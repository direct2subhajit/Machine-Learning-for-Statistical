The source of the entire litany will be an amplifying box on a display pole adjacent to the electronic cash register. **********No, the grocery chain has not trained its checkout personnel to be ventriloquists. It has chosen the Stratford store to test the region's first talking scanner. A device known as a speech synthesizer will give a verbal accounting of all readings made by the electronic scanner from the printed computer code on each package or container as it is recorded and passes through the checkout. **********Grand Union said it was aiming to reduce consumer confusion and concern over the speedy operation of the scanner. If the speech synthesizing device, dubbed the ''Positalker,'' can accomplish that on nine checkout lanes during the next six months, the 856-store supermarket chain will install more of them, although officials would not estimate how many or how quickly. 'Humanizing' Touch **********Henry T. Johnson, Grand Union's vice president for corporate marketing, said that the scanning cash register systems ''are far more accurate than traditional checkout systems.'' But he said that the speed of the checkout system was creating some uneasiness among shoppers. The voice synthesizer will ''humanize the process,'' he said, and also give the consumer a check on the accuracy of the prices recorded. **********The speaker will recite only the pricing information, not the names of the items, since that would slow the checkout process, according to a spokesman for National Semiconductor Corporation. The Santa Clara, Calif., computer maker supplies both the ''Datachecker'' scanning system being used by Grand Union and the speech synthesizer. **********Items are listed on a lighted digital display near the cash register and are printed on the register tape. The Grand Union spokesman said that since the ''Positalker'' is an attachment to the existing checkout system, the cost is just $3,000 for the nine units, compared with the approximate $135,000 cost for a single electronic cash register and its central processor. Translates Scanner Code **********The speaking device is an electronically triggered mechanism that matches the proper verbal response to the digital codes being read and translated by the scanner. Scanners ''read'' the computer printed code on packages as the items pass over the optical scanner of the checkout and record the name of the item and its price on the electronic cash register or point-of-sale system. **********The National Semiconductor speech synthesizer is already in use in eight supermarkets west of the Mississippi. These include the King's Supermarket and Safeway in Denver; Kroger, H.E. Butt and Safeway in Houston; Bashe's in Phoenix, and Albertson's in San Jose, Calif. **********In the original installations, the voice synthesizer first used a male voice. But, according to National Semiconductor's spokesman, shoppers insisted that the man's delivery was too much of a monotone and that a woman's voice would be ''softer.'' Besides, the spokesman added, ''Since most supermarket checkout operators are women, shoppers felt that the voice talking to them should be feminine, too.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/26/business/interest-rates-surge-over-doubts-on-budget.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1981-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 793, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTEREST RATES SURGE OVER DOUBTS ON BUDGET", "print_headline": "INTEREST RATES SURGE OVER DOUBTS ON BUDGET", "body_text": " **********Interest rates rose sharply yesterday as the credit markets concluded that President Reagan's budget proposals would not be enough to prevent upward pressure on interest rates in the future. **********In yesterday's trading, the most tumultuous activity was in the long-term bond market, where prices dropped by more than two points and yields rose to record levels. The bellwether 13 7/8 percent Treasury bonds due 2011, for example, fell 2 5/8 points, or $26.50 per $1,000 bond, to 92 1/4, where the yield to maturity is 15.05 percent. **********Interest rates also rose in the short-term markets, partly because of signs that the recent decline in short-term rates had run its course. By late in the day, six-month Treasury bills were bid at 14.7 percent, up from 14.36 percent earlier in the day. **********On the heels of the steep price declines, the Federal Reserve reported that a key measure of the money supply expanded by $1 billion last week, in line with expectations. **********Although discussion about large Federal budget deficits and the resulting Treasury borrowing requirements has dominated the credit markets in recent weeks, many analysts said that the latest upturn in rates was caused by more than just the volume of future Treasury issues. They explained that the Fed's determination to keep money supply growth under control meant that short-term interest rates would remain high and could increase. **********Yesterday, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul A.  Volcker, reminded the markets of the Fed's intentions to combat inflation through the money supply. In a speech at t he National PressClub in Washington, D.C., Mr. Volcker said th at progress had been made in the last two years, and predicted tha t inflation would decline slightly next year, to less than a 10 percent growth rate. **********Despite the lower inflation outlook, traders were worried that the Fed would again be forced to curb money supply growth by making credit scarcer in the banking system and thereby encourage higher rates. **********''The financial markets are coming to realize that interest rates are going to remain high for a considerably longer period than they thought,'' said H. James Toffey, managing director of the taxable fixed-income department at the First Boston Corporation. **********''Investors are asking,'' Mr. Toffey added, ''how do I justify buying stocks or bonds if I can earn 16 percent in the money market for the foreseeable future?'' If short-term rates are not expected to decline substantially, then investors are loath to buy a longer-term issue that offers a lower yield and greater price risk than a shortterm investment due in six months or less. **********Late yesterday, the Fed announced that the closely watched M-1B measure of the nation's money supply reached $433.7 billion in the week ended Sept. 16, registering a $1 billion increase. M-1B, which consists of c urrency in circulation and all types of checking accounts, is still several billion dollars below the Fed's target forthis year, al though it is up $1.9 billion in the last two weeks. **********Increases in the money supply are inevitable following the Fed's practice in recent months of increasing the supply of credit in the banking system, analysts said. Yesterday, however, there was at least one sign that the Fed was not willing to continue to supply increasing amounts of money to the system. Over the last 13 weeks, nonborrowed reserves in the banking system have grown at a 22 percent annual rate, but some experts say that growth cannot continue without causing an inflationary increase in money supply. Fed Drains Reserves **********A recent sign that the Fed was not continuing to make credit still more plentiful was yesterday's action to temporarily drain credit from the banking system by arranging temporary sales of securities.That action came when overnight loans among banks in the Federal funds market were extended at about 14 percent, well below the 15.37 percent average for the week ended Sept. 23. **********While many investors are deserting the long bond market, yields in that sector have climbed even though inflation has dropped slightly over the past year. For example, 30-year Treasury bond yields were just over 12 percent when President Reagan took office in January, rose to 13.2 percent by midyear and now are above 15 percent. **********Securities dealers agreed that investor demand for issues due in more than two years was weak, despite a chorus of economists and salesmen who say that bonds are an attractive investment. As prices were plunging yesterday, one dealer said: ''The lack of buyers is the main factor. The President's program for more budget cuts was not encouraging, but it did not make things worse.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/12/world/reagan-in-ottawa-pledges-amity-differences-on-el-salvador-remain.html": {"writer_name": "Howell Raines", "pub_date": "1981-03-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 897, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DIFFERENCES ON EL SALVADOR REMAIN", "print_headline": "REAGAN, IN OTTAWA, PLEDGES AMITY; DIFFERENCES ON EL SALVADOR REMAIN", "body_text": " **********President Reagan addressed the Canadian Parliament today with a speech full of pledges of friendship but devoid of concessions for settling the disputes over American military aid to El Salvador and such issues as fishing rights and pollution. **********The speech, in that respect, matched the tone and outcome of private meetings among Mr. Reagan, Prime Minister Pierre Eliott Trudeau and their chief advisers. No communique was issued at the end of the 27-hour visit, Mr. Reagan's first foreign trip as President. **********Participants said that the private meetings produced agreement on broad policy goals - the pursuit of a political rather than a military solution in El Salvador, for example. But the meetings ended with the Canadian Minister for External Affairs, Mark MacGuigan, opposing the United States decision to send arms and military instructors to the Central American nation, while Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. insisted that the United States would stick to its plans. **********Mr. MacGuigan did say that there was ''broad common ground'' on the goal of self-determination for El Salvador and that Canada was satisfied with the Reagan Administration's promise to work in good faith to settle fishing rights and boundary disputes, complete the Alaska natural gas pipeline, in which Canada has invested heavily, and resolve cross-b@order conflicts over environmental quality. Haig Calls Meetings a Success **********Mr. Haig, joining Mr. MacGuigan at a news conference, said the meetings were a success because they set up a ''substantive framework'' for future discussions. Solutions to ''vexing interest issues'' must come later, he said. When reporters pressed for details on the El Salvador impasse, Mr. Haig complained, ''You're doing your best to get a row started, aren't you?'' **********In their speeches to Parliament this morning, Mr. Reagan and Mr.  Trudeau struck this same balance between cordial agreement on goals, and stout defense, in careful diplomatic language, of their separate national intersts. **********Mr. Reagan used his appearance before a joint session of the Canadian Senate and the House of Commons to describe his ''nearrevolutionary steps'' aimed at restoring conservative economic policies in the United States, and to ask for Canada's support for a policy of stern anti-Communism. ''Across the oceans, we stand together against the unacceptable Soviet invasion into Afghanistan and against continued Soviet adventurism across the earth,'' he said. **********Mr. Trudeau, in a soft, almost whispery voice, suggested that Mr.  Reagan belonged to an American tradition of hostility to government interference. ''But here in Canada,'' he said, ''our own realities have sometimes made it necessary for governments to further enterprise. Those realities and that necessity are still with us today.'' **********Then, warning against an impulse to ''oversimplify'' world issues, he urged on Mr. Reagan a policy of patience toward the Soviet Union.  Mr. Trudeau said that in the Polish crisis, the Russians, given time, ''may accommodate themselves at least to the dynamics of their own region.'' **********This contrast between the liberal and conservative philosophies was not lost on the Canadian legislators convened in Commons, a vaulted hall decorated with fluted columns, panels of carved stone and intricate stained-glass windows. The Progressive Conservative Party members applauded vigorously and shouted ''hear, hear!'' as Mr.  Reagan described his budget-balancing techniques. But members of Mr.  Trudeau's Liberal Party sat silently or slowly yielded up a few perfunctory hand claps. Reagan Stumbles During Speech **********At one point Mr. Reagan stumbled so badly in his speech that some journalists said later that they feared that he might be suffering a physical attack. But aides said that Mr. Reagan was simply confused by his own interlinear notes, written in small handwriting in the text of his speech, and that his subsequent omission of a reference to the fishing treaty to divide the catch on the Georges Bank was inadvertent. **********Mr. Trudeau, in remarks to reporters after the speeches, expressed regret that the Administration had abruptly withdrawn that treaty from consideration by the United States Senate. The Reagan move surprised the Trudeau Government and contributed to the substantial turnout of hostile demonstrators who greeted the President yesterday. **********Mr. Trudeau said Canada still insisted that the fishing treaty be linked irrevocably to a boundary treaty involving the Canadian-American demarcation line in the Gulf of Maine. ''We view the United States gesture of withdrawing the treaty as an indication of their determination to solve the problem in other ways'' short of a ''fish war,'' Mr. Trudeau said as Mr. Reagan listened. **********''The other area, of course, of great concern to Canada was crossboundary pollution,'' Mr. Trudeau added, citing the problems of acid rain and pollution in the Great Lakes and other bodies of water. On these points, he said, Mr. Reagan gave him ''assurances that the United States has the will and the determination to cooperate with us in preserving the environment for ourselves and for posterity.'' **********Two matters of substance, settled by subordinates before Mr. Reagan and Mr. Trudeau met here, were completed today. Mr. Haig and Mr.  MacGuignan signed a renewal for five years of the North American Air Defense Command, a joint air warning and defense system. An agreement giving people who work in both nations uniform coverage under Social Security and its Canadian counterpart was approved, too."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/20/business/ryder-unit-orders-gm-vehicles.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ryder Unit Orders G.M.

It is now ranked 15th in the Fortune 500 list. **********''This is so much bigger than anything that has every happened before in mergers,'' said Robert Powers, chairman of Smith Barney Inc., an investment bank. ''With all the lines of credit now being established by other oil companies, this could well be the start of a new wave of mergers and acquisitons in the energy field.'' **********Began Buying Shares **********E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company was able to claim victory in its multibillion-dollar bidding war with the Mobil Corporation and Joseph E. Seagram & Sons for control of Conoco after it began early yesterday to buy the 55 percent of Conoco stock attracted by its tender offer. The purchases started shortly after the passing of a midnight Tuesday deadline that Du Pont had set. Until that hour, the thousands of Conoco shareholders who had submitted their stock to Du Pont for purchase at $98 a share had the right to retrieve their shares in favor of a better offer from Seagram or Mobil. **********In addition, Du Pont was able to begin buying the tendered stock because the Justice Department, in the best indication yet that the Reagan Administration does not oppose mergers that create huge corporations, said late Tuesday that the merger would not violate antitrust laws. **********Du Pont agreed to begin paying $98 in cash for up to 38.7 million of Conoco's 86 million outstanding shares and to exchange 1.7 Du Pont shares, a unit worth $80 at the close of yesterday's trading, for each share of all the remaining Conoco stock. At 3:45 A.M., Du Pont began sending payments for the 37.9 million shares that had actually been tendered for cash, while key executives toasted the occasion in a champagne celebration at an elegant Wilmington hotel near company headquarters. An additional 9.4 million Conoco shares that were tendered for the stock portion of the offer will be exchanged on Aug.17 for Du Pont shares. Three-Month Marathon **********For Conoco, the day's events marked the end of a bizarre threemonth marathon that saw three of the nation's biggest corporations deploy an army of lawyers and investment bankers in a battle for its undervalued oil, natural gas and coal assets. It now becomes part of the world's largest chemical company.  The two companies had combined sales last year of $32 billion. **********Conoco had endorsed the Du Pont offer and had opposed the Mobil and Seagram bids. Both the chairman of Du Pont, Edward Jefferson, and Conoco's chairman, Ralph E. Bailey, expressed ''delight'' yesterday that the merger was being consummated. **********''Chemical companies in recent years have been increasingly worried about oil companies using their oil reserves to develop into the petrochemical business,'' said Paul Christopherson, who follows Du Pont for Kidder, Peabody. ''Du Pont will be the one chemical company in the whole world that has put all those concerns behind it.'' The vast majority of chemicals produced by Du Pont have hydrocarbons as their raw material. Advantage to Du Pont **********Mr. Christopherson said Du Pont's merger with Conoco should also remove some of the volatility in the chemical company's earnings, which have tended to rise and fall in line with the swings in prices of hydrocarbons and other raw materials. In 1980, Du Pont earned $716 million on revenues of $13.6 billion. Conoco earned $1.02 billion last year on revenues of $18.71 billion. **********Du Pont stock closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $47.125, up $1.50, bringing the total value of its offer for Conoco to $7.57 billion. The largest previous corporate takeover in history was the Shell Oil Company's acquisition of the Belridge Oil Company in 1979 for $3.65 billion. Conoco closed at $91.875, down 38.5 cents, almost double the price at which it had traded in May when other corporations, attracted by its low stock price, began bidding for the company. Analysts have estimated Conoco's breakup value at $100 to $150 a share. **********Conoco first appeared susceptible for acquisition after Canada's Dome Petroleum Ltd. successfully acquired Conoco's controlling interest in the Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Company last May. In the process, Dome called for Conoco shareholders to tender their stock and they did so in overwhelming numbers. Seagram Started Chain **********Seagram started the competition for the remainder of Conoco's assets on June 25 with a $73-a-share offer for 41 percent of Conoco's shares. It was quickly joined by Du Pont and Mobil, the nation's No.2 oil company, in a dizzying round of bids that made millions for arbitragers and investment housesand tidy profits even for individual stockholders with just a few shares. In May, before the bidding started, Conoco stock was being traded at $50 a share, just over half its current value. **********While neither Mobil nor Seagram, the Canadian liquor company controlled by the Bronfman family, publicly conceded defeat, insiders at both corporations indicated that the fight for Conoco was over. **********Yesterday afternoon Seagram extended its deadline for purchasing Conoco stock, from midnight yesterday to midnight Friday, on the basis of its own final tender offer of $92 a share for 51 percent of the stock. Analysts said Seagram's stake in the new Du Pont-Conoco company could go as high as 20 percent, which would make it the second-largest shareholder after the duPont family and their trusts, which control about 22 percent. Payments Ordered **********With Du Pont the clear winner, Mobil, which had offered to pay $120 a share for almost half of Conoco's stock, announced that it had instructed its depository, the First National Bank of Chicago, to return the roughly 2.2 million Conoco shares attracted by its tender offer. This will enable stockholders to tender the shares either to Seagram or Du Pont. The value of Mobil's bid, worth $8.8 billion in cash and securities, exceeded the successful Du Pont offer, but the Justice Department declined to give Mobil immediate antitrust clearance, apparently making stockholders unwilling to tender to Mobil. **********Mobil said it would tender to Seagram the 735,800 Conoco shares that it had purchased between July 1 and 3, before its takeover offer. Payments by Seagram **********Seagram began executing payments in its tender offer for Conoco stock on Aug.2, paying $92 a share. By last weekend, Seagram had purchased 15.5 million Conoco shares, or 18 percent. **********Mr. Christopherson, of Kidder, Peabody, said Seagram's $92 offer may have attracted as many as 5 million to 10 million additional Conoco shares since last weekend. **********Du Pont has issued 80 million new shares to pay the stock portion of its Conoco purchase, which means it will now have a total of 236 million shares. If Seagram were to obtain 20 million Conoco shares, that would translate into 34 million Du Pont shares, or 14 percent of the company. If it received 25 million shares, the Bronfman family, which controls Seagram, would control 18 percent of Du Pont's stock.  Mr. Christopherson said the duPont family and trusts combined will control only about 22 percent of Du Pont after Conoco is absorbed and their holdings are diluted. **********Analysts have speculated that Seagram may try to trade its shares and cash for a Conoco subsidiary, the Consolidation Coal Company. The coal company, the nation's second largest, is of little use to Du Pont and its sale could be used to cover the $3.8 billion which Du Pont had to borrow to help pay for the Conoco purchase."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/16/business/prospects.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 193, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROSPECTS", "print_headline": "PROSPECTS", "body_text": " **********Good News on Grain **********Recent estimates about the record size of this year's grain crop, which agriculture specialists once feared would be meager, are apt to be a boon to consumers, exporters and livestock farmers well into 1982. **********Assuming little damage is done at harvest time, the size of the wheat and corn crops, currently estimated at 2.8 billion and 7.7 billion bushels respectively, should soften grain prices and ease food price inflation next year. **********Jason Benderly, an economist at Bache & Company, expects food prices to rise between 5 and 7 percent, compared with an 8 percent annual increase in 1981. **********Exports to the Soviet Union, which has not had a good harvest, are likely to be far above the 6 million metric tons currently on the books, perhaps as high as 18 million tons. **********Among farmers, the record crop seems likely to benefit livestock breeders most, and farmers in the Southeast, experiencing their third drought in four years, the least.

Crocker, the Assistant Secretary of State-designate for African Affairs, would visit the so-called front-line states of Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, as well as South Africa. **********A purpose of the mission, officials said, is to open a constructive dialogue with South Africa on ways to bring about change in that country, while reassuring the black African leaders of the Administration's interest in finding an internationally acceptable formula for ending South Africa's control of South-West Africa, also known as Namibia. U.S. Seeks Support in Africa **********Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., who met yesterday with the External Affairs Minister of Nigeria, Ishaya Audu, and held a reception for African ambassadors last night, has been concerned about speculation in many parts of the world that the Reagan Administration would drastically revise American policy toward Africa, with a bias toward South Africa. **********Mr. Haig is said to hope that the Crocker mission will produce more support in Africa for American policy and provide a catalyst for reviving the Namibian talks, which have been stalemated since January. **********The details of the policy review will not be made public at this time, officials said, so that Mr. Crocker can discuss American ideas with the African leaders in confidence. **********Mr. Audu said yesterday that he was ''personally optimistic'' about the American policy. As to Namibia, he said, ''I'm convinced that the United States has very positive plans of furthering this in the direction that we all would like to see.'' **********Nigeria is crucial because it is the most populous African country and because its oil wealth has become a major political force on behalf of bringing about a solution in Namibia. **********One element of the policy review became known last week when the Reagan Administration pledged $75 million in economic aid to Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, for each of the next three years, for a total of $225 million. **********In another gesture to the Africans, the State Department announced that the Administration had reaffirmed the policy of forbidding highranking South African military officers from coming to the United States for talks with American officials and prohibiting American officers from traveling to South Africa. **********Earlier this month, four high-ranking South African military intelligence officers visited the United States on visas that the State Department said had been obtained improperly. It said that the officers had not been identified on the visa applications as military men. While in the United States some of them met with officials of the National Security Council and the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency. **********In addition, one of them met with Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, but she contended that she also did not know ahead of time that he was a military officer. Bush to Attend Refugee Conference **********As another sign of American interest in Africa, Vice President Bush will attend an international conference in Geneva on April 9 and 10 that will be devoted to the problem of African refugees. **********Acknowledging the speculation about American policy toward Africa, Mr. Haig said last Thursday before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, ''I understand that there are a lot of nervous messages, if you will, on the airwaves, with respect to future American policies in southern Africa.'' **********Mr. Haig, in his statements on Africa to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, said: ''Let me assure you, we are sensitive to a number of inherent contradictions in the area. One is the need to maintain an effective dialogue with the Government of South Africa as we pursue the changes that we have historically sought there that are desirable. Namibian Independence Urged **********''Secondly, is to recognize that the so-called front-line states have a vital interest in the outcome of the situation, especially Namibia. We have already endorsed an independent Namibia which would receive the support and approval of the international community.'' **********Mr. Haig said that he had been discussing the Namibia situation with the four Western nations that, with the United States, had taken the lead in seeking to promote a negotiated settlement since 1977.  They are Britain, Canada, France and West Germany. **********''We'll soon initiate a program that the President has already considered at some length,'' he said, alluding to the projected Crocker mission. **********Mr. Haig also said that it would be wrong to label African countries that receive Soviet military aid ''Marxist'' even if they may call themselves that. Africa and Soviet Aid **********He said, ''An increasing number of black African states that have become the recipients of Soviet military equipment and increased levels of Soviet influence are having second thoughts about the desirability of that kind of relationship which is essentially inorganic.'' **********''It is built almost exclusively on the provision of lethal weapons,'' the Secretary said. ''It does not include the kind of developmental assistance that turns developing states into modern states.'' **********''Many are very free about labeling these recipient states as Marxist,'' he said. ''Some have suggested they will be Marxists or democrats, depending on their assessment of which label will bring them the progress for their people that they seek. And I'm one that shares that view.'' **********In addition to the unresolved Namibia question, the Crocker mission is expected to discuss such questions as future relations with Angola. Washington has refused to establish diplomatic relations with Angola because of the continued presence of about 20,000 Cuban troops. Issue of Aid to Angolan Guerrillas **********The Angolans have said in the past that the Cubans would leave once there was a Namibian solution, ending the threat of South African military intervention. An issue that has received considerable attention is that of future American aid to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, a pro-Western guerrilla organization known by its initials as Unita and headed by Jonas Savimbi. Mr. Savimbi had been scheduled to visit Washington, but the State Department said that the trip had been postponed indefinitely at his request. **********The Reagan Administration is planning to ask Congress to lift the law barring aid to groups such as Unita, but that legislation is unlikely to be acted upon before the end of the summer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/21/world/israel-tightens-emigre-policy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 214, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAEL TIGHTENS EMIGRE POLICY", "print_headline": "ISRAEL TIGHTENS EMIGRE POLICY", "body_text": " **********Israel has moved to make it more difficult for Jewish emigrants arriving in Vienna from the Soviet Union to go anywhere else but Israel. **********Nearly 85 percent of the emigrants reaching Vienna with visas for Israel have gone elsewhere in recent months. **********Of these, 90 percent went to the United States as refugees. **********The Jewish Agency for Israel, which handles immigration to Israel, this week began giving assistance to emigrants to go elsewhere than Israel only if their motives are to join parents, children or spouses.

Few funds concentrated on a specific industry, and some of their investors became unhappy when the chosen group fell out of favor. The problem has grown as market leadership has shifted more frequently in recent years. **********Now the Fidelity Management and Research Company is offering a new vehicle called Fidelity Select Portfolios, which is intended to appeal to individuals interested in four specific growth sectors: precious metals, energy, technology and health care. **********Investors in the fund who favor one or more of these groups will be allowed to shift from one to another as many as four times a year without charge. Any additional changes in the same year will cost $50 each. **********Peter Lynch, who is a vice president of Fidelity Management and Research, the $11 billion Boston-based money management concern, observes that some segments of the stock market have enjoyed ''startling'' performance for extended periods while the market as a whole has done less well. In the last 15 years, he noted, the market has been relatively even as measured by both the Dow Jones industrial average and the broadly based Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks. **********In recent months the health care sector has been strong and the technology category has been somewhat less so, while the energy and precious metals groups have been weak. **********Mr. Lynch said that any investor buying shares of the new fund could pick a group in hopes of market appreciation and then let professionals analyze and choose securities within the group. **********''Thus, the investor makes the strategic decision, and Fidelity carries out the tactics,'' he said. ''More-over, the fund pays commissions at the institutional rate, which can be 75 percent lower than the individual would pay - 10 cents a share or even less.'' The fund is a no-load vehicle, so investors obtain fund shares at their net asset value without having to pay extra for a sales commission. **********In addition to the right to shift from group to group, the investor has the option of moving into a special account for Fidelity Cash Reserves, one of the company's money market funds. Thus the investor can strike a defensive position during periods of an uncertain stock market. **********Mr. Lynch said Fidelity might create more sectors for the fund (in addition to the present four) if other industries begin to look promising. Each of the four portfolios, he added, is managed by a specialist who works full-time in that segment of the market.  Apparently no similar funds are in registration at this time.  Fidelity is so sure that the flexibility offered by the new fund will appeal to investors, however, that it expects competitors to offer similar funds in the future. **********Fidelity Select Portfolios opened for investment last Tuesday.  Applications are made by mail or telephone to the headquarters of the company, so the new fund has taken in little money so far. **********The minimum initial investment is $5,000. If an investor wants to participate in more than one portfolio, $5,000 is required for each.  Subsequent purchases are available in $250 minimums - $1,000 if made by telephone. Mr. Lynch said all normal mutual fund services would be available, including reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. **********Mr. Lynch cautioned that the new fund would offer ''absolutely no guidance as to which section of the market covered by the various sectors of the fund is thought to be most attractive at a given moment in time.'' **********It remains to be seen, of course, whether the market performance of any of the four chosen groups will be better than that of other groups. It also remains to be seen whether Fidelity's money managers will do better than the average within each chosen sector. **********Technically speaking, the new vehicle is known as a ''series'' fund. It is the latest of several mutual funds that offer an investor a choice among specialized portfolios. **********For example, Vanguard's no-load Warwick Fund offers three separate portfolios of tax-exempt securities. In that fund the categories are set apart by maturity, with short-, medium-and long-term portfolios offered. Other tax-exempt series funds offer a choice on the basis of maturity or quality of bonds."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/12/business/patents-fleischmann-award.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1981-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; Fleischmann Award", "print_headline": "Patents; Fleischmann Award", "body_text": " **********Isaac Fleischmann, who retired this week as director of information services after serving the Patent and Trademark Office for 35 years, was presented by the Department of Commerce with a new public affairs award at a reception in his honor.

No More Compromise **********Poland's Deputy Prime Minister, Mieczyslaw Rakowski, said in a speech that the party had exhausted its capacity for compromise in dealing with Solidarity, the independent trade union organization.  Mr. Rakowski will meet Solidarity negotiators tomorrow. **********He said that the patience of the authorities and of Poland's Eastern bloc neighbors was running thin, and he declared that the very existence of the country was at stake. **********Such language has not been heard here for several months, and it was one more sign that the crisis is heating up again, at a time of a widening rift between the party leaderships in Warsaw and Moscow. Protests and Hunger Strikes **********In the last week, there were protests against prison conditions, hunger strikes to support the release of political prionsers and a vote by Solidarity to stage a two-hour warning strike this week. **********There were also events that did not make the headlines but that indicated a new and possibly dangerous direction of popular discontent. For the second time, a monument to commemorate the deaths of Soviet soldiers in World War II was desecrated, this time in the town of Rybnik. A five-pointed star was ripped off and an inscription was painted over on a monument in a cemetary containing the ashes of more than 1,800 Red Army soldiers. **********In the western city of Poznan, the Soviet Consul General died under mysterious circumstances after shots were fired inside the consulate Tuesday night. Various stories made the rounds - that he was killed when a hunting gun he was cleaning accidentally discharged, or that there had been an altercation with an employee. **********In the absence of any reliable information - the Soviet Embassy has refused comment - there is no reason to read a political motive behind the act. Still, rumors and apparently even anonymous leaflets have circulated that the Consul, Rudolf Skvortsov, was assassinated. **********Solidarity, meeting without its chairman, Lech Walesa, who was in Geneva to attend an international labor organization conference, voted to go ahead with a two-hour protest strike in four northern provinces on Thursday. **********The protest is intended to make the authorities honor a pledge to investigate and reveal the names of officials responsible for calling in the police who beat up Solidarity members while evicting them from a local council meeting in Bydgoszcz on March 19. Church Opposes Strikes **********The strike vote, 22 to 13, was taken despite the pleadings of Bishop Jan Michalski, who addressed the delegates in person and said he was speaking in the name of the late Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski. He told them that the Roman Catholic Church firmly opposed further strikes and that the delegates carried the fate of the nation in their hands. **********Solidarity and Government negotiators are scheduled to meet tomorrow to try to resolve the issue. Both sides have expressed confidence that they can settle it without a strike, and this may well be the case. But the fact that a strike vote was taken seemed to point to a resurgence of militancy on the part of local Solidarity leaders. Suspension Period Due to End **********On April 10, Prime Minister Wojciech Jaruzelski won a resolution in Parliament that called for a two-month suspension of strikes. The suspension period ends on Wednesday. **********Many union leaders appear to feel that the Government has not accomplished much during its grace period. None of the longstanding list of union demands, ranging from a curb on censorship to the promulgation of a new trade union law, have been satisfactorily concluded, although some progress has been made. **********The police in Bydgoszcz sent an open letter yesterday to a party conference in that city in which they disclaimed responsibility for the incident last March, in which three Solidarity members were seriously injured. They warned that they did not want to become political scapegoats. **********''We consider that the sources of the events of March 19 lie beyond the leadership of the Bydgoszcz civic militia,'' the letter said, as quoted by Warsaw radio. ''The right people must be brought to account, and not functionaries who are just carrying out their duties. We demand that the political and administrative authorities do not treat our organs as an instrument for their own exclusive purposes.'' **********People close to the investigation have privately said that the police used to evict the Solidarity members were brought in from other localities. Some Police Are Organizing **********As a further sign of restiveness, the police have recently begun to organize their own independent union in various parts of the country, although this is not being done under Solidarity's auspices. **********The tensions are rising at a time when the Soviet and Eastern bloc press in general is stepping up a campaign against the Polish party leadership, which in a rare move called a congress for July 14. The Soviet press has implicitly supported a small, hard-line faction in southern Poland called the Katowice Discussion Forum. **********Last week Tass, the official Soviet press agency, carried a dispatch from Warsaw that described how a Solidarity leader in the southern town of Zawiercie had threatened violence against the Communist authorities if they did not remove a Soviet flag from a local council building and change street names associated with the Soviet Union. **********The union man, Bohdan Krakowski, told Western journalists that he had been misquoted. He said he had asked only that the Polish flag be allowed to fly alongside the Soviet flag ''so that everyone might know that we are living in a Polish city, not a Soviet city.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/28/business/crane-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-march-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CRANE CO reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "print_headline": "CRANE CO reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/world/around-the-world-canada-televises-funeral-of-young-cancer-victim.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 166, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; CANADA TELEVISES FUNERAL OF YOUNG CANCER VICTIM", "print_headline": "Around the World; CANADA TELEVISES FUNERAL OF YOUNG CANCER VICTIM", "body_text": " **********The funeral service of Terry Fox, a 22-year-old college student who died Sunday of cancer, was televised nationally today as part of an extraordinary tribute to Canada's greatest national hero in memory.

That was a welcome slowdown from the pace of more than 10 percent in the summer months and economists said they expected the index to continue to show small rises for several more months. **********A decline last month of seven-tenths of 1 percent in the sale price of houses was symptomatic of the way many economists hope that the current recession as well as high interest rates -which have been savaging the housing market - will squeeze down inflation. **********'Not Seen Since the 1930's **********''We have a deflation in prices of homes of a magnitude we have not seen since the 1930's,'' said Michael Sumichrast, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, the housing industry's major trade group. **********''This sagging economy is having a favorable effect on the inflation rate,'' added Robert Ortner, the Commerce Department's chief economist. **********The slight October rise in the price index meant that, since Jan.  1, the index has risen at an annual rate of 9.6 percent. With moderate increases expected for November and December, it appeared likely that the Administration would realize its forecast of a 1981 rise below 10 percent in the nation's most widely followed measure of inflation at the retail level. Summarized by White House **********Murray L. Weidenbaum, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told President Reagan in a memorandum summarized by the White House that he hoped the October index would contribute to further declines of interest rates, which started to fall last month from the unusually high summer levels. **********Home loan interest rates, which have been on an upward path for two years or more, edged down in October by one-tenth of 1 percent, thus contributing to the more moderate performance of the price index. All of the slight easing came from Federal agency reductions in maximum interest rates on federally underwritten home loans. **********Analysts believe that conventional loan rates have started to come down in recent weeks and will continue to do so gradually through the winter. **********Such a trend would offset increases in other components of the Consumer Price Index, just as the upswing of mortgage rates was seen as exaggerating inflation. **********Theodore Torda, a senior Commerce Department economist, commented that the October index was ''an aberration on the low side'' because the ''underlying inflation rate, we think, is still in the range of 8 to 9 percent.'' **********Other analysts said that small rises in the index would help moderate wage increases and so contribute to an easing of cost-price pressures. Wage increases in a number of union contracts are tied to increases in the price index. **********By comparison, the index had risen 1.2 percent in September, or at an annual rate of 14.4 percent, not compounded. Rising food and housing costs had contributed to the September jump, before the growing recession changed this trend in October. New Experimental Variation **********The October rise of four-tenths of 1 percent, calculated after adjustment for normal seasonal changes, was appreciably below the adjusted rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent that would have occurred in October under a new experimental variation of the index, known as C.P.I. X-1. The housing component in this index uses an estimate for rents instead of home purchase costs. The difference in the two indexes reflected the considerable effect on the current index exerted by changes of house prices and mortgage interest rates. **********The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the price index, announced on Oct. 27 that, starting with January 1983, it would use rental data instead of home purchase costs in calculating the Consumer Price Index. **********Many analysts have said that, in periods of rising prices and loan rates, such as 1978-81, the house purchase factor distorted the index, if only because few consumers buy a house every month or even every year. Officials of the Carter and Reagan Administrations, however, resisted substituting rents for home ownership costs partly on the ground that declining house prices and interest rates would slow the overall rise of the index. Exactly that happened in October and is expected to be repeated. Below Two Million Mark **********The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the decline in house prices was concentrated in the Northeast and North Central states.  The National Association of Realtors reported that, because of high mortgage interest rates, sales of existing houses in October fell to an annual rate of 1.92 million, slipping below the two million mark for the first time in 10 years. **********Sales have dropped 39 percent in a year, said the association's chief economist, Jack Carlson. He added that the typical price of an existing house fell by $1,900 in October, to $65,200, a decline that was roughly double what usually occurs in October, often an off-month for home sales. **********Mr. Carlson forecast that further declines of house prices and mortgage loan rates would exert a moderating effect on the price index over the next few months. He forecast that mortgage loan rates would slide from more than 17 percent now to ''14 or 15 percent by spring.'' **********The Bureau of Labor Statistics delayed publication of a companion monthly report on nonfarm earnings until Wednesday because of the partial shutdown of the Government on Monday. 'Rebasing' of Index Postponed **********The bureau also announced that it had postponed indefinitely, because of cuts in its budget, its scheduled January 1982 ''rebasing'' of the price index. The index's base, now 1967 prices taken as 100, was to be shifted to 1977. That change would not affect the size of monthly changes in the index. **********Prices of food and beverages rose by two-tenths of 1 percent last month, well below their July-September pace of eight-tenths of 1 percent a month. Prices of fresh fruits and vegetables fell. Beef slipped after large summer increases. Pork rose less than in the summer. Restaurant meals were up seven-tenths of 1 percent. **********The transportation component of the index jumped 1.2 percent because of the fifth consecutive increase in the prices of used cars and a 1.2 percent rise, after seasonal adjustment, in gasoline prices. Also higher were automobile finance charges, which had been reduced in August and September to promote sales. Medical Costs Up 1 Percent **********Medical care costs climbed 1 percent last month, the 10th consecutive month of increases of nine-tenths of 1 percent or more.  Charges for hospital rooms had another large increase, rising 1.6 percent. Profesional fees rose seven-tenths of 1 percent. Drugs and medical supplies increased eight-tenths of 1 percent. **********Within the housing component, prices for heating oil and electricity declined but prices rose again for natural gas. Rent and household furnishings were higher. **********On the 1967 base of 100, the October index stood at 279.9 - goods and services that cost $100 in 1967 cost $279.90 last month."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/17/world/man-in-the-news-cool-hostage-negotiator.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 883, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COOL HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR", "print_headline": "MAN IN THE NEWS; COOL HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR", "body_text": " **********Deputy Secretary of State Warren M.  Christopher has seldom enjoyed the limelight, preferring instead to work hard and discreetly backstage, so it probably suited him fine this afternoon to be absent from the White House when President Carter named him one of 15 recipients of the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. **********But even though Mr. Christopher was 4,000 miles away in Algeria, trying to negotiate the freedom of the American hostages in Iran before time runs out on the Carter Administration, Mr. Carter got the slim, taciturn Californian on the phone from the East Room to praise him for service to country. **********''Warren Christopher,'' Mr. Carter said, reading the official proclamation honoring the 55-year-old No. 2 State Department official, ''has the tact of a true diplomat, the tactical skills of a great soldier, the analytical ability of a fine lawyer and the selfless dedication of a citizen-statesman. His perseverance and loyalty, judgment and skill have won for his country new respect around the world and new regard for the State Department here at home.'' **********The description contained most of the adjectives and superlatives heard around this hypercritical capital when Mr. Christopher's name is mentioned. But then the President went further. Departing from his text, he rated Mr. Christopher the ''highest'' of all Administration officials in Washington. Most Sensitive Problems **********As the top aide to Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance and then to Edmund S. Muskie, Mr. Christopher has handled some of the most sensitive diplomatic problems faced by the Administration. **********He helped smooth the way for passage of the much-disputed Panama Canal treaties, helped win approval of shipments of high-technology arms to Arab nations and went to Taiwan to reassure the Nationalist Chinese when the United States and China moved to strengthen ties.  In Taipei demonstrators broke a window in his limousine and he suffered cuts and bruises. **********When Soviet troops moved into Afghanistan, Mr. Christopher was sent to Europe for talks with allied governments about imposing sanctions. For several months he has concentrated almost exclusively on efforts to free the hostages in Iran, shuttling back and forth between Washington and Algiers, the meeting point for intermediaries, often going for long stretches without rest but always emerging from the work sessions with the unrumpled demeanor of a diplomat. Strong at Negotiations **********Mr. Christopher's greatest strength is said to be his ability to negotiate. Unfailingly courteous and soft-spoken, cool and collected, organized and prepared, he is said to have a knack for winning concessions without making his adversary feel boxed in.  ''Never get mad except on purpose,'' he tells aides. **********While negotiations are under way and especially when they are over, Mr. Christopher avoids reporters. In a town where egos usually intrude, he sometimes seems to have none. **********A longtime friend says that the Deputy Secretary's lack of ego and his great caution are the main reasons he has never held a Cabinetlevel post in three decades of being in and out of Washington. ''This is a town of games and risks and politics and Chris just doesn't play that way,'' the friend added. ''He was trained as a lawyer and he's a lawyer's lawyer. But if you don't play in Washington, you're always going to be No. 2.'' Mechanic, Not Philosopher **********Others say Mr. Christopher has never been given a Cabinet job because he is not true Cabinet material. ''More a mechanic than a philosopher,'' says Representative Benjamin S. Rosenthal, Democrat of Queens. **********When Mr. Vance resigned as Secretary of State last spring over the abortive raid to free the hostages in Iran, there was speculation for a few days that Mr. Christopher might be moved up. But in the end, President Carter named Mr. Muskie. **********Warren Minor Christopher was born Oct. 27, 1925, in Scranton, N.D.  His father, a banker, was hit hard by the Depression and illness, and the family moved to Los Angeles. After serving in the Navy, Mr.  Christopher received a law degree from Stanford University in 1949, doing so well that Justice William O. Douglas asked him to serve as his clerk for a year. Dabbled in California Politics **********After that he returned to Los Angeles and joined O'Melveny & Myers, one of the largest and most influential law firms on the West Coast.  As a young California lawyer, Mr. Christopher dabbled in Democratic politics, and eventually his political associations led him to Washington, where he served as a trade negotiator, then in a group looking into the causes of urban riots, then as Deputy Attorney General in the Johnson Administration. **********In 1973 Mr. Christopher was approached about becoming the special Watergate prosecutor. He turned down the job on the ground he had not been promised enough freedom. **********Mr. Christopher is married to the former Marie Josephine Wyllis, and they have four children. An earlier marriage ended in divorce.  He spends his scarce free time with his family or on the tennis court. He also jogs, arising at 5:30 for his daily run, sometimes on the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal towpath."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/25/world/a-land-sacred-to-three-faiths.html": {"writer_name": "United International", "pub_date": "1981-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 29, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A LAND SACRED TO THREE FAITHS", "print_headline": "A LAND SACRED TO THREE FAITHS", "body_text": " **********In Bethlehem, Msgr.

The paper was late and still not on the stands when his phone rang. It was a call from Solidarity union leaders in the gigantic Nowa Huta steel mill: They just wanted him to know that they were drawing up strike plans because, they assumed, the censor had stopped publication. **********The assumption was not so far-fetched, for Gazeta Krakowska is considered the most outspoken and courageous newspaper in Poland and has had more than one brush with the censor. The fact that a few hours' delay in publication was almost enough to shut down the largest steel mill in the country shows how much workers value the abstract right to read relatively unfettered news. **********It is perhaps a lesson not to be lost on the authorities, who have pledged to rein in the press and other mass media to try to mollify the Soviet Union. A letter from the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party this month charged that the Polish news media had fallen into the hands of ''the enemy'' and were being used to ''undermine socialism.'' **********The reaction to the letter has not been, for the moment at least, a 180-degree turn. Newspapers still carry accounts of events not usually covered in the Communist world and commentaries critical of the Government, although television, which responds more quickly to control from above, seems suddenly vapid, with a great deal of air time devoted to official ceremonies and ambassadors presenting their credentials. Journalists Urge Freer Expression **********Last week the journalists' association passed a resolution that said, in effect, that the press must continue its role of reflecting the national need for freer expression. Journalists must be responsible for what they write and must be conscious of the interests of the state, but should not abandon a critical outlook, it said. **********The changes that have taken place are largely behind the scenes.  Jozef Klasa, the Central Committee member in charge of press, radio and television, a liberal, resigned. He was replaced by Leslaw Tokarski, editor of the weekly magazine Perspektywy, who is a onetime protege of Stefan Olszowski, ranking hard-liner on the Politburo. The position is critical in determing how much control is exerted over editors and television producers. **********The Government is also attempting to reopen negotiations on a draft bill to curb censorship that had finally taken shape after months of talks with Solidarity, the independent union organization. The draft exempts from censorship informational bulletins for internal distribution by trade unions, and the authorities now want the exemption stricken out. **********The Polish press has come such a long way that it is hard to imagine it returning to a docile preoccupation with non-news. Many newspapers now feature long articles on the housing shortage, the collapse of medical facilities, corruption and profiteering by former party officials, and social problems ranging from drug addiction to homosexuality, which have been taboo for decades. Polish Ties With Soviet Are Taboo **********The only articles that appear to be out of bounds for the official, or censored, press are those that raise questions about Poland's relationship and military alliance with the Soviet Union, and those that directly attack the principles of Marxism-Leninism. But even here the boundary is sometimes tested. **********Some time ago Tygodnik Powszekny, the independent Roman Catholic newspaper, printed an attack on the management of the Polish economy that included this observation: ''Whereas the crisis of capitalism is a crisis of overproduction, in a planned economy it is a crisis of underproduction. The present economic crisis is the direct consequence of our system.'' **********The Polish press is now the most free in the Eastern bloc, including Yugoslavia, one Polish columnist said. But for all that, it is restrained. **********One factor in the new freedom has been a flood of ''independent'' newspapers, estimated to number between 100 and 200. Some of them bypass the censor, which is illegal but tolerated by a weakened state apparatus. Union Publishes Newspapers **********Almost every major Solidarity office has its own publication, which may be nothing more than a mimeographed sheet appearing daily, packed with information and opinion. There are also new nationwide newspapers, including Solidarnosc, the national union's weekly, with a circulation of 500,000, and Rzeczywistosc, or Reality, a new organ for conservatives that emphasizes nationalism, egalitarianism and Communist orthodoxy. Its circulation is 150,000. **********Even Trybuna Ludu, the staid and rather flat national voice of the Polish United Workers' (Communist) Party, has changed. Its articles about Solidarity reflect a degree of acceptance that is heretical to other countries, and it is no longer easily found on newsstands in Moscow and Prague. **********One irony in the situation is that it has been the Communist Party newspapers, especially in the provinces, that have been in the forefront of change. **********The unquestioned champion of the new press freedom is Gazeta Krakowska, the Communist Party newspaper of Cracow. Mr. Szumowski, a 42-year-old former television reporter and documentary film maker, and his wife, Dorotea Terkowska, a columnist, have transformed it into the most sought-after publication in Poland. Making Muckraking History **********Last fall Gazeta Krakowska made muckraking history when it published investigative reports about corruption by party officials in a nearby town. The article was even cited at a party meeting, which then expelled several officials, as support for the charges against them. It was the first case in Poland of investigative reporting that led to a direct result. **********During the Bydgoszcz incident last March, in which policemen beat up Solidarity activists, the paper again excelled. Other journalists, including those working for the Polish press agency, P.A.P., complained bitterly that their dispatches were altered beyond recognition. Gazeta Krakowska solved the problem of official sensibilities by printing three full-length front-page articles, one giving the official version, another the union's side and a third with its own facts and conclusions. **********Mr. Szumowski is modest and circumspect about his accomplishments.  He is not a crusader or a ground breaker, he said, just a newspaperman who believes in using ''good, journalistic workshop skills.'' **********''The party has called for a dialogue, and I treat that call seriously,'' he said. ''If there's to be a dialogue, well, let's have a dialogue.'' **********''I take the party at its word, and I treat seriously the agreements it struck with Solidarity,'' he added. ''There are opponents of the method of dialogue I represent - and there are people who would like to break the social accords.'' **********Mr. Szumowski has been fortunate in that the local Cracow party leadership is among the most enlightened in the country. When he becomes embroiled with the censor he calls upon the local first secretary, Krystyn Dabrowa, for support. **********The trick, he found, is often in the presentation. ''Take Bydgoszcz. Many journalists wrote about it accurately, but they couldn't get their stories printed. It's not enough to be courageous. You must support that with a knowledge of the political conditions. If a journalist hasn't learned over the past 10 years how to ski through the slalom of censorship, he won't be able to suddenly regain his agility.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/16/business/holder-s-surprise-offer-snags-ua-columbia-bid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 650, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOLDER'S SURPRISE OFFER SNAGS UA-COLUMBIA BID", "print_headline": "HOLDER'S SURPRISE OFFER SNAGS UA-COLUMBIA BID", "body_text": " **********The joint effort by Dow Jones & Company and Knight-Ridder Newspapers Inc. to acquire fast-growing UA-Columbia Cablevision Inc.  hit an unexpected snag yesterday when United Artists Theatre Circuit Inc. announced a tender offer that could yield it a total of nearly 50 percent of UA-Columbia's shares, at a price $10 above the bid by the two big publishers. **********The movie chain, which is already one of UA-Columbia's major shareholders, said it would offer $85 a share in cash for up to 22 percent more of UA-Columbia, 725,000 shares, eclipsing the $75 offered last month by Dow Jones and Knight-Ridder. From the beginning, United Artists Theatre Circuit has vehemently opposed that proposal as inadequate and has threatened to take whatever steps it deems necessary - including litigation - to block it. **********Since the theater chain already owns 27.6 percent of UA-Columbia's stock, if it manages to pick up the additional 725,000 shares, United Artists would control 49.6 percent of the stock, enough to effectively thwart any takeover attempt. At the $85 price, the additional shares would cost the company a total of $61.6 million. **********UA-Columbia's board approved the proposal from Dow Jones and Knight-Ridder last month by an 8-to-6 vote and was scheduled to meet yesterday morning to vote on a definitive agreement. The unexpected action from United Artists Theatre Circuit, however, disrupted those plans. What was expected to be a fairly routine meeting ended up starting two hours late and lasted well into the evening. 'A Complete Surprise' **********A UA-Columbia official said there would be no comment on the theater chain's tender offer before today. He did note that the development ''came as a complete surprise,'' and said, ''When we went home last night, we had no idea at all that this was coming.'' The United Artists tender offer is scheduled to begin today. **********Knight-Ridder and Dow Jones both said only that they were studying the development. During prepared remarks at the Dow Jones annual meeting yesterday, however, Warren H. Phillips, the company's chairman and chief executive, cautioned shareholders that it ''would be a mistake to draw conclusions at this stage.'' He said, ''This is a normal tactic to be expected in this sort of thing.'' **********United Artists Theatre Circuit declined to elaborate on its intentions with respect to UA-Columbia, saying that the tender offer papers will be self-explanatory. However, an official at Drexel Burnham Lambert, which is acting as the movie chain's investment banker and has been hunting for another suitor for UA-Columbia, would not rule out the possibility of a forthcoming offer from another party. **********In trading yesterady on the over-the-counter market, UA-Columbia stock responded to the new development by surging 5 1/2, to 78 1/4 bid. Knight-Ridder was unchanged at 34 1/4; Dow Jones was up 3/8, to 76 3/4. **********In a separate development yesterday, United Artists Theatre Circuit said that it had decided to scrap a plan to take the company private that had been under consideration since early last year. It did not elaborate on the reasons for the decision. First Bid in February **********The first offer for UA-Columbia came in late February, when Dow Jones, a diversified publisher that owns The Wall Street Journal, and Knight-Ridder, one of the country's biggest newspaper chains, offered $72 a share for all the common stock of the cable operator. In early March, they sweetened the proposal to $75, or a total of $247.5 million. Though the proposal represents one of the biggest offers for a cable operator, there was speculation that the price would not be sufficient to satisfy all of UA-Columbia's shareholders. **********Despite negative votes from the five directors representing United Artists Theatre Circuit, the UA-Columbia board approved the offer in principle, though it left the company free to entertain additional bids before a definitive agreement was ratified."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/20/business/l-whose-security-139460.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 312, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Whose Security?", "print_headline": "Whose Security?", "body_text": " **********To the Business Editor: I was dismayed by Barbara Daniel's letter ''Pro Bergmann'' (Nov.  29), responding to ''Relax, Social Security Is Doing Its Job'' (Nov.  15).

Stop-gap measures, such as interfund transfers, may postpone the day of reckoning.

Such pressures have already provoked price reductions or elimination of special surcharges by Kuwait, Iraq and Egypt. **********Companies discuss the accelerating moves in only the most guarded terms for fear of angering foreign suppliers. But they privately concede that the moves are prompted by the current glut of world oil, which in turn has led to painful losses by almost every refinery in the world. It is routine for companies to lose $3 or more on every barrel of oil processed in the present market, although many companies are still posting profits from their drilling operations.. **********Sharply lower demand, low utilization of refineries and soaring interest rates are making it impossible for companies to pass on the cost of their chief raw material, crude oil, analysts say. **********''The oil companies want to make their case politely, but they're in anguish,'' said Halsey Peckworth, editorial director of Platt's Oilgram Price Reports, a trade publication that closely tracks petroleum markets. Taking on the Producers **********As a result, the international oil companies - whose fortunes have seemed to move in tandem with those of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries since the first big price run-up in 1974 - today find themselves in a quiet war with OPEC nations and other oil producing countries, such as Mexico, Egypt, Norway and Britain. Last month's inconclusive OPEC meeting seemed to solidify the already apparent opposition to the pricing posture of producers, a major oil company official suggested. **********For consumers, analysts suggest that the emergence of the companies as advocates of lower crude prices may be some of the best news in years, following as it does a drop in retail gasoline prices of nearly 10 cents a gallon over the past two months. **********''It's going to be a great summer for petroleum consumers,'' said a planning official of one of the world's biggest oil companies.  The industry's drive for lower prices, which appears to involve most Western companies, began in the Persian Gulf region, where companies have forced Kuwait, Qatar and Iraq to abandon surcharges they formerly added to official selling prices. But its focus has shifted to the countries that sell some of the highest-priced oil in the world: Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia and the North Sea producers. Companies Take Hard Line **********Focusing attention on the industry's new stance was a statement made over the weekend by C.C. Garvin Jr., chairman of the Exxon Corporation, who said that the giant oil company had ''more oil than we see a market for.'' **********''Where the prices are not competitive with the marketplace, we think there should be an improvement,'' he urged.  The Shell Oil Company is taking a similarly determined perspective, having already walked away from a firm crude contract in Malaysia. ''We simply cannot continue to pay,'' said Henry Sullivan, manager of Shell's hydrocarbon business. **********''Those people who can terminate their contracts have terminated them,'' said a top international official of a major oil company.  ''Those that can't are negotiating and raising all the hell they can.'' Scope of Campaign **********The scope and intensity of the worldwide industry's campaign to cut oil prices is evident from a variety of recent developments: **********- Companies have walked away from long-term contracts with Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria and elsewhere, according to crude oil traders. Moreover, companies are pressing producers to allow them to reduce the amount of contract oil they take, without being compelled to forfeit the entire contract. **********- Libyan oil, the highest-priced in OPEC, is being offered in the market at a $2 discount by a French trading company, Mr. Peckworth said. Such price-shaving at the expense of other producers of highquality, low-sulfur oil could represent a significant price breakthrough, analysts suggested. **********- Industry delegations, from Japan as well as the United States, are said to have quietly visited Mexico to try to persuade the state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos, to cut as much as $5 from the price it charges for its best grade of crude. Mexico responded yesterday by saying it can only guarantee to maintain current price levels until July 1. Skeptical of Impact **********To be sure, longtime oil analysts are skeptical of whether the companies will be able to reduce foreign crude prices to nearly as much as they apparently would like. ''I don't think anyone in their right mind expects $41-a-barrel oil to come down to $35,'' said Marshall Thomas, markets editor of Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a trade publication. He said that a reduction ''to maybe $37'' seems to be the unofficial industry ''target.'' **********The depth of the price reductions the companies seem to be seeking is clear when official government selling prices are compared with prices prevailing in the spot market, where oil not under long-term contract is sold. Because the spot market is governed by the forces of supply and demand, analysts sometimes argue that it is the truest calibrator of prices. **********Oil from Norway's Ekofisk field, priced officially at $40, draws only $35 in the spot market. Crude from the British Forties field there, offically pegged at $39.25, draws $7 less in the spot market. **********Two sharp reductions over the past two months in the price of Egyptian oil - traditionally closely linked to spot prices - are indicative of what might happen if this was the principal index for oil prices. Since April, that country's best grade of crude has fallen by $4.50, to $36. **********''It's certainly not a healthy situation,'' W.G. Magers, a vice president of the Sun Company, said. ''There are some gutty decisions we're going to have to make soon.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/18/business/2-banks-start-ventures-with-money-funds.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1981-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 688, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 BANKS START VENTURES WITH MONEY FUNDS", "print_headline": "2 BANKS START VENTURES WITH MONEY FUNDS", "body_text": " **********The First Interstate Bancorporation, a big Los Angeles-based bank holding company, and the First National Bank of Springfield, Ill., a medium-sized institution, have started joint ventures with money market mutual funds. **********The two banking companies are thus allying with an adversary that the banking industry has widely criticized. The funds compete with the banks and thrift institutions in providing check-like services.  But they pay far higher rates on customer deposits because they are not subject to the interest-rate ceilings that apply to banking institutions. **********Many other banks are interested in initiating programs similar to the two joint ventures, which both started in the past few weeks.  ''We've had inquiries from all over the country,'' said Dean C.  Countryman, vice president of First National of Springfield. He will be in New York this week advising a New York bank, which he declined to name, that wants to set up a joint venture with a money fund. **********These moves are further evidence that the banking industry, struggling to hold on to clients and deposits in an era of high interest rates and stiff competition, is flexing its muscles and moving into new areas. In so doing, the banks are stretching the traditional definitions, and possibly the legal ones as well, of what banks can and cannot do. Investment in Dreyfus Funds **********For its part, the Illinois bank offers an individual checking account that automatically invests the unused balance in any one of three of the Dreyfus Corporation's money market funds, three funds in the Fidelity Group or in repurchase agreements. To qualify for the high-yielding program, an individual must put a minimum of $15,000 in the new checking account. **********The arrangement available at First Interstate's 21 banks in 11 Western states is somewhat different. Along with Dreyfus, First Interstate has established its own money market fund, Pacific American Liquid Assets. First Interstate is the manager and principal adviser for the fund, which is now offered only to the custodial accounts in the trust departments of its affiliated banks. **********Dreyfus handles all the administrative and marketing chores, such as paper work, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and supplying clients with information about the fund. **********Under the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, banks are forbidden from underwriting or marketing securities. Money market mutual funds, marketed as shares, are securities. **********''We're in a gray legal area with this program,'' concedes James B. Fox, president of Western Asset Management Company, the investment advisory arm of First Interstate. ''In effect, this is a straightforward money market fund.'' **********However, First Interstate is not, technically speaking, marketing the fund, even though it is available only to its clients. ''All we're doing is acting as an adviser to an open-end mutual fund,'' said R. Jeffrey Taylor, counsel for First Interstate. ''That is permissible.'' 'Selling Accounts' **********In both the joint ventures, Howard Stein, chairman of Dreyfus, explained: ''The banks are selling accounts. They aren't selling a fund.'' **********How widespread such joint ventures could become is uncertain and much depends on the future course of banking regulation. For instance, if banks are permitted to set up their own money market funds, many big banks would have little need for cooperative efforts with the fund industry. **********However, under present restrictions, banks are more and more likely to link up with their sometime adversaries, the money funds. As Mr.  Fox of Interstate noted, ''The only way we could have done this is through a joint-venture arrangement.'' **********Also, the funds have proven expertise in the field. ''We can get them into the business quickly,'' Mr. Stein said. ''We know how to run a money fund.'' **********At present, it seems that joint approach to financial products is a concept that will be expanded. ''There will probably be some other joint venture product areas between major funds and banks,'' said Mr. Fox of First Interstate's investment subsidiary. ''We've already had some exploratory conversations with Dreyfus on this subject, but I can't be any more specific.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/07/business/watt-opposes-stock-limits.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 202, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Watt Opposes Stock Limits", "print_headline": "Watt Opposes Stock Limits", "body_text": " **********Amid growing hostility to Canadian takeovers of United States companies, Interior Secretary James G.

The prisoners had wanted to count all the time lost bec ause of protests. **********More Time in Jail **********''It means that in most cases the prisoners will have to serve two and a half years extra in jail,'' the statement said.  Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, James Prior, announced the changes yesterday after a seven-month hunger-strike campaign in Maze Prison was ended last weekend. **********A Government spokesman said Lord Gowrie, the minister responsible for prisons, would meet with the prisoners to help explain details of the new rules. Protestant Calls It a Sellout **********Ian Paisley, the militant Protestant leader, and his supporters have attacked the changes as a sellout to the jailed I.R.A. members.  Members of Mr. Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party walked out of a reception given last night by Mr. Prior at which he intended to explain the new rules. **********Mr. Prior said yesterday that prisoners would be allowed to wear their own clothing and would be entitled to 50 percent of the normal remission of their sentences after they conformed to prison rules for three months. Demand on Political Status Denied **********He refused to concede the hunger strikers' main demand for political prisoner status. He said that two of their other demands, on prison work and free association, were not compatible with a civil prison, although there was room for development. **********Mr. Prior said that the prisoners' education should be improved and that they should be allowed more opportunities to associate together. But, he added, ''there will be no question of a political or military system of administration or any return to special category status.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/30/business/advertising-mcnamara-clapp-s-first.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 40, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "McNamara & Clapp's First", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; McNamara & Clapp's First", "body_text": " **********McNamara & Clapp has landed that much-desired first account, Taylor Rental Centers of America, a franchising operation that spends about $1.5 million for advertising.

This cost, an estimated $1.5 billion in 1980, is passed along indirectly in the price of goods to both credit card and cash customers. **********The major credit card issuers, the American Express Company, Visa and Mastercard, maintained that without the ban on consumer surcharges, credit card holders would be penalized for using their cards. Opponents of extending the ban contend that the merchant fee hides the true cost of credit card purchases, interferes with the free market, encourages inflation and penalizes cash customers. House 'Caved In' **********Senator William Proxmire, Democrat of Wisconsin, one of the chief opponents of the surcharge ban, said that it only benefited banks and credit card companies. He said the House ''caved in'' in passing the credit card surcharge ban bill. **********Representative Frank Annunzio, Democrat of Illinois, and sponsor of the bill in the House, said that in a society that has 60 million credit card users, it would be punitive to ask cardholders to pay an extra fee whenever they used their cards. **********''We are a nation of credit card junkies addicted to popping plastic,'' said Mr. Annunzio.  During the House hearings, the major credit card issuers and the American Bankers Association testified in support of the surcharge ban. The Federal Reserve Board testified against the ban extension.  No consumer groups testified. **********''There was nobody we thought who was concerned about the issue,'' said Curtis Prins, staff director of the subcommittee on consumer affairs, House Committee on Banking. ''The Congress is protecting the credit card user from being bilked. Right after the ban expired we were contacted by a man who ate dinner at a restaurant and got a 4 percent surcharge on his bill because he used his credit card.'' Lower Prices for Cash Purchases **********The diner's situation illustrates the heart of the issue for opponents of the surcharge ban. They maintain that without it, consumers who use cards would know and bear the cost of credit card usage. Furthermore, consumer groups say merchants are likely to offer cash customers lower prices, making credit card buying less attractive, without a ban on surcharges. **********''Credit card users should pay the legitimate cost of using their cards. We don't need cash customers subsidizing their use,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts. Mr. Frank offered an amendment eliminating the ban, but House rules required that the bill go to the floor without amendments. **********''That bill was rushed through the House,'' said Mr. Frank.  ''People came up to me on the floor after I voted against it and asked why. When I explained it was because the surcharge ban was a subsidy of the credit card industry they said they wished they had known that earlier. I think I could win that amendment on the floor if we go to a House-Senate conference.'' **********A House-Senate conference on the bill is a possibility because of opposition to the surcharge ban from consumer groups, the Federal Trade Commission and other groups that testified before the Senate. Consumer Opposition Arose **********Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, is co-sponsor of the Senate bill along with Senator Jake Garn, Republican of Utah.  Initially, Senator Chafee planned to poll members on the bill but eventually held hearings. Mr. Chafee was convinced that extending the surcharge ban protected consumers. During testimony, however, consumer groups testified against the surcharge ban extension. In addition to the Federal Trade Commission, the surcharge ban was also opposed by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and several other groups. **********Senator Proxmire introduced an amendment that would eliminate the surcharge ban to the bill. In the meantime the deadline on the ban expired. **********Opponents of the reinstitution of the ban, including the consumer groups and Senator Proxmire, began to look for allies for their cause. By last week, several free market organizations such as the National Taxpayers Union and the Council for Competitive Economy had contacted Mr. Garn to express their opposition to the surcharge ban. **********''Our support of free competition leads us to oppose the surcharge ban, an anticompetitive regulation that interferes with business people and consumers and that is out of step with the economic views expressed by the voters in November,'' said Sheldon L. Richman, the council's research director. **********The expiration of the customer-surcharge ban means that merchants now can pass on their card costs to credit card holders alone. The expiration is not, however, expected to alter the business practices of retail merchants who do a high volume of business with credit card holders. They are unlikely to pass on the fee to buyers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/07/business/chemical-s-prime-19-1-2.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1981-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 531, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHEMICAL'S PRIME 19 1 2%", "print_headline": "CHEMICAL'S PRIME 19 1 2%", "body_text": " **********The Chemical Bank lowered its prime lending rate yesterday to 19 1/2 percent, the lowest level among the nation's largest banks.  Despite signals from the Federal Reserve System that it does not intend to allow interest rates to drop as precipitously as they did earlier last year, some bankers believe that market pressures will force a rapid reduction in interest rates. **********Such thinking was partly the reason why the Chemical Bank, the nation's sixth largest, set its prime at 19 1/2 percent yesterday, down from 20 1/2 percent, according to Thomas S. Johnson, executive vice president. **********At most major banks across the country, the prime stands at 20 1/2 percent. On Monday, however, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company lowered its prime rate to 20 percent, as the Marine Midland Bank did yesterday. Other Loan Rates Tied to Prime **********The prime is the rate banks charge on loans, usually for 90-day periods, to their most creditworthy corporate customers, although many of these companies are able to borrow below the prime for loans with shorter maturities. The prime is particularly important because rates on many other loans are tied to it. **********Chemical's decision to lower its prime was largely based on a sharp decline in the rates it must pay for its own funds, Mr. Johnson said. But equally important, he added, is Chemical's expectation that short-term interest rates will continue to decline. **********Mr. Johnson said Chemical recognized that the Fed was adverse to allowing a sharp and rapid decline in money market rates, such as occurred in early 1980, when the prime rate dropped to 10 3/4 percent from 20 percent in a three-month period. **********In addition to statements by Fed officials, Mr. Johnson noted that in recent days the central bank had not intervened in the financial markets to lower the relatively high rate on Federal funds, money that banks trade among themselves. Yesterday, for example, rates on Federal funds averaged about 20 percent, not far below the peak reached during the height of the tight-money policy. Fed Options Viewed as Limited **********But Mr. Johnson said the Fed was limited in its ability to buck market forces. He expects the economy to slow, thereby reducing corporate borrowing from banks. Long-term interest rates will also decline, he says, and this will cause many companies to return to the bond markets. Funds obtained in the bond markets would be used to repay bank loans. **********The result, Mr. Johnson said, will be a sharp reduction in borrowing from banks. Thus, even if the Fed remains cautious about adding money to the banking system, the supply will decline sharply enough to cause a steep slide in interest rates. And because the Fed will still want to keep the growth of the money supply within its targets, it will be reluctant to take too much money out of the system to bolster interest rates, Mr. Johnson said. **********Yet, the Chemical official does not expect rates to drop so rapidly as last year. He predicts short-term rates will again drop about 10 percentage points, but over six months instead of three."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/07/business/reading-agrees-to-settlement.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reading Agrees To Settlement", "print_headline": "Reading Agrees To Settlement", "body_text": " **********The Reading Company said it had agreed to a Government settlement that provides $121 million for railroad properties transferred to Conrail and others in 1976.

It will be the first time since 1954 that a Secretary General has submitted a budget that does not provide for the expansion of the world body. **********''The proposed program budget does not provide for any growth in real terms,'' Mr. Waldheim explained. But he noted that the budget, which must be approved by two thirds of the General Assembly before the end of its session in December, would be able to keep pace with inflation. **********In putting together his bud get, the Secreta ry General was caught between the demands of the Assembly for incre ased services and the refusal of the wealthy nations to increase th eir contributions to theorganization. **********''Whether we like it or not we are in the center of public opinion,'' said Helmut Debatin, the Under Secretary General, who did the actual work on the budget. ''Developing countries are concerned if they are not getting what they say they are entitled to. The Secretary General is put against the wall.'' 20 Nations Were Opposed **********Despite overwhelming support in the Assembly last year for increases in the world body's expenditures, they were opposed by 20 nations from the East and West that finance nearly 80 percent of the organization's budget. This was a clear signal to Mr. Waldheim that he could not expect additional financing for the next two years. **********While he will not refer to that vote in his address tomorrow, Mr.  Waldheim defended his budget as ''maintaining and strengthening the financial credibility of the organization at a time when many member states face serious economic and financial difficulties.'' **********At the same time Mr. Waldheim complained that the work of the United Nations would inevitably be impaired by the no-growth budget.  The Secretariat in particular, he said, ''cannot successfully and efficiently accomplish the ever-widening tasks assigned to it without being granted adequate means.'' **********In a draft text of his speech to the budget review commission of the General Assembly, Mr. Waldheim acknowledged that ''the organization cannot in its financial policy neglect the economic and financial positon from which member states view its budgetary requirements, as it is they who have to bear the financial burden.'' **********Under the complicated budgetary process of the United Nations, Mr.  Waldheim's proposed budget is reviewed by two committees, one a 16-member advisory panel and the other a committee composed of each of the 156 member-countries. At any point in the three-month review deletions or additions may be made to the budget, although historically there is little precedent for substantial changes being made in the Secretary General's budget. **********The budget is not put together with expenditures strictly linked to anticipated income. Rather, the Secretary General's $1.54 billion budget, of which only $250 million will come from taxes on staff income and other money-raising activities, is a statement of the proposed expenditures for programs that have been mandated by the General Assembly. The total expenditures, which this year come to $1.25 billion, are then assessed against the member nations according to a formula based on population and gross national product. **********Contributions range from the United States's assessment, which accounts for 25 percent of the world bo dy's budget, or about $150 million per y ear, to those of underdeveloped countries, which are assessed at o nly one tenth of 1 percent, or about $60,000 a year. **********In the past 20 years the budget of the United Nations, 75 percent of which now goes on salaries, has grown from about $60 million a year to its current annual level of more than $600 million, with a concomitant expansion of the staff from 4,000 to more than 11,400.  Mr. Waldheim explained the growth as a direct consequence of the increasing demands of the General Assembly. Constant Call for New Programs **********In each session the Assembly has called for the United Nations to create more programs, ranging from agricultural assistance in Asia to programs to incorporate ''environmentally sound'' features into urban planning in Latin America, as well as an array of conferences and councils on what are deemed urgent political issues. **********Mr. Waldheim indicated that with the necessary belt-tightening, the organization's ''economic, social and humanitarian'' functions would remain a priority and that cuts would occur elsewhere. **********Reflecting the increasing austere fiscal situation of the United Nations, Mr. Waldheim will admonish some of those member nations that have been dilatory in meeting their financial obligations. If a member fails to pay its assessment for two years, it is deprived of a vote in the General Assembly.

Mr. Johnson was former chief counsel to the Chicago Board of Trade, the nation's biggest futures exchange, and is regarded as the the leading legal authority on commodity trading. His nomination was announced just before the meeting began. **********As a result, Mr. Johnson canceled his appearance and many of those who did speak abandoned their usual attacks against the Federal agency and the equally standard laments about the overregulation of their industry by Washington. Instead, much of the addresses centered on three topics of mounting concern to the commodity industry. **********One is the rising attacks by the Internal Revenue Service and Congress on the use of commodity futures to postpone or minimize tax payments. The second is industry's campaign for the legalization of trading in commodity options, which were outlawed in June 1978 after years of scandals. The third is how much of the C. F. T. C.'s regulatory power should be assumed by the industry itself. **********The I. R. S. and its supporters in Congress have long fought against the use of tax straddles - the simultaneous purchase and sale of futures contracts in two tax years - to roll over tax liabilities, convert short-term gains into long-term, or otherwise shelter income. **********''While we view the Reagan Administration as friendly, its positions on fiscal reform could encourage the I. R. S. and Congress to step up their attacks on tax straddles,'' one brokerage house executive noted. Currently, the I. R. S. is prosecuting a record 700 tax straddle cases and there are several bills in Congress that would outlaw such straddles. Whether or not the I. R. S. wins its cases, they are a costly burden to those involved, including brokers, and also frighten many potential users of these tactics, he said. **********The subject of commodity options was aired more openly at the seminars and recreational grounds of the Boca Raton Hotel. Options are the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell commodities at a specified price within a fixed period of time. A trader's risk is limited to the premium paid and, unlike futures, which are promises to buy or sell commodities under similar terms, protect the trader from margin calls. **********Dr. Henry G. Jarecki, chairman of the Mocatta Metals Corporation and a leading expert on options, tackled the issue in a witty speech that delighted his seminar audience. Mocatta, the American affiliate of the 300-year-old London metals trading house, is one of the few companies permitted to trade options since the ban, and does so only through a handful of brokerage houses. A psychiatrist and former teacher at the Yale University Medical School, he said, somewhat tongue-in-cheek: **********''You all will probably be permitted to trade options soon. And as soon as the first trouble reappears they will be banned again, no matter what kind of trouble. Unless measures are taken, the same crooks, flakes and other assorted nuts will enter the options business and start ripping off the public. **********''We at Mocatta blew the whistle on some of the more notorious crooks and flakes - Goldstein, Samuelson & Company, Collins & Day and Alan Abrahams, also known as Lloyd Carr -which gulled the public out of tens of millions of dollars before they were put out of action. The cost to the industry was a tarnished reputation and the ban on most options tradiing. Today, most exchanges have filed to trade options because they know the market is there. How long it will be there is something else again.'' **********Paul Sarnoff, research director at Rudolf Wolff Commodity Brokers Inc., took the issue of options further: ''All one needs to be a futures or options merchant is $200 for a C. F. T. C. registration, $250,000 in capital - and arrange for a clearing member of a futures exchange to execute the business. The public often does not know that their business is not being directly handled by the prestigious clearing member. They often learn this after their 'broker' vanishes or, as has been the case several times recently, the non-clearing dealer goes bankrupt.'' **********Because the clearing house of each exchange closely monitors the assets and liabilities of members, the financial health of the 110 or so clearing members was not in question, Mr. Sarnoff said. ''The problem is the link between the customer and the nonclearing member, and this should be looked into before the ban on options is lifted,'' he added. **********As for the industry's move toward self-regulation along the lines of the National Association of Securities Dealers, a number of critics said privately that this could weaken the role of the C.F.T.C. to the point where the much more feared Securities and Exchange Commission would take over. **********These fears were reinforced recently when the S. E. C. granted the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which trades in stock options, the right to trade in options on Government National Mortgage Association debt instruments. Ginnie Mae futures have been a lucrative product of several commodity exchanges, which have sought in vain thus far for C. F. T. C. approval to trade options in these financial instruments as well."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/19/business/ex-cell-o-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-may-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EX-CELL-O CORP reports earnings for Qtr to May 31", "print_headline": "EX-CELL-O CORP reports earnings for Qtr to May 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/24/business/advertising-jwt-s-spreading-umbrella.html": {"writer_name": "Sandra Salmans", "pub_date": "1981-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 526, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; JWT's Spreading Umbrella", "print_headline": "Advertising; JWT's Spreading Umbrella", "body_text": " **********WORKERS are putting the finishing touches on the stainless-steel sculpture suspended in the Park Avenue Atrium, the glittering new headquarters of the JWT Group, come October. Hill & Knowlton, which JWT aquired 14 months ago, inherits the hacienda-style offices in the Graybar Building, and its attractively priced lease. **********The two moves are some of the more conspicuous examples of synergy for the JWT Group since it took over Hill & Knowlton, the world's largest public relations firm, along with Euro-Advertising, a nineagency network in Europe, and World Wide Agency, a recruitment advertising agency, last year. The relocations also indicate the untarnished optimism of the JWT Group, the J. Walter Thompson Company's parent, and of its chairman and chief executive, Don Johnston. **********That optimism is not founded on the current bottom line. The JWT Group, like much of the industry, has been bumping up against advertiser resistance to spending. Despite rosy predictions last year, JWT took a beating in the first half of 1981, thanks to currency translation losses, a postponement of client expenditures on advertising, large real estate outlays and high interest costs. **********This, Mr. Johnston said last week, is an ''aberrational year.'' ''There's a lot of uncertainty about spending patterns,'' he added. ''The timing of up-front buying has been slower. There's an awful lot hanging on the fourth quarter of this year.'' For the future, however, Mr. Johnston said he is confident about the benefits of expanding the JWT empire. **********Mr. Johnston speaks of the various companies in the group as ''brands'' with discrete brand personalities. ''We felt it made a lot of sense to have two separate brands,'' he said of Hill & Knowlton and J. Walter Thompson. By sheltering the brands under a corporate umbrella, Mr. Johnston said, the JWT Group allows them to grow without a commensurate growth in overhead. The arrangement offers opportunities for improving productivity that are otherwise foreclosed in the advertising-public relations world, he said. ''It frees Thompson and Hill & Knowlton from having to take care of the plumbing,'' Mr. Johnston added. **********The Hill & Knowlton partnership has already proved handy, especially overseas, where the public relations agency can be ushered into the offices of clients by the long-established J. Walter Thompson Company. But ''it's worked both ways,'' insisted Mr.  Johnston, citing Gerber, Kellogg and Dart & Kraft as some of the clients who have been propelled by Hill & Knowlton into the arms of J. Walter Thompson or vice versa. **********Then there is World Wide which, despite the name, was pretty much confined to the United States until Thompson absorbed it, renamed it Thompson Recruitment Advertising and opened offices abroad. ''We were fascinated with the potential of high-volume, fast-turnover business with a lot of blue-chip clients,'' said Mr. Johnston. **********Euro-Advertising, as Mr. Johnston has said in the past, represents a ''second track'' abroad for JWT - with the implication that third, fourth and more ''tracks'' may be added. ''In Europe, a mature market, it's almost too late to start your own agency,'' he said.  ''But you can still grow by getting a flanker brand.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/02/world/poles-cut-sugar-rations-meat-will-be-restricted.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Poles Cut Sugar Rations; Meat Will Be Restricted", "print_headline": "Poles Cut Sugar Rations; Meat Will Be Restricted", "body_text": " **********The Government, giving the details of previously announced programs, said today that it had cut sugar rations by half, to 2.2 pounds per person per month, and that it would impose meat rationing April 1. **********The meat plan, worked out in consultation with the independent union Solidarity, will give most adults a monthly allotment of 7.7 pounds of meat and meat products.

In public, Bonn officials have affirmed that no evidence has appeared to indicate that Mr. Agca was ever in West Germany. **********Today, a Government spokesman denounced the Turkish Government's criticism of West Germany's inability to apprehend Mr. Agca, saying that Turkish information intended to lead to his arrest was ''inadequate and materially misleading'' and hindered rather than helped the search for Turkish extremists. **********High officials acquainted with the problem conceded, however, that intense, though secret, investigations were continuing to check reports that Mr. Agca spent time in West Germany. **********1.4 Million Turks in West Germany **********Though Bonn stopped the influx of foreign migrant workers six years ago, there are four million foreigners in the country, roughly 1.4 million of them from Turkey, including dependents. **********Government officials say that a polarization of Turkey in the late 1970's, as the country's economic and political structure began to disintegrate, led to growing radicalization and militancy among Turkish groups in West Germany. **********A recent report by Bonn's domestic intelligence agency estimates that there are about 50,000 members of Turkish extremist groups in West Germany, roughly 26,000 of them in right-wing groups. **********''The influence of the groups varies greatly, on their jobs and at home,'' said Jurgen Miksch, who oversees the German Evangelical Church's migrant worker aid efforts in Frankfurt. ''The extremists would like to control workers' daily lives. They tell them, 'Go here. Don't spend your time there.' Generally, it creates an atmosphere of intimidation.'' Left Said to Grow More Active **********The Government's analysts say that since the coup that brought the military junta of Gen. Kenan Evren to power last September, activity has increased on the left, where opposition to the military regime is strongest. But labor union and church officials among Turkish workers here accuse the Government in Ankara of turning a blind eye to extremism on the right. **********The rising militancy among Turkish workers is sometimes attributed to Bonn's sluggishness in social integration of Turkish workers and their families, who remain apart from German life because of differences in language, customs and religion. **********The major left-wing organization is the Federation of Turkish Labor Organizations in Germany, a grouping of two older unions that claim to have about 20,000 members. It is closely allied with the outlawed Turkish Communist Party, which has its exile headquarters in East Germany. West Germany's labor union movement avoids all contact with the organization. **********The major right-wing organization is the Federation of Turkish Democratic Idealist Associations, an umbrella organization for about 200 purportedly cultural groups throughout Europe. The federation's headquarters, in Frankfurt, says it has 50,000 members, roughly 35,000 of them in West Germany. **********Government analysts say Turkey's National Action Party, a rightwing party outlawed in Turkey, established the Federation of Idealist Associations as a front after overseas activities of Turkish political parties were banned in 1976. **********''The extremists here are a mirror image of Turkey,'' said a Bonn analyst. ''The same organizations are here, the suborganizations and the splinter groups.'' Ideas of Turkish Superiority **********The work of the organizations, analysts say, is to build strong units in exile to pursue their political goals clandestinely in Turkey. The analysts say most of the right-wing groups support ideas about superiority of the Turkish people and of Islam and they propagate the idea of turning from the West and establishing a Turkish Islamic empire. **********The groups are financed by a system of tithes exacted from members, as well as by generous contributions from affluent supporters, the analysts say. There are numerous reports, stemming chiefly from leftist sources, that drug trading and dealing in weapons are sources of finance, as the groups exploit the frequent travels of Turks between their homeland and Western Europe. Islamic Revival Among Turks **********Though the National Action Party and the federation are secular groups, they have developed ties to Islamic bodies in West Germany, tapping a significant Islamic revival among Turkish workers, specialists reported. **********Union leaders say an Islamic resurgence is partly a result of renewed Islamic consciousness spurred by the 1979 Iranian revolution against the Shah and partly the wish of Turks living in an alien culture to preserve their ways. **********''They seek national identity in religion,'' a labor union study said. ''The reason is fear that their children could be alienated from their parents and culture.'' **********Radical Islamic groups, seeking the overthrow of the Turkish Government and establishment of a nationalist Islamic state, have allied themselves with groups like the idealist federation. Today, there are more than 200 Islamic centers, operated by conservatives, 63 of them in heavily industrialized North Rhine-Westphalia, where many Turks work. **********Recent documentation by West Germany's labor federation pointed out strong anti-Western, anti-Semitic and anti-Christian currents in the Islamic centers' publications. Some analysts suggest that this was the atmosphere in which Mr. Agca conceived the need to kill the Pope."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/19/business/connecticut-rating.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Connecticut Rating", "print_headline": "Connecticut Rating", "body_text": " **********Moody's Investors Service yesterday assigned a prime-1 rating, its highest, to commercial paper to be issued by Connecticut.

At the time, just after the assassination of President Ziaur Rahman, Mr. Sattar, then the Vice President, was hospitalized with serious ailments. He told close aides that he feared he would be unable to campaign, but changed his mind in the face of arguments that the party built around the charismatic personality of President Zia could disintegrate without his candidacy. **********According to highly placed Bangladeshi sources who refused further indentification, it was Lieut. Gen. H.M. Ershad, the country's chief of staff, who made the most telling arguments for Mr. Sattar's entry into the race. But, as the campaign developed and the opposition Awami League was drawing large crowds, some of the same officers reportedly became hesitant. **********At one point during the monthlong campaign, General Ershad visited Mr. Sattar and put to him a suggestion for a military takeover that had been discussed by the army leaders. Although, according to a source close to the new President, the conversation never proceeded beyond the theoretical, Mr. Sattar, then acting president, rejected the idea immediately and told the officers that if they moved to seize power he would immediately retire to his house in Dacca. Secret Poll Conducted **********Mr. Sattar's view gained the support of Maj. Gen. Mohabbat Chowdhury, who is the director general of military intelligence.  General Chowdhury was reported by the sources as taking the position from the outset that if Mr. Sattar headed a military regime, he would be playing into the hands of the opposition candidate, Kamal Hossain. To relieve the anxiety of his fellow officers, General Chowdhury reportedly conducted a secret nationwide poll, which showed that Mr.  Sattar was running well ahead. Once this was circulated, talk of military intervention dissipated. **********According to the highly placed sources, Mr. Sattar has shown himself in these events to be a tough and stubborn leader who is not prepared to compromise what aides call a lifelong committment to due process and constitutional correctness. One man said that the President is fond of saying, ''I have nowhere to go but the grave,'' meaning that at the age of 75, with a recent history of poor health, he finds it easy to uphold convictions. **********At the Presidential Palace tonight, the newly elected leader, wearing an open-necked shirt, said in answer to a question that he had no intention of expanding the role of the army, as General Ershad had suggested in a recent interview with a British journalist. ''The army has a role to protect the sovereignty of the country and I don't think any other role is possible,'' he said. **********At the news conference, he said the election returns, which so far have him leading Mr. Hossain by 12 million votes to 4 million, represented ''a victory of the concept of Bangladeshi nationalism expounded by our late leader.'' He claimed that the election had been held ''peacefully and in a most free and fair way all over the country,'' and he termed the poll here as the ''freest and fairest election ever held in this part of the world.'' **********The opposition continued today to dispute such assertions, citing incidents of alleged intimidation at the polls and charging that through his control over the media and having military transport at his disposal, the Government candidate had an unfair advantage. A spokesman for Mr. Hossain's Awami League said the party had decided this afternoon to stage a series of demonstrations building to a nationwide protest next Monday challenging the result."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/26/business/tosco-to-sell-60-of-oil-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tosco to Sell 60% of Oil Unit", "print_headline": "Tosco to Sell 60% of Oil Unit", "body_text": " **********The Tosco Corporation said it was negotiating to sell up to 60 percent of a shale oil facility in Utah whose development plans were announced last month. **********Tosco is primarily an independent oil refiner but is involved in the development of two shale oil projects. **********In addition to the Utah project, the company owns 40 percent of the $3.5 billion Colony Shale Oil Project in Colorado, which is 60 percent owned by the Exxon Corporation. **********Tosco recently received a $1.1 billion loan guarantee from the Department of Energy for its share of the Colony project.

In the absence of the long-awaited drop in the funds rate, and because of a heavy supply of new issues, most interest rates have been rising since mid-June. **********In the long-term bond market, for example, the bellwether 13 7/8 percent Treasury bonds due 2011 were offered late in the day at 102 7/8 to yield 13.47 percent, compared with 12.55 percent on June 15. **********Tax-exempt yields are even closer to the peaks set earlier this year, as shown by $150 million of Aaa-rated Georgia bonds that were offered with yields ranging from 7.75 percent in 1982 to 10.25 percent in 2001. Underwriters led by Chase Manhattan said that less than $29.8 million of the bonds were still unsold. Reserves Added **********Yesterday the Federal Reserve temporarily added reserves to the banking system by arranging one- and four-day purchases of securities, but analysts stressed that the action was not necessarily a sign that the Fed is trying to make bank reserves less scarce and thereby encourage lower interest rates. **********Amid the uncertainty about the timing and extent of any near-term drop in short-term rates, the Treasury sold new one-year bills at an average rate of 13.74 percent, up from 13.15 percent at last month's sale, but well below the record 14.62 percent at May's auction. **********In the money markets, the additional reserves supplied by the Fed's temporary purchases were not enough to cause much of a drop in the Federal funds market, which opened at 19 3/4 percent, traded as high as 20 3/4 percent and averaged about 20 1/8 percent. **********Some money center bankers who are responsible for money market borrowings said that yesterday's high funds rate might have been caused partly by heavy demand from banks that were trying to offset today's transfer of more than $2 billion of previously frozen Iranian deposits to the New York Federal Reserve Bank. That transfer drains reserves from the banking system, and was perhaps one reason why the Fed temporarily added reserves to the banking system yesterday, analysts said. Drop in Rates Expected **********Bankers agree that one reason for the higher-than-expected funds rate over the past month has been the widespread expectation that interest rates are going to drop. **********''Most people are expecting interest rates to fall and they are therefore borrowing heavily in the short-term markets,'' said Thomas Johnson, executive vice president at Chemical Bank. Along with many other market participants, Mr. Johnson said that the lower funds rate would come about because slow money supply growth would ultimatly encourage the Fed to make reserves slightly less scarce. **********He noted that M-1B had declined for two consecutive months and that M-2 growth had slowed to about a 4 1/2 percent annual rate in June and May. **********Among those predicting lower interest rates in the near future and later this year were economists at Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc.  who wrote in a recent publication that current high interest rates ''are only transitory in nature and are being affected by high short rates and an overwhelming bond calendar, both of which require a winding down period.'' **********Lacy Hunt, an economist at Fidelity Bank is another who expects lower interest rates in the second half of the year. He estimated that real gross national product might fall in the third quarter, and that inflation would continue to decline, with the Consumer Price Index rising at a 7.5 percent annual rate over the next three months. **********Thirty-year Treasury bond yields could fall below 12 percent during the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of 1982, he said, while the bank prime rate could fall four percentage points by the end of 1981.

Tension Among Conservatives **********The fear that public discontent might climb to politically intolerable proportions before a Reagan economic program can show results accounts in part for the Reagan Administration's repeatedly stated intention to act forcefully from the onset. The new administration hopes to avoid the heavy strains that it sees developing among Mrs. Thatcher's supporters. In Britain, many Tories openly worry that the austerity the country is enduring to curb inflation is not the answer, or that the price of success will be too high. **********In the Reagan team's view, the need to deal with Britain's urgent economic troubles has largely preempted Mrs. Thatcher's more fundamental plans. **********As Alan Greenspan, a top Reagan strategist, observed, ''She has not yet implemented the requirements for reducing the public-sector borrowing requirement (the Government deficit) or, as a consequence, the rise in the money supply, both of which are integral parts of the solution.'' **********When Mrs. Thatcher won office, many Britons, including some who did not particularly like her, regarded the Lincolnshire grocer's daughter as representing the country's ''last chance,'' with failure leading inevitably to a Government headed by left-wing elements of the Labor Party and the virtual end of free enterprise. **********As it happens, Mr. Reagan's election has coincided with the first comprehensive efforts to appraise Mrs. Thatcher's efforts. Her honeymoon is over, and with the economy in deep recession and unemploymemt at the highest levels since the 1930's, there are many who see in Britain a discrediting of conservative policies. Public-Sector Wage Rises **********Reagan advisers here, when asked what they have learned, invariably start by observing that while Mrs. Thatcher is being pilloried for supposedly imposing savage spending cuts and iron-fisted monetary control, she has actually carried out nothing of the kind. In fact, during her tenure, Government spending and borrowing have raced ahead, and the money supply has climbed even faster than the doubledigit inflation rate. **********But even in theory, much less in practice, Mrs. Thatcher's strategy appears less daring than that discussed by Mr. Reagan.  Although she did plan substantial tax cuts, now largely deferred, to spur incentives, Mrs. Thatcher's Government has not subscribed to the supply-side economics of Mr. Stockman, Representative Jack Kemp and Senator William V. Roth. **********As Mr. Greenspan and others see it, the trouble is not with Mrs.  Thatcher's prescription; it is that she has yet to administer the medicine. **********Various explanations have been offered for this failure of execution, including the need to prop up distressed nationalized industries, a problem not shared by the United States, and a decision by Mrs. Thatcher to keep a pledge to give big pay rises to publicsector employees. **********Mrs. Thatcher concedes that her first attempts at budget-cutting were too timid, and this mistake of starting too slowly has made a strong impression on the Reagan team. **********Those who advocate the Kemp-Roth tax plan are less concerned about budget-cutting and deficits. They contend that sharp tax cuts will generate enough additional economic activity to make up the lost revenue quickly. **********Some say the British experience has provided a reverse confirmation of the Kemp-Roth thesis. As the British economy slumped, business subsidies, unemployment payments and other Government payments have risen while tax revenue declined, thereby adding to the deficit. Much the same has happened in the United States. **********''The fatal mistake,'' ventured John D. Mueller, an aide to Representative Kemp, ''was for the British to cut back on the incentive side and hope budget austerity would get them through.'' **********Another error ascribed to Mrs. Thatcher is her preaching of sacrifice while the average Briton's income was still rising - resulting in a loss of credibility. According to the Reagan ''supplysiders,'' people's expectations are so important to curbing inflation that an erosion of public confidence that things are on course makes it harder, for example, to persuade workers to accept moderate wage increases. **********It is not overlooked here, however, that some things are now going Mrs. Thatcher's way. The balance of payments has swung into hefty surplus, and the inflation rate, though much higher than when she came to office, has come down rapidly of late, to just over 15 percent. **********And the widespread distress in the corporate sector does seem to be forcing it to become more efficient."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/28/business/company-news-conoco-to-close-minnesota-refinery.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company News; Conoco to Close Minnesota Refinery", "print_headline": "Company News; Conoco to Close Minnesota Refinery", "body_text": " **********Conoco Inc., the nation's ninthlargest refiner, said it would close its refinery in Wrenshall, because of sharply reduced demand for petroleum products and an excess of refining capacity in the industry. **********The action by the Stamford, Conn., company follows similar closures in the past three weeks by Mobil, Texaco, Gulf Oil and Standard Oil (Indiana. **********Conoco said the refinery was operating at only 50 percent of capacity and provided about 5 percent of its total supplies.

Virginia Scherr, his wife, runs a business that processes hospital medical records for physicians. She has 47 employees and an office in a converted garage. The Scherrs have three teen-age sons. **********That would be quite enough for most people, but not the Scherrs.  They have lived for 20 years on City Island, that boat-infested spit of land jutting into Long Island Sound from the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx. Their comfortable house on the island's east shore overlooks Hart Island and the distant King's Point section of Long Island. **********An irresistible compulsion led them two years ago to purchase an oversized 1898 house at 33 Tier Street, with the intention of renting it out on a year-round basis. The house was not the only attraction.  The property is 100 feet wide and runs back 400 feet to the water, from which there is a splendid view of the Harlem Yacht Club and Sagman's boatyard. **********On the property stood a series of small one-bedroom cottages with shingled roofs. Since the 1950's they had been rented out on a seasonal basis by the owners of the main house, which was itself divided into four apartments. **********Mr. Scherr, as he put it, has ''dabbled in rehabilitation.'' He is a formidable fellow with hammer and saw. His thought was to rehabilitate the buildings and rent them out on a year-round basis. **********But two problems put that idea to rest. The Scherrs decided they would not be able to manage a property with so many tenants. And the cost of rehabilitation could not be recouped from the rents in a reasonable period of time. **********And so the Scherrs find themselves, two years later, as the owners and sponsors of a cooperative conversion project with a total sales offering price of $1.39 million. With themselves as the general contractors, they have done a total rehabilitation of main house and cottages into up-to-date, year-round housing with a marked California look. **********The main house has been converted into one floor-through and two duplex apartments in which some windows are circular in shape to resemble huge portholes. The cottages, flanking a winding path of newly installed cobblestones, have been imaginatively rebuilt with special touches everywhere. **********They have skylights and large windows oriented toward the water views, open and informal floor layouts, circular stairways, and stained-glass decorative windows. No two houses are exactly alike, but they all have a facade of nutty-brown clear cedar siding.  Kenneth Koons of the Bronx was the architect. **********In all, there are 12 housing units in eight buildings, and offstreet parking for 10 cars. The largest of the cottages has been built up into a two-family house, but most of the cottages are single-family units. Seven of the apartments have been sold and the first buyers will arrive next month. **********An 1,800-square-foot apartment in the large cottage sold first, for $160,000 (excluding the buyers' portion of a $75,000 mortgage allocation for the entire project), the Scherrs said. A waterfront cottage sold for $115,000. Another sold for $110,000 and a third for $105,000. The three apartments in the main house sold for $85,000. **********The entire project was done with subcontractors from the area and bank financing of only $310,000 in a short-term construction loan.  The Scherrs estimated that they put $800,000 to $850,000 into the project, mostly their own capital and personal borrowings. The deeper they got into the project, the more money it turned out they would need. ''The momentum carries you along,'' Mr. Scherr said. **********He managed to squeeze in time at the construction site early weekday mornings and on weekends, meanwhile holding down a full-time job at Ross Roy/ Compton New York Inc. **********From a financial standpoint, the Scherrs are agreed, the project is only partially a success. It will produce a reasonable return on the capital invested but hardly a ''killing,'' they said. About $40,000 was spent in correcting what they came to consider construction errors. **********But it certainly was a success in what Mrs. Scherr described as ''an exercise in tolerance.'' Every step of the way the Scherrs had disagreements - over how to lay out the apartments, how many to build, how to treat the exteriors, how to price them. Mr. Scherr had firm ideas on the construction. ''They would build the walls in the morning,'' Mrs. Scherr said, ''and I would come in the afternoon and have them tear them down.'' **********Mrs. Scherr, it seems, wanted to spend more, do more and charge more. Mr. Scherr felt it necessary to heed the prices recently obtained in City Island sales and not make the job so expensive that sales might be imperiled. **********''We disagreed on everything,'' Mrs. Scherr said, but not on the absorbing interest of real estate development. She intends to pursue condominium conversions of commercial property independently, and he is already involved in a joint venture with a contractor aimed at creating 90 new condominium apartments in City Island."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/17/business/gateway-industries-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GATEWAY INDUSTRIES reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "GATEWAY INDUSTRIES reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/09/business/patents-oral-composition-devised-to-treat-hemorrhoids.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1981-05-09", "snippet": "A composition for treatment of hemorrhoids by oral administration was patented this week by Joseph S.

For Mr. Desmarais, the head of and largest shareholder in the Power Corporation, a large holding company, has acquired almost 5 percent of Canadian Pacific with an option to buy another 5.6 percent. **********The moves have excited talk in Canadian corporate circles that this country could be on the verge of witnessing the largest corporate takeover in its history, an estimated $3 billion effort to own a sprawling corporate giant with vast North American holdings in ships, planes, trains, trucks, hotels, steel mills, paper plants, mines, forests, oil, agriculture, real estate and even chinaware. **********Vulnerable to a Takeover **********In an age of takeovers, Canadian Pacific has appeared incr easingly vulnerable.

Its rails were to be used to link Canada's isolated population into one nation. **********Sometimes loved, sometimes hated, but never forgotten, Canadian Pacific Ltd. grew to become Canada's largest non-Government company, consisting of 110 companies and 110,000 employees. In 1980 it reported final consolidated net income of $583.1 million, or $8.11 a share, on revenues of $9.98 billion, compared with a 1979 net of $508 million, or $7.06 a share, on revenues of $8.18 billion. Six-Month Net Declines **********But in the six months ended last June 30, the company's earnings have fallen slightly, mainly because of disappointing second-quarter results in CP Air, CP Ships and CP Enterprises Ltd., its nontransportation investment arm that has moved aggressively into the United States recently. **********CP Enterprises' holdings include Pancanadian Petroleum; Cominco Ltd.; Great Lakes Forest Products; Marathon Realty; CP Hotels; Syracuse China; Chateau Insurance; Algoma Steel; Dominion Bridge, now called AMCA International, and the Canadian properties of International Paper, acquired in July. **********CP Entreprises is run by Ian D. Sinclair, the blunt, brash 67-year-old business executive who gave up his chairmanship of the parent company in May, marking what many consider to be the end of an era when one man ran Canadian Pacific's entire empire. **********Mr. Sinclair is a friend of Mr. Desmarais, part of the fraternity of clans that controls Canadian business. Both companies have their headquarters in Montreal. Both men have also heard the rumors of a brewing takeover of Canadian Pacific by one of the financial forces in Canada. **********Names of prospective bidders mentioned by analysts include the British Columbia Resource Investment Corporation; the Alberta Heritage Trust Fund, the multibillion-dollar repository of much of that province's growing oil royalties; the Nova Corporation, formerly the Alberta Gas Trunk Line, and even the newly merged Hiram Walker-Consumers Gas entity. Seagram Activity **********The Seagram Company was also prominently mentioned when large blocs of Canadian Pacific stock traded early this summer. ''They'd buy around $50, back off when it rose to $52 or $53,'' one broker said, ''and then come in like gangbusters when CP fell to $49.'' **********Actually, the purchaser was Cadillac Fairview Ltd, the real estate company largely controlled by Cemp Investments. That company is an arm of the Bronfman family, which controls Seagram's. Cadillac Fairview took its 4.4 percent share of Canadian Pacific, some 3.7 million shares, to Mr. Desmarais, who paid $174 million. **********''Without talking to each other,'' Mr. Schulman said, ''these business families all think alike. They know the rules, the rumors, the goals of others. Cemp led the signals. They had some spare cash to fool with. So they assembled the bloc and went to Paul and made a deal. That's the way these things get started.'' **********Mr. Desmarais says he is simply making an investment in Canadian Pacific. But at the same time he sold for $195 million his transportation subsidiary - Canadian Steamship Lines, Canadian Shipbulding & Engineering, Kingsway Transport (trucking) and Voyageur Enterprises (buses) -which frees his company from possible conflicts with parallel Canadian Pacific interests. **********He also arranged an option to buy another 4 million shares, or 5.6 percent, of Canadian Pacific for $216 million from the Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, the provincial pension fund manager.  Today, the Power Corporation announced that it had let that option expire without taking action, at least for the moment. Swap Called Possible **********A takeover of Canadian Pacific, especially by interests that might move its headquarters out of troubled Quebec, appears disas trous to many in Quebec. Analysts note that Mr. Desmar ais is a Quebecer with family ties to the federal Cabinet. He owns a lmost 40 percent of Consolidated-Bathurst, the paper company in Q uebec, where the provincial government and Caisse want to incr ease their resource holdings. A swap might be made, analysts say. **********They also note that Mr. Desmarais's remaining holdings - Great West Life Assurance, Montreal Trust and Investors Syndicate, a mutual fund - would fit nicely with the Canadian Pacific family and that the Power Corporation's units co uld borrow upward of $500 million. That would be suff icient for more than 20 percent of Canadian Pacific and effective con trol. **********The Power Corporation reported six-month earnings ending June 30 of $48.5 million, or $1.88 a share, on revenues of $197.4 million, compared with earnings of $47.6 million, or $1.85 a share, on revenues of $155.7 million in 1979. **********Mr. Desmarais has been an innovative entrepreneur, who has always sought control. ''Desmarais didn't buy CP at $54 just for its $1.90 dividend, a 3.5 percent yield,'' Mr. Schulman said. Canadian Pacific closed yesterday at 43 5/8, down 2 1/2, on the Toronto Stock Exchange. **********Officials at Canadian Pacific have been silent about Mr. Desmarais, which is widely taken as tacit approval. They expect him to join the company's 22-member board next May. Mr. Desmarais says that would be ''nice,'' that he just wants a say in the company and that control is not his goal. **********But others, aware of the binding securities regulations that begin once someone seeks control, remain skeptical."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/30/world/around-the-wolrd-storms-compel-indonesians-to-halt-hunt-for-survivors.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Storms Compel Indonesians To Halt Hunt for Survivors", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WOLRD; Storms Compel Indonesians To Halt Hunt for Survivors", "body_text": " **********Monsoon storms forced the suspension today of the search for nearly 400 people missing from an Indonesian ship that sank in flames in the Java Sea, and officials said it was feared that there were no more survivors. **********''With such bad weather we now have only very little hope to find any more survivors,'' said a spokesman for the search operation for the Tampomas II. **********He said 355 passengers and 25 crewmen were still missing and ''there is little chance they could survive at sea without food or fresh water.''

In the 1970 census its population was said to be 32,000. Now it is somewhere between 166,000, a figure furnished by census officials in Pretoria, and 299,000, a number provided by the Chief Minister of KwaNdebele, Simon Skhosana. **********20 New Families a Day Arrive **********Every day, Mr. Skhosana said in an interview, the South African authorities deposit about 20 families in his state.  They are brought here with their possessions in white government trucks with green canvas tops, having been ordered to leave adjacent rural areas to the south around the Transvaal towns of Bronkhorstspruit, Middelburg and Bethal, which were proclaimed white by South African legislation. **********White politicians have recently become self-conscious about the policy of sorting out the black population on an ethnic basis, but two years ago a junior member of the Government declared that more than 9,000 Ndebele-speaking families had been removed to their supposed homeland in only one year. **********The veld in KwaNdebele is now covered with widening patches of mudand-thatch hovels, metal shanties and green canvas tents that are standard government issue for resettlement sites. **********The only visible industry is the government of this new black state. The only housing programs are for Mr. Skhosana and his ministers, who live side by side in small ranch-style structures behind a high barbed-wire fence, and for government employees, who are given simple cinderblock homes with small solar-heating devices atop the bathrooms. Few Buildings of Significance **********If there is any building that is plainly worth more than the car parked in the Chief Minister's driveway - a BMW sedan that sells for $35,000 in South Africa - it is the gymnasium-style structure that houses an appointed legislature. **********Elsewhere in KwaNdebele, which lies astride the upper Olifants River, agriculture is in decline because the growing population is taking over the grazing land and competing for the water, which is in short supply. There are no jobs in commuting distance. Most ablebodied men end up working in Pretoria, 60 miles away along a dirt road with occasional bus service. Those who are conscientious return on weekends. **********KwaNdebele's newest settlements have the appearance of unplanned squatter camps but, under the supervision of white officials from the Ministry of Cooperation and Development, little stakes have been driven into the hillsides every 60 feet or so to indicate the plots that can be allotted to new arrivals. Shanties on a Former White Farm **********The Nduli family got theirs on what was an empty hillside on a farm that had belonged to a white family named Smit in an area known as Kwaggafontein, 10 miles from here. Now there are scores of shanties and hundreds of people, mostly women and children. **********Kleinbooi Nduli, the youngest of Rose Nduli's three grown sons, arrived on a truck with the family's possessions, which were now stacked inside and around a thatch hovel that was serving as a shelter until the oldest brother, Johannes, could return from Pretoria with metal siding to make a shack. **********Kleinbooi Nduli wore a brown shoe on his right foot and a black boot on his left; the boot was tied with bits of copper electrical wire. With a shovel he dug away at the veld grass to clear his plot. **********Until he was abruptly told that his services had been terminated, he was living on a white farm near Middelburg with his brother's wife and three children, his sister and her child and his mother. His brother Johannes and another brother, Paulus, worked as laborers in a construction gang in Pretoria, earning about $50 a week each, much more than the $34 a month the farmer had paid Kleinbooi. **********Kleinbooi Nduli was asked whether he minded being forced out of a job in Middelburg. He laughed in embarrassment and said the farmer had sometimes hit him. His mother was more direct. **********''The law is the law and we have nothing to say about it,'' she said in a matter-of-fact tone. Forced to Move Three Times **********Jim Masetlana, an old-timer at Kwaggafontein, having been deposited here in March, was matter-of-fact but also angry. He had been forced to move three times in 19 years, from one township to another, as the black settlements outside the white South African cities are called. **********Asked whether it mattered that he had finally come to reside in a homeland, he replied sharply, waving his hand at the encampment on the hillside. **********''This is no homeland,'' he said. ''It's just a township. Where I grew up was really a homeland. I had land. I could plough, Even the white farmers give you land to plough. This type of homeland I've never seen.'' **********Chief Minister Skhosana, who once worked as a driver in Johannesburg, laughed when he was asked whether he had asked the white authorities to stop bringing new people into his state. **********''It's impossible,'' he said, meaning apparently that it would have no effect.

''And I just heard of two sales at $2,000 a square foot! The market is overheated.'' **********What will happen, he wondered aloud, if inflationary expectations subside? Will those who are paying $2,000 a square foot for land, who are perhaps paying 20 percent or more for interim financing and who face greatly increased costs for the numerous nonconstruction services associated with new development decide not to go forward after all? **********''If you start building today, you've got to get average rents of $50 to $60 a square foot,'' the developer said. Space in new east midtown buildings is currently said to be commanding rents of $35 to $45 a square foot per year. Recent leases in the General Motors Building and the Pan Am Building are reported to have been written at more than $50 a square foot. **********But the figures do not show the extent of leasing activity at that rent level, and the developer confessed he was uneasy. People going ahead with new projects are ''counting on inflation to bail them out,'' he said. **********How broad will the market be for space at the new east midtown rents? ''Already we are beginning to find resistance to the rents between Third Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas,'' the builder said. **********Leasing brokers confirm that many tenants are leaving the east midtown area rather than pay rents that are $20 a square foot higher than they had paid on expiring leases. The departures are often companies that use perhaps 10,000 to 30,000 square feet of space, while big law firms, accounting firms and corporate headquarters have usually stayed and accepted the higher rents. **********John L. Dowling, executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield Inc., identified the departing tenants as service firms - among them advertisers, publishers and public relations concerns - that cannot easily pass on their sharply increased rent costs. The rent resistance has not caused a weakening in rent levels, the brokers say. But leasing activity in the early part of this year subsided from what one broker, Edward S. Gordon, called last year's ''frenzy.'' **********A large body of office tenants, still comfortable with older leases made at perhaps $10 to $13 a square foot, have ''not had to face the music yet,'' Mr. Dowling said. Average rents in one group of east midtown buildings stand at $16 a square foot, for example. **********S. Donald Friedman, executive vice president of Huberth & Huberth, gave an example of how one east midtown service firm was responding.  It has a lease east of Madison Avenue in the 50's at $13 a square foot. The lease has five more years to run. **********The space can command $35 a square foot. The firm has put it on the market for sublet and is moving into 50,000 square feet in a loft building south of 34th Street at $10 a square foot ''as is.'' It will spend its own money to renovate the new space. **********''The tenant in 10,000 to 30,000 square feet is resisting the new high rents,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''They are finding space in the 'marginal' areas.'' **********Accordingly, the ''marginal'' areas are gaining new strength. The Park Avenue South area with its side streets from 18th Street north to 33d Street is one example. It was not an office center until recently, but office tenants are replacing manufacturers in some buildings. They pay higher rents than former manufacturing tenants, thus slowing the move toward residential conversion so noticeable in the late 1970's. **********Also benefiting is the Times Square area and Broadway buildings south of 42d Street.  As one developer noted, rents in Manhattan are ''all over the lot.'' **********At 767 Third Avenue, a new building with 250,000 square feet of leasable space that the William Kaufman Organization is producing, Melvyn Kaufman describes most of the incoming tenants as ''squeezeouts.'' It is a 39-story building in which most floors have 6,500 square feet of usable space. There are 20 tenants so far, including governmental missions, advertising agencies, law firms and computer firms, and the building is ''over 75 percent'' rented. The first occupants are supposed to arrive in August. **********The average rents are about $35 a square foot, Mr. Kaufman said.  Leasing began last fall at several dollars a square foot below that and has moved higher. ''But there is a limit to how much a tenant will pay not to be overcrowded,'' he said. **********The rent requirements of the new buildings have had the effect of raising asking rents greatly in older buildings in the vicinity of the new buildings, Mr. Friedman said. ''There's not enough space available for a healthy give and take in negotiation on rents,'' he said. **********In part the current midtown situation was created by the collapse of new production in the mid-1970's. The post-recession buildings are only now becoming ready for occupancy: 4.6 million square feet this year in midtown and 5 million square feet more next year. Several of the buildings will be occupied fully by the corporations building them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/15/world/around-the-world-killing-of-seals-is-protested-in-paris-and-the-hague.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Killing of Seals Is Protested In Paris and The Hague", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Killing of Seals Is Protested In Paris and The Hague", "body_text": " **********About 300 people gathered outside the Canadian Embassy today to protest the killing of baby seals and other furred animals.

Apart from this, however, there seems little to inspire confidence in the 35-page document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********The company states that the equipment it uses will be supplied by others: Inteleplex is not a manufacturer and has no intention of becoming one, the prospectus says. **********The company also states that its contract revenues so far total $160,424. Inteleplex, which is based in Atlantic City, reports a negative net worth. Moreover, as stated in bold type on the cover, Inteleplex securities involve a high degree of risk and the offering means immediate, substantial dilution. **********The million units marketed Wednesday each consisted of one share of common stock and a warrant to buy another share at a unit price of $3. The underwriter said yesterday that the units were fully subscribed and had reached 3 1/4 bid in the aftermarket. **********Inteleplex was founded last February, two months after a similar operation, General Telecommunications Technologies, ceased doing business. G.T.T.'s president, John M. Sues, is now president of Inteleplex. He ceased being president of G.T.T. when it ceased being a company. General Telecommunications owes unspecified sums to creditors, and one major investor failed to recover an investment in the company, the prospectus says. **********Inteleplex states that the creditors and the investor could attempt to assert claims against Inteleplex, though the company is not aware of existing or threatened claims. **********Even so, the company will set aside $250,000 from the proceeds of the offer for ''extraordinary working capital purposes,'' including the defense of any such claims. **********In March the company issued 1.3 million shares to Mr. Sues and to John Voigt, executive vice president, ''in consideration of past services'' to the month-old business. **********That same month, Harold Charno and Marcus Finkle, the latter a director, purchased 306,350 Inteleplex shares for 24 cents each.  In June, Mr. Charno and Mr. Finkle each lent the company $75,000 at an interest rate of 20 percent. The loans were subsequently converted into notes and units at 50 cents a unit. The units are similar to those being offered to the public, though the exercise price on the warrants is $5 a share. **********After the offering, though, the warrant price will be adjusted to $3 a share and the notes will be repaid out of the proceeds.  In September, the company sold $125,000 of 20 percent notes to an Aarnel Funding Corporation defined-contribution pension plan and issued Aarnel 50,000 Inteleplex units at a cent each. The loan is to be paid back out of proceeds of the offering. Moreover, the Aarnel pension plan will receive units worth $150,000 at the proposed offering price - or more than the principal amount of the loan itself. **********Rooney, Pace purchased for $300 a total of 30,000 units as compensation for ''certain financial consulting services'' in the July private placement with Aarnel. Rooney, Pace is also receiving an underwriting fee. **********While there is always hope in a business enterprise such as this, the risk to the investor is heightened by a lack of operating history and Inteleplex's weak financial structure. Moreover, the history includes a chief executive who just discontinued a business in a related field. He will be paid $75,000 a year by Inteleplex. All officers and directors as a group will be paid $280,000 a year. **********Mr. Rooney was reached by telephone and asked about the apparent similarity between Inteleplex and some earlier Muir offerings.

She has analyzed it, and related research, in the July-August issue of Harvard Business Review. **********''That study asked consumers whether they ever wanted to complain about the advertising they saw, and roughly half of them said they thought of complaining,'' she went on, ''although, human nature being what it is, only 8 percent actually did complain.'' **********''When Gallup asked them what it was they wanted to complain about, most of them focused on areas of taste. They said advertising was 'distasteful,' 'offensive,' 'insulting to my intelligence.' '' **********Those findings, she said, give ''further evidence of the importance of the irritation factor in advertising,'' tying in ominously with the results of repeated soundings by William D. Wells, the director or research at Needham Harper & Steers. **********Mrs. Bartos keeps up with that sort of thing in her capacity as J.  Walter Thompson's director of communications development; her job includes following social trends and trying to make links back to advertising and marketing. **********One societal sea change in recent years, she said, has been that the public has become ''increasingly sophisticated and increasingly skeptical -skeptical about all institutions.'' ''And therefore,'' she added, ''they are very sensitive about condescension, stereotyping and so forth.'' **********Understandably, in that climate, Mrs. Bartos ascribes considerable importance to an upward creep in the percentage of Mr. Wells's respondents, in his yearly surveys, who agree with the premise that ''advertising insults my intelligence.'' Sixty-one percent of the men and 60 percent of the women felt that way in 1975, but by last year the figures had risen to 66 and 67 percent, respectively. **********Over the same five years, Mr. Wells's soundings have also traced a decline in consumers' partiality to brand products.

But by last year those percentages had fallen, respectively, to 64 and 56. **********That shrinkage, Mrs. Bartos said, ''is very worrying in view of the fact that we have recently seen the challenge coming from generic, or no-name, brands. After all, the essential role of advertising is to build consumer trust in advertised brands.'' **********Is there a causal relationship between the two trends that Mr.  Wells has traced, Mrs. Bartos was asked. Do irritating advertisements actually diminish peoples' confidence in advertised brands? **********''I personally believe yes,'' she said, citing an earlier survey, sponsored by the American Association of Advertising Agencies, which, she said, suggested ''that when consumers say an advertisement insults their intelligence, or is in poor taste, they may also be challenging the credibility of the advertising message.'' **********''At the moment, this is a hypothesis which has not been proved,'' she continued, ''but I think the inferential data are so strong that it behooves us as an industry to move very cautiously, to consider any action on our part which may be eroding consumers' trust in advertised brands.'' **********Elaborating on that, Mrs. Bartos gave a nod toward the traditional notion that irritating qualities help give advertising impact: ''Now clearly it would be foolhardy for someone in a business to advertise with advertising that doesn't move the public,'' she said, ''But I honestly believe we don't have to insult or alienate our customers in order to persuade them.'' **********What to do? ''I think that, in order to close this credibility gap, or to avoid further erosion, it would be prudent for advertisers to add a dimension to their copy-testing procedures,'' she said, to track the irritation factor.'' **********All right, but what to call the new irritation-factor-tracking technique? The Bartos test?"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/28/business/terramar-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TERRAMAR CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "TERRAMAR CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/05/world/around-the-world-longtime-hanoi-leader-heads-new-presidency.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Longtime Hanoi Leader Heads New Presidency", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Longtime Hanoi Leader Heads New Presidency", "body_text": " **********Truong Chinh, a founding member of the Vietnamese Communist Party who was a rival of Ho Chi Minh for its leadership, was elected leader of Vietnam's new collective presidency today. **********The Hanoi radio announced that the National Assembly had elected Mr. Chinh, 73 years old, to head the five-member State Council, a body with wide powers that replaces the figurehead post of president. **********The other members are Nguyen Huu Tho, Le Thanh Nghi, Chu Huy Man and Xuan Thuy.

In the same period the economy has suffered from increasing trade and budget deficits and rising inflation. **********Mr. Kreisky, who is 71 years old, has served longer than any other Western European head of government, with 11 years behind him in the Ballhaus Palace, where Prince Metternich once ruled. In a career as a Social Democratic politician spanning half a century, Mr. Kreisky has achieved a renown that reaches well beyond Austria. **********He now relishes his role as an occasional middleman between East and West and, more recently, between North and South, as diplomats refer to the industrialized and developing countries. **********Last month, however, ill health prevented him from attending the Cancun, Mexico, conference of rich and poor nations, of which he was a principal architect. In a meeting with foreign journalists last week, Mr. Kreisky acknowledged that it was not always possible to square the circle between North and South and East and West. **********He said he had tried hard and failed to persuade the Soviet Government to send a high-level delegation to Cancun. He said the absence of the Russians ''was a great political error, although it is not my job to instruct them.'' **********Mr. Kreisky spoke of himself as ''Austrocentric'' in his internationalism. ''I would say that the epoch of detente,'' he said, ''began in essence with the Austrian state treaty'' of 1955, under which 100,000 Soviet and Western occupation troops were withdrawn and independence was achieved. **********''The 25 years without a war, without intervention, without pressure have been such a blessing for this country,'' he said. ''I'm a star witness for the fact that in these 25 years there were no interventions. That's true for us and is true more or less for all the frontline countries in Europe - Swedes, Norwegians, Finns, Austrians and Yugoslavs.'' **********It is generally believed here that Mr. Kreisky's reputation as an international middleman and spokesman for cooperation across ideological lines is what has kept him in office so long and makes him popular today among a majority of Austrians. **********They affectionately call him ''Kaiser Bruno,'' as if he were the heir of the Hapsburg emperors, and they gave him a comfortable 51 percent majority in a four-way race in the last federal election, in 1979. **********But the economy is limping, with inflation running at 6.9 percent, a trade deficit of $6 billion, a projected budget deficit of $4 billion and creeping unemployment in stagnant state-owned industries such as steel. Some Austrians believe that a worsening of the economy could force elections before the scheduled date, in the spring of 1983. **********Meanwhile, many Austrians have begun to worry about what would confront them when Mr. Kreisky is no longer around.  In the event that the Chancellor must step down, politicians here now expect that he would pass the baton to Deputy Chancellor Fred Sinowatz, a 52-year-old son of a worker family from Burgenland in easternmost Austria. **********Mr. Sinowatz, who has been Education Minister since 1971, was described as ''the reserve Chancellor'' in a cover story this week in Profil, a widely read conservative magazine that has no particular affection for Social Democrats. The magazine said previous Socialist pretenders to the chancellorship, Poldi Gratz and Hannes Androsch, had already canceled each other out. **********Although Mr. Sinowatz lacks Mr. Kreisky's international connections and experience, many politicians in the Government and the opposition plainly regard him as steady and sturdy enough to take over if called."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/21/business/bayuk-cigars-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-26.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BAYUK CIGARS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 26", "print_headline": "BAYUK CIGARS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 26", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/29/world/around-the-world-faction-in-polish-party-will-monitor-big-meeting.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 82, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Faction in Polish Party Will Monitor Big Meeting", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Faction in Polish Party Will Monitor Big Meeting", "body_text": " **********Some Communist Party members have set up an unusual system to monitor the deliberations of a Central Committee meeting tomorrow and relay the information to party members throughout Poland. **********Communists who seek to democratize the party demanded that the meeting be televised.

But this is only because of a huge investment write-off and the halting of routes to Singapore and Dallas, which had been losing money. **********French Transport Minister Daniel Hoeffel, saying France ''will not and cannot abandon Concorde,'' signed a new agreement with Air France this week. The French Government, which with Britain had spent more than $2 billion developing the world's first supersonic passenger aircraft, will pay 90 percent of the plane's estimated operating losses for the next three years, compared with 70 percent in the past. **********Under the new pact, the French taxpayer will contribute $66 million this year to the cost of Air France's champagne-and-caviar service linking Paris with New York, Washington, Caracas and Rio de Janeiro.  In 1982, when losses are expected to decline slightly, the subsidy will be about $64 million, and in 1983, $59 million. **********Defending the decision to keep Concorde flying despite its high consumption of costly fuel and declining demand for air service, Mr.  Hoeffel argued that two-thirds of the subsidy promised to Air France represented the cost of amortizing its seven airliners and would have to be paid in any event. **********Any further increase in Concorde fares, which are generally about 30 percent above normal first-class rates, would only drive away passengers and increase losses, he said. A one-way Concorde fare between New York and Paris is $1,526. **********Nevertheless, the Government's plan to continue subsidizing the Concorde was attacked by many members of Parliament during discussions on next year's budget a few weeks ago. **********The Government's decision represents a considerable victory for Air France, which in an unusual display of independence for a French state industry had threatened to stop service a few years ago unless its losses were subsidized. The Government insisted that Air France continue flying the Concorde, which it sees as a symbol of French prestige and engineering excellence, and agreed to foot most of the bill. British Also Subsidize Flights **********Britain has also effectively agreed to subsidize British Airways' Concorde flights by allowing the state-owned airline to write off the capital costs of its six planes as well as stocks of spare parts, at a total cost to the taxpayer of about $400 million. As a result of this, and after the halting last fall of unprofitable routes, British Airways says its service from London to New York and Washington is making money. **********Before these latest subsidies, Britain and France had also agreed not to charge airlines that want to buy the planes for the roughly $2 billion in research and development costs paid by the two Governments before the airliner was built. Air France and British Airways are the only lines that have bought the Concorde so far and, with skyrocketing fuel costs and mounting operating losses, the consortium of British and French Government-owned aircraft manufacturers that built the plane has given up hope of other orders. **********Although Air France sold, on average, 70 percent of the seats on its Concorde run from Paris to New York last year, the load factor was 55 percent on the Rio de Janeiro run, 45 percent between Paris and Washington and 36 percent on the route to Caracas. British Airways' Concordes were 75 percent full between London and New York and 55 percent full on the London-Washington route."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/04/business/economic-scene-reagan-policy-protests-grow.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1981-12-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 750, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; Reagan Policy: Protests Grow", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; Reagan Policy: Protests Grow", "body_text": " **********THE worsening recession, combined with the Reagan Administration's ''new federalism,'' is intensifying the economic and financial pressure on the nation's cities and states. At this week's conference of the National League of Cities, one conservative Republican, Gov.  Richard A. Snelling of Vermont, warned that the President's program was leading the nation toward ''an economic Bay of Pigs.'' **********The protests of mayors and governors, including even those with reputations for preaching and practicing fiscal austerity, reflect the deterioration of the financial position of many states and localities. **********The Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, which has never been accused of advocating ''bleeding heart'' or spendthrift liberalism, has warned in its November Survey that people and businesses all over the country are going to feel pain as local budget problems force cuts in spending, along with higher taxes. **********The prospect of widespread deficits at the state and local level, which Morgan estimates will total $5 billion in 1982, has already had a depressing effect on municipal bond markets. **********Concern about the ability of cities and states to meet their costs drove yields on municipal bonds to record highs this year. The Bond Buyer's index of municipal yields reached a peak of 13.2 percent in early September. **********The financial squeeze could injure the American economy's ability to withstand a sharp downswing, Morgan warns. In earlier postwar downturns, state and local fiscal actions have been a countercyclical force as welfare and unemployment payments rose while income and sales tax collections dropped. But in the current slump, cuts in spending and increases in taxes are likely to aggravate the recession. Hard-pressed state and local governments, unlike the Federal Government, have no alternative to cutting spending and raising taxes, lest they be forced into bankruptcy. **********The recession is also stirring up strong opposition to the President's policies among labor leaders; workers anxious about their jobs; Social Security pensioners; farmers; religious leaders (such as the Christians and Jews from Baltimore who denounced the Administration's economic and defense programs this week as creating ''misery at home''), and voters generally who, according to public opinion polls, are growing increasingly critical of the President's ability to manage the economy. **********Mr. Reagan has been hustling to put out these fires - lest they become a general conflagration -by dropping in on the White House Conference on the Aging to make a speech; sending forth aides as peace doves to the mayors, the governors and the farmers, and inviting the labor leaders to the White House for some personal stroking. **********He hopes to soothe his critics without making significant changes in his economic policies, while offering symbolic gestures, like a willingness to consider the plight of the air traffic controllers. **********However, an unappeased Lane Kirkland, president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, emerged from the White House meeting with the President on Wednesday and said icily that the Administration's economic policies had produced ''excessive and mounting unemployment and the waste of resources resulting from the deepening recession.'' Mr. Kirkland said he had urged a ''strong antirecession program'' upon the President but ''deep principled differences'' still separated labor and the White House. **********But deep principles do not divide all labor leaders from the President. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, who supported Mr. Reagan's election last year, came out of the White House Tuesday with a lot more to show than the A.F.L.-C.I.O.: the President's opposition to trucking deregulation. **********The teamsters' delegation to the White House was led by their president, Ray Williams, who was indicted last May in Chicago for attempting to bribe Senator Howard W. Cannon, a Nevada Democrat, to gain votes against trucking deregulation. The Administration, a White House spokesman indicated, remains strongly opposed to Government regulations in general, but will handle deregulation on a ''case-by-case'' basis. **********However, Mr. Reagan shows no signs of compromising on macroeconomic policy to arrest the recession and rising unemployment. Having made inflation his main target, Mr. Reagan seems determined to slug it out with existing fiscal and monetary policy, despite the complaints of various interest groups, including business groups such as builders and auto dealers frightened of their own prospects. **********One interest group that could give him a much harder time if the recession drags on would be the Republicans in Congress, worrying about next year's election.

Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson said on television that there was no reason to doubt that the Iranians would keep their word and allow the departure of the French on two Iran Airlines flights, one on Monday and the other on Wednesday. **********''We have more than one reason for thinking that this will be carried out,'' Mr. Cheysson said. He did not say what the reasons were, but he stressed that the Iranians had been cooperative in their most recent talks with the French Ambassador, Guy Georgy, and a special envoy, Paul Depis. **********Privately, officials said they had no way of telling what would happen. One official said yesterday that there were signs of disagreement among the Iranians as to what to do, which also marked their handling of the 52 American hostages who were held for 444 days, Mixed Signals From Iran **********The signals out of Teheran were mixed. The Teheran radio, while denouncing the French as imperialists, stressed that the French in Iran were guests. But the radio quoted Ayatollah Meshkini, a leading clergyman in the city of Qum, as threatening reprisals against the French if France did not return former President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr and Massoud Rajavi, a leftist guerrilla leader, who were recently granted asylum here. The French in Iran, the Ayatollah was reported as saying, would suffer the same fate as the American hostages. **********A Foreign Ministry spokesman here said there was no reason to believe that Iran would link the extradition of Mr. Bani-Sadr and Mr. Rajavi with the departure of the French, who were urged to leave by President Francois Mitterrand because of growing anti-French sentiment in Iran. **********Iran has presented a formal extradition request to Ambassador Georgy, but it is being held up in Teheran along with Mr. Georgy and his 115 compatriots. France takes a strong position on granting asylum to political exiles, and there seems to be virtually no chance that the two men will be extradited. **********Mr. Bani-Sadr is not making things easy for his hosts, however.  Last night two Foreign Ministry officials went to his residence at Auvers-sur-Oise outside Paris to reiterate an official warning that the exiled leader must make no statements to the press. French Barred Interviews **********When Mr. Bani-Sadr and Mr. Rajavi flew here on a commandeered Iranian Air Force plane nine days ago, the French insisted as a condition for granting asylum that they give no interviews on political subjects. A flurry of interviews ensued, and officials were sent to try to stop the flow. **********Mr. Bani-Sadr has been silent for the last few days, but last night's visit was prompted by his renewed offers to talk to the press. **********Short of delivering up the exiles, the French have made an effort to appear conciliatory. Three corvettes, built here for the Iranian Government but embargoed during the American hostage crisis, which ended in January, were released for delivery this week. Today, the plane commandeered by Mr. Bani-Sadr and Mr. Rajavi flew back to Iran from Evreux Air Force base, where it landed July 29. **********Foreign Minister Cheysson said the release of the ships and the plane was a ''normal'' step and not related to the crisis.  Nevertheless, the moves were interpreted here as an effort to make it easier for the Iranian authorities to keep their promise. No Signs of Use of Force **********There are no signs of any significant contingency planning for the use of force to free the French if they are kept as hostages. An official here said there had been no discussion of such a thing and indicated that it did not seem feasible. **********The nearest French intervention force is stationed in Djibouti, 2,000 miles from Teheran. Apart from the distance, the official said, a commando operation was a poor way to get a large number of people out alive from what presumably would be scattered locations. **********If there is any strength that the French are counting on, it is political. As they see it, the logical interest of the Iranian Government is to preserve its ties with a Western European nation that is in a position to help it and that is governed by a Socialist President who is committed to taking a sympathetic attitude to revolutionary aspirations in the third world."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/15/business/other-business-the-penny-stock-excahnge.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 403, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE PENNY STOCK EXCAHNGE", "print_headline": "OTHER BUSINESS; THE PENNY STOCK EXCAHNGE", "body_text": " **********The Denver Stock Exchange has not a single floor broker.

Stiegelmeier, 49 years old, a former financial consultant and the newsletter's publisher, ''I've been aware there was no clearing house, no medium for the distribution for news about Denver over-the-counter companies.

Regan said today that the Administration was considering increases in the excise taxes on liquor and tobacco, adding another set of items to a growing list of revenue-producing proposals intended to help reduce the budget deficit. **********''Its an obvious area for us to look at; it's a painless way,'' Mr. Regan said in a speech here to the American Business Conference, a recently organized group of growth-oriented businesses. ''So that is a possibility; we are looking at all types of things.'' **********But he added that no decision had been made and no package had been presented to President Reagan. **********Proposal 'Floating Around' **********Some Treasury Department sources said that the Administration was also considering the possibility of some sort of curb on the present tax deductibility of interest on consumer installment credit, excluding mortgages and auto loans. But a Treasury spokesman, Marling Fitzwater, said that, while a proposal had been ''floating around,'' the department was not considering such a change now. **********The effort to increase tax revenue reflects the realization on Capitol Hill and in the Administration that, even with huge budget cuts in the next two years, additional revenue would be needed if the budget deficit was to be eliminated by 1984. **********At the same time, the Administration is insisting that there be no reduction or delay in the 25 percent cut in individual income taxes over three years enacted by Congress this summer. The first phase of the tax cut, a 5 percent reduction, went into effect on Oct. 1. **********Secretary Regan repeated his pledge that the Administration would not support any delay or reduction in its three-year tax cut.  ''Without the tax cuts,'' he said, ''you don't get the economic recovery; you shoot yourself in the foot.'' **********''The right solution is the hard solution - to cut the budget,'' he added. New Cuts Were Proposed **********As part of a new effort to balance the budget, the President proposed in September a new series of budget cuts and also proposals to increase tax revenues by $3 billion through such measures as restricting energy tax credits, taxing payments to private contractors for Federal projects in progress and curbing tax exemptions on industrial revenue bonds. **********Mr. Regan said today that, while he had promised to present a package to Congress this week, that date would now ''have to slip a bit.'' **********Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have been talking about doubling the excise taxes on liquor and tobacco. The present excise tax on cigarettes is 8 cents a pack. The present tax on a barrel of beer is $9 and, on a gallon of distilled spirits, it is $10.50. If the current excise taxes on cigarettes, liquor, beer and wine were doubled, Treasury figures show, the new revenue raised would amount to about $3 billion in 1982. Questioned on Impact Dilution **********Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, at a news conference before his speech to the business conference, was asked if increases in excise taxes would dilute the impact of the Administration's tax cuts. **********Mr. Weidenbaum said that such increases would be small in comparison with the Administration's tax cuts and asserted that, over all, ''this will continue to be an unprecedented program of tax relief.'' **********Members of the business conference, who met with President Reagan at the White House, generally voiced strong support for the President's economic program. Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the conference and chairman of the American Stock Exchange, said that the Administration should ''very carefully consider every source of revenue'' in an effort to reduce the budget deficit now and in the future. **********In an earlier appearance before the conference, Senator Ernest F.  Hollings of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, said the President's tax cut would have to be reduced because the country was staring at a $100 billion budget deficit in 1984 that could not be wiped out just with budget cuts. Satisfied With Reserve's Policy **********In answer to questions from business executives and reporters after his appearance, Mr. Regan said that he now was satisfied with the Federal Reserve's present monetary policy. The statement was the first by the Secretary accepting the current growth rate in the money supply. Since August he had criticized the Federal Reserve for being too restrictive and not permitting M-1B, the measure of currency and all checking account deposits, to grow fast enough. **********''The Fed is trying to do the right thing but they are not getting the kind of response they anticipated,'' Mr. Regan said, adding that the Federal Reserve's current growth pattern ''is agreeable to us.'' **********In his speech to the conference, Mr. Weidenbaum said that the economy had fallen into a ''mild'' recession, as the President said Sunday, and that the unemployment rate would rise ''to the neighborhood of 8 percent'' in the immediate future. The unemployment rate in September was 7.5 percent. **********But he argued that the President's tax cuts in October and next July, the expected increases in defense spending and a hoped for drop in interest rates meant that ''there are powerful forces already at work to reverse current areas of weakness in a timely fashion.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/01/business/management-assistance-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-march-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE INC reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "print_headline": "MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE INC reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/14/business/stocks-drop-as-trading-slows.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1981-01-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 506, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STOCKS DROP AS TRADING SLOWS", "print_headline": "STOCKS DROP AS TRADING SLOWS", "body_text": " **********Selected natural resource issues advanced yesterday, while stock prices generally edged lower as trading contracted.

After displaying weakness, bond prices improved slightly late yesterday following the announcement of a 1.3 percent drop in the nation's retail sales for December. **********Signs of a slumping economy, analysts explained, were generally regarded as bullish for the bond market, partly because of lower credit demand. **********Meanwhile, Alan C.

It is a great company, and we would have loved to have been a part of it.'' **********Whether Corning would have been able to com plete a merger, even with Owens-Corning's support, is unclear. Cor ning faces an October 1986 deadline for disposing of 90 percent of its interest under the revised terms of a consent decree entered int o in 1949 in response toan antitrust complaint. The disposal date was set when the decree wasamended in 1978. **********The decree had prevented Corning from exercising any voice in the affairs of Owens-Corning or having representation on its board of directors. Premium Price Expected **********James Burt, Corning's vice president of investor relations, said that the company had proceeded with preliminary merger discussions after talks with the Department of Justice indicated that the decree would not necessarily bar a merger. **********Apparently because arbitragers now expect a takeover, Owens-Corning shares rose $1.75, to close at $26.625 a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange following the announcement. At that price, the sale would be worth $195 million. Most analysts, however, expect Corning to command a premium price for its 7,332,575 shares, increasing the value of the sale, because the shares can easily be expanded into a controlling interest. **********The sale would result in a large capital gain for Corning, which carries the value of its Owens-Corning interest on its books at $2.2 million. **********Corning's announcement was a bit of a surprise. Corning had been expected to meet the terms of the amended consent decree by exchanging its Owens-Corning shares for Corning stock in a tax-free transaction. That was the strategy employed by Owens-Illinois Inc.  when it liquidated its remaining interest in 1973, 21 years after the joint venture went public. **********Mr. Burt confirmed that Corning may well return to the stock swap approach if Lazard Freres & Company, its adviser for the sale, cannot come up with a buyer or group of buyers willing to pay the premium Corning seeks during the next few months. ''It depends on what is best for our shareholders,'' he said. Corning's Aggressive Course **********Analysts took the move as another in a string of recent indications that Corning's management was on an aggressive course aimed at marshalling the company's resources to exploit its technological strength in several fast-developing businesses. The 130-year-old company has a pivotal position in the burgeoning fiber optics industry, whi ch is providing telephone companies with the materials they need to transmit messages with lasers. **********Corning also has a growing stake in biotechnology and a wellestablished reputation as the world's leading specialty glass producer. **********''In exposing Owens-Corning to a takeover bid, they have done something that some people might not think was nice,'' said Mark Hassenberg, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ''It has not been their style in the past, but it shows a concern for maximizing their potential.'' **********The stock market apparently agreed. Corning's shares rose $1.75, to close at $55.50 on the New York Stock Exchange following the announcement. **********Some analysts have their doubts that Corning will find a buyer.  Although Owens-Corning is expected to show dramatic earnings gains when the economy picks up, earnings this year are projected at just $2.50 a share, and the company is a defendant in thousands of asbestos lawsuits. In addition, the stock's 26 5/8 finish yesterday was above the company's 1980 book value per share. Analyst Doubts Takeover **********''It seems unlikely to me that any company would want to buy into the aggravation and potential liability at these prices,'' said Timothy Jones, who follows Owens-Corning for Dean Witter Reynolds. **********''I expect that if there is any action, it will be quick,'' said Brian Fernandez, an analyst who follows Corning for First Manhattan.  Corning earned $124.9 million on sales of $1.53 billion last year.  Corning received $8.2 million in dividends from its Owens-Corning investment. **********Owens-Corning earned $54.3 million on sales of $2.29 billion in 1980."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/19/business/briefs-098860.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 348, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Amax Inc. said that it would receive about $23.5 million in cash from the sale of tax benefits on about $85 million worth of equipment to be leased in accordance with provisions of the Economic Recovery Act of 1981. *********** Anaconda Copper Co., a unit of Atlantic Richfield Co., said that it was suspending copper production at its Carr Fork Mine near Toole, Utah, for about a year, because of a lack of demand. *********** Bass Equity Enterprises said that it and partners had reduced their collective stake in Northwest Energy Co. to 5.8 percent of the cumulative convertible preferred shares, or an investment of $3,285,256. *********** Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. and A.C.L.I.

Sprinkel, saying, ''If it leads to short-run problems, it's well worth the price we're paying.'' **********In Congress, a senior Democrat, Representative Henry S. Reuss of Wisconsin, criticized the board for ''supinely accepting'' Reagan Administration policy advice. Otherwise, however, there was little unfavorable reaction to yesterday's increase in the Federal Reserve discount rate - affecting loans to commercial banks - from 13 percent to a record 14 percent. **********Comments by Mr. Reuss, the chairman of the Joint Economic committee, and by William D. Nordhaus, a Yale economist who was an adviser to President Carter, underscored a fundamental difference in economic policy between the Reagan Administration and the Carter White House. **********Mr. Reuss and Mr. Nordhaus, in separate interviews, both said that inflation is importantly influenced by such forces as oil prices, crop prices, American exports of grain to the Soviet Union and wages, which account for three-fourths of business costs. This was the view of the Carter Administration. **********Mr. Sprinkel, the Treasury's Under Secretary for Monetary Affairs, and other Administration officials have insisted that excessive expansion of the country's money supply by the Federal Reserve is the sole cause of inflation. Conversely, they argue that only steady, unvarying progress toward slower expansion can bring down inflation. 'Offsetting' Benefits **********In a telephone interview, Mr. Sprinkel said that the unswerving trend toward slower monetary growth that he and other Administration officials have urged on the Federal Reserve was likely to cause some slowdown in economic activity - production, jobs, income - for about a half year. But, he said, ''the benefits in the long run'' -the predicted slowing of wage and price inflation - ''are offsetting.'' **********Yesterday's action by a unanimous seven-member Reserve Board raised to 14 percent the interest rate that the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks charge on loans to commercial banks. Because such loans finance a very small fraction of commercial bank lending, the importance of changes in the discount rate is as much symbolic as anything else. **********When such changes follow the trend of money market rates, as occurred yesterday, they are the Federal Reserve's way of signaling that the market is moving in line with official intentions. **********At the White House, the deputy press secretary, Larry Speakes, said in reply to a question: ''We do support the Fed's decision on this.  We feel like it is an essential step that is needed at this time.'' **********Mr. Speakes rebuffed a suggestion that the rise of interest rates in the past several weeks was a vote of no confidence in the Reagan program. Noting that the Congress has yet to vote on the President's budget and tax proposals, Mr. Speakes said, ''Once we do have it in place we're hopeful that these kinds of situations will not occur.'' **********The Fed's action also was endorsed by Murray L. Weidenbaum, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, in a speech in New York City to the Society of American Business and Economic Writers. ''We support the Federal Reserve System's perseverance in restraining excessive money supply growth, notwithstanding any short-term repercussions on interest rates,'' Mr. Weidenbaum said. The text of his speech was released in Washington. 'Sophomoric and a Disaster' **********Mr. Reuss, criticizing the Federal Reserve, said it ''has not had the gumption to assert its independence, stand up on its hind legs and shout from the rooftops that the Reagan economic policy is sophomoric and a disaster.'' Mr. Reuss said the Fed should have retained in 1981 the money growth targets it had in 1980 instead of reducing them. **********Mr. Nordhaus, interviewed by telephone, said he thought that the latest tightening of credit could cause ''a significant, sharp drop'' in economic activity later this year and might drive the annual rate of housing starts below one million units. Mr. Weidenbaum said yesterday that the development of variable rate mortgages would help the housing industry cope with high borrowing costs. **********Charles L. Schultze, who was chief economic adviser to Mr. Carter, said the economy could not achieve the sustained, vigorous growth forecast by the Reagan Administration unless interest rate come down. ''On the other hand,'' Mr. Schultze said, ''you have got to be careful about predicting recession or catastrophe, because the economy has shown surprising resiliency to very high interest rates.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/20/world/visitors-to-iraqi-iranian-front-find-a-stalemated-war-of-artillery-fire.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 485, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VISITORS TO IRAQI-IRANIAN FRONT FIND A STALEMATED WAR OF ARTILLERY FIRE", "print_headline": "VISITORS TO IRAQI-IRANIAN FRONT FIND A STALEMATED WAR OF ARTILLERY FIRE", "body_text": " **********A visit to the Iraqi-occupied Iranian oil port of Khurramshahr has provided new evidence that the war between the two countries continues in stalemate and is being fought largely through exchanges of artillery fire. **********A group of Western correspondents just returned from an escorted tour of the city reported that Iraqi forces there are still being subjected to artillery and mortar bombardment, more than four months after Baghdad announced its capture.

Writing in the 19th century, Ruskin was one of the first, with Marx, to have raised this now-familiar complaint. In the Gothic cathedrals of Europe, Ruskin believed, you can see the glorious fruits of free labor, given freely. What is usually meant by the term craftsmanship is the production of things of high quality; Ruskin makes the crucial point that a thing may also be judged according to the conditions under which it was built. **********Presumably the stonemasons who raised the cathedrals worked only partly for their pay. They were building temples to God. It was the sort of work that gave meaning to life. That's what West and his team of engineers were looking for, I think. They themselves liked to say they didn't work on their machine for money. In the aftermath, some of them felt that they were receiving neither the loot nor the recognition they had earned, and some said they were a little bitter on that score. But when they talked about the project itself, their enthusiasm returned. It lit up their faces. **********Many seemed to want to say that they had participated in something quite out of the ordinary. They'd talk about the virtues of the machine -''We built it right'' - and how quickly they had done it - ''No one ever did it faster; at least, Data General never did'' - and of the experience they had gained - ''Now I can do in two hours what used to take me two days.'' One of the so-called kids - kids no longer, but veterans now - remarked, ''Thi@s'll make my resume look real good.'' But, he quickly added, that wasn't what it was all about. **********Many looked around for words to describe their true reward. They used such phrases as ''self-fulfillment,'' ''a feeling of accomplishment,'' ''self-satisfaction.'' Jim Guyer (one of the Hardy Boys) struggled with those terms awhile with growing impatience. Then he said: ''Look, I don't have to get official recognition for anything I do. Ninety-eight percent of the thrill comes from knowing that the thing you designed works, and works almost the way you expected it would. If that happens, part of you is in that machine.''On this project, he had reached a pinnacle th e day when he finally expunged the ''last known bug'' from the boar d that he'd designed. **********Engineers are supposed to stand among the privileged members of industrial enterprises, but several studies suggest that a fairly large percentage of engineers in America are not content with their jobs. Among the reasons cited are the nature of the jobs themselves and the restrictive ways in which they are managed. Among the terms used to describe their malaise are declining technical challenge; mi@sutilization; limited freedom of action; tight control of working patterns. **********No one who made it through the Eagle project could in fairness have raised such objections. The work was divided, but it was not cut to ribbons. Everyone got responsibility for some important part of the machine, many got to choose their piece, and each portion required more than routine labor. The team's members were manipulated, to be sure, and the unspoken rules of their group were Darwinian, but many of those who made it through declared that they had been given as much freedom as they could have wished for. **********A great deal has been written on the question of how to motivate industrial workers. Presumably such literature arises because so many jobs have been made so trivial that few people can find any meaning at all in them. It may be that techniques of management alone can't cure the problem. But clearly, for even the most potentially interesting jobs to be meaningful, there must be managers who are willing to throw away the management handbooks and take some risks. **********Maybe in the late 1970's designing and debugging a computer was inherently more interesting than most other jobs in industry. But to at least some engineers, at the outset, Eagle appeared to be a fairly uninteresting computer to build. Yet more than two dozen people worked on it overtime, without any real hope of material rewards, for a year and a half; and afterward most of them felt glad. That happened largely because West and the other managers gave them enough freedom to invent, while at the same time guiding them toward success. **********West never passed up an opportunity to add flavor to the project.  He helped to transform a dispute among engineers into a virtual War of the Roses. He created a seemingly endless series of ''brushfires,'' and got his staff charged up about putting them out.  He was always finding romance and excitement in the seemingly ordinary. Engineering is not of necessity a drab, drab world, but you do often sense that engineering teams aspire to a bland uniformity. **********As for West himself, there is no doubt that he had experienced an odd, nervous kind of fun. The circumstances had been propitious.  There was a crisis. Solving it called for unorthodox procedures. He'd found, it seems to me, an opportunity to reconcile for a time two opposite ambitions - one conventional and quantifiable, the other unorthodox and vague. He was back in Cambridge, as it were, singing folk songs, while at the same time putting money on Data General's bottom line. He could be, for a little while, a balladeer of computers. **********''We're building what I thought we could get away with,'' West had said. But Eagle sufficed. ''With this machine we're going way beyond what any one person can do. I always wanted to build something like this.''  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  From ''The Soul of a New Machine'' by Tracy Kidder.

The first pronounced decline in the economic growth of the industrial nations occurred in the 1970's, when rising inflation and the 1974 oil price shock helped shrink the average rate of economic expansion to only 3.5 percent a year from the 5 percent that prevailed in the 1960's. Down to a Lower Plateau **********Now economic growth rates appear to be dropping to a lower plateau, partly as a result of the second oil price shock in 1979-80 but also because of high interest rates. **********The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and most private forecasters now expect that the industrial economies - essentially, the United States, Canada, Western Europe and Japan - will follow the mild contraction in 1980 and probable stagnation this year by growing a paltry 1.5 percent or so on average during 1982. **********If realized, this means that the industrial world's growth will average well below 2 percent a year over the first three years of the 1980's - the worst three-year performance that has been turned in since the start of the 1960's. '1980's Are Opening Badly' **********''The 1980's are opening badly, with another downward lurch in growth and an upward lurch in unemployment,'' said Paul Nield, chief economist at Philips & Drew, a London stock brokerage concern. **********''Sustained growth is getting more difficult to achieve,'' said Ulrich Schroeder, chief economist at the Westdeutsche Landesbank in Dusseldorf. **********The second big decline in growth that began at the start of this decade is intensifying economic and political strains between the industrial nations. David Watt, director of the Royal Institute for International Affairs in London, sees ''a rough ride'' for the industrial allies ''so long as slow growth continues.'' **********With an economic growth rate of roughly 4 percent needed to stop unemployment from rising, the number of jobless in the industrial world rose during the 1970's, to 4.5 percent of the work force compared with 2.7 percent in the previous decade, as measured by the O.E.C.D.'s standardized figures for the 15 biggest countries in the organization, which has 24 members. 26 Million Jobless in 1982 **********As the 1980's unfold, unemployment in the industrial world is climbing steadily higher by roughly half a percentage point a year, rising from 6.3 percent of the work force in 1980 to 7 percent this year and probably 7.5 percent in 1982, meaning 26 million people without jobs, according to forecasters here. **********Rising unemployment is straining relations between the industrial nations by encouraging protectionist policies, as governments try to keep out foreign goods to safeguard jobs at home. Top Reagan Administration officials have warned Europe and Japan to limit sensitive exports to the United States or open their markets to more American goods if they want to prevent reprisals by a Congress increasingly worried by the influx of foreign goods. **********In the last three years, the nations in the European Economic Community have failed to make any new moves toward freer trade among themselves because none is ready to make sacrifices. **********Rising unemployment is also encouraging Europe's growing antinuclear movement to oppose President Reagan's calls for matching the Soviet Union's arms buildup by spending more on defense and trading less with Eastern bloc countries, with opponents saying that this will only accentuate the recession. Economics and Strategy **********''This is the first time that a major economic crisis has coincided with a serious strategic debate inside the alliance, and look at the way the peace movement is blossoming,'' said Gregory Flynn, assistant director of the Atlantic Institute in Paris. **********The latest slowdown in growth is also inducing a new mood of humility among policy makers and economists, who now ruefully acknowledge that many of the recovery strategies they advocated in the past are discredited. ''We can't honestly say we have any easy answers any more,'' said Sylvia Ostray, the O.E.C.D.'s new chief economist. **********An Oxford University economist, Peter Oppenheimer, who used to help coordinate monetary policy at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, said that ''we're in a state of intellectual bankruptcy; all we know is that there isn't any single economic formula that will do the trick.'' **********A major victim of the second economic downturn in the industrial nations has been the O.E.C.D.'s ''locomotive'' recovery plan, which called for the stronger economies, such as those of the United States, West Germany and Japan, to pull the rest of the world back to prosperity by expanding demand and encouraging more imports. But as these nations tried to spend their way out of recession in 1978 and 1979, the result was exactly what critics had forecast - rising inflation, swelling budget deficits and the collapse of the dollar and eventually the mark. **********''We're not going back to the locomotive age,'' the West German Economics Minister, Count Otto Lambsdorff, quipped at a recent Atlantic Institute meeting in Brussels. Monetarist View Undermined **********Yet the deepening recession is also undermining support for the alternative monetarist strategy, which holds that economic growth will only revive when inflation has been squeezed out of the economies by rigorously limiting the supply of new money and credit. **********No government has tried to carry out this policy more strictly than the British Conservatives under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  Yet halfway through Mrs. Thatcher's first term of office, British inflation is as high as when she came to power, while the Conservatives' tight money policy has helped push unemployment up to nearly three million from just over two million. **********After studying experiments with monetary policies, Alexandre Lamfalussy, chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements, said that he now thought the ''very high social costs'' of monetarism in terms of bankrupt industries and rising unemployment made it hard for any democratic government to persist with this approach long enough to yield lasting results. Causes Many and Complex **********As the disarray among policy makers suggests, there is still no real agreement over why growth rates are falling once again, except that the causes appear many and complex. **********Dr. Ostry of the O.E.C.D. estimates that the second oil price shock and the restrictive policies that governments imposed afterward to limit its inflationary impact have reduced the total output of the organization's members by 5 percent below what it would otherwise have been in 1980 and will cut it by another 8 percent this year. **********On top of this came the exceptional explosion in United States interest rates, likened by the French Finance Minister, Jacques Delors, to ''a third oil shock.'' The American increase is criticized as forcing other countries to raise their rates as well to protect the value of their currencies. **********Workers appear to be restraining wage demands more than they did after the first oil price explosion, offering the prospect of lower inflation and more room for expansion in the future. But the monetarists say unemployment is high because labor is still pricing itself out of jobs, and they are calling for greater flexibility in wages and labor markets. Only 'Moderate Success' **********As Mr. Lamfallusy notes, the industrial nations have still experienced only ''moderate success'' so far in curbing inflation through a prolonged recession, and fear of another price upsurge remains the principal reason governments will not adopt more expansionary policies. **********With Saudi Arabia committed to hold the world oil price steady until the end of next year, and the world oil surplus abetting that intention, the industrial nations at least appear safe from the threat of another oil shock for a while. But at recent O.E.C.D.  meetings, there have been warnings that, even if inflation dropped and oil prices remained steady, another threat hung over recovery chances. **********Just as the late Milton Gilbert, then chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, argued after the first oil shock that every upturn might be damaged by a new oil price rise, so Dr. Ostry fears that any future upturn in the United States might lead to another interest rate explosion so long as the Federal Reserve sticks to its low targets for monetary growth. ''The interest rate cycle may replace the oil price cycle,'' she said. Stimulation Weighed **********Despite the many reasons for caution, there are now clear signs that several governments, appalled by the prospect of even lower economic growth in the 1980's than they experienced during the last decade, are toying with the idea of stimulating their economies. **********President Francois Mitterrand of France is publicly committed to trying to spend his way out of the recession by raising wages and public spending. But in West Germany, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt seems more tolerant of government deficits, while Mrs. Thatcher was forced by a Cabinet rebellion to increase public spending in Britain by 4.5 percent more than originally planned. **********Even President Reagan's failure to reduce the budget deficit as promised is being welcomed by many for the support it will give the weakening American economy. **********''There's a bit of reflation in the air,'' said Philips & Drew's Mr. Neild, ''You feel governments have taken a look into the future and have gotten scared.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/25/world/a-polish-cellist-applies-for-asylum-in-the-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Polish Cellist Applies For Asylum in the U.S.", "print_headline": "A Polish Cellist Applies For Asylum in the U.S.", "body_text": " **********A 31-year-old Polish cellist who has been studying at Yale University announced today that she had applied for political asylum in the United States. **********The cellist, Cecylia Barczyk, who gave her first American performance in New York last February, said, ''I can't live in a country without democracy.'' **********''My hopes have been with the Solidarity movement,'' Miss Barczyk added in an interview.

But Mr. Trudeau said that removing the bill of rights from the package would not make things any easier. **********He looked back at the history of constitutional squabbling between Ottawa and the provinces and said the provinces would not support even simple patriation with an amending formula because they constantly sought to bargain for more powers and disagreed among themselves on what the amending formula should be. Consequences of Rejection **********Asked if Canada would declare independence on its own if Britain's Parliament did not approve the Canadian request, Mr. Trudeau answered: ''The British Parliament will act. I have the word of the Prime Minister.'' **********Mr. Trudeau said he got such assurances from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher last June. A federal-provincial constitutional conference ended in failure in September, however, and six provinces have taken Ottawa to court over the moves. Some of these provinces have lobbied extensively in London to defeat the moves there as well. **********Mr. Trudeau said he had warned Mrs. Thatcher that he might not have provincial support. He said it was ''her problem'' to deliver the votes and indicated that if the votes were not forthcoming, there would be trouble at the next Commonwealth conference, to be held in the fall in Melbourne, Australia. He said he had told Mrs.  Thatcher that ''Britain might find it difficult to justify its position'' if it refused to give one of its former colonies ''its complete and final independence.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/world/leaders-of-37-nations-and-plo-to-open-talks-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 506, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LEADERS OF 37 NATIONS AND P.L.O.

It said that the union's leaders had broken agreements with the Government limiting their activities to labor matters and were openly plotting ''to capture power.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/27/world/no-headline-240580.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********FLASH FLOODS HIT SOUTH AFRICA: Washed-out bridge on road to Laingsburg, about 160 miles northeast of Cape Town. **********Flooding in the region was caused by tor-rential rains in the normally dry area.

They say they will ''interview'' the addresees when they return later from Antarctica through New Zealand with a view to prosecuting them. **********Americans detained in New Zealand will have no right under law to refuse to answer questions. Penalties on conviction vary depending upon the amounts. Importation of large quantities of illegal drugs for distribution can bring up to 10 years' imprisonment. Anger and Depression **********This news has stirred anger and depressed morale among the 1,000 or so American scientists, support workers and Navy personnel on the continent this austral summer. They accused the New Zealanders of opening their first-class letters, seizing magazines, damaging goods and violating their privacy. **********The State Department has ordered American officials in Christchurch, New Zealand, where the United States keeps its Antarctic support base, to cooperate with the searches. But high officials of the National Science Foundation, which is responsible for maintaining the American presence here, are so infuriated that they have talked of moving their Antarctic operations to Australia, though the cost makes this unlikely. **********While American authorities here say they do not condone importation of illicit drugs, they fear the searches will retard work here, particularly if eagerly awaited Christmas parcels are delayed or damaged. Already about a dozen key construction foremen have declared they will quit and leave the continent if their letters are opened. **********The New Zealand action came as a surprise to American officials and raised some complex issues of international law.  The Antarctic mail is sent through the Navy and is considered domestic mail by the United States. In the past it has been treated as mail ''in transit'' and left untouched in New Zealand when transferred to military craft flying south. Violation of Rules Cited **********A legal memorandum by the Judge Advocate of the United States Naval Support Force, Antarctica, implied that the seizures violated Universal Postal Union Rules guaranteeing ''freedom of transit'' for parcels. **********However, the Assistant Collector of Customs in Christchurch, B.J.  Kearns, was quoted in The Christchurch Press as defending the searches on the ground that the mail entered New Zealand territory during its transfer between planes. **********''The goods are therefore subject to customs examination in the same way as any other goods entering New Zealand,'' Mr. Kearns was quoted as saying. He disputed the charges over unnecessary damage. **********A New Zealand official on a visit here said some Americans had taken advantage of the mail system to smuggle in goods.  The commander of the United States Naval Support Force, Capt. Jare M. Pearigen, said in an interview that the seaches had gone a long way toward reducing the use of illicit drugs at American Antarctic stations. It had been widespread in previous years. Mail and Food Important **********After food, probably nothing is more important than mail from home to the morale of these isolated Americans. They wanted to talk of little else during a recent visit by reporters to research stations scattered over the continent. **********At the South Pole station, the workers handed reporters a letter they had sent to The Christchurch Press, signed by 39 members. It accused customs of a ''gross and unwarranted breach'' of trust between the two countries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/21/business/seatrain-lines-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SEATRAIN LINES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "SEATRAIN LINES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/01/business/credit-markets-money-supply-unchanged.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1981-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 898, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Credit Markets; MONEY SUPPLY UNCHANGED", "print_headline": "Credit Markets; MONEY SUPPLY UNCHANGED", "body_text": " **********The Federal Reserve announced yesterday afternoon that the nation's basic money supply was unchanged in the week ended July 22, a development that analysts said left the Fed with little reason to change monetary policy or short-term interest rates in the near future. **********''By itself the money number does not change anything, but it is part of a trend that, if continued for another half month, would set the stage for lower rates,'' said Maury Harris, an economist at Paine Webber Inc. **********William Melton, an economist at the Irving Trust Company, added that the Fed would ''continue to be very cautious'' about encouraging lower rates by making bank reserves more plentiful. Although growth of the adjusted M-1B money supply measure is about $8 billion below the Fed's target of 3 1/2 percent growth this year, growth of M-2, the other closely watched money-supply measure, has been very rapid.  Mr. Melton estimated that M-2 would increase at a 12 or 13 percent annual rate in July, which would put it above the top 9 percent growth rate that the Fed has targeted for 1981. **********When money supply growth is slower than the Fed would like, it tends to supply more credit to the banking system, which leads to lower short-term rates. When money supply growth is faster than the Fed would like, it makes credit scarcer, thereby encouraging higher short-term rates. Earlier Data Revised **********After revising the previous week's data downward by $200 million, the Fed said that M-1B was unchanged at $428.7 billion in the week ended July 22, or $100 million lower than the average for the month of June. M-1B consists of currency plus interest- and noninterestbearing checking accounts at banks and savings institutions. **********The Fed announces an average level for M-2 monthly, although some components, which Mr. Melton used to make his estimate, are published weekly. M-2 consists of M-1B plus savings deposits at banks, certain short-term bank borrowings in the domestic and off-shore money markets, and the rapidly growing money market mutual funds. **********After the Fed's announcement, short- and long-term interest rates rose and eliminated the declines of earlier trading. Traders stressed that the higher rates reflected the efforts of securities dealers to attract buyers to next week's Treasury bill, note and bond auctions, and not any disappointment with the money supply and banking data published by the Fed. **********''The Fed data could have been good news for the market, but it was far overshadowed by the volume of notes and bonds to be auctioned next week,'' one dealer said. On Tuesday the Treasury plans to sell $4.25 billion of new notes due November 1984, $2.25 billion of 14 1/4 percent notes due May 1991, and $2 billion of 13 7/8 percent bonds due 2011. Treasury Bills at 14.96% **********By late in the day, three- and six-month Treasury bills were bid at 14.96 percent, more than an eighth of a percentage point higher than early in the day. The Treasury announced yesterday a $4.5 billion auction of new one-year bills, and by late in the day the outstanding year bills were bid at 14.3 percent. **********Among outstanding Treasury notes and bonds corresponding to upcoming issues, the 15 3/4 percent notes due May 1984 were offered at 99 30/32 to yield 15.78 percent, the 14 1/2 percent notes were 99 to yield 14.68 percent and the 13 7/8 percent bonds due 2011 were 99 1/4 to yield 13.98 percent. Earlier in the day the bonds had traded at a price of 100. **********According to economists, a slowdown in business borrowing is a crucial component of any sustainable decline in short-term interest rates. The latest Fed data give a mixed picture of business credit demands. Total bank loans to businesses fell at large banks, while commercial paper outstanding continued to grow rapidly, rising by $1.7 billion. **********In the week ended July 22, total business loans extended by large banks nationally fell $265 million, which includes a $817 million drop at 10 large banks in New York City. Most of the drop was accounted for by a decline in bankers acceptances outstanding, which fell by $657 nationally. **********Data on bank reserves showed no large changes in the amount provided by the Fed or the amount needed by the banking system. Total borrowings at the discount window rose more than $200 million to more than $1.9 billion in the week ended July 29, but even so, the demand for overnight loans ebbed enough to allow the average rate on bank loans in the Federal funds market to fall to 18.54 percent from 19.05 percent the previous week. For the last two days the funds rate has averaged about 17 1/2 percent. **********Nonborrowed reserves fell by $108 million, to $39.075 billion, in the week ended July 29. Nonborrowed reserves declined during the March-June period as the Fed sought to slow money supply growth by making reserves scarcer in the banking system. **********The increase of $644 million over the lastest four weeks, compared with the four-week average a month ago, shows that the Fed is willing to allow some growth of nonborrowed reserves now that M-1B growth has slowed, although the Fed has not moved aggressively to push more credit at the banking system."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/15/business/key-rates-085580.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": " **********Previous   Year       In percent   Yesterday   Day   Ago              PRIME RATE*   17.50   17.50   20.00       DISCOUNT RATE**   13.00   13.00   13.00       FEDERAL FUNDS   14.71   15.60   18.35       3-MO.

But they have reservations about how democratic the elections will be. **********''Can we between now and next March create the conditions for elections that will be meaningful?'' the United States Ambassador, Deane R. Hinton, said in a recent interview. ''Difficult, but we don't despair. And we're sure going to try.'' **********''I have to admit the elections are not going to be perfect,'' the head of the Election Council, Dr. Jorge Bustamante, said in an interview. **********Most sectors of Salvadoran society, including the National Federation of Lawyers, the Roman Catholic Church and conservative business leaders, are stronger in their declarations that the conditions are not propitious for bringing democracy to their tiny country. Churchman Is Skeptical **********In his homily last Sunday, Msgr. Arturo Rivera Damas, the senior church official in El Salvador, reiterated that the level of violence and the lack of confidence in the Government make meaningful elections impossible. **********According to Dr. Bustamante, the violence will in effect disenfranchise most peasants in rural areas, where an estimated 60 percent of the population lives and where illiteracy is about 70 percent. **********The National Federation of Lawyers has refused to work with the Electoral Council in drafting an election law. One of their reasons is that there is a state of siege, which suspends constitutional rights such as freedom of speech and assembly. Mass demonstrations and political rallies are prohibited. **********''There can't be an election under these conditions, and the state of siege can't be lifted now,'' Rene Fortin Magana said in an interview yesterday. Mr. Magana is president of the lawyer's federation and was a member of a ruling junta in 1960. He is now organizing what he calls a pressure group, called Democratic Action, which might participate in the elections as a party to the right of the Christian Democrats. **********Only the Christian Democrats want the elections, Mr. Magana said, adding: ''We are not obligated to participate.'' Broadcasting Is Controlled **********The main objection to elections involves the advantages of incumbency enjoyed by the Christian Democrats, which under the state of siege includes their control of radio and television. Mr. Magana said more non-Christian Democrats must be brought into the Government before there can be elections. **********Two members of the civilian-military junta, including President Jose Napoleon Duarte, are Christian Democrats, as are most of the Cabinet members. The junta has appointed the country's mayors and members of the Electoral Council, three of whose six members are Christian Democrats. **********''It will be a media campaign,'' said Jose Eduardo Palomo, manager of an agricultural supply company and a member of Democratic Action.  It will have to be, he said, because fear of being assassinated will keep candidates from campaigning in public. **********The Christian Democratic Party's headquarters in the center of the capital has been bombed several times. ''We know that many of us will be killed during the campaign,'' said San Salvador's Christian Democratic Mayor, Julio Adolfo Rey Prendes. Leftist Participation Unlikely **********On the other side, it seems unlikely that there will be any significant participation by leftist groups, either because they will not be allowed to campaign or because their leaders fear they will be killed. **********The Democratic Revolutionary Front, a broad coalition united with the leftist guerrillas, should not be allowed in the elections, Mr.  Magana said, because it has ''Marxist-Leninist tendencies.'' **********The head of the Democratic Revolutionary Front is Manuel Guillermo Ungo, a Social Democrat. Ambassador Hinton said Mr. Ungo, who is in exile, should be allowed to be a candidate, and he expressed confidence that Mr. Ungo would not fare well. ''He has no future in this country,'' Mr. Hinton said. **********''Do you think the United States would ever permit Mr. Ungo to become president?'' asked a professor at the Jesuit-founded University of Central America. U.S. Playing 'One Key' **********''The United States is playing only one key on the piano,'' a senior church official here said. He was referring to Washington's promotion of elections and its rejection of negotiations as the way to settle the civil war. **********''Elections do not necessarily mean democracy,'' a businessman said. Like many Salvadorans, he doubts that the elections will be honest or that the army will honor the outcome. **********Nevertheless, the Government is continuing its drive. On office buildings in the capital and on the villages' mud huts, whose surfaces are blotched with white paint that barely conceal spraypainted revolutionary graffiti, neatly printed blue-and-white posters are being put up. ''In 1982 your vote can make the difference,'' the posters say. ''El Salvador deserves your vote.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/17/business/advertising-debeers-to-promote-anniversary-rings.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DeBeers to Promote Anniversary Rings", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; DeBeers to Promote Anniversary Rings", "body_text": " **********Ayer's biggest client in Canada has been DeBeers Consolidated Mines and that leads right into another item.

''Japan must open its market much wider,'' William E. Brock, the United States trade representative, told his audience last week at the Shimoda Conference, a gathering of 80 top Government officials, business executives and academicians from both countries that was held in Oiso, a small town southwest of here. **********Because of the deepening trade deficit with Japan, Mr. Brock predicted that the Administration and Congress would ''face substantial pressure'' this year to restrict Japanese imports into the American market. He stressed that the Reagan team would try to resist this protectionist pressure, and said he hoped it would be ''containable.'' **********Aggravating the push for protectionism, Mr. Brock said, was ''the widespread preception in America that Japan does not play fairly in the international trading arena.'' **********In a later interview, Mr. Brock, as well as many of the other Americans at the conference, said that, while the notion that Japan had a closed economy might be overdrawn, the widespread perception is by no means groundless. ''They've got a lot of liberalizing to do here,'' he added. ''We've got to keep the pressure on.'' **********Mr. Brock spent most of his five-day trip to Japan at the Shimoda Conference. It is named for the town where Commodore Matthew C. Perry first came to port in Japan in 1853. It was the fifth such gathering; the last one was in 1977. Although other topics were discussed at the three-day conference, trade issues were dominant. **********The view that the trade deficit with Japan, particularly if it continues to swell, could become a serious political issue in the United States was the consensus among the Americans. **********''It's clear that this kind of trade imbalance between the two countries will create severe and rapidly mounting political strains,'' said Paul W. McCracken, a University of Michigan economist and a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. **********The Japanese, too, are deeply concerned by the growing deficit.  Recently, the Japan Foreign Trade Council, a business group headed by this nation's powerful trading houses, urged quick action to increase imports, and Japan's Cabinet ministers will reportedly review possible methods fo r stimulating imports late r this month. **********However, the Japanese attribute much of the present deficit problem to the Reagan Administration's policy of high interest rates rather than to any impediments to imports in Japan. High interest rates in the United St ates strengthen the dollar, making American exports morecostly and im ports cheaper. **********''The United States complains, but at the same time you pursue a policy of benign neglect in terms of international exchange rates,'' said Naohiro Amaya, special adviser to the Minister of International Trade and Industry. **********Mr. Amaya added that ''much more should be done with United States monetary policy.'' Any easing of monetary policy that would reduce interest rates would weaken the dollar relative to other currencies. **********In addition, the Japanese business executives and Government officials said that American criticism amounted to what one described as ''yelling at us because the Japanese economy is so successful.'' **********During the first seven months of 1981, the United States ran a trade deficit with Japan of $8.6 billion, the Commerce Department has reported. By contrast, the deficit for the full year of 1980 was $9.9 billion, and the previous record was $11.6 billion in 1978. **********United States Government estimates of the deficit for the year have been steadily revised to higher levels in recent months. Earlier this summer, Government economists were saying the deficit with Japan could go as high as $13 billion. In July, however, the monthly deficit reached a record $1.35 billion, and at the Japanese conference, the projection used for discussion was $15 billion. **********The deficit with Japan on a current account basis - a broader measure of the economic relationship between two nations that includes services and some short-term capital movements, as well as merchandise - will be much less than the trade deficit. The current account with Japan will show a deficit of more than $2 billion, Mr.  Brock estimated. Still, the trade deficit or surplus is most widely followed and, thus, is more important politically. **********In the recent past, the contentious trade issues that resulted in curbs on Japanese exports to the United States centered on specific products or industries, such as the current ''voluntary'' limit on Japanese automobile shipments and the reduction in exports of color television sets to the United States in the late 1970's. **********Now, the situation is somewhat different. ''This time the deficit overall is the issue,'' said Robert D. Hormats, assistant secretary for economic and business affairs in the State Department. ''There''s no specific area to focus on.'' **********Today, the barriers to entering the Japanese market that the Americans mentioned are not clear-cut tariffs or quotas. For the most part, those have been removed in the wake of the Tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations, which were begun in the early 1970's and were largely prompted by pressure from the United States for Japan to open its economy. **********Instead, the blocks that remain are mostly such nontariff impediments as special standards on imports and time-consuming and expensive customs procedures. Other problems cited by the Americans are even more subtle and less susceptible to quick change. These include the country's strong ''Buy Japan'' ethic and the complex distribution system that is highly dependent on long-standing social relationships. **********These are some of the ''powerful social and cultural forces,'' Mr.  Brock said, that ''make trade liberalization an excruciating process for Japan.'' **********Simple political influence is another problem. Americans continually argue that Japan should be more open to American agricultural products, and even the Japanese politicians at the conference said they would like to import more food products and that would probably lower consumer prices in Japan. In the next breath, however, most of them noted that the farmers' lobby in Japan was extremely powerful and many Japanese politicians would be ousted without farmers' support. **********But the Americans also face political strictures on trade liberalization. For example, the single step that could do most to narrow the trade deficit, most at the conference agreed, would be to sell Alaskan oil to Japan. By some estimates, that might slice $5 billion annually from the deficit. **********Indeed, because of the high transportation costs of shipping Alaskan oil through the Panama Canal, it would be much cheaper for American consumers to buy oil from Mexico or other nations. **********Though the Reagan Administration is trying to change it, United States law now mandates that the Alaskan oil be sold in the domestic market. **********Also by law, shipments going from one American port to another must be handled by American-flag ships and crews, which are more costly than foreign carriers.  ''So now you've built up a whole navy up in Alaska to deal with theregulations,'' said John W. Simmons, senior v ice president of international relations for th e Atlantic Richfield Company . ''If you change the law now, you're going to throw that whole navy out of work; you can bet there'll be plenty of resistance to that .''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/06/world/us-asked-to-trim-war-games.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 241, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. ASKED TO TRIM WAR GAMES", "print_headline": "U.S. ASKED TO TRIM WAR GAMES", "body_text": " **********Oman has ordered the United States to reduce the size and scope of a United States Marine landing exercise in the Arabian Sea-Persian Gulf area, Reagan Administration sources said today. **********The planned landing on Oman's shores next month is designed to demonstrate American intentions to help safeguard the security of oil-producing nations in the region. **********The sources, who asked to remain anonymous, said they were not certain why the Omani Government balked at the original United States plan. **********However, they indicated that Oman might want to keep the exercise as limited as possible to avoid criticism from other Arab nations.

And, since as Miss O'Leary uniquely put it, ''You've got to walk before you can run,'' the campaign will begin Monday without dear old television, just radio and newspapers. And unlike most soft drinks, Old Tyme, although it will be pushed by a jingle in its marketplace incursion, is not aimed at the youth market, but rather the older crowd. That's the kind that listens to WOR. And they will be among the crew that will hear about the ''swashbuckling taste of ginger beer,'' which goes well with the picture of the pirate on both the old and new labels.  Besides, Robert D. Fearon, chairman of the agency, likes the word swashbuckler because it swishes around the mouth like a soft drink. **********The new client is Robert W. Tuckman, lawyer and one-time associate counsel to the former Assembly Speaker, Stanley Steingut, who tried his hand at original equipment manufacture before buying out Lou Scharf, now 80 years old. **********The radio commercials, with jingle music by the Radio Band of America, will also be running on WNBC-AM, WNEW-AM, WRFM-FM, WCBS-AM and FM, and WYNY-FM. **********Black-and-white or four-color print ads will run in The New York Times and its magazine, The Daily News, and New York magazine.  The ad budget just for the summer is about $250,000, Miss O'Leary said, noting that Mr. Tuckman's plans call for adding the Boston, Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco markets by the end of the year and putting between $100,000 and $150,000 worth of advertising into each. **********The Old Tyme label is on about a dozen different soft drinks as well as on a number of spicy sauces and two kinds of marmalade. The soft drink line, which has a very good cream soda, also includes such unusual soft drink flavors as sorrel, champagne cola and apple. **********The ginger beer, up against such competing brands as Perry, A&J, Metro and Schweppes, will be promoted as a soft drink and also as a mixer for such old-time favorites as the Moscow Mule (with vodka) and the Shandygaff (with beer). **********And the Old Tyme Jamaican Style Ginger Beer has the extra cachet of being imported. While Lou Scharf Inc. owns the formula, the manufacture and bottling is done by an independent company in Toronto. It also has the cachet of carrying a premium price, and that is one way of popularizing something with a certain segment. **********Indeed, the ads will also be running in newspapers in the Hamptons, where the agency will be running tasting parties for the various exotic mixed drinks, like the introduction festivities last night at the Jim McMullen ''in spot'' on Third Avenue and 72d Street. **********''The question is who can spread the word-of-mouth?''

Another park, the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, or Epcot, located near Orlando, Fla,. is scheduled for completion in 1982. **********Now, however, the company is apparently trying to rebuild its animation department, depleted two years ago, by recruiting new young talent and by rethinking its position in the market. Renewed Emphasis on Movies **********''They're trying to come back into the movie business,'' said George Novello, an assistant vice president of reseach for E.F.  Hutton. ''Recently, much of their effort has been going to Epcot.'' **********Its summer release of ''The Fox and the Hound'' represents what Disney hopes will be a new era in Disney films. It has taken four years to get the 83-minute film about the friendship of a hound puppy and an abandoned fox puppy to the screen. At least part of the delay was caused when 11 animators left two years ago to form a rival company after a dispute with Disney management about artistic control. **********''The art of animation wasn't growing. The studio was so encrusted with its original and traditional ways,'' said Don Bluth, 44 years old, the animator who led the walkout. **********Without Walt Disney's flair for capturing the attention of young moviegoers, Disney films lost their momentum. The company produced a series of comedy movies such as the four ''Herbie'' movies about an impish Volkswagon, which appeared to be a success. The first of these films, ''The Love Bug,'' posted impressive profits in 1970. **********But by the time the fourth picture in the series, ''Herbie Goes Bananas,'' was completed, it was apparent that the films were not attracting audiences. ''We were making nothing but comedies. We didn't have the diversity we needed,'' said Ronald W. Miller, president and chief operating officer. **********So, Disney turned to other movie-making methods, trying to produce ''a couple of pictures to make money,'' Mr. Miller said. Box Office Failures **********These efforts included hiring well-known screen personalities to star in Disney films. One such example, ''The Devil and Max Devlin,'' starred Bill Cosby and Elliott Gould. ''The film cost between $7.1 and $7.2 million to make,'' Mr. Miller said. ''We lost a considerable amount of money. We were lucky to make six and a half in the film rentals with a write-off of $4 million.'' **********The company also agreed to joint ventures with Paramount Studios on ''Popeye'' and ''Dragonslayer.'' Both pictures did poorly at the box office. ''Popeye,'' which cost $22 million to produce, earned just over $22 million domestically. ''It didn't do well in Japan or Taiwan. Germany and France are still question marks - if it does well there, we'll show a small profit,'' Mr. Miller said. **********So far, ''Dragonslayer'' has had an unprofitable domestic run.  Disney is unlikely to profit from the film unless it too does well in foreign markets. **********Another recent picture, ''Watcher in the Woods,'' has also been disappointing. The film was pulled from distribution after a brief premiere run in New York in April 1980. ''We made a terrible mistake visually. We hadn't really worked on the alien'' - a character who is not seen until a climatic moment at the film's end - said Thomas L. Wilhite, vice president of creative development for motion pictures and television. An additional $800,000 was spent to restore the set in England and re-shoot the end of the movie. The second version is scheduled for release in November. **********When faced with pulling ''Watcher in the Woods'' from distribution, Disney decided to re-release ''Mary Poppins,'' the popular and successful children's film, as a substitute. The film is a Disney classic, part of the company's vast library of proven money makers, which have in large part been responsible for keeping up corporate profits. Most of these films, such as ''Cinderella,'' ''Snow White'' and many others, are re-released about once every seven or eight years. Disney Resists Cable **********But Disney is not one of those studios looking forward to cable television as an aftermarket for its classics. None of its classic films will be released for play on cable systems or home video cassette sales, Mr. Miller said, until a scrambling method, which prevents the making of illegal copies, is perfected. **********To bolster its new movie efforts, Disney has been looking for young executives, like Mr. Wilhite, 28, who can bring to Disney a broader appeal. ''Since Walt died, you have to recognize that there have been changes in society. Kids do mature much earlier,'' Mr.Wilhite said. As a result, the studio is developing some projects such as ''Tex,'' the story of two brothers growing up in present-day Oklahoma without parents. **********Mr. Miller, who is married to Mr. Disney's daughter, Diane, and Mr. Wilhite both acknowledge some frustration in making production choices because of the Disney reputation for nonsexual, nonviolent family entertainment. **********''There's a lot of frustration in making pictures for Disney. There are a lot of areas we'd like to get into but can't,'' Mr. Wilhite said. ''I'd like to do something a little different, a little more earthy,'' Mr. Miller said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/31/world/islamic-peace-mission-in-teheran-making-a-new-cease-fire-effort.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 385, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISLAMIC PEACE MISSION IN TEHERAN MAKING A NEW CEASE-FIRE EFFORT", "print_headline": "ISLAMIC PEACE MISSION IN TEHERAN MAKING A NEW CEASE-FIRE EFFORT", "body_text": " **********Nine Islamic leaders arrived in Teheran today for another attempt to arrange an Iraqi-Iranian truce and began talks at once with the Iranians. **********(The Saudi Arabian radio said the mission was carrying a new peace proposal, United Press International reported.

Only a handful of people slip between the desks, tables, chairs and typewriters that are piled in the corridor. The walls are full of graffiti, mostly the giant signatures of the people who ran the nation's antipoverty program until it closed Sept. 30. The fish swimming in the tank outside the administrator's office are, as one former employee put it, ''the only signs around here that life goes on.'' **********But life does go on in the Federal bureaucracy, even if the C.S.A., once the beehive of Federal activism in social affairs, has now become the symbol of the Reagan Administration's determination to turn back programs to the states and to pare the Federal work force.  Other agencies, such as the Department of Energy and the Public Health Service, have experienced relatively heavy cutbacks. But despite the Sturm und Drang that accompanied the Reagan budget and program cuts, the latest figures indicate that only 4,006 nondefense employ- ees nationwide were, in the word that increasingly is being bandied about here, ''separated'' from the Federal payroll in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. **********Although the toll has been relatively slight, the personnel reductions would likely become more severe if Congress goes along with Mr. Reagan's plan for an across-the-board 12 percent cut in discretionary spending. But for now, the figure is far lower than anyone - Reagan personnel experts and Administration critics alike - expected. **********The Federal Government employs 1.8 million full-time workers and 60,000 part timers, excluding the Postal Service and the Armed Forces. As late as midsummer some projections had put the number of reductions in force, or RIF's, at 16,056. Even the President's pledge to reduce the Federal work force by 75,000 by the end of fiscal year 1984 may not cause much of a ripple; an official at the Office of Management and Budget estimates that the rate of Federal employee turnover itself is more than 75,000 a year. **********''It's a shell game,'' said Representative Geraldine Ferraro, Democrat of Queens and the head of a House human resources subcommittee. ''They're talking about reducing Federal employees, but they haven't really done it. They're doing cosmetic things. It looks good, but if you look below the surface, the story is a lot different.'' **********The actual dislocations that will be caused by forthcoming efforts to reduce the payroll constitute only one of many mysteries in the Reagan Federal personnel program. **********Although the Administration has made its effort to reduce the Government work force one of the centerpieces of its drive to cut the budget, the amount of money it will save is still being debated here. The O.M.B. estimates that a Federal em- ployee costs an average of $25,000 a year, but the Government Accounting Office is still trying to determine how much the severance pay, overtime, lump-sum leave payments, productivity loss and, in many cases, unemployment compensation will tax the Federal treasury. **********''It's an awfully difficult calculation to make,'' said an official at the G.A.O. ''New budget decisions are being made every day. We don't know how long it will take us to figure this out, or how accurate we can be.'' **********The Administration, however, contends that, whatever the short-term costs of cutting the Federal work force, the effort will pay off in substantial savings in the long term. **********''There's no question that we'll eventu- ally have savings,'' said a high-ranking O.M.B. official who declined to be named. ''It's just that the savings don't occur immediately. It takes six to eight months before you start realizing the savings.'' **********The true impact of the President's program is further obscured by the quirks and byzantine operations of the bureaucracy itself.  One of the natural consequences of the reduction in force is a personnel practice known among Government workers as ''bumping,'' which occurs when a high-level employee faced with the loss of his job exercises his prerogative to take a job that is occupied by an employee in a lower level, and to collect his old salary for two years. ''You could have the bizarre possibility of somebody earning $50,000 occupying a job that pays $12,000,'' said Reginald M. Jones, chairman of the Task Force on Personnel Reductions (no relation to Reginald H. Jones, General Electric's retired chairman). ''It could happen. It does happen.'' **********That, along with another Federal personnel practice, known as ''retreat,'' which occurs when an employee retains his salary and job grade for two years but returns to a lower-level job he previously held, causes major disruptions in the life of Federal bureaucracy. **********Although no figures are available yet, an O.M.B. official acknowledges that the Government might find itself overloaded with high-paid executive-level employees and without the batteries of secretaries, technicians and mid-level professionals it needs to carry out its functions. **********Because the Reagan program has produced such anomalies in the bureauracy, the reduction in force has come under attack on Capitol Hill. ''It tends to have the most devastating effect on women, minorities and others with little seniority,'' said Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. **********I N addition, according to figures issued by the Office of Personnel Management, about three-fifths of all the reductions in permanent Federal employee levels between January and July came from part-time Federal workers. During that period, 5,105 part-time positions and only 3,330 of the full-time positions were eliminated. **********Reductions in force can sometimes bring about reductions in productivity. Personnel costs at the Internal Revenue Service were cut by $21 million in 1968, for example, but the resulting loss in revenues hit an estimated $700 million over three years.  Representative Ferraro, among others, has expressed concern that possible cuts in the Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service would reduce the effectiveness of their services and would produce long waits at air terminals and ports. **********In a report issued this summer, the G.A.O. questioned the use of personnel ceilings in Government, saying such policies have an ''adverse effect on the performance and distribution of the Federal workload'' and adding: **********''The use of personnel ceilings reinforces the misconception that containing the staffing level of the direct Federal work force controls the cost of Government.'' **********Few officials even here would argue that Government employment is without featherbedding and waste, but some critics of the Administration's reductions maintain that the savings produced by the personnel cuts are often chimerical. ''Wholesale RIF's do not erase the necessity for the work to be done,'' said Frank Taylor, a spokesman for the National Federation of Federal Employees. **********''Management then looks to the only source it has left - outside contractors. And outside contractors have to make a profit,'' he said. ''Since the bad blankets sold during the American Revolution, outside contractors have supplied the Government with shoddy products, indifferent service, huge cost overruns and various other tactics that make their service more expensive to the taxpayers than that provided by Federal employees.'' **********Others suggest that the reductions in force themselves are part of the Administration's effort to cut Government regulation. ''In some of the areas, they're using reductions as a policy weapon,'' said Robert W. Hartman, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution here. ''With fewer people to enforce regulations and laws, it means weaker enforcement.'' **********To accompany its effort at reduction in force, the Office of Personnel Management implemented programs to register displaced employees and to refer them to openings within and outside the Government. **********But, according to Jerry Klepner, director of legislation for the National Treasury Employees Union, the placement procedures are inadequate. ''The Administration has done an abysmal job,'' he said.  ''They have not devoted enough resources to developing outplacement services. Some Federal agencies are hiring, and many employees who are losing their jobs could be placed in other agencies. There is no effective system.'' **********If the implications and operations of the work force reduction program can only be spoken of in tentative terms, it is in part because the Government has had so little experience in laying off and firing its employees. **********Although union officials are fond of pointing out that the ratio of Federal employees to the national population has declined by about one-fourth in the past three decades, nearly all the reduction has come by way of attrition. Only in the Defense Department, which traditionally has reductions in force at the end of wars and during periodic base closings, and in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which pared its payroll after it reached its goal of a lunar landing in 1969, have RIF procedures received much use. **********''We have very little experience in doing this,'' said Mr. Jones, the chairman of the Task Force on Personnel Reductions. ''We didn't think the Government was ready to do this. So we assembled people, brought all our personnel material up to date, established training sessions and conducted thousands of briefings. **********''Even then,'' he continued, ''sometimes the word didn't get through. Or the word got through and the employees didn't want to believe it. Sometimes no matter how much you explained that they should begin their job hunting, they didn't believe it. I think more employees are inclined now to believe it is going to happen.'' **********Already some 927 have been separated from the Department of Energy, which suffered an unusually high toll in the first round of cuts.  The Government counts an additional 650 separations from the Community Services Administration, which ceased operations Sept. 30.  And the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior separated 204. **********The Federal Grain Inspection Service was among the first Government agencies to eliminate jobs in the fiscal year that began last month; it eliminated 77 jobs Oct. 3. The Public Health Service also separated about 2,100 employees Oct. 31. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is expected to dismiss 47 this week. At the Department of Labor, perhaps as many as 1,200 jobs may be cut by Dec. 31. **********Should Mr. Reagan prevail and win his second round of budget cuts, there could be many more layoffs. According to some estimates here, the Federal Communications Commission could lose as many as 375 positions, for example. **********A S rumors of personnel cuts -many of them unfounded - circulate through the Federal bureaucracy, employee morale tends to suffer.  Documents circulating within the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that the Administration is considering reducing the staff by nearly half. In hearings on Capitol Hill this month, Anne M. Gorsuch, the E.P.A.'s administrator, refused to confirm whether staff reductions are being contemplated for next year. **********The situation has caused much uncertainty among E.P.A.'s employees. ''The average worker has no idea what's going on,'' said Harold L.  Dodson, president of the Government employees' local at E.P.A.  headquarters here. ''With a little trust or cooperation, something could be worked out. Right now our people have zero morale. All they get are rumors. Productivity and efficiency are way down. We have chaos and confusion and not organization.''  ONE UNHAPPY DEPARTURE WASHINGTON **********Her title was Power Rate Analysis and Allocation Specialist in the Office of Power Marketing Coordination of the Department of Energy.  Now, after a quarter-century on the Government payroll, Marlene A.  Moody is unemployed. **********The Government lured her here four years ago from Boulder City, Nev., where she directed a three-state power-marketing program for the Western Area Power Administration. This autumn the Government told her that if she wished to remain in the Energy Department, she could retain her $41,657 salary at the Government's GS-14 grade but would have to take a lower-level job as a budget analyst in a GS-11 grade, which has a pay range of $23,566 to $30,640. **********''I found it very, very difficult to accept a GS-11,'' said Mrs.  Moody, who is 44 years old. ''It was an insult. It's been 10 years since I was a GS-11. A lot of effort and work and expertise has been accruing in that period. To have 10 years of my life erased like that made no sense.'' **********Instead, Mrs. Moody, who said she has never done the kind of budget job she was offered, decided to leave the Government. **********It was, in part, her story that led Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to call the Reduction in Force process ''a costly tool in dollar and human terms.'' **********Mrs. Moody's departure has left a gap in the Energy Department.  ''She was the only one on the staff who could do that kind of work,'' said a lawyer with the department. ''Now she's been sideswiped and is out.'' **********Mrs. Moody and her husband, who is an education specialist at a home for mentally and emotionally disturbed children, have two grown children. Today, she sits in her Tacoma Park, Md., home, trying to assemble a battery of clients for her new career as a power-rate consultant. She is angry over what she believes are the implications of Mr. Reagan's effort to diminish the size of the Federal work force. **********''I try very hard not to be bitter about this,'' she said. ''But I don't think the process that's going on in Government now is a beneficial one. The Federal work force is being weakened. Maybe that's the Administration's goal. But the best people aren't being retained and the people who are being retained are being shuffled off to jobs where they aren't being productive anymore. There has to be a better way to reduce the Federal work force than this kind of chaos.'' **********When Mrs. Moody left the Government payroll Sept. 25, she was entitled to a year's salary as severence pay plus an additional six weeks' accumulated vacation pay. But, she said, the cost of the Administration's work force reduction plan cannot be measured only in dollars. **********''I just sat there and watched nothing being done by anybody,'' she said of her last days at the Energy Department. ''The whole organization is totally preoccupied by this mess they've created.  It's still going on. It's just tremendous turmoil, and there's a lot of work to be done.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/30/business/dean-witter-link-to-sears-backed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 228, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dean Witter Link To Sears Backed", "print_headline": "Dean Witter Link To Sears Backed", "body_text": " **********Shareholders of the Dean Witter Reynolds Organization Inc., the large securities firm, approved a $607 million takeover of the company by Sears, Roebuck & Company, the nation's largest retailer. **********Holders controlling 9.78 million shares - those shares not obtained by Sears through its original tender offer - accepted terms of the merger agreement, said a Dean Witter spokesman, Robert Stovall. **********That agreement calls for the remaining Dean Witter stockholders to receive 3.110 shares of Sears common stock for each share of Dean Witter common. **********Before Sears's tender offer for Dean Witter stock expired Nov. 10, Sears had acquired 4.55 million Dean Witter shares, or 40 percent of the common outstanding at the time, Mr. Stovall said.

Just two weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a consent degree against Frederick Wyman 2d, a broker at L.F. Rothschild Unterberg Towbin, and his father, Frank Wyman, for violating insider trading rules. And last week the financier Edward M. Gilbert was convicted of 34 counts of stock manipulation. **********The detective work in each case originated in a small, noisy room several stories above the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange. There, amid the staccato clatter of printing machines that record stock trades, a team of 11 analysts and investigators, armed with computers, follows each transaction made in a trading session. **********Officials at the New York Stock Exchange are decidedly optimistic about their surveillance program, known as Stock Watch, which has monitored trading activity since the 1940's. The American Stock Exchange, as well as most of the regional exchanges, have similar systems. Hard to Detect **********Other market observers, while applauding the stock exchange's security efforts, are not so enthusiastic about its ability to protect against well-executed stock manipulation or insider trading schemes. **********''If a person has inside information, and tells a friend about it, and that friend tells another friend about it, and transactions are done through nominee accounts (in which the actual owners of the stock are not identified), detection becomes very hard, if not impossible.'' said Thomas A. Russo, a partner in the Wall Street law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. **********Another view comes from Harvey Pitt, former general counsel of the S.E.C., now in private practice in the Washington office of the New York-based Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Kampelman: ''I just don't think it's possible to create a system that can prevent every deliberate fraud, but I think these cases came to light because the trading activities were picked up by market surveillance programs which are becoming increasingly sophisticated as computer technology advances.'' A Trading Alarm Sounds **********In the insider trading scheme involving Morgan Stanley, for instance, the exchange's analysts were alerted by a computerized printer that issues a warning message whenever a transaction or accumulation of trades exceeds pre-determined price or volume guidelines. **********The warning parameters are based on the historic performance of the stock and are programmed into the computer's memory.  For instance, the blue-chip General Motors stock, currently trading around $49 a share, is programmed to flag price movement up or down more than three points in a single trading session, while I.B.M, trading at $60, will be flagged if it reaches $64. The same principle holds true for newer, more volatile listings. **********Most jumps in the price of a stock can be readily explained by an encouraging earnings statement, an independent research report, the introduction of a new product or the disclosure of a possible merger or acquisition. **********Companies routinely alert the exchange to events that may affect their stocks. In addition, the Stock Watch subscribes to several news services that provide information which may affect a company's market performance. Sifting for Clues **********The Stock Watch detectives step in when there is no apparent reason for unusual interest in a stock. **********''Sometimes I look back through the news service reports as far as 90 days,'' said Sheldon Richter, a wiry, bearded man who started at the exchange as a floor reporter, and now heads the staff of analysts. ''There are times when a company will be talking about preliminary negotiations toward a merger, and they haven't said anything for 60 days, and now the stock is kicking-out (showing up on the warning printer), so by looking back, we can track it down.'' **********An analyst who detects trading irregularities immediately calls a floor official - a member of the exchange, who may question a specialist or commission broker about the stock's activity. If no reasonable explantion is forthcoming, the brokerage firm handling the account is questioned. **********The corporation whose stock is being traded is also questioned.  ''The company might say they don't know what is going on, then we might ask them then to say so on one of the news wires,'' Mr. Richter said. The purpose, he said, is to quell rumors, ''reducing unwarranted speculation in the stock.'' Checking Transactions **********When there is still no rationale for the stock's volatility or high volume, the analyst retrieves the computer record of sales - frequently covering several months of trading. **********''Trying to relate little scraps of information to other scraps to build a case is a tough, hard job,'' said Richard Drew, a vice president of the exchange responsible for the Stock Watch program. **********Mr. Drew said analysts looked for concentrations of activity, such as large block trades. ''If a person is involved in several situations - phenomenally luck on one tender offer, then another, and a third and a fourth - after several such occurrences, we often find that there may be problems here,'' he said. **********If the analyst finds reasons for further inquiry, the broker or customer representative may be asked why this moment was chosen to trade heavily in the market. **********''If he says it was tape action - he was watching tape and the stock exhibited high volume and he decided that it's a good time to buy the stock and he wanted to join the bandwagon, then we say fine,'' Mr. Richter said. ''The investigator will look at the market, and if there was no tape action, the broker will be asked to come to the stock exchange, accompanied by counsel.'' A Pattern Emerged **********As Mr. Drew put it, ''It is out of this kind of detective work that the Morgan Stanley case developed.'' **********After examining the trading pattern of several stocks that had been flagged by the computerized warning system, the analysts determined that they were all involved in takeover bids, and that the unusual spurts in trading activity came just before public announcements - a classic case of insider trading. **********Among those stocks involved were Marshall Field & Company, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation and the Monroe Auto Equipment Company. Because of the pending investigation, Stock Watch officials declined to be more specific about which stocks were spotted first or how high they had traded above normal. **********When wrongdoing is found, the exchange begins disciplinary action.  When the exchange lacks jurisdiction it calls in the enforcement arm of the S.E.C., which has jurisdiction over customers, lawyers, accountants or officials of the company whose stock is involved."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/22/business/wurlitzer-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WURLITZER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "WURLITZER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/09/business/ex-reagan-aide-s-firm-in-pipeline-fight.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Pound", "pub_date": "1981-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 745, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EX-REAGAN AIDE'S FIRM IN PIPELINE FIGHT", "print_headline": "EX-REAGAN AIDE'S FIRM IN PIPELINE FIGHT", "body_text": " **********The top executive of the principal company that would build the Alaskan gas pipeline said that he hired the public relations company of a former adviser to President Reagan to help him win White House endorsement of a proposal that would make financing of the project easier. **********The executive, John G. McMillian, a large financial contributor to the Democratic Party, said in an interview that he had retained the public relations-lobbying firm, the Hannaford Company, to improve his image with Republicans and to gain access to the White House and key Republicans. **********The proposal that Mr. McMillian wants approved could shift some of the pipeline's $40 billion cost to consumers before construction is completed. A Former Reagan Speechwriter **********The Hannaford Company is run by Peter D. Hannaford, a speechwriter and adviser to Mr. Reagan before Mr. Reagan became President. **********''Being able to talk to people who make the decisions is vital,'' said Mr. McMillian, the chairman and chief executive officer of the Northwest Alaskan Pipeline Company. The company heads a consortium of pipeline companies that plans to build the Alaskan segment of the 4,800-mile system, which would carry natural gas from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay through Canada and into the United States. **********Mr. Hannaford's firm, which was just one of several concerns hired by Northwest Alaskan to lobby for the pipeline financing plan, is being paid $2,000 to $3,000 a month, according to Mr. McMillian. Mr.  Hannaford became the focus of controversy recently when it was disclosed that he had bought a consulting firm, on an installment basis, from Richard V. Allen, the national security adviser. **********According to the White House, Mr. Hannaford's company arranged for Mr. McMillian to meet in the White House on Sept.22 with Edwin Meese 3d, the President's counselor. **********The Administration was then studying proposals for waiving some provisions of the Federal laws that apply to the pipeline project.  Mr. McMillian and other sponsors said that the waivers were needed to encourage private financing of the pipeline project. **********In a candid interview, Mr. McMillian said he was not ''ashamed'' that he had hired Mr. Hannaford's firm and other lobbyists and public relations firms to help him. He said it was ''part of doing business'' in Washington. ''Everybody does it,'' he added. President Endorsed Waivers **********Mr. McMillian and the White House said that Mr. Meese, who could not be reached today, made no commitments to him. Mr. Reagan endorsed the waiver proposal on Oct.6. **********The waiver package has been consistently criticized by some consumer advocates, including Ralph Nader.  In 1977, President Carter approved the pipeline project, but stipulated that it was to be privately financed.  He also specified that gas consumers could not be charged for construction costs until the system was finished. Furthermore, for antitrust reasons, his decision prohibited oil companies that owned Prudhoe Bay gas from owning part of the pipeline. **********The project consists of three segments. Under the waiver mechanism, if the system is not finished as of a date to be selected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, customers could be billed as each segment is completed. The sponsors acknowledged that consumers could be paying for the gas before the pipeline is finished. Such pre-billing, they contend, would assure their lenders that project debt would be repaid. **********The waiver also gives the Exxon Corporation, the Atlantic Richfield Company and the Standard Oil Company (Ohio) - the companies producing the gas - the right to own an equity interest in the line. **********Mr. McMillian and his supporters originally wanted to begin billing natural gas users for pipeline construction costs immediately. But the Reagan Administration demurred. **********Mr. McMillian's Sept.22 meeting with Mr. Meese, the President's counselor, was arranged by Daniel T. Kingsley, an executive vice president of the Hannaford Company. Craig L. Fuller, an aide to Mr.  Meese, said that Mr. Kingsley had called him and asked for the appointment. Mr. Fuller worked for Mr. Hannaford before joining Mr.  Meese's staff in January. **********Mr. Fuller and Mr. Mcillian said that Martin Anderson, who is Mr.  Reagan's chief domestic policy adviser, sat in on the meeting. Mr.  Hannaford did not attend, although Mr. Fuller recalled that Mr.  Kingsley did. **********''They didn't promise me anything,'' said Mr. McMillian. ''They just listened.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/27/business/sage-allen-co-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-may-2.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 44, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SAGE-ALLEN & CO INC reports earnings for Qtr to May 2", "print_headline": "SAGE-ALLEN & CO INC reports earnings for Qtr to May 2", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/15/business/air-wisconsin-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-march-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 45, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AIR WISCONSIN reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "print_headline": "AIR WISCONSIN reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/15/world/around-the-world-belfast-policeman-is-killed-as-rocket-smashes-vehicle.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Belfast Policeman Is Killed As Rocket Smashes Vehicle", "print_headline": "Around the World; Belfast Policeman Is Killed As Rocket Smashes Vehicle", "body_text": " **********One policemen was killed and several more were wounded this evening when their armored vehicle was ripped apart by an Irish Republican Army rocket, the police said. **********Meanwhile, another imprisoned Irish guerrilla, Robert McLaughlin, who is 29 years old, began a hunger strike today, taking the place of Francis Hughes, who died Tuesday after 59 days without food."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/05/world/haig-opens-tour-with-cairo-talks-pledges-efforts-for-a-mideast-peace.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1981-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 723, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HAIG OPENS TOUR WITH CAIRO TALKS, PLEDGES EFFORTS FOR A MIDEAST PEACE", "print_headline": "HAIG OPENS TOUR WITH CAIRO TALKS, PLEDGES EFFORTS FOR A MIDEAST PEACE", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State Alexander M.

The goal is to use the common concerns on strategic matters as a catalyst toward progress in peace talks. **********As to the situation in Poland, Mr. Haig was in touch with Washington throughout the 13-hour flight to keep up with the latest information. **********Mr. Haig indicated his concerns about Poland when he said on arrival: ''Unfortunately, my stop in Cairo this morning is clouded once again by growing tensions for peace and stability in Europe.'' **********The Secretary met early this evening with Foreign Minister Kamal Hassan Ali. American reporters traveling with Mr. Haig were invited to the Foreign Ministry before the session to receive a ''preview'' of the Egyptian point of view. **********The Egyptian position, as explained by a Foreign Ministry official, is that the Reagan Administration, by its stress on strategic matters was causing problems for itself and some of its friends in the region. **********Of particular concern to the Egyptians is the composition of the peacekeeping force that must be set up by April 1982 to patrol the Sinai peninsula after Israel makes its final withdrawal. **********The United States had said it was prepared to supply up to half the force, but Egypt urged Mr. Haig today to withdraw that offer and instead try to fill the force with contingents from other countries.  If there is a large American force in the peacekeeping group, Egypt will be criticized for allowing the Americans to replace Israel as the ''occupying power'' in Sinai, the official said. Israel Wants Large U.S. Role **********Israel, however, wants a 4,000-member force, preferably with many Americans, to insure its security. Until now, the United States, recognizing that it will be difficult to find volunteers for such a force, had thought that by publicizing its own willingness to participate it could persuade others to participate. **********The Egyptians are also concerned over the talk in Washington about setting up a permanent American ground force in the Middle East. If the United States has troops in the peacekeeping force, this could add to speculation that they were the first in a Middle East combat force and that Egypt was allowing the United States a Sinai ''base,'' the official said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/05/business/canada-trade-surplus.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canada Trade Surplus", "print_headline": "Canada Trade Surplus", "body_text": " **********Canada's September trade surplus fell to $65 million (Canadian) from August's upward-revised figure of $372 million and last September's $553 million, Statistics Canada said today.

French global strategic thinking agrees with that in the Pentagon on one important point: A Soviet attack on Western Europe is the most dangerous but at present least likely threat. The danger lies in proxy wars or limited Soviet interventions in the arc of land from Libya to Pakistan and in black Africa. **********Since 1973, French forces have intervened twice in Zaire and in Djibouti, Mauritania, Lebanon, Chad and the Central African Republic.

Five minesweepers in the squadron are, French sources said, the only Western ships of this type in the Indian Ocean. **********The 3,600 French troops in Djibouti are the largest Western land force within striking distance of the Persian Gulf area. The force has four infantry companies, 30 tanks in two squadrons and two batteries of field artillery and one of @antiaircraft artillery. Ten Mirage III-C fighters and 13 helicopters are the air component. **********Djibouti is across Bab el Mandeb from Southern Yemen, where there are Soviet and Cuban forces.

French intervention forces, however, are already organized in three major units that Westerners say are notable for their flexibility and powerful antitank weaponry. **********The largest unit, with a strength of 12,000, is the 11th Parachute Division in Corsica and southwest France. The second largest is the 7,000-member Ninth Division of marine infantry in Brittany. The 31st Brigade of 2,000 has been formed and equipped with tanks and other heavy weapons to support the other units. **********France's two aircraft carriers, the Foch and the Clemenceau, with their escorts and supply ships, would provide naval support for a major intervention. Nine transports and landing ships would carry the seaborne forces. **********France, like the United States, is short of long-range air transports.  The intervention force would have to depend on 50 Transall transports, which are twin-engine planes, and three DC-8's. The Government has ordered 25 second-generation Transalls, and military sources believe that these will double the force's lift capacity.  The new planes' performance is said to be similar to that of the American C-130, a tactical transport. Described as Highly Trained **********A French military estimate that may be optimistic is that today's landing forces would suffice for an operation by several regiments 3,700 miles from France. **********American and other NATO officers who have watched the intervention force on exercises say it is highly trained and motivated. It has more long-service soldiers than the forces stationed in France and West Germany, where conscripts predominate. The weapons and vehicles, while somewhat outmoded, have been chosen with an eye to conditions of war in third-world countries. **********The extent of French cooperation with the United States in the event of a crisis in Southwest Asia is difficult to estimate. The consensus among other NATO military and diplomatic sources is that any French involvement in strength would come only if the Government perceived a serious danger to French interests."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/30/world/around-the-world-canadian-voices-annoyance-with-us-over-acid-rain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canadian Voices Annoyance With U.S. Over Acid Rain", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Canadian Voices Annoyance With U.S. Over Acid Rain", "body_text": " **********Canada's Environment Minister, John Roberts, said here today that his Government was growing ''increasingly impatient'' with the failure of the United States to control acid rain. **********Mr. Roberts, who spoke at an environmental conference at Tufts University, said acid rain was polluting Canadian lakes and rivers, affecting trees and killing or harming wildlife.

Should they cash in their money market fund shares to lock in high yields on long bonds or sit tight - accepting reduced yields as interest rates retreat? **********United States Treasury bonds maturing in 25 years are enticing at current prices. For example, the 13 7/8 percent United States Treasury bond of 2006 now sells at a premium - $10,400 per $10,000 bond for a current yield of about 13 1/4 percent. **********Meanwhile, municipal bonds, which appeal to individuals in top tax brackets, are even more attractive. For example, the Municipal Assistance Corporation 10 5/8 percent bonds of 2008 are selling at about 85 for a current yield of about 12 1/2. The taxpayer in the 50 percent bracket would have to find a taxable bond yielding 25 percent for the same net result. **********With money market fund yields already down to 14 1/4 percent, many investors may wish to consider locking in high long-term yields.  In addition, should interest rates retreat further, prices of long bonds would appreciate substantially. Still, many investors will shy away from this devastated market, concerned that interest rates may move up again. Higher interest rates would produce paper losses and substandard yields for those who buy and hold long bonds today. **********Paul W.H. Trevor, who heads Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen, a money management firm in Manhattan with $100 million under management, favors long bonds for their high current yields and appreciation potential. **********He said that should prices weaken, he would buy more because his outlook was favorable for the longer term. However, anyone who fears a weakening is not ''locked in,'' he said, and can sell and redeploy assets. **********Mr. Trevor is a native of Britain. He attended high school in France and was graduated from the University of Virginia and the Columbia University Graduate School of Business. He has managed money since receiving his M.B.A. in 1951. **********Firmly convinced that inflation will moderate and that interest rates will ''trend downward'' over the next few months, Mr. Trevor is purchasing long-term Government bonds for his firm's pension accounts and tax-exempts for individual accounts. **********In a telephone interview he said that appreciation potential is greater in long bonds than it is in shorter maturities. If long-term interest rates decline by 100 basis points - one percentage point - the price of a 30-year bond would increase by roughly 8 to 9 percent, he said. By contrast, there is no appreciation potential in a money market fund, certificate of deposit or Treasury bill. **********Mr. Trevor acknowledged that a large Federal deficit might force the Treasury to issue so many securities that interest rates could be pushed up again. However, he said that the demand for credit in the private sector would probably go down more than it would rise in the public sector. **********''This happened in the 1974-1975 recession,'' he said. ''This was a period during which the deficit reached $100 billion, yet the interest structure came down. For example, the prime rate, which reached 12 percent in July of 1974, retreated to 6.75 percent by early 1976.'' **********He believes that a sharp recession would produce a deficit of $100 billion or more this time. Referring to the risks of long-term bonds - risks that have caused some to imply that long-term bonds are obsolete - he said that there were two basic problems. **********''If you buy long-term bonds today there is a risk that in the next two weeks they will go down on profit-taking,'' he said. ''The other and more fundamental risk is that we won't control inflation -that the Federal Reserve will become extremely expansionary and that therefore inflationary psychology will become rampant once again.'' **********Can the individual afford to take these risks? Mr. Trevor thinks so. ''I don't recommend bonds for their stability,'' he said. ''Bonds will continue to be volatile. I suggest bonds for those willing to take an equity-type risk for a higher relative total return over the next couple of years than they can expect in money market instruments, Treasury bills and even stocks. **********''As far as stocks are concerned, I believe they have more risk and less potential than bonds at present. I think that bonds are cheap relative to stocks. The yields on bonds are now about 25 percent higher than the yields on stocks in terms of earnings. That is, highgrade corporate bonds are offering yields of 13 3/4 percent while the earnings yield on Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks is about 11 percent. **********''This is close to the situation that existed before the big stock market break in 1974. This yield premium favoring bonds is justified only under one of two circumstances: one is a great fear of inflation, which I believe to be unjustified; the other is that you expect earnings on stocks to go up sharply, which I think unlikely in view of the recession.'' **********Mr. Trevor concludes that either bond prices will go up or stock prices will go down or, more likely, both will occur."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/02/business/taxes-complicated-by-changes-in-law.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Rankin", "pub_date": "1981-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1499, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Series", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TAXES COMPLICATED BY CHANGES IN LAW", "print_headline": "TAXES COMPLICATED BY CHANGES IN LAW", "body_text": " **********There is both good news and bad news for taxpayers who, with calculators and pencils at hand, are getting ready for the annual bout with their income tax returns. The 1980 forms are largely unchanged from last year's, which is something of a relief. But the task has been complicated by new legislation, including some bills enacted in the final days of last December, as well as by hundreds of court cases and rulings handed down last year that have clarified the tax treatment of certain issues and actually changed the rules in other cases. **********To be sure, the task was already complicated enough. The tax code runs to some 6,000 pages of fine print, and an industry of tax preparers, employing thousands of people, has sprung up to interpret its intricacies and help people through their tax returns. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service itself employs 85,000 workers, including almost 19,000 auditors, to monitor the system. **********With it all, the American tax system basically is one of voluntary self-assessment, in which the taxpayer is generally trusted to determine the money owed. **********And the system somehow manages to succeed. Despite grumblings over the millions of hours consumed in doing the returns - and concern over the estimated billions of dollars of revenue lost to tax cheating - the American tax system is nonetheless the envy of other industrialized countries. **********In the 1980 fiscal year, for example, the I.R.S. processed almost 91 million individual tax returns, levying $252 billion in taxes and refunding $34 billion. 'Bracket Creep' **********Individual tax rates for 1980 were not increased, which at first might seem to provide cause for rejoicing. But ''bracket creep'' - in which taxpayers are pushed into higher tax brackets solely because of wage increases they receive to keep pace with inflation -will increase the tax bite for many. **********To make matters worse, the latest increase in the Social Security levy will mean that middle-income workers will be paying an extra $387 each to the Government this year. Not only has the tax rate increased to 6.65 percent from 6.13 percent of earnings, but the amount of annual salary subject to the tax has risen to $29,700 from $25,900. The maximum tax is now $1,975. **********But there were many positive developments for taxpayers as well.  The Internal Revenue Service, for example, last year relaxed its position on outlays for weight control programs. It decided that such expenditures could be deducted as a medical expense as long as a person attends the program on a physician's orders, to cure or alleviate a specific ailment, such as hypertension. **********The I.R.S. also increased its mileage allowance for people who use their own cars for medical or charitable purposes. The allowance now is 9 cents a mile, up from 8 cents, retroactive to Jan. 1, 1980. The allowance for business use of a car was increased to 20 cents a mile from 18 1/2 cents for the first 15,000 miles, and to 11 cents a mile from 10 cents a mile beyond that. Reversal on Loans **********The revenue service also suffered a setback on its tough stance regarding interest-free loans. The courts rejected its contention that key employees who receive loans from their companies at low interest rates, or at no charge at all, must report the economic benefit as income. The court decisions, the latest in a string of defeats in this area for the I.R.S., strengthen the use of interestfree loans as a device for parents in high tax brackets to shift income to children in lower brackets. **********Although Congress passed no major tax legislation last year, it enacted several relatively narrow bills that may have great importance to taxpayers in special situations. Many people who sold property under deferred-payment arrangements, for example, may be able to postpone paying tax on the gain by taking advantage of liberalized new rules under the Installment Sale Revision Act. A prime candidate might be someone who sold a house last year and received part of the payment in 1980 and the rest in 1981. **********Previously, sellers could defer capital gains only if they received 30 percent or less of the selling price in the year of sale - a technicality that many sellers inadvertently overlooked. But **********This series was written with the assistance of Sidney Kess, who conducts a nationwide continuing education program on tax return preparation for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Mr. Kess, national tax partner in the accounting firm of Main Hurdman & Cranstoun, is adjunct professor of law at New York Law School. **********Under the act, which is retroactive to Jan. 1, 1980, anyone who does not receive payment in full can qualify for the installment method, regardless of the amount of the initial payment. **********In addition, Congress abolished the rule requiring that sellers receive at least two separate payments to qualify for the installment method. Now this treatment is available to those who receive one lump sum payment after the year of sale. **********''As a practical matter, for those who overlooked the tough previous rules, tax liability and ability to pay are synchronized,'' Sidney Kess, national tax partner with the accounting firm of Main Hurdman & Cranstoun, said in an interview. **********Furthermore, such treatment is now automatic. Previously, taxpayers who qualified had to elect to use the installment method. Now the presumption is that they will use the method unless they chose not to. Dividend Exclusion Doubled **********Although the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 deals mainly with the nation's energy problems, it contains several provisions of importance to the general public. The amount of dividends that taxpayers can exclude from income has been doubled, to $200 from $100 for single persons, and to $400 from $200 for married persons filing jointly. In addition, the exclusion has been broadened so that interest income from banks and savings and loan associations can be excluded, as well as dividends. In short, the first $200 of interest in savings accounts of single people is tax-free. **********The new exclusion goes into effect for the tax years of 1981 and 1982, so it does not help taxpayers now toiling over their 1980 returns. The law is scheduled to revert to its less generous provisions after 1982, but the betting is that under the Reagan Administration the larger exclusion will be retained, if not expanded. **********The act also enlarged the size of the ''renewable energy source'' credit, for such things as solar heating systems, to $4,000 from $2,200. In addition, it clarified the treatment of joint ownership of energy items qualifying for the credit. Previously, there was confusion about how much credit could be claimed by owners of adjacent condominium units, for example, who installed a commonly owned solar heating system. **********People who inherit property will also benefit from the act, which abolished the ''carry-over basis'' provisions that had been the pride of tax reformers. Now the law reverts to where it had been before the Revenue Act of 1976, when heirs who sold inherited property were able to increase the basis, or tax cost, of the property to its value on the date of death or, alternatively, six months later. This enabled them to escape paying tax on any appreciation of the property that had occurred during the lifetime of the deceased. **********The reform act had attempted to tax the appreciation by requiring the heir to ''carry over'' the deceased's original cost of the property, but protests that the law was unworkable prevented it from taking full effect. The windfall profit tax act decisively disposed of the matter. Stock Refund Opportunity **********The Technical Corrections Act of 1979 (which was not passed until April 1980) has created a possible refund opportunity for people who own Section 1244 stock, which is stock issued by new businesses. **********The Revenue Act of 1978 doubled the amount of ordinary losses that stockholders in defunct companies could deduct - to $50,000 if single and $100,000 if married filing jointly - but only for stock issued after Nov. 6, 1978. **********The corrections act says that, beginning in 1979, stockholders can claim such increased losses no matter when the Section 1244 stock was issued, even if the issue date was decades ago. ''So if you had a large 1244 loss in 1979 that was limited by the previous ceiling, you may be able to claim a larger loss by filing an amended return,'' Mr. Kess said.

Haig Jr. and Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, said today that the first high-level talks between the Chinese authorities and the Reagan Administration had gone ''very well.'' American officials said that Taiwan had not been a major issue of contention. **********At the start of the last day of talks, Mr. Deng, who is a deputy chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and in effect the nation's leader, told Mr. Haig through an interpreter in the presence of reporters: **********''I have heard that you had very good sessions with Foreign Minister Huang Hua.'' Mr. Haig said that the talks had gone ''very well'' and that the ''time was well used.'' The comments by the two sides were evidently meant to dispel speculation in some news reports that problems had arisen in connection with Chinese concern over United States policy toward Taiwan. **********Two aides to Mr. Haig were authorized to brief reporters in advance of the final round of talks today. They contended that, while the Taiwan issue had come up, it had not played a major part in the talks and had not given rise to any acrimony. **********As a result of the discussion about Taiwan, one American official said, ''the Chinese now have a richer understanding of our policy and that it is more sophisticated than they believed.'' **********The major focus in the talks, the official said, has been the global strategic positions of the United States and China and specific regional issues such as Cambodia and Afghanistan, in which both the Chinese and the Americans oppose what they call Soviet ''hegemonism.'' **********Yesterday, Mr. Haig's discussions concentrated on military and intelligence matters in what the American side said was ''a very friendly atmosphere.'' **********One of the participants in the talks said the Chinese side had been ''all hearts and flowers.'' The Chinese, he reported, were going out of their way to appear supportive on the strategic questions that Mr. Haig came to discuss and on seeking better coordination of policies against the Soviet Union. News Conference Scheduled **********Ever since Henry A. Kissinger made his first trip here in 1971 as President Nixon's envoy, there has been a custom of secrecy about the negotiations while they were going on, and this has rarely been breached. Mr. Haig, however, plans to hold a news conference before he departs for Manila tomorrow, and an American official promised that the Secretary would ''fill in some of the blanks.'' **********Other customs were also followed. While Mr. Haig was meeting with Chinese leaders, his wife, Patricia, made the two-hour trip to the Great Wall and climbed the steep path to the top. The Haigs and members of their party attended a ballet known as ''The Sword'' and many seemed to doze, a custom set by Mr. Kissinger, who once fell soundly asleep during another ballet. **********Mr. Haig began his day yesterday with a meeting of nearly four hours with Foreign Minister Huang, continuing the discussions that the two men began Sunday. Session Extended From 2 Hours **********The session was originally planned to last two hours, but was extended to give the two sides a chance for more detailed discussion of the issues, aides to Mr. Haig said later. **********Mr. Haig also met with Bo Yibo, a Deputy Prime Minister who is in charge of economic matters, to discuss trade, including the provision of technology that could be used for military purposes. **********Then Mr. Haig conferred with Defense Minister Geng Biao, who was accompanied by Zhang Zhunzi, a deputy chief of army intelligence.  Chai Chenwen, a senior official in the Defense Ministry, met with members of Mr. Haig's party, including Lieut. Gen. Vernon A.  Walters, former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency and now ambassador at large; Richard R. Burt, director of the State Department's Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs; Richard I.  Armitage of the Pentagon, and Gen. William Webb, military attache at the embassy here. Talks Reflect New U.S. Policy **********This is the first time a Secretary of State has held such militarily oriented talks with the Chinese, and it reflects a decision by the Reagan Administration to press forward as far as it can in cooperation with the Chinese against the Soviet Union. **********Mr. Haig's predecessors were always constrained by a desire for closer relations with Moscow and for progress in arms control issues, something not considered so crucial by Mr. Haig. **********He had said that he was ready to discuss the question of possible arms sales and cooperation in sharing of intelligence information with the Chinese if they expressed an interest, but it was not known whether such matters actually were discussed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/28/business/american-petrofina-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-march-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 37, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERICAN PETROFINA INC reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "print_headline": "AMERICAN PETROFINA INC reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/20/world/man-in-the-news-polish-chief-a-pragmatist.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 935, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POLISH CHIEF: A PRAGMATIST", "print_headline": "MAN IN THE NEWS; POLISH CHIEF: A PRAGMATIST", "body_text": " **********When Stanislaw Kania was first named as Poland's Communist Party leader in the wake of last summer's labor unrest, his first speech was read on Polish television by a dapper young announcer. A ripple of excitement passed through Warsaw: the new party secretary was attractive and young. Then the error was discovered, and people crowded the news kiosks to see what the new chief really looked like. **********That he did not read his first televised speech as party leader, and that so few people knew who he was, proved to be an unintentionally appropriate introduction to Mr. Kania, a career party functionary and security chief who has led Poland through a year of unceasing crises and who last night achieved the distinction of becoming the first Eastern European party leader to be confirmed in his post by a secret-ballot vote. **********A 1,311-to-568 Victory **********Poland's first independent party congress chose Mr. Kania over his only opponent, Kazimierz Barcikowski, a fellow Politburo member who shares Mr. Kania's moderate views. The vote was 1,311 to 568. Mr.  Barcikowski was nominated by the congress only yesterday; several other prospective nominees declined requests that they run. **********That Mr. Kania survived the tumultuous year, to say nothing of his re-election at wide-open party congress, was probably as much a result of his image as a colorless and modest bureaucrat as of his reputed skills at back-room maneuvering - and of pure chance. **********As recently as two months ago, the common wisdom in Warsaw was that Mr. Kania was politically finished. Moscow had begun showing signs of a loss of confidence in his leadership, the economy was steadily sliding downhill, liberals and hard-liners alike were demanding action, lawlessness was on the rise, and Solidarity, the independent trade movement, was pressing for more concessions. **********In early June, Moscow sent a stiff warning letter to the Polish party that included a sharp attack on Mr. Kania. It seemed an open call for his ouster, and at the Central Committee meeting of June 9-10 the hard-liners in the Polish party went on the offensive. Challenge to Leadership Fails **********But in a deft maneuver, Mr. Kania called for an open vote of confidence. The Politburo asked the 140-member Central Committee for a vote of confidence in each Politburo member. The proposal was rejected, as the Central Committee seemed to shy away from dramatic changes at a time of crisis. The challenge to Mr. Kania's leadership then withered. **********Mr. Kania emerged from the episode with a new gloss. He had beat back the hard-liners, and his defiance of Moscow gave him a new tinge of nationalism. In the wake of the Soviet challenge, his middle-of-the-road approach began to seem safer than the radical proposals of the reformers. Started as a Blacksmith **********Stanislaw Kania was born on March 8, 1927, to a peasant family in Wrocanka, near Jaslo, in southeastern Poland. An apprentice blacksmith when World War II broke out, he joined the resistance movement. Soon after the end of the war, he enrolled in what was then the Polish Workers' Party. **********Rising steadily through administrative posts, Mr. Kania was chosen after the bloody riots in northern Poland in 1970 to replace the security chief, Mieczyslaw Moczar. The same riots led to the ouster of Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief and to his replacement by Edward Gierek. **********Ten years later, it was Mr. Gierek who fell from power in a new wave of workers' disruptions, again over economic conditions. Mr.  Kania was named to the top post. **********Throughtout the last year of crises, Mr. Kania has remained largely out of public view, making few speeches or appearances. His predecessor, Mr. Gierek, led a conspicuously flashy life that ultimately aroused strong resentment and accusations corruption. Mr.  Kania, on the other hand, reportedly lives in the same modest flat that he had before becoming First Secretary. No Puns Concerning His Name **********Little is known of his family life. A bulky man who keeps his receding hair close-cropped, Mr. Kania has no known hobbies, and no anecdotes are told about him. His name in Polish is also the name of a popular edible mushroom, but even this has failed to generate any popular puns. At this year's May Day parade, Mr. Kania shunned the traditional grandstand and walked alongside ordinary marchers. **********In his politics, Mr. Kania is considered a conservative but pragmatic functionary who lacks imagination and creativity but believes in the basic doctrines of Communism. Although he is thought to have little sympathy for Poland's powerful Catholic Church or for dissidents, he has demonstrated an ability to compromise with both.  His political survival is attributed in large part to his success in staking out a middle ground and in seeking to forge a consensus. **********Mr. Kania's future will require more than political skills. His survival in office is likely to hinge on his ability to forge a functional economic program and then to push it through against the likely resistance of Solidarity and consumers. His struggle for reelection at the party congress suggested that he will have to work hard to achieve control over the party apparatus, and the Kremlin is not given to restoring lost confidences. **********But in contrast to his predecessors who raised great expectations on coming to office, Mr. Kania is returning to his post with few public illusions about the hardships ahead."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/26/world/baker-supports-added-advisers-for-el-salvador.html": {"writer_name": "Juan de Onis", "pub_date": "1981-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 738, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BAKER SUPPORTS ADDED ADVISERS FOR EL SALVADOR", "print_headline": "BAKER SUPPORTS ADDED ADVISERS FOR EL SALVADOR", "body_text": " **********Senator Howard H.

Long, Democrat of Maryland, chairman of the subcommittee, said the Administration wanted the current level of military aid, $10.4 million, increased by an amount between $25 million and $40 million. **********The United States now has 19 military advisers in El Salvador plus its regularly stationed military attaches. Mr. Long opposed sending the additional advisers, because he said the move would be seen in Latin America as ''gunboat diplomacy all over again.'' **********A debate over the Administration's plans to increase the military aid, particularly the issue of advisers, has intensified on Capitol Hill since the State Department began its campaign against what it describes as Soviet-bloc shipment of arms to left-wing guerrillas in El Salvador. **********Apparently because of a meeting between President Reagan and his economic advisers, the White House postponed a National Security Council discussion of plans for increasing military aid to El Salvador. The discussion may be rescheduled tomorrow or Friday. **********The Pentagon has prepared recommendations for sending new equipment, including patrol boats, helicopters, communications and radar, that would help El Salvador's armed forces cut off the flow of smuggled arms to the guerrillas. Former Ambassador Testifies **********Robert E. White, whom Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.  dismissed earlier this month as United States ambassador to El Salvador, told the foreign operations subcommittee that social reform and ''political reconciliation'' were the means to defeat the leftwing guerrillas. He also said that he opposed a major increase in military aid, asserting that it would weaken El Salvador's civilian leadership, headed by President Jose Napoleon Duarte. **********Mr. White said that Salvadoran security forces, in their campaign against the guerrillas and their sympathizers, had been responsible for killing at least 6,000 people, ''often just on suspicion.'' **********''Are we really going to send military advisers in there to be part of that kind of machinery?'' he asked.  In response to questions from Representative Jack Kemp, Republican of Buffalo, who defended the Administration's plans, Mr. White said that the ''Marxist-Leninist guerrillas'' lacked popular support and could be defeated by the Salvadoran armed forces, with modest United States arms supplies. **********Mr. White, a career diplomat who has not accepted reassignment to the State Department's corps of inspectors, also said that in January, while he was still ambassador, he opposed a Pentagon plan to send 75 military advisers to El Salvador. **********Also appearing before Mr. Long's subcommittee was John Bushnell, acting Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American affairs, who said that both economic and military aid increases would be necessary to assist El Salvador's Government in its campaign to defeat the leftist insurgency. Preference for Economic Aid **********The Salvadoran Government has said that economic aid would be of higher importance than military aid in the struggle against the guerrillas. While conceding that helicopters and communications equipment were needed, the country's military leaders have said that they could defeat the insurgents on their own. Both civilian and military officials in El Salvador say that the battle with the guerrillas is centered on social issues and that economic aid would help them win. **********The Carter Administration had approved $10.4 million in military aid to El Salvador, including an emergency shipment of ammunition, rifles, food rations and combat gear in January, after the Salvadoran armed forces had quelled a general uprising by the guerrillas. **********For the current fiscal year, the authorization of economic aid for El Salvador, a country of 4.5 million people, is $63 million.  Mr. Bushnell said that economic assistance would have to be increased, with the additional amount dependent on ''the further damage to the Salvadoran economy which the guerrillas are able to inflict'' and the response from other international lenders to El Salvador's requests for funds ''to reconstruct its economy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/25/business/450000-tons-of-corn-bought-by-soviet-union.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 516, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "450,000 TONS OF CORN BOUGHT BY SOVIET UNION", "print_headline": "450,000 TONS OF CORN BOUGHT BY SOVIET UNION", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union has bought 450,000 metric tons of United States corn for delivery after Sept. 30, the date a current five-year grain agreement between the two countries expires, the Agriculture Department said today. **********The disclosure came hours after an announcement that the United States and the Soviet Union would meet early next month in Vienna to talk over a possible new grain agreement between the two countries. **********Officials said the sales - the first to the Soviet Union since the curtailment of grain shipments was ended three months ago - were reported to the department by private exporters as part of the regular export reporting procedure. **********Although the five-year agreement expires Sept. 30, the United States told the Soviet Union at a meeting in London in June that it could buy, without more consultation, up to 3 million metric tons of corn and 3 million of wheat for delivery before Oct. 1. **********Also, the Russians were told then that they could buy ''reasonable quantities'' of grain for delivery on or after Oct. 1.

In 1979, before the American hostages were seized in Teheran, E.D.S. won a $19 million breach-of-contract suit against Iran. Four months ago, the company went back to the Federal court to protect that judgment against a transfer order. **********Enjoined by District Court **********A Federal District Court in Texas enjoined the Government from taking control of the $19 million. The Government has appealed that ruling to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, but E.D.S., which is headed by H. Ross Perot, a Dallas financier, was asking the Supreme Court, in effect, to skip the mid-level appeal and take up the case itself. **********The Justice Department, in a memorandum filed last week, told the Justices that it did not regard as subject to the release agreement those Iranian assets that had been won in court cases by American companies before President Carter froze all Iranian assets on Nov.  14, 1979. For that reason, the department said, E.D.S. was not actually affected by the subsequent Presidential orders and its case did not raise those legal questions that might need resolution by July 19. **********However, the Supreme Court will still have a chance to review the underlying issues. Dames & Moore, an engineering and research company based in Los Angeles, told the Court last week that it planned to bring an appeal this week from an adverse Federal court decision in California. Unlike E.D.S., Dames & Moore has claimed Iranian assets that apparently are subject to the July 19 transfer. **********Two E.D.S. employees were jailed by the late Shah's Government on Dec. 28, 1978, several months after Iran stopped making payments under a contract with the company, apparently in connection with allegations of corruption involving American companies and Iranian officials.

''We live and work here all the time and the worst we have is a little sore throat. The complaints in the press are lies.'' **********For almost two weeks a fire in the Santa Cruz Meyehualco dump has spewed soot and smoke across this sprawling city, bringing a public outcry. **********But the scavengers, known locally as ''pepenadores,'' resent the attention suddenly being given to the problem of disposing of 7,000 tons of urban waste each day. Garbage is their livelihood and almost any solution, such as construction of a new processing plant, is a threat. Payments Bought Protection **********The 7,000 or so pepenadores, though, are not without friends. As in many major cities, garbage is a lucrative business here, creating small fortunes for the officials and political bosses who control it. And by paying for the right to scavenge, the pepenadores have bought themselves protection. **********A job among the flies and rats and rotting food of the Meyehualco dump hardly seems like a privilege. Yet access to the scavengers' union is eagerly sought by the unemployed and tightly controlled by its leader, Rafael Gutierrez Moreno, who is also a member of Congress from the governing party. **********A powerful figure who is feared by his followers and does not welcome inquiries into his affairs, Mr. Gutierrez Moreno not only decides who will work in the dump, he also monopolizes the resale business. He takes the earnings on all the tin collected in the dump and receives a commission on other sales. **********In the 150-acre dump, a team of sturdy ''cabos,'' or corporals, assign scavengers to specific areas, reserving the freshest piles of garbage for those who give them small tips. They are also in charge of chasing away outsiders. ''Do you have permission to be here?'' 12-year-old Jose Ruiz asked a recent visitor. ''If not, you're in trouble.'' A Sharp Eye for Valuables **********The scavengers, most of whom live in shacks on the periphery of the dump, usually earn 150 to 300 pesos a day - $6.25 to $12.50 - but are sometimes luckier. ''You can find watches, gold chains, rings and other valuables thrown away by mistake,'' a pepenador explained.  ''You have to know how to look. It takes experience.'' **********But they complain bitterly about the drivers of the municipal garbage trucks who, they claim, remove the best items from the trash before it arrives at the dump. ''When there's a good load, you can hear the clink of bottles, tin and metal as it's tipped out,'' Mr.  Estrada Menendez, himself a cabo, explained, ''but most of the time, they bring little.'' **********On top of that, he said, the drivers charge the equivalent of a dollar to unload in a specific place.  The drivers, however, form part of a profit-making chain that begins with the street cleaner and ends with the pepenador. Garbage collection, although theoretically a public service with an annual budget of $3 million, has many of the trappings of private enterprise. Long Line of Entrepreneurs **********The street cleaner, for example, often accepts trash from homes and stores in exchange for a tip. He must then pay the truck drivers who empty his load. The drivers, in turn, charge to collect garbage on their rounds but pick out all salable items before driving to Meyehualco or Santa Fe, the city's other open-air dump. **********The 11,500 sanitation workers have their own union to defend their interests and pay monthly dues of $4.25, part of which is reportedly distributed among municipal officials in charge of garbage collection. **********Even before the recent fire in the Meyehualco dump, however, dissatisfaction with the sanitation service was growing. While streets are kept clean and garbage is collected in more affluent or commercial parts of town, city trucks rarely visit poorer districts where trash is often strewn on streets or dumped in open lots. **********But the Meyehualco fire, which began mysteriously on March 12 and quickly engulfed 40 acres of the dump, not only drew angry protests from residents but also highlighted the environmental disaster that the city is becoming. To the exhaust of two million vehicles and the smoke of hundreds of factories were added the sulfur dioxide fumes from Meyehualco. Reports of Invading Rats **********Newspapers had a field day, reporting that millions of residents were in peril, that hundreds of thousands of huge rats had invaded the neighborhoods around the dump and that the remains of numerous murder victims had been found by firemen among the smoking rubbish. **********The city authorities tried hard to play down the risks to the population, announcing daily for more than a week that the fire was about to be extinguished. But environmental officials conceded that sulfur dioxide levels in the air had increased tenfold and that toxic substances in some parts of the city were double those considered safe. **********Out of the crisis, though, came a new pledge by the city government to close down the 35-year-old Meyehualco dump, which was once on the southeast edge of the city but is now surrounded by poor neighborhoods. A new garbage-processing plant will be opened by next year, officials promised, and Meyehualco will be turned into a park. **********But the worried pepenadores are already preparing to protest.  ''We've lost a lot in the fire,'' one young man said, waving toward an expanse of blackened garbage. ''Now they want to take our jobs.  Our families have worked here since before I was born. What else can we do?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/14/business/american-international-group-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-march-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP INC reports earnings for qtr to March 31", "print_headline": "AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP INC reports earnings for qtr to March 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/27/world/solidarity-opens-the-second-phase-of-gdansk-parley.html": {"writer_name": "John Darnton", "pub_date": "1981-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 878, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOLIDARITY OPENS THE SECOND PHASE OF GDANSK PARLEY", "print_headline": "SOLIDARITY OPENS THE SECOND PHASE OF GDANSK PARLEY", "body_text": " **********The Solidarity union opened the second phase of its national convention here today with invited American labor leaders absent, with Soviet reporters watching like hawks and with moderates and militants clashing over the issue of workers' participation in the management of industries. **********Solidarity had invited three representatives of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., including Lane Kirkland, president of the 15-million-member organization, but they were not granted visas by the Polish Government.

But underneath was a growing dispute that threatens to preoccupy this second session, expected to last nine days. Compromise With Government **********At issue was a compromise that the union's leader ship offered to the Government over workers' participation in the management of industries. Some delegates grumbled that the leaders had no right to reach such an agreement without the approval of the congress or at least of the governing national commission. **********Only four union people, including Lech Walesa, Solidarity's chairman, were involved in the decision to seek a compromise. The formula that they agreed upon overcame an impasse on the question of which side - the workers or the state - should be empowered to hire and dismiss managing directors. **********The solution, to allow both sides to offer candidates and to retain the right to appeal to a court, broke a logjam of legislation that might set economic recovery in motion. Yesterday Parliament approved two bills, one of them including the compromise. **********Some union leaders, however, wanted to hold to an earlier position in which the workers would have the sole right to make managerial appointments and wanted to insist on a national referendum on the whole issue of worker self-management. The first phase of the congress had called for a referendum. **********Parliament Resisted Lead- ers **********Andrzej Celinski, who is secretary to Solidarity's executive body and is close to Mr. Walesa, termed the new law a ''victory.'' Pointing out that members of Parliament had resisted the Communist leadership's effort to water down the bill, he said such a spirit of independence had not been seen in the legislature in the last 36 years. **********But another union leader, Mieczyslaw Gil, who was Solidarity's chief negotiator on the issue, said the law was clearly ''not satisfactory.'' He suggested that the authorities were out to provoke a confrontation. **********Another said that the congress was the union's ''supreme authority'' and that its earlier resolution should not have been violated - a position that many delegates seemed to agree with. **********Privately, top leaders in the union said they expected heated arguments in the coming days. But they were confident the compromise arrangement would stand.

The list included cuts for small business, rural development, exports, fishing vessels, trade adjustment, merchant ships and rail rehabilitation. **********The White House also called for complete elimination of guarantees for biomass energy development, defense production and community development. **********In addition, the White House said that Mr. Reagan wanted to reduce guarantees issued for rural electrification and telephone service by $1 billion, or nearly 20 percent, but could not do so without legislation. Intention Stated Previously **********The White House list of cuts in loan guarantee commitment to be issued in the fiscal year 1982, which began Oct. 1, provided the detail to support the President's Sept. 24 statement of intentions. **********Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist of the Office of Management and Budget, told reporters that ''this is a first step'' and that further curtailments would be made for the fiscal years 1983 and 1984. **********The Administration wants to shrink Federal guarantees of private loans, Mr. Kudlow said, because such loans, no less than Treasury borrowing to finance the budget deficit, ''pre-empt private capital and saving.'' **********The Reagan Administration, like the Carter Administration, has said that so-called off-budget borrowing by the Treasury and the issuance of Federal loan guarantees as a substitute for Federal dollars had grown rapidly in the 1970's and gotten out of hand. Rapidly Growing Involvement **********The White House contended that by borrowing directly and by assisting private borrowing, Washington now was ''absorbing'' more than 40 percent of the supply of credit available to nonfinancial borrowers, against 5 percent from 1955 to 1969 and 15 percent in the 1970's. **********Mr. Kudlow asserted that by reducing its role in credit markets, the Government would help make credit generally more available and would contribute to a decline in interest rates, all of which would help home buyers and business borrowers. However, those who lose access to subsidized interest rates - or to all credit -were expected to reply that the disadvantages to them would far outweigh the benefits. **********The largest single curtailment was $16 billion, or 25 percent, for mortage guarantees issued by the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae. Its guarantees make blocks of mortgages more attractive to investors, thereby bringing fresh money into financial institutions that originate home loans. **********Jack Carlson, executive vice president of the National Association of Realtors, said the loss of Ginnie Mae guarantees would make it harder for buyers of existing houses to find financing. The White House said that the effect on construction of new houses would be slight because Ginnie Mae loans account ''for less than 5 percent of financing for new housing construction.'' **********Other large cuts included $1 billion, or a 20 percent reduction, for the Small Business Administration and $1.2 billion, or 14.6 percent less, for the Export-Import Bank. **********Officials said that they believed the President's authority to limit loan guarantees did not violate anti-impoundment provisions of the 1974 budget act but that the question had not come up before and might be tested in the courts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/18/business/intercontinental-diamond-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 88, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERCONTINENTAL DIAMOND CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "INTERCONTINENTAL DIAMOND CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/31/business/radiant-technology-inc-reports-earnings-for-yr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 46, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RADIANT TECHNOLOGY INC reports earnings for Yr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "RADIANT TECHNOLOGY INC reports earnings for Yr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/business/hj-heinz-net-gains-3.4.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 151, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "H.J.

Mr. Osman is now a Deputy Prime Minister with broad powers and complete access to President Sadat.

Mr. Sadat has ordered a special committee of Parliament to investigate the charges and denials. The committee, which one Government official said would be mired for a long time in closed hearings, is to begin its inquiry next week. **********One of Mr. Osman's charges was that President Nasser's daughters had paid only $8,600 for houses worth about $140,000. The charge has been denied by Ashraf Marwan, a former Sadat favorite who is married to one of President Nasser's daughters. Mr. Marwan, speaking for the Nasser family, said he planned legal action ''to stop all defamatory charges reflecting on our honor and reputation.'' **********Mr. Osman also charged that a former Prime Minister of Egypt was involved in a real estate scam in which Cairo property was sold at a fifth of its value to non-Egyptian interests in exchange for shares in business ventures. **********The former Prime Minister, Abdel Aziz Hegazi, has said he will document his innocence before the committee of Parliament investigating the matter. Mr. Hegazi served as Mr. Sadat's Prime Minister from 1974 to 1975, when he was dismissed without public explanation. **********Financial chicanery and skimming is not at all rare in Egypt.

Botha to threaten to confiscate his passport. **********''Given the opportunity again, I will repeat precisely what I have said,'' the outspoken black cleric said. He then proceeded to do so at a news conference in which he said again that economic pressure from abroad was necessary if South Africa's racial conflicts were to be resolved by peaceful means. The Bishop, an Anglican, is General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches. **********Not long after Bishop Tutu's news conference, Mr. Botha appeared at a rally in Cape Town, where he reiterated his determination to lift the cleric's passport. **********''When you travel on a passport granted to you, you must behave,'' Mr. Botha said. ''You cannot use the privilege granted to you and then misuse it to organize boycotts against your country. I repeat, Bishop Tutu's passport will definitely be withdrawn.'' Favored for Peace Prize **********Six hours after his arrival at Jan Smuts Airport, Bishop Tutu still had his passport. Some Afrikaans-language newspapers have observed that the confiscation of Bishop Tutu's passport might help to enhance his chance of winning the Nobel Peace Prize, for which he has reportedly been nominated. **********But Mr. Botha's threat came in the midst of a political campaign - the all-white electorate goes to the polls in three weeks - and it seemed likely that it would have to be made good, if only to prevent right-wing opponents from declaring that the Government had backed down in the face of international pressure. Bishop Tutu's last stop was Rome. **********The encouragement of disinvestment by foreign companies or economic sanctions against South Africa can be defined as ''terrorism'' under South African law. Bishop Tutu has stopped short, therefore, of saying what sort of ''economic pressure'' he would like to see the West impose. Asked about the response he got from officials he met, he threw back his head and laughed. ''There was a fair degree of coyness,'' he said. Two Answers for Whites **********A reporter from the South African Broadcasting Corporation asked whether blacks would not suffer most in the unlikely event that the West heeded the kind of pleas that the Bishop has been making. He had been asked that question by a number of foreigners, Bishop Tutu said, and always replied that there were two answers that blacks give. **********''You benefited from black cheap labor, black migratory labor, black misery,'' he said, repeating the first of them. ''How can you so suddenly become altruistic and now suddenly worry about black suffering when you have benefited from them for so long? **********''That is the rougher answer,'' he went on. ''The nicer answer is to say that blacks are suffering now.'' Having a passport confiscated, the Bishop said, was not the worst thing that could happen to a Christian. Even getting killed was not the worst thing. ''For me one of the worst things would be if I woke up one day and said to people, 'I think apartheid is not so bad,' '' the Bishop said to general laughter. He was still laughing himself when he said, ''For me that would be worse than death.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/13/world/carter-says-possibility-that-hostages-will-be-freed-now-looks-better.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1981-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1067, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CARTER SAYS POSSIBILITY THAT HOSTAGES WILL BE FREED NOW 'LOOKS BETTER'", "print_headline": "CARTER SAYS POSSIBILITY THAT HOSTAGES WILL BE FREED NOW 'LOOKS BETTER'", "body_text": " **********President Carter said today that the possibility of freeing the hostages in Iran before he leaves office ''looks better,'' but he cautioned that he was still unable to predict success in the negotiations. **********With only four days left before the Administration's self-imposed deadline for dealing with the crisis, the President's comments to reporters reflected the wariness of officials at the White House and State Department about the latest developments in Teheran, which have stirred hope among some officials here that a breakthrough might be near. **********In Teheran, the Government introduced two pieces of emergency legislation in Parliament to help expedite an agreement. One would authorize the Government to conduct binding arbitration regarding claims against Iran's frozen assets in the United States; the other would ''nationalize'' the wealth of the late Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi and 53 of his relatives. This last bill was apparently drawn up with an eye toward United States court cases in which Washington has agreed to seek waivers of laws protecting the property of former monarchs. **********(On Tuesday, the Iranian Parliament was forced to postpone action until Wednesday because not enough members of Iran's Council of Guardians were present.) **********Several American officials said that the statements of the Iranian authorities today appeared to indicate a sincere desire to resolve the crisis by the time Mr. Carter leaves office a week from tomorrow. But virtually every official also reminded reporters of previous hopes raised during the 14-month crisis only to be dashed later. Christopher Remains in Algiers **********Deputy Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher remained in Algiers for the fifth day, keeping in contact through the Algerian Government with the three-man Algerian team of intermediaries in Teheran. **********Mr. Carter, outside a Washington restaurant, said he had spoken by phone earlier with Mr. Christopher. ''It looks better, but I can't predict success,'' he said. ''That depends on them. We made a reasonable offer.'' **********John H. Trattner, the State Department spokesman, repeated again today that Mr. Christopher still was reporting that ''serious problems remain.'' Intermediaries Are Praised **********In Algiers, Mr. Trattner said Mr. Christopher called on President Chadli Benjedid of Algeria to express American appreciation for the ''high sense of propriety, the impartiality and discretion'' of the intermediaries. Mr. Trattner said that the courtesy call did not signal a breakthough or an end to the negotiations. **********The almost daily repetition of ''serious problems remain'' has become the Administration's diplomatic shorthand for saying that Iran has not replied formally to the latest American proposals. Until a formal reply is received and until it becomes clear that the two sides are officially in agreement, officials say the United States has to regard the positions as being far apart. **********Various indirect signals, including the questions asked by Iran about the most recent American proposals, have led officials to believe that Iran has substantially altered its position to bring it closer into line with that of Washington. But until a formal response is received, Mr. Trattner said, this could only be regarded as conjecture. **********Crucial to any breakthrough would be Iran's formal agreement to free the hostages before it has gotten back all the money it has claimed was frozen by the United States. Earlier, Iran had sought $14 billion, but now, according to officials, Teheran seems to be willing to accept the American estimate that only $9.5 billion was frozen. **********Judging by the legislation introduced in the Iranian Parliament today, Iran also may be willing to free the hostages with only assurances of receiving $5.5 billion simultaneously and $1.8 billion within a week or so, making a total of $7.3 billion that would be promptly available to Iran. Claims Appear to Be Lower **********The legislation introduced in Parliament would allow Iran to agree to binding international arbitration of the remaining $2.2 billion in frozen assets that are claimed by Americans. Until now, Iran has said it would not free the hostages until all the money was returned or an equivalent amount placed in escrow. **********Timing is a problem. Unless Iran responds officially in the next four days in a way that is completely acceptable to Washington, officials say the Administration will not have enough time before Inauguration Day to assemble the necessary assets to send to Algiers for eventual transfer to Iran in return for the simultaneous release of the hostages. **********If Iran delays or introduces some new element it is likely that the crisis will have to be turned over to the Reagan administration. **********---- Christopher Awaits Decision Special to the New York Times **********ALGIERS, Jan. 12 - American negotiators and Algerian intermediaries here anxiously awaited the outcome today of the debate in the Iranian Parliament on proposals for solving the hostage problem. **********The American team, headed by Deputy Secretary of State Warren M.  Christopher, and the Algerian Government both maintained strict official silence on the progress of the negotiations, fearing that a statement might be misinterpreted in Iran and jeopardize a settlement. **********However, Algerian sources close to the negotiations expressed relative optimism that an accord was within reach, barring lastminute complications in the Iranian Parliament. On the American side, it was stressed that a decision by Mr. Christopher to postpone his return to Washington was ''an encouraging sign.'' ---- Reagan Gets Optimistic Report Special to the New York Times **********LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12 - President-elect Ronald Reagan said today that he had received reports showing a ''reason for optimism'' regarding the hostages, and he said he thought President Carter was negotiating for their release ''on the basis that we can all agree to.'' **********But Mr. Reagan repeated previous comments that he would not automatically agree to anything Mr. Carter negotiated without inspecting it first. ''I hope and pray and I think that the President is negotiating on a basis that we can all agree to,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''On the other hand, I don't think anyone should be asked to sign a blank check.'' **********Asked to comment on President Carter's remark that things were looking up for the hostages, Mr. Reagan said: ''Well, I understand that there is optimism, and I have my fingers crossed, and hope there's reason for it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/business/the-return-of-the-radio-network.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Feinberg", "pub_date": "1981-04-12", "snippet": "S OMEWHERE back in the murky days of yesteryear, decades before the advent of Laverne and Shirley and Archie and Edith, network radio ruled the air waves.

Now, while much of the media world stands agog at the upheavals to be wrought by new video technologies, a curious radio revolution is occurring. The old radio networks are storming back, and new ones are being formed at an astonishing pace. **********Within just the last two weeks, four new networks were announced, two each by the RKO Radio Network and the Satellite Music Network.  Last November, the Wall Street Journal's 50-city radio network went on the air and in January a sports network called Enterprise Radio began. The impetus? Advertising. Network radio is one of the fastestgrowing large advertising media, having increased its billings 23 percent in 1980, to $157 million, and in the first quarter this by more than 25 percent. **********As yet, such spending isn't much of a threat to competing media - the advertising bill in the United States last year was $54.75 billion. But the amount of programming that radio networks offer their affiliates has grown enormously since the 1960's when the four existing networks - ABC, CBS, NBC and the Mutual Broadcasting System - were primarily news services. By the end of this year there should be 19 national radio networks, many of them feeding programming such as concerts, sports events, talk shows and dramas. **********Generally, radio networks send their affiliates programming that contains national commercials and free time to be sold to local advertisers. Networks usually pay affiliates ''compensation'' - an average 17 percent of billings -for airing their shows and commercials. **********''Network radio is exploding,'' says Ira Berger, network supervisor at the Needham, Harper & Steers ad agency in Chicago. ''Much of its increased billing is coming directly out of network TV because the price of TV has gotten so high that many advertisers are looking for ways to spend more efficiently. Network radio can be a very good, fairly cheap way of covering the whole country.'' **********There is something resembling irony here. Three of the radio networks luring dollars away from network television have initials that most television viewers would recognize. **********The new radio networks are appealing to advertisers much as magazines and cable television do, by cultivating particular demographic groups, which are hard to target through network television. Two radio networks cater to blacks and one is aimed at physicians. **********''In 1960 we were a terrible medium,'' says Robert M. Chambers, general manager of the ABC Radio Networks. ''In recent years we've put more emphasis on programming because the advertisers want it and the affiliates demand it. Stations want something from us - concerts, lifestyle features, etc., that will distinguish them from the guy across the street who's playing the same records.'' **********Indeed, the RKO Radio Networks' president, Thomas F. Burchill, contends that increased competition between radio stations has helped spur the resurgence of radio networks. **********''In 1968,'' he says, ''there were 4,000 radio stations. Ten years later there were almost 8,000, mostly because of the growth of FM.  Now stations need additional resources to compete effectively, and many things they can't afford to produce themselves.'' **********These days ''instant'' radio networks are often formed by program syndicaters in conjunction with advertising agencies. (Satellite transmission is making this much simpler.) These networks transmit programming only infrequently and their ''affiliates'' can vary extensively from week to week. Regional networks, such as what Phil Rizzuto calls ''the New York Yankees baseball network'' are also popular. Finally, many radio sales concerns will put together an unwired national network for advertisers willing to sponsor different shows in dozens of cities. **********Network executives have learned from the success of radio syndicators that concert specials invariably improve ratings. This year, RKO will present at least 12 of them and ABC, which aired just one in 1978, will broadcast 100. **********There's a special reason for RKO's entry into network radio. Mr.  Birchill says the company feared that Federal Communications Commission rulings might prevent it from growing in the stationoperating business. In the late 70's, RKO General was worried that the F.C.C. might strip it of all its television and radio stations as retribution for filing false financial reports with the commission and, more importantly, because its parent, General Tire & Rubber, had confessed to making many improper payoffs at home and abroad and had been accused by the F.C.C. of forcing its customers to buy commercial time from RKO. In January 1980, the commission refused to renew three RKO television station licenses. The case is now in the courts. **********Profits can flow very fast in the network business. Mr. Burchill says RKO I became profitable after just 10 months. Bill Rasmussen, creator of the Enterprise sports network and the ESPN Cable TV sports network, says his radio operation, featuring a daily sports talk show that lasts an astounding 13 hours, will be in the black by the end of this year. Industry sources say that most networks yield returns of 20 to 25 percent per year, which helps explain the new interest. Mr. Burchill projects network revenues of at least $330 million by 1985, and perhaps as much as $500 million. **********N O radio network sounds more futuristic than the Satellite Music Network, created by Kent Burkhart, an Atlanta-based radio consultant, in partnership with John Tyler & Associates of Dallas; Midwest Broadcasting, owner of WCCO Radio in Minneapolis, and United Video of Tulsa. This summer Mr. Burkhart plans to introduce two 24-hour-a-day networks, one playing adult pop (Barbra Streisand, Barry Manilow) and the other contemporary country (Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers). The twist here is that the disk jockeys would chatter to an entire nation. **********''We'll get revenue,'' says Mr. Burkhart, ''by selling two minutes per hour to national advertisers and by charging stations for using the service. For a local station, the economies are striking. They can cut their payroll dramatically. Many radio stations are getting hurt badly by rising costs and they need help. I expect two or three competitors by the end of the year, and eventually I think half the stations in the country will get their programming this way.'' **********Mr. Burkhart is encouraged by two statistics. More than 1,000 radio stations already devote most, if not all, of their broadcast hours to playing syndicated tapes, most often containing what is called ''beautiful music.'' And, according to 1979 F.C.C. figures, only 60 percent of commercial radio stations are profitable. **********The Big Four radio networks have not been caught sleeping. With the exception of Mutual, all are contemplating the creation of new networks. At NBC, Chuck Renwick was just given the full-time job of developing new networks and network services. Having lost almost $15 million in the mid-70's on its News and Information Service network, NBC rebounded well in 1979 by successfully starting a second full network, The Source, a lively blend of news, features and occasional music aimed at the 18-to-34 audience. By the end of the year NBC will broadcast a five-hour block of talk shows and is trying to create a network for women. **********CBS has been aggressively adding affiliates, sports events and life-style features. Its ''Mystery Theater'' has not exactly brought a return to the golden age of radio drama but it is doing moderately well. **********ABC has been investigating country and ''beautiful music'' networks. With 1,750 affiliates, ABC is the most profitable radio network, largely because it had the good sense in 1968 to split into four demographic segments - FM, Contemporary, Information and Entertainment. **********''It took a long time to get our story across to advertisers and agencies,'' is how ABC's Robert Chambers explains some rough years.  ''That's not quite the way I see it,'' says Gene DeWitt, director of media services (U.S.A.) for the McCann-Erickson ad agency. ''The radio networks kind of lucked out. The gouging by the TV networks drove dollars into their pockets. Nonetheless I'm thrilled with all the new programming they're doing.'' **********But Mr. DeWitt and a spokesman for Mutual, which is owned by the Amway Corporation, believe this luck may now hold.  ''The radio programming market is about to break open,'' says the Mutual spokesman. ''Eventually, local stations will receive a vast cornucopia of quality programming from the networks, and it's conceivable that very soon a station might take programming from many network sources.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/20/business/slaughter-brothers-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SLAUGHTER BROTHERS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "SLAUGHTER BROTHERS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/27/business/brokers-divided-on-mergers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1436, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BROKERS DIVIDED ON MERGERS", "print_headline": "BROKERS DIVIDED ON MERGERS", "body_text": " **********Wall Street leaders appeared divided about the recent wave of brokerage house mergers as they gathered here today for the semiannual convention of the Securities Industry Association. **********Executives of large brokerage firms expressed cautious optimism about the Prudential Insurance Company's purchase of Bache Group Inc. and the American Express Company's bid to acquire Shearson Loeb Rhoades Inc. But most heads of smaller regional firms were sharply critical of such mergers. The move toward consolidation, most delegates agreed, portended a major reshaping of the way financial services are provided in America. **********''It's too easy to say that these mergers will create a great delivery system for a set of yet-to-be-born products or already existing products that fit,'' said William J. Kneisel, a principal on the syndicate desk at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''What it's really going to mean in terms of financial services and new approaches is going to take a while to sort out.'' **********Comments From Delegates **********Asked whether the emergence of large financial institutions was a threat to independent brokerage houses, Watson B. Dabney, president of J.J.B. Hillard, W.L. Lyons Inc., a large regional concern based in Louisville, Ky., said: ''It doesn't mean that it's the end of small brokerage firms any more than it means the end of small banks. That's like saying that if you went across state banking lines, there would be nobody left but Manny Hanny, Citicorp and Morgan and so on.'' **********H. Virgil Sherrill, president of Bache Halsey Stuart Shields, which is owned by Bache Group, commented on the merger with Prudential.  ''All the reaction I've had from everybody has been extremely positive,'' he said. ''I would say that maybe most of my competitors are just being complimentary, but they've all been very encouraging.'' **********During interviews in New York and Bermuda, several executives, particularly from small and medium-sized regional firms, expressed skepticism about consolidation. Some Prefer Independence **********''I'm just glad nobody wants to take us over,'' said Peter Eichler, president and chief executive officer of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc., based in Los Angeles. ''I think there may be some others to follow, but most of the firms out here would prefer to remain independent. **********''Unfortunately, the financial strength in this country is so heavily concentrated in the large insurance companies and the banks - their economic muscle far outdistances anything we have in the securities industry - that we are prey to these large offerings.'' Mr. Eichler added, ''I think we would be just as well to keep the business for ourselves. I hope this doesn't constitute a trend.'' **********Sanford C. Bernstein, chairman and president of Sanford C.  Bernstein & Company, said, ''I think it's going to become a more dehumanized business for the people involved in the conglomerate mergers.'' **********Mr. Bernstein questioned whether reshaping the financial industry would ultimately lead to better service to the public. As a result of this ''dehumanized budget environment,'' he said, ''There's going to be a greater stress on profits: The firms that are involved in these mergers are going to be driven more by money than service.'' **********He cited his firm's experience with tax shelters, the sort of service that one-stop financial groups might be expected to offer.  ''Our firm has refused to sell tax shelters,'' he said. ''That doesn't mean that we've seen every one of them and that there aren't some good ones being sold, but a lot of the ones being sold are not products that we'd put our name to. Conglomerates are going to push these kinds of products.'' **********This sentiment was echoed by W. Leslie Douglas, vice president of Folger Nolan Fleming Douglas Inc., of Washington. ''If an insurance or finance company buys a brokerage firm, the customer will be deluged with the offering of more services, most of which he won't want or need.'' he said. Outlook for the Customers **********Donald B. Marron, president of Paine Webber, is typical of executives who regard the mergers as harbingers of a new competitive environment on Wall Street. ''I think it's a very good thing for the customers,'' he said. ''We have an oligarchy in this industry. A small number of firms have a dominant role in the marketplace, and to compete in this environment is to improve the quality of your services. What this ought to do is provide a wider range of services and quality organizations at fair prices.'' **********Many of the executives from smaller firms felt that some employees, particularly stockbrokers, would be reluctant to work in large financial institutions. **********William C. Roney Jr., marketing partner with Wm. C. Roney & Company in Detroit, said: ''There are a lot of people who are not going to want to work for a giant company because most good people in our business have a pretty high entrepreneurial spirit, and I think they're likely to feel somewhat submerged in that sort of environment. Maybe bigger isn't always best.'' **********The effect that such mergers might have on the working environment at large brokerage firms also stirred some skepticism from Mr.  Eichler of Bateman Eichler. ''I think a lot of people are not going to want to be joining Shearson or Bache because they are subsidiaries of American Express or Prudential,'' he said. ''It might help them in capital, and it might be an aid to the underwriting side of our business, but I don't think it will help them necessarily in the brokerage part.'' A Personalized Operation **********As a group, however, people at most of the smaller regional firms seem optimistic about their future as independent brokerage houses.  Warren H. Berl, chairman of the Sutro Group, with headquarters in San Francisco, said: ''I believe that there is a certain element out there that would prefer to do business with a more personalized kind of operation then with one of the major service stations such as appears to be forming. I think that will probably increase the potential for a big regional firm, such as we are, in doing business with the individual client.'' **********Mr. Berl predicted that ''some of the major firms will go the way of Shearson and Bache, and others will go in the opposite direction - the Dean Witters and E.F. Huttons could very well buy an insurance company, for example, rather than being absorbed.'' **********Stephen Putnam, president of F.L. Putnam & Company, Boston, said that the recent merger activity ''obviously brings a great deal of capital to bear behind the brokerage dealers involved, and from that point of view, it could strengthen the industry.'' He added, ''I don't think it changes the outlook for regional firms significantly.'' **********Benjamin F. Edwards 3d, president of A.G. Edwards & Sons, a St.  Louis house widely cited as a possible takeover candidate, said: ''We plan to continue in the brokerage business. If other people want to diversify out of other businesses, that's fine with us.'' Role of Specialized Firms **********Felix G. Rohatyn, a partner at Lazard Freres & Company, said, ''From the point of view of a small and rather specialized firm, I don't think those particular mergers are going to have that much of an impact, because the services that we render to corporate clients are fairly specialized and depend on a few individuals within the firm, and that isn't going to change in my judgment.'' **********But he and others believe that the acquisitions are likely to increase pressure on Congress to soften the Glass-Steagall Act, which in effect bars banks from underwriting corporate securities. **********''The next step, which may be much more threatening, will be pressure from the large banks to either amend or repeal the Glass-Steagall Act and come into our industry directly either by acquiring firms or setting up their own,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. ''That would probably change the nature not only of the securities industry but also of our underlying economic structure. That would be quite significant and probably would lead us toward the German and Japanese relationships between the banks and industry.'' **********John B. Madden, a partner with Brown Brothers, Harriman & Company, remarked: ''A lot of people say you should put reserves on money funds and that sort of thing. Rather than doing that, you ought to free the banking industry from the restraints under which they have been placed and let everybody get out.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/26/business/chase-loan-policies-draw-fire.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 297, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHASE LOAN POLICIES DRAW FIRE", "print_headline": "CHASE LOAN POLICIES DRAW FIRE", "body_text": " **********Representative Benjamin S.

Eagleburger, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, attributed the problems at least in part to clashing views on the benefits of detente with Moscow. ''Detente for you, for Berliners, for Germans, has made a difference,'' he said in Vienna, ''but for us, detente has been a failure.'' **********A high French official, who did not want to be identified and whose remarks were typical of those heard in Europe, spoke of a deeper security problem. ''The United States used to represent protection from risk,'' he said in an interview in Paris. ''Now you represent protection and risk - or, to many Europeans, just risk.'' **********In many interviews over several weeks in Bonn, Paris, London and Washington, no one predicted that the current situation would prove unmanageable if the alliance could adapt politically to changes that seem certain to take place, among them increasingly divergent views on how to manage relations with the Soviet Union and how to handle change in the third world. **********The Economist, an influential London weekly, said recently in an editorial that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was in ''the early stages'' of a ''terminal illness.'' Seymour Weiss, a key consultant to the Reagan Administration, said for quotation what several of his official colleagues would say only privately: ''If there were no workable NATO in three years, I wouldn't be surprised.'' **********To old hands of the Atlantic alliance, it is nothing new to have a yearly ''crisis'' over a problem: how to conduct relations with Moscow, the risks and morality of stationing nuclear weapons in Europe, the role of NATO outside the European theater, the possibility of American troops being withdrawn from Europe or whether NATO members are all paying their fair share of the common military burden. **********What is new this time is that nearly all these issues are back, all at once, and are far more difficult to cope with because of a new element of ideology. **********Ideological politics have been reborn on the left in Europe and on the right in the United States, making for sharply divergent world outlooks and generating deep mutual suspicions. **********The left in Europe - the British Labor Party, the left wing of the West German Social Democratic Party and the Socialist Party in France, for example -seemed to many of those interviewed to be returning to earlier ideological roots centering on issues such as disarmament, workers' solidarity across national lines, help to oppressed nations and peoples and peaceful resolution of conflicts.  In the Reagan Administration, the roots run to a fervent nationalism and a kind of traditional isolationism. Key figures such as Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger and Richard V. Allen, the national security adviser, have far less patience with and tolerance of European views than their predecessors did. They are much more prepared to pursue a steady anti-Soviet line with or without the Europeans. Tone of Statements at Issue **********Allied governments have been pressing the Reagan team to moderate its polemics, which European leaders see as needlessly militaristic and playing into the hands of Moscow's ''peace offensive.'' Their goal, like that of many people in the State Department, is to quiet things down, so that problems that predated the Reagan Administration can be addressed. **********Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. is known to be so concerned about these attitudes that he now plans to address the issues that concern the Europeans in a speech to the Foreign Policy Association in New York City on Tuesday. **********But there are powerful figures in the Administration who continue to fight any change in approach. In private, many of them call Europeans ''Vichyite'' in a reference to the French who collaborated with Hitler, ''neutralists'' and ''pacifists,'' and contend that ''shock treatment,'' not conciliatory language, is necessary to shape them up. **********Even Mr. Haig, a former commander of NATO known for his understanding of West European attitudes despite his harsh public statements about the Russians, has made clear in private that he, too, is worried about trends in European thinking. Unlike many people in the White House and Defense Department, however, he is against threats and shock tactics and prefers quiet pressures. Delay in Policy Toward Europe **********By all accounts, the Administration has not begun to prepare an overall plan for managing relations with the European allies. The reason for this, according to some senior Administration officials, is that the approach toward Europe needs to be derived from the approach toward the Soviet Union, and not the other way around, and nothing that could really be called a policy toward Moscow has been agreed upon. **********There have always been differences between Europe and the United States over dealing with Moscow. The Europeans have historically insisted on the moral ambiguity of diplomacy and have worked with and against adversaries as part of the same relationship. American diplomacy has often insisted on drawing lines between ''good'' and ''evil'' powers, the more so now with the Reagan team's belief that Moscow is the wellspring of international terrorism as well as a political-military challenge to Western interests. **********There was always the Janus-like worry that either Washington would use nuclear weapons to defend Europe and blow Europe up at the same time or would not use the weapons for fear of jeopardizing American territory and thereby abandon Europe to the Russians. By all accounts, these worries reached their most acute form with the NATO decision of December 1979 to deploy new medium-range Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe. The purpose was to counterbalance new Soviet missiles and, by deploying new missiles, to give added credibility to the threat that they would be used. But then the Europeans began to worry about just that -their use. Issues Outside of Europe **********There was always an issue over whether the Atlantic allies should help each other outside Europe, but the sides are now reversed on the issue. For the first 20 or so years of the alliance, Washington resisted anything that might smack of assisting former colonial powers. Now Washington wants European help in defending areas such as the Persian Gulf. Europe is enormously dependent on oil from the Gulf, but the Europeans are resisting anything that smacks of transforming what they see as essentially local disputes into East-West confrontations. **********Many Administration officials see this as Europeans wanting to preserve the peace in Europe even at the price of allowing leftist factions backed by the Soviet Union to come to power in the third world. They see Americans paying to defend European interests in the Persian Gulf. **********These officials think the situation could easily degenerate into serious disputes over an equitable sharing of alliance burdens both in the third world and in Europe. Ultimately, they believe, it will revive Congressional pressures to reduce the number of American troops in Europe. **********Some evaluations of the economic relationship between Europe and the United States are that it is not so bad as previous crises, such as the one in 1971 when the flexible exchange rate system collapsed.  Other evaluations of the relationship are that it is potentially worse. C. Fred Bergsten of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said in an interview that the Reagan Administration was forcing high interest rates and tight money on Western Europe and depressing the economies there. ''The situation is not unmanageable, but it will require basic changes in Administration policy to cope with it, and so far they have shown no willingness to do this,'' he said. **********A high-ranking State Department official provided an even more somber estimate. He saw severe problems developing as the new Administration pressed Western Europe to restrict trade with the Soviet Union and pressed it over general economic relations with the developing world, where the Europeans want to be more forthcoming than Washington does. **********''The economic problems of today,'' he summed up, ''will last longer than before because they are based on underlying structural problems. European economies are less healthy, less vibrant and less able to adjust.'' A Repeated Theme **********This idea of underlying structural problems in the alliance was a repeated theme in interviews as officials and experts here and in Europe spoke of what was new or relatively new in the situation: not only French but also West German pursuit of an independent foreign policy, the deepening chasm between the big and little nations of Europe and the rebirth of ideologies in Europe and the United States making political compromises and trust harder to achieve. **********In the winter issue of The Washington Quarterly, the historian Theodore Draper wrote: ''French Gaullism by itself could be isolated and ignored. Franco-German Gaullism commanding the heart of Western Europe can neither be isolated nor ignored.'' Now, although France is still a member of NATO, its forces are not integrated into the alliance's military command structure. **********Virtually everyone interviewed stressed that the problems appeared in most acute form in West Germany. Pierre Lellouche of the French Center for International Relations said, speaking of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, ''The fact that Schmidt, in effect, has to tell the German people that their enemy is the Soviet Union and not the United States shows how serious the problem is.'' **********West German officials and experts are notably more restrained in evaluating their own situation. A high German official explained: ''We have faced three crises. After the war, we asked whose side are we on, Russian or American, and chose America. In the late 1960's, the question was what should our relations be with the East and we chose detente. Now, the question is what is our role in the world.'' By this he meant whether West Germany would serve itself and the prospects of world peace better by pursuing a more independent policy from the United States. **********The gap in perceptions between West Germany and the United States could be seen several weeks ago in Bonn at a conference sponsored by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, which is close to the ruling Social Democratic Party. Assistant Secretary of State Eagleburger gave a speech to reassure the Europeans about the Americans. He spoke about the need for military strength against the Soviet Union and the need to negotiate with Moscow. He also severely criticized the Europeans for not taking at face value President Reagan's pledge to begin negotiations on missiles in Europe with Moscow before the end of the year. No One Seemed Reassured **********Willy Brandt, the former West Germnan Chancellor and leader of the Social Democrats, then gave a speech to reassure the Americans about German fidelity to the alliance. He said problems stemmed from young people who were unaware of the cold war and America's importance to Europe, and he contended that Germany was not pacifist, neutralist or anti-American. **********Both speeches were well received but nobody seemed reassured. Many of the Europeans simply did not believe Mr. Reagan would seriously negotiate with Moscow on arms control or anything else. Many of the Americans remained wary that Mr. Brandt was too tolerant in his attitude toward an antinuclear mass rally then in progress in Hamburg that had decidedly anti-American overtones. **********The debate in West Germany, particularly over the future stationing of medium-range American missiles in Europe, is reflected and magnified in its small neighbors. In the view of several American diplomats, countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark show decreasing sympathy to almost any American world position, increasingly pick up the Russian position and have been unreliable in upholding their share of alliance military burdens. The feeling is that the big European countries also have problems with their political left wings, but that their leaders, such as Chancellor Schmidt and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, are willing to risk their political futures to keep their countries in line. **********''Elites in the big countries are opposing the mass movements, but not in the small countries,'' agreed Klaus G. de Vries, a member of the Socialist Party in the Dutch Parliament who sympathizes with the protest movements of the left. **********Some American and British officials see this as leading to an alliance with tiers of loyalty and reliability, a complicated and ultimately unworkable arrangement. **********West European leaders and diplomats are increasingly looking for more moderate language from the Reagan Administration to calm European public opinion. But the last thing Reagan officials say they want to do is calm public opinion. As several of these officials explained it, to calm public opinion in Europe and the United States would be to lull the people again into a false sense of security and undercut pressure for increased military spending. **********Some high-ranking officials in the Reagan Administration say that if the Russians did invade Poland, it would at least make clear who the good guys and bad guys were and would mobilize the West.  Europeans, almost without exception, look on this with horror and even believe the shock would have a disintegrating effect on the alliance. A Few Bright Spots **********Many Europeans and some State Department officials stressed some continuing bright spots: agreement in the alliance on what to do in the event of a Soviet attack on Poland, a growing consensus among leaders on the need for greater military spending, the reaffirmation of the NATO decision to pursue both deployment and negotiations on the new missiles for Europe and the preference of many European leaders for Mr. Reagan over former President Jimmy Carter. **********But to most of those interviewed, these bright spots are fleeting, and the task of managing differences is becoming overwhelming. This is because leaders on each side of the Atlantic increasingly take their own positions as givens and assume that for things to work, the other side must change fundamentally. **********President Francois Mitterrand made this point mildly but publicly in early July when he said, ''I still have faith in the capacity for reflection of American leaders.'' Christoph Bertram, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, put it more bluntly: ''There will be no crisis this year. Europeans still think time will shape things toward pragmatism in Washington and that, in time, the Administration will adjust and see realities as Europeans see them.'' Need for Basic Changes **********But the point was that most of those interviewed talked of the necessity of basic changes in attitude, not the usual compromises that have kept the alliance together in the past. **********A British diplomat put it this way: ''No American President can afford politically to be responsible for the destruction of the Atlantic alliance. What will save the alliance will be repeated American failures. Only then will Mr. Reagan see realities and change.'' **********In the end, hardly any of those interviewed could imagine a world without the alliance, but hardly any could foresee its future without fundamental change."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/24/business/van-wyck-international-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-aug-28.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VAN WYCK INTERNATIONAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Aug 28", "print_headline": "VAN WYCK INTERNATIONAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Aug 28", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/06/business/moore-corp-ltd-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 52, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MOORE CORP LTD reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "MOORE CORP LTD reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/13/business/tax-leasing-deals-mount.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 214, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tax Leasing Deals Mount", "print_headline": "Tax Leasing Deals Mount", "body_text": " **********More companies yesterday took advantage of the chance to complete retroactive tax leasing deals before tonight's deadline.

David Mathews, who served for 15 months as Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the Ford Administration never did get listed in the H.E.W. telephone directory, which is published spasmodically. **********''When I worked in the Department of Transportation, my name stayed in their directory until 1979, and I left in 1977,'' said Suzanne Hatcher, who handles sales for Carroll publications. **********Six-foot-two, of husky build and curly auburn and white hair, Mr.  Carroll, 52 years old, put his feet up, puffed at his ever-present pipe, and talked in a low key manner about his operation. **********A 1950 graduate of Yale with a degree from the University of Michigan's Law School, Mr. Carroll also earned a masters in business from Columbia University. For years he was associated with Time Inc., serving as assistant business manager of Time/ Life Broadcasting properties, as director of planning with Time/Life Books, and as vice president of planning for General Learning, a Time/General Electric joint venture in the field of education. **********Divorced, with two sons, he works out of the second floor of an 1807 brick building that he owns situated on the banks of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in the Georgetown section of Washington. **********I N 1970, he joined the Environmental Protection Agency. ''It was one of the first sort of crosscutting agencies that involved every other agency,'' Mr. Carroll recalled.  ''And as we dealt with people from other governmental departments, we found ourselves asking continuously, 'Who are these people, where do they fit, which is the brass and who are the Indians?' - and no one knew.'' **********After going into the consulting business in 1975, Mr. Carroll bought for $1,000 a defunct publication based in Columbus, Ohio, called ''U.S. Government Organization Chart Manual,'' to sell as a sideline. For his money, he got 55 subscribers and, he discovered, a lot of obsolete information. **********Today, he heads a staff of six full-time employees and 15 parttime employees. There are 5,000 subscribers and he has current annual revenues of nearly $700,000. **********The Executive Directory lists individuals alphabetically as well as by organization and function, and all three sections are cross indexed. As a result one can find the direct telephone number of the Community Service Grants Office of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, or the head of the Afghanistan desk at the Department of State, or the Hydrocarbon Processing and Distribution Group at the Energy Department. **********''I spend most of my time on the Department of Energy,'' said Ann L. Friel, editor of the directory. ''It's a zoo.'' Since the establishment of the Department of Energy in August 1977, it has undergone 10 major reorganizations. Its 28 major departments are broken down into more than a hundred subdivisions, of which, Inventions and Small Scale Technology, MXRES Project, Uranium Resources and Enrichment, Coal Resource Management, Shale Oil Resource Applications and Electric Energy Systems are a few. **********T HE company also publishes a separate directory for governmental energy activities (''That's where the money is,'' says Miss Hatcher), and a State Executive Directory of all 50 state governments. A research service is offered to clients who subscribe to one of their three chart services that give a visual picture of the structure of the Federal Government (the military chart shows command centers and divisions within commands). There is another chart service showing the stucture and personnel of 110 of the top Defense Department contractors. **********Carroll clients include consulting firms, lawyers and law libraries, universities, lobbyists, and Washington representatives of major companies. **********Federal offices make up 20 percent of their subscribers and they include the Executive Office of the President, the United States Senate Library, the General Accounting Office, the Library of Congress, and several branches of the Department of Commerce and the Justice Department. The State Department subscribes to their military charts that sell for $375 a year. **********''The Carroll book is one way of getting a handle on the Federal Government,'' said Linda Neighborgall, deputy coordinator for the Federal Information Center Program of the General Services Administration. ''We have been very impressed with it. It's up to date, and he does a lot checking.'' The G.S.A.'s 91 information centers around the country are subscribers. **********The secret of Mr. Carroll's success is simple. Each entry is called every two months for updating.  ''People said it was impossible,'' said Miss Friel, who with Pauline G. Green, the associate editor, updates the organization charts and handles major governmental reorganizations. ''But we have this group of marvelous older women whose kids have grown, and they make phone calls for three hours each day from their homes. They never let you down, they're careful, conscientious and part of that old school -they're never sick on the job.'' **********For its staff of outside callers and their accumulated phone bills, Carroll Publishing pays about $2,000 a month. It also runs up a monthly in-office phone bill of $2,000. **********The January/February issue has asterisks denoting the positions that appear in the Plumb Book (the political jobs that Mr. Reagan can fill). It is expected that most of these appointments will not be made until February or March and even later. **********''In our experience, the bulk of the appointments come in late summer and early fall, because it takes that long for these new guys to get in place and effectuate change,'' Mr. Carroll explained. **********About 20,000 Federal employees move every year within the capital area alone, according to Joseph O'Hern of the General Services Administration, which has a mandate of sorts of trying to keep track of it all. G.S.A.'s consolidated Centix system with 170,000 lines feeds most of the Federal agencies and departments, but some departments like Treasury and Commerce have independent phone systems and publish their own directories. **********''Basically we try to publish a directory once a year or when things get so disorganized it needs doing again,'' said Richard Q.  Vawter of the G.S.A.'s Information Office. ''I don't think we are very professional about it, but it is very difficult. Carroll is very successful, but it obviously requires a lot of manpower, and it's the kind of thing that if you do it all the time it becomes easier, if you do it once a year it becomes cumbersome.'' **********The G.S.A.'s library, as well as its information office, subscribe to the Carroll directory. James E. Edwards, special assistant to the Commissioner of Automated Data and Telecommunications, explained: ''Our directory is only as good as the information we receive. We ask our customers to fill out a form whenever there is a move, or a telephone or position change, but offices are often negligent in reporting changes. We have to rely on them (Carroll) to provide the information, for we don't have the resources or manpower to obtain it ourselves.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/01/business/discord-over-mobile-phones.html": {"writer_name": "Ernest Holsendolph", "pub_date": "1981-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 989, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DISCORD OVER MOBILE PHONES", "print_headline": "DISCORD OVER MOBILE PHONES", "body_text": " **********A compromise by the Federal Communications Commission that, in effect, gave the Bell System an upper hand in marketing a new mobile telephone service now seems to be falling apart. **********The commission, after 13 years of deliberations, agreed last spring to authorize the use of a new technology called cellular radio. The technology, developed by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, is expected to dramatically improve car phone service - and may have other, potentially lucrative, applications as well. **********But since the F.C.C. acted, the phone company's competitors have waged an intense lobbying campaign to overturn the ruling, and their work may very well pay off. The F.C.C., at a meeting Dec.17, is expected to reconsider its earlier decision and possibly open up the field to more competition. **********It appears that Mark S. Fowler, chairman of the F.C.C., leans strongly toward taking away the guaranteed entry of Bell's local phone companies in the cellular radio market. **********Other commissioners also indicate privately that they are reconsidering their stand, and William Baxter, the Assistant Attorney General for antitrust matters, has called for keeping Bell out altogether. Bell Officials Incensed **********To no one's surprise, Bell officials are incensed at the thought that the company and its affiliates might lose their guaranteed participation in cellular radio. At the time the new service was approved April 8, the company said that it could have some service in place by 1983 and could be in 70 cities by the mid-1980's. **********''This has been one of the bitterest experiences in the history of A.T.&T.,'' said Pickard E. Wagner, a spokesman for the company. ''We have been trying to get this service to the American people for over a decade, and any backsliding by the commission now will just put off the day when the service can get to market. Nobody but the telephone company is ready and capable of putting up a good cellular mobile system. If this is thrown up in the air, the whole business will just go to the Japanese manufacturers.'' **********The technology came from Bell Labs in the 1940's, but did not become a hot item until the late 1960's, when Bell brought it before the F.C.C. **********It stayed on simmer there until last April, when the commission gave its ''final'' authorization for the system. A Bonanza Expected **********What kept the commission hung up so long was the question of how to allocate the right to offer the service, expected to be a bonanza worth hundreds of millions of dollars to equipment makers and radio system designers. **********Cellular radio will give the nation superior car phones and may make possible very small wireless units for home and portable personal use. **********Under the present system, a single powerful transmitter services a city area. Even in New York, where 5,000 people were on a waiting list at one time, no more than 24 simultaneous conversations can take place. The system is often ''busy,'' and voice reproduction is of poor quality. **********With the cellular process, made practical by new computer technology, localities are divided into small geographic areas, or ''cells,'' each served on a two-way basis by a low-power transmitter. Special switching equipment makes it possible for a call made from a moving vehicle to be handed off automatically from cell to cell, from frequency to frequency, without interrupting the conversation. **********Such a system allows division of the available frequency into smaller parts and thus can accommodate more callers. Voice quality is vastly improved, making it possible to place a call to London from a car moving through the streets of Washington, for example, with sound reproduction equal to that of a local call. An F.C.C. Compromise **********The F.C.C. had to weigh arguments by those who thought cellular service should be a local regulated monopoly, like ordinary phone service, against those that said the phone companies should be excluded and wide open competition among mobile radio companies permitted. In April, the commission, in a self-proclaimed compromise, said that the phone companies could offer service in every market - along with only one other competitor. **********However, some potential applicants, such as Motorola Inc., said that the plan was unfair because the monopoly phone company, with capital already in hand, would be first out of the gate, while competitors battled for local operating rights. **********And Millicom Inc., a New York City-based company, complained that its competing technology was ignored.  Various parties, including the Washington law firm of Dean Burch, a former F.C.C. chairman, called for the commission to reconsider its final order. Lobbyists swarmed on Capitol Hill urging Congress to take the issue away from the commission. **********The F.C.C. may well be pre-empted by Congress. Staff members on the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications said that ''strong consideration'' was being given to putting into an emerging telecommunications bill a provision that would overrule the commission's plan. Far-Reaching Applications **********Barry Yampol, president of the Graphic Scanning Corporation, an Englewood, N.J., company that transmits data and messages electronically, and provides radio paging, says that the cellular technology can have far-reaching applications. **********''It provides not just mobile but portable two-way communication that will be competitive eventually with the local switched network or local wireline phone service,'' he said. **********''It will take the wisdom of Solomon to reach a good decision,'' said Stuart Crump, editor of Cellular Radio News, a trade publication here. ''But wait, they did the Solomon approach by dividing the frequencies.'' **********Joseph R. Fogarty, a leading supporter of Bell's position on the seven-member commission, said: ''I advise the American people to keep their walkie-talkies and CB radios, because they seem to be the only mobile service we'll have this decade. I'm keeping my batteries charged.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/04/business/key-rates-143390.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/02/business/owens-minor-bodeker-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OWENS, MINOR & BODEKER INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "OWENS, MINOR & BODEKER INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/01/world/envoy-to-pakistan-named.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 54, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Envoy to Pakistan Named", "print_headline": "Envoy to Pakistan Named", "body_text": " **********President Reagan announced today that he would nominate Ronald I.

It will be available starting in the fall for a single unit price of $16,500 with volume discounts available. **********The Star work station would increase the productivity of such professional workers as engineers and analysts, Xerox officials said, by speeding their ability to gather information and to compile it into reports and memos. **********''We've already seen some things that indicate that the professional wants help,'' said Mr. Massaro. He pointed to the growing use of personal computers by engineers and analysts. Vital Gap Filled In **********For Xerox the Star work station also fills in a vital gap in its product line. It is designed to be used with other products introduced by Xerox over the last three years, including an electronic filing system, a printer that can print out what appears on the work station screen, a communications device linking various machines, and Ethernet, a communications network to tie the office machinery together. **********But what Xerox sees as strong points could hinder sales of the Star work station, some analysts believe.  Harvey L. Poppel, senior vice president of Booz Allen & Hamilton, a consulting firm, said that productivity of professional and managerial office workers was less well defined and more difficult to measure than it was for typists or factory workers. Unless companies can be convinced of the savings, he added, they will be reluctant to spend the money needed to buy the terminals. **********In addition, the Star work station is really useful only when tied in with the electronic file, the printer and the Ethernet network.  Few companies have made commitments so far to buy the whole package, which might retard sales of the work station."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/25/world/danish-longshoremen-act.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Danish Longshoremen Act", "print_headline": "Danish Longshoremen Act", "body_text": " **********Longshoremen here today refused to unload the Polish freighter Wila on the ground that their Polish colleagues were forced to load it at Gdansk ''under the military's smoking guns.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/16/business/at-t-lifts-earnings-11.1-calls-for-higher-local-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 786, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.T.&T.

Brown, also said at a news conference before the company's annual meeting here that no negotiations were under way to settle the Justice Department's antitrust suit. However, he said, the company would be willing to negotiate a settlement. **********A tentative accord made in the last days of the Carter Administration was rejected by the Justice Department under President Reagan. The Justice Department has vowed to push the effort to break up A.T.& T. despite requests by the Defense Department to drop the case because of what it describes as the vital role of the company's communications network in national defense. **********Earnings of $6 Billion **********A.T.& T., which earned $6 billion in all of last year, the most ever for an American corporation, said its profit in the first quarter of 1981 rose to $1.6 billion, or $2.05 a share, from $1.4 billion, or $1.98 a share, a year earlier. But Mr. Brown called the earnings ''essentially flat'' and said they underscored a need for higher telephone rates. **********The company's latest three-month revenues were $13.5 billion, up from $12.1 billion in 1980's first quarter.  A.T.& T. keeps its accounts on a calendar-year basis, but announces earnings for the three-month periods ending the last days of February, May, August and November so that a current earnings report can be mailed to shareholders with their dividend checks, which are payable on the first business day of each calendar quarter. The company had announced that, in the three-month period ended Feb. 28, earnings rose 8.6 percent to $1.52 billion, or $1.97 a share, from $1.4 billion, or $1.93 a share, in the similar period a year before. Details of Expansion Plans **********A.T.& T. released a ''statement of policy'' today that detailed its previously announced plans to cope with increased competition in the telephone business and to expand into data processing and related fields, most of them unregulated. A.T.& T. is seeking permission to operate in unregulated business areas. **********Increasing local telephone rates was described as the key to these plans. In the past, the company said, local rates have been held below costs, with the difference made up by relatively high longdistance rates. **********''Long-distance service must be relieved of the burden of contributing to the support of local service,'' Mr. Brown said in his speech to 1,398 shareholders gathered in the Houston Convention Center. ''Deprived of that support, local rates will have no place to go but up, further and faster than inflation would in any case make necessary.'' **********One aspect of the company's expansion is a plan to offer its yellow pages electronically so the directory can be read on home computers.  The first test, scheduled for Austin, Tex., has been delayed in court because of opposition from newspapers, among others. **********''I really don't think it helps very much for the American Newspaper Publishers Association to clothe its economic interests in First Amendment rhetoric,'' Mr. Brown said. ''The issue is advertising, competition for advertising, and nothing else.'' Conflicting Agency Views **********In its statement of policy, A.T.& T. said: ''Ours is the business of moving information - voice, video, data, graphics, etc. - from just about any place in the United States to just about any other place in the United States or, for that matter, the world.'' **********The company has won approval from the Federal Communications Commission to set up a subsidiary to offer such services, but the Justice Department contends that it would violate a 1956 consent decree limiting A.T.& T. to businesses where rates are regulated by governmental bodies. Mr. Brown said A.T.& T. was ''caught in the middle'' between two parts of the Government. **********Other, smaller phone companies are now offering long-distance service between major cities at rates lower than A.T.& T.'s. Mr.  Brown said the telephone company, which is to raise interstate longdistance rates by 16 percent within a few weeks, planned to fight that competition, partly by raising the charges those companies pay to connect to the Bell System. **********Stockholders elected the management's slate of directors and rejected seven shareholder proposals, as management had urged.  The most important of those proposals would have barred the company from making charitable contributions, required it to report to shareholders all political contributions by its political action committees and required it to report to shareholders where pension funds were invested."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/world/malaysia-confronts-enviroment-issues.html": {"writer_name": "Pamela Hollie", "pub_date": "1981-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 738, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MALAYSIA CONFRONTS ENVIROMENT ISSUES", "print_headline": "MALAYSIA CONFRONTS ENVIROMENT ISSUES", "body_text": " **********Here in the municipality of Penang, beside the busy Strait of Malacca in northwest Malaysia, is Butterworth, one of Malaysia's principal free-trade zones.

Rapid deforestation, indiscriminate mining practices, poor planning and accelerated expansion are taking a toll on the country and its resources. **********The Ministry of Science and Technology has designated 42 of the 50 Malaysian rivers as ''grossly polluted,'' the result of paper and palm-oil production, rubber processing, pineapple canning and mining.  Leaving Things Till Later **********''There is a tendency to promote development and then sort out the problems later,'' said K.J. Ratnam, director of the Center for Policy Research at the university here. ''At the beginning, countries seem to feel that the price of preserving the environment is too high.'' **********In 1974 Malaysia enacted an environmental quality act that recognized the priority of economic growth over environmental concerns and is toothless. In effect, the palm-oil and rubber industries have escaped because of their importance. Only after multinational companies, particularly the oil producers, began bringing in new technology did the glaring disparity between the new and the old practices become apparent. **********''Some of the multinationals, particularly the oil companies, were sensitive to their behavior abroad, and it just may have been easier to build their installations to the same standard everywhere,'' said Anthony Morrow, an industrial sociologist in George Town. ''Whatever the reason, people began to become aware that something could be done to save the fish in the rivers.'' **********In recent years the Government has begun talking about protecting the environment and, under pressure from an organized and increasingly active consumer movement, it has begun to tighten regulations despite opposition from the industrial sector. S.J.  Sundram, Director General of Environmental Quality, said, ''Malaysia's economy today and for a long time to come depends on the renewable-resources sectors and these, for a small country like ours, are limited, fragile and in urgent need of comprehensive protection and sustained production.'' **********Industrial developers have been able to avoid having to carry out the 1979 regulations on sewage and industrial waste that were to go into full effect this year. The 130 palm-oil plants, for example, were to build treatment facilities to reduce the 250,000 tons of effluent released annually. The deadline has been extended until July 1; the Government has promised that it will act then. Until 'Something Awful Happens' **********''We will have to wait and see,'' said Lim Teck Ghee, secretary of the Consumers Association of Penang. ''Enforcement is very lax until something awful happens.'' **********Penang has a double environmental threat. In addition to industry and the tin mines, the Strait of Malacca is one of the world's busiest waterways, with more than 4,500 ships, many carrying oil to Japan, passing through monthly. The strait is Japan's lifeline to the Middle East, and the ports along it are vital to regional trade. **********Neither consumers nor the Government can do much about the strait, which is an international passage, but on land the battle is intensifying. Through educational seminars and mailings to 40,000 individuals and groups a month, the consumer association is ''trying to bring consumerism and environmental concern out of the dark ages,'' said Khor Kok Peng, its research director. **********''We are trying to educate Malaysians and the Government,'' he said.  It is an uphill battle. For villages without modern conveniences, consumerism has no meaning. On the environmental issue the association has nevertheless found support in fishing villages where livelihoods are threatened by pollution. **********''We are far behind the United States,'' Mr. Khor said. ''We don't have the technology or the sophistication, but we are beginning to approach the problem that every developing country must face. We want basic things like clean air and water and the guarantee of a good fishing day tomorrow.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/18/business/sec-is-chided-in-st-joe-case.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1981-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 541, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.E.C.

It never happened, and the reason was that Elf's big and even more powerful brother, the French Government, took a look at the deal, didn't like it and quashed it. **********Elf's chairman, Albin Chalandon, maintains that the order to halt the transaction came directly from the Elysee Palace of President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, and that Elf still doesn't know why it was given. **********The incident illustrates the way the decisions of a national company can be subject to government policy. The Prime Minister in the Giscard d'Estaing Government, Raymond Barre, acknowledged that it was he who ordered the Kerr-McGee plan aborted. He did so, he said in an interview here, for diplomatic reasons. Another former minister, who asked not to be identified, added that Mr. Chalandon, who has operated Elf first and foremost as a profit producer, had taken the bidding process too far without approval, exceeding the authority the state allowed. **********For all that, Mr. Chalandon and the Giscard d'Estaing Government were essentially on the same wavelength. The question now is how such companies will be run under their new master - the Socialist Government of Francois Mitterrand. Elf says it may well continue to initiate big takeover bids in the United States, such as the Texasgulf acquisition. Others see the company's assets put to use pursuing Government policy - propping up employment where necessary and buying up bankrupt French companies. **********In addition, there is the clash of goals and style. Mr. Chalandon was not available for interviews, but he told the company's annual meeting in May that ''Elf's dynamism and prosperity have aroused as much mistrust as satisfaction on the part of our supervisory authorities.'' The sources of friction between such a man and a left-wing government are liable to be legion, and it may be difficult for him to live with the objectives of a government that is bringing more business under the state's control. When the nationalization bill of Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy becomes law, an overwhelming majority of France's largest companies will be state-run. **********Perhaps most significant, the nationalization of most of the financial sector means that the allocation of credit will be statedirected to a far greater degree than that of any other Western country, and Paris banking circles are convinced that the Government will name a Communist to the chairmanship of at least one big newly nationalized bank. **********Sixty-seven percent of Elf Aquitaine is owned by the Government.  The company, put together from a number of small oil companies shortly after Charles de Gaulle's return to power in 1958, is a key factor in the economy and easily the largest company in terms of assets in France. It produces around a quarter of the country's petroleum needs from gas fields in southwest France and oil wells in Gabon, Nigeria, the North Sea and the United States. The 33 percent of the stock still in private hands is alone worth more than 10 percent of all the stock traded on the Paris Bourse. Elf last year earned 5.8 billion francs - well over $1 billion - up 250 percent since Mr. Chalandon became chairman in 1977. **********Elf's management regards the United States as one of the few places in the world where profit is not likely to become a dirty word. It may take some time to digest its recent takeover of Texasgulf - but it probably hasn't satisfied its appetite for American properties.  ''In principle, Texasgulf is the platform on which we'll build,'' says Jean-Yves Chereau, the Paris executive for Elf's North American operations, ''but Texasgulf is not the end.'' **********The Texasgulf takeover, in fact, came about almost coincidentally, rather than as the planned answer to Elf's strategic needs. The idea originated with the Canada Development Corporation, and its desire to acquire Elf's considerable assets in Canada. Elf was worried about its ability to develop these assets under Ottawa's National Energy Program and, says Mr. Chereau, some of its holdings offered only long-term prospects of profit. **********Texasgulf, by contrast, offered a relatively rapid payout, so Elf accepted a complex plan, structured by Salomon Brothers, under which its Canadian properties and those of Texasgulf passed under the control of Canada, while the United States properties of Texasgulf came under that of Elf - and thus, incidentally, of the French Government. **********The United States companies Elf had been considering give an idea of where it may make a new thrust. The most recent were certain subsidiaries of Diamond Shamrock. Negotiations over these, according to Elf's vice chairman, Gilbert Rutman, were abandoned for reasons that provide an intriguing pointer to possible moves in the future. **********''Our lawyers,'' he says, ''warned us that, if we accepted the data Diamond Shamrock was offering on these subsidiaries, we would have seen inside information that would prevent us, at some time in the future, from bidding for Diamond Shamrock itself.'' **********For the time being, therefore, all negotiations with Diamond Shamrock have stopped, as have those with another American company to come under Elf's active consideration, Ashland Oil. The Ashland negotiations, however, were broken off, Elf sources say, for ''insider'' reasons of a different type. Whereas few people were aware of the possibility of deals involving Texasgulf or Diamond Shamrock, dozens of Elf employees, according to one senior executive, knew about its interest in Ashland. The stock took off, and Elf backed off. **********As for Kerr-McGee, rumors about Elf's intentions had run rife in the spring of last year. One day in May the July 80 call option on Kerr-McGee jumped from 5 to 6 3/4 - a rise of 35 percent. **********The Kerr-McGee episode created an open breach between Mr. Chalandon and the Barre Cabinet. The Cabinet felt that the size of Kerr-McGee, and of the estimated $5 billion needed to take it over was at least three times what the Government had been led to expect that Elf might be planning. Mr. Barre said he felt that to make an unfriendly bid for an American resource company of that size, given the delicate state of French-American relations, would be undiplomatic. As a result, Mr. Barre stopped the bid hours before it was to be started, and a few weeks later he restructured the company in a way that would give the Government firmer control over broad policy decisions. **********Up to then, Mr. Chalandon had been chairman of the holding company, Erap, which votes the Government's stock, as well as head of the operating company, Elf. Now the Government removed him from the chairmanship of Erap, putting Pierre Alby, chief executive of Gaz de France, the state-controlled gas utility, in his place. **********Although Mr. Barre says he tried to calm Mr. Chalandon by telling him that the idea was to give him greater autonomy in the normal operation of Elf, Mr. Chalandon didn't see it that way: Elf views the reform as an attempt to weaken the Elf group ''and to humiliate its managers,'' he said at the May annual meeting. **********Working with the new master may be tricky for Mr. Chalandon because he is politically far to the other side -an ex-chairman of a rightwing party who was nominated to Elf's leadership by the right-wing leader, Jacques Chirac, when Mr. Chirac was Prime Minister under Mr. Giscard d'Estaing. **********W ITH France's unemployment soaring, one conflict between what Elf's management sees as best for the company and what the Government considers best for the country is likely to heat up rapidly. Prime Minister Mauroy says the creation of jobs is his administration's top priority. **********Elf has substantial overcapacity in its domestic refineries, and it needs to shut some of them down. Will its new Socialist overlords allow it to do so? Not if it involves cutting back on employment, says Mr. Rutman, the Elf vice chairman. **********''We think the agreement between us and the Government will be 'you eliminate 200 jobs, but you must replace them with 200 other jobs in the same area.' '' The company won't create ghost towns, he says: ''If we can't create jobs in a place where we want to shut an operation, we won't shut.'' **********Mr. Rutman willingly concedes that this sort of operational stricture is not going to do anything positive for Elf's earnings.  Another burden on them is likely to be a governmental requirement that Elf use its enormous financial resources to buy up failing French companies. Since Elf is a state-controlled enterprise, its acquisition of other companies will bring even more industry under the state - without making it necessary for the Government to pass additional nationalization bills. **********Another area in which the Socialists may intervene in Elf management may be most controversial of all. According to one top Government official (who, for obvious reasons, declines to be identified), Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Mauroy are already laying plans to move their own people into key jobs in nationalized companies. One senior Elf executive says the company is holding back from creating new management positions, for fear the Government will insist on filling them with Socialist Party members. **********Mr. Rutman denies that this sort of infiltration has taken place so far, but he says ''it would be naive'' to suppose there will not be pressure of this sort in the future. People can be ''recommended,'' he observes, and although he adds that ''officially the Government has no right to put its people into Elf, any more than any stockholder,'' the recommendation of the holder of 67 percent of a stock is likely to get attention. **********At Texasgulf, Richard D. Mollison, the chief executive, is 65 years old, and people in Paris are studiously noncommittal about who will succeed him.

Dougherty Intermarco Looks Back **********A YEAR ago in the light, airy, dignified and sincere surroundings of the Plaza's Palm Court, Ramon G. Gaulke, just getting accustomed to being chairman of Intermarco-America, talked expansively about the newly formed shop and its breakthrough plan. **********Imagine an ad agency with no account executives to act as liaison with the client, having the creative teams doing that work themselves. **********Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.  Back in the Palm Court for breakfast yesterday was the same Ramon Gaulke, one-time president of Marsteller, who as before was accompanied by Gerard Pedraglio, vice chairman of the Intermarco-Farner network of the Publicis group that is half owner of Mr. Gaulke's operation. **********Mr. Gaulke acknowledged that the original concept was a bum idea and Arlene Hoffman, his president and creative director who was not on hand a year ago, more than agreed with him. Having heard Mr.  Gaulke complain, ''I think we are begining to collapse physically,'' she added, ''Suddenly I have a warm spot in my heart for account people.'' **********''You can't grow big under this system and you have to grow big,'' added Mr. Gaulke, probably becoming the 9,784th ad agency founder to change his grand initial plans. **********''And besides, it takes too much time from the creative people,'' added Miss Hoffman, putting in a word for her discipline.  Luckily, Intermarco Advertising as it is now called, is in 5,600 new square feet at 4 West 58th Street (over the Paris Theater) that can more than accommodate an influx of account executives, quite a few account executives. **********And a few will be needed, since, according to Mr. Gaulke, the agency, as planned and hoped for in a first-year projection, is now billing at the rate of $10 million, which is coming from 11 regular clients and two more for special projects. **********One of the more fascinating aspects of Intermarco's client list is the presence of five different alcoholic beverage assignments with no client concerns about a conflict problem. **********One is Cointreau America, posters for which just went up in bus stop shelters, and the others are De Motal Armagnac; Buton Distillers for a new product from Italy; Mediterranean Importing for Fazi Battaglia, and Peartree Imports for Reynac aperitif. **********A number of these assignments are for the full marketing treatment, which means from point-of-sale material and up. Hence, Miss Hoffman's complaint about exhaustion. **********Since nothing goes better with a jug of wine than a bit of cheese and a piece of French bread, Intermarco has cleverly added a few calories to the client list with Boursin cheese and Bagettines de Paris, a baker. **********To go with the baker there is also a banker, the BNP Bank, a French institution, as well as Business Week International; Akwell Industries, the condom manufacturing subsidiary of G.D. Searle, and Flymo, which manufactures a lawn mower that rides on a cushion of air. **********That happens to be a lot of business to be handled by a dozen people in what Mr. Gaulke characterizes as ''a full-service agency except for a research department.'' **********As you have probably already noted, practically all of the client companies are either foreign or international in interest. The latter category would also include Mr. Gaulke and Miss Hoffman, who had also worked at Marsteller before setting up her own agency to handle the Jamaica Tourist Board. **********And one part of the European scene that particularly interests both is the look of the advertising - more emphasis on the graphics, especially in television, taking advantage of the medium. **********''In the U.S.,'' Miss Hoffman said, ''there's too much copy, too much hard sell, which is getting to be less and less effective.  Graphics get the message across quicker and better.'' **********In hopes of capturing the spirit, Intermarco is using European photographers for still and motion pictures."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/business/l-thurow-and-wages-238000.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 193, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THUROW AND WAGES", "print_headline": "THUROW AND WAGES", "body_text": " **********To the Business Editor: Professor Thurow focuses on the most perverse, although probably the least discussed, procedural obstacle to feasible price stabilization: the scattered scheduling of major union contract negotiations and the overlapping maturities of multi-year agreements. **********As long as the practice is allowed to continue, the reciprocal escalation of costs and profits per unit of output, the only two components of price, is almost guaranteed to follow suit. **********Professor Thurow correctly identifies the urgent need as a common, equitable point of departure for annually negotiated compensation adjustments, with no interim indexing of benefits to the rate of inflation.

Together with deterrence and defense, arms control and disarmament are integral parts of alliance security policy. **********The President and the Federal Chancellor affirmed in this connection their resolve to implement both elements of the NATO decision of December 1979 and to give equal weight to both elements. **********The Federal Chancellor welcomed the U.S. decision to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union on the limitation of theater nuclear weapons within the SALT framework by the end of this year. Arms Talks Are Welcomed **********He also welcomed the fact that the U.S. Secretary of State has initiated preparatory discussions on theater nuclear forces with the Soviet Union, looking toward an agreement to begin formal negotiations. The President and the Federal Chancellor agreed that T.N.F. modernization is essential for alliance security and as a basis for parallel negotiations leading to concrete results on limitations of theater nuclear forces. **********The President and the Federal Chancellor assessed very favorably the close cooperation between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Three Powers in matters relating to Berlin and Germany as a whole.  The Federal Chancellor thanked the President for his reaffirmation of the pledge that the United States will continue to guarantee the security and viability of Berlin. **********Both sides noted that a serious international situation has been created by Soviet expansionism and armaments efforts. To meet this challenge and to secure peace, they are determined to respond with firmness and to maintain a dialogue with the Soviet Union. **********The President and the Federal Chancellor agreed that it is important for the stabilization of East-West relations that the current C.S.C.E. review conference in Madrid agree on a balanced substantive concluding document which includes enhanced respect for human rights, increased human contacts, a freer flow of information and cooperation among and security for all of the participants. No Interference in Poland **********In this regard, and as part of such a balanced result, the President and the Chancellor favor agreement on a precise mandate for a conference on disarmament in Europe, providing for the application of militarily significant, binding and verifiable confidence-building measures covering all of the continent of Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals. **********Poland must be allowed to solve its problems peacefully and without external interference. The President and the Federal Chancellor reaffirmed unequivocally their view that any external intervention would have the gravest consequences for international relations and would fundamentally change the entire international situation. **********Genuine nonalignment of the states of the developing world is an important stabilizing factor in international relations. The Chancellor and the President support the independence and the right of self-determination of the states of the developing world. They will, in concert with their allies and the countries affected, oppose any attempts, direct or indirect, by the Soviet Union to undermine the independence and stability of these states. **********The President and the Federal Chancellor reaffirmed their view that the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan is unacceptable. They demanded the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and respect for that country's right to return to independence and nonalignment. Cooperation on the Middle East **********Both sides stressed the importance of broad-based cooperation with the states of the Gulf region.  The President and the Federal Chancellor agreed that the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany, the latter within the framework of European political cooperation, should continue the search for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Their efforts should continue to be complementary and build upon what has been achieved so far. **********Both sides reaffirmed the determination to strengthen further the open system of world trade and to oppose pressure for protectionist measures. **********They stressed the vital importance for political and economic stability of further energy conservation and diversification measures to reduce the high degree of dependence on oil. The pressing energy problems can only be mastered on the basis of worldwide cooperative efforts that strengthen Western energy security and reduce the vulnerability of the West to potential supply cutoffs from any source. **********The President and the Federal Chancellor agreed on the need in framing their economic policies to give high priority to the fight against inflation and to the creation of improved conditions for renewed economic growth and increased productivity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/13/world/cairo-expels-russian-for-spying.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cairo Expels Russian for Spying", "print_headline": "Cairo Expels Russian for Spying", "body_text": " **********The state-controlled Middle East News Agency said today that the Egyptian authorities had arrested an unnamed Soviet Embassy official and ordered him expelled from the country for spying.

Shift in Soviet Diplomacy **********Mr. Vasev's appearance in several radio and television interviews lately marks a significant departure for Soviet propaganda and diplomacy in Washington. It evidently reflects a Soviet decision to meet charges from the Reagan Administration quickly with public appearances in this country rather than relying purely on press commentaries and official statements in Moscow. **********Mr. Vasev rejected what he called a suggestion that the United Sates ''could impose on the Soviet Union'' a ''code of conduct'' for international relations, a subject reportedly raised by Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. with the Soviet Ambassador, Anatoly F.  Dobrynin, at a private dinner on Feb. 5. **********In an interview on the Cable News Network ''Newsmaker'' program, Mr. Vasev said that the Soviet leadership might have to ''take countermeasures'' such as increasing its own military spending in response to steps now contemplated by the Reagan Administration. **********While he voiced uneasiness about the tough line of the new Administration, he said that Moscow would show ''patience and restraint'' and not jump to quick conclusions about its longer-term intentions. ''We're not going to escalate it,'' he said. **********Top Administration officials contend that tens of millions of dollars worth of Soviet arms are being shipped to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador, but Mr. Vasev said in the television interview and in later remarks to The New York Times that this issue had not been raised officially with the Soviet Union by the Reagan Administration. **********Asked whether official complaints had been made to the Soviet Government, he replied: ''You haven't, and had you made, I would have refuted it. The Soviet Union is not concerned with arms shipments to Salvador, and that's a statement of fact. The Soviet Union is not involved, and you can't pin it on us.'' **********Pressed to say whether Soviet weaponry was moving to Cuba and Ethiopia and from there to El Salvador, as the Administration has charged, he replied: ''We do ship armaments to Cuba as a matter of Soviet-Cuban relations. We do supply arms to Ethiopia as a matter of Soviet-Ethiopian relations. But I flatly deny that there is any Soviet supply of arms to the guerrilla forces in Salvador.'' **********He was reminded that the United States often required recipients of American weapons to agree not to transship them to third countries and was asked whether Moscow did the same. **********''Sometimes we do, sometimes we don't,'' he replied. ''If we trust the other side that the arms will not be used against Soviet interests, we don't.'' Later, asked by The Times whether Moscow imposed restrictions on Cuba and Ethiopia, he added, ''In the case of the Cubans and Ethiopians, no.'' **********The Soviet diplomat, the second-ranking member of the mission here, said that after ''unprovoked remarks'' toward Moscow by President Reagan and Secretary Haig, the prospect for Soviet-American relations ''doesn't look very promising.'' But he pointedly declined to predict that the two superpowers were heading back into a cold war period. **********The Soviet leadership, he said, can afford to wait to see what actual steps the new Administration will take in the months ahead, and he contended that some of the ''purely artificial'' sharpening of American statements was intended to create a better domestic climate for higher military spending. **********''This is working up a tough attitude toward the Soviet Union which helps ul@trapatriotism when the crunch of guns-versus-butter comes,'' he told The Times. ''We are not worried. You often waste money. We'll have to look where you spend your money. In order to shift the military balance, one needs a lot of time.'' **********In the present climate, Mr. Vasev asserted, Moscow is indifferent to whether the Reagan Administration lifts or continues the embargo on grain shipments to the Soviet Union or makes efforts to increase trade."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/30/world/no-headline-155100.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 559, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********TEXT OF REAGAN'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF SANCTIONS **********LOS ANGELES, Dec. 29 (AP) - Following is the text of President Reagan's announcement today of economic sanctions against the Soviet Union: **********LOS ANGELES, Dec. 29 (AP) - Following is the text of President Reagan's announcement today of economic sanctions against the Soviet Union: **********The Soviet Union bears a heavy and direct responsibility for the repression in Poland.

Issuance of such licenses will be suspended.

He and his wife, Miyuki, visited some showrooms, then retired home to ponder choices. **********One evening, a salesman they had talked to unexpectedly knocked at the door, interrupting the family supper. ''I was not very happy,'' Mr. Tamura recalled, ''but he waited outside about an hour until we finished. Then he came in and I was impressed with his eagerness to sell a car.'' **********This is the Japanese way. While winter afternoon sunlight gleams off the the polished red, gray and brown Toyota Corollas sitting in a glass-enclosed showroom that is headquarters to 350 new-car salesmen - and 60 used-car salesmen - the buyers are at home. Very much unlike the system in the United States, the salesmen follow them there. **********Situated near Shibuya Station, Tokyo's third-busiest commuter point, the Toyota Tokyo Corolla dealership sold more than 24,000 cars last year. Yet days at a time go by without a prospective customer walking through one of the three glass entrances. No salesmen patrol the floor, ready to spout mileage statistics, kick tires or cut deals for interested parties or reluctant buyers. **********''Japanese customers are timid compared to Western customers,'' says Toshio Sato, a section chief in the Toyota Tokyo Corolla headquarters. ''If they come into the showroom and the clerks try to explain about the cars, it scares them away. They want the salesmen to come to their home where they can decide in their own castle.'' **********Dickering, on the other hand, goes on in much the same way as in the United States (but no discount exceeds 10 percent of the asking price, said Mr. Sato of his dealership). Buyers haggle over the value of the old car to be traded in and about which accessories, such as a stereo or FM radio, might be added - as well as straight price. **********Indeed, Mr. Tamura, negotiating the eagerness of the salesman, got a cut price on his new Toyota Calina. ''Cars were selling very fast then, so a discount was not very easy to get,'' he said, with some satisfaction. **********About 60 percent of new Japanese cars are purchased on an installment plan - 15 percent down and 24 months to pay under current government guidelines - according to Mitsuya Goto of Nissan, makers of Datsuns. The rest are purchased for cash, sometimes borrowed from a finance company. **********Mr. Goto observes that the average length of car ownership in Japan is around 47 months, just under four years, but that an owner is likely to be more ready to trade in his current vehicle just before ''shaken'' time rolls around. Shaken is the mandatory inspection required of every car and truck in Japan every two years. **********Unlike the fairly casual American system, the shaken is a bolt-bybolt review. It accounts for the extraordinarily good condition of vehicles on Japanese streets. It also means many drivers would rather buy a new car instead of paying a mechanic to get everything up to snuff. **********Automobile salesmen know when each vehicle in their territory is due for a new inspection, and schedule visits accordingly. They also know other bits of personal information about their prospective customers, culled from local government files or the nearby residents' association. **********''He may know a housewife's birthday and will give her a small present then,'' explains Mr. Sato.  What sells best here? Mostly Toyota and Nissan models. Toyota put out six of the 10 top sellers here last year and Nissan, three. Only the Mazda, made by the Toyo Kogyo Corporation, dented the ToyotaNissan dominance. **********And what is the worst seller? The import. Registrations of foreign cars plunged last year to 44,900 -accounting for less than 1 percent of the national total - from 60,000 in 1979. A tradition of tariff barriers, although those are gone now, plus service problems given the low volume of sales, plus the very entrenched nature of the national industry, and a host of assorted other factors have made the import, in effect, a nonstarter. **********Last year was the second-best year on record for domestic sales, and Toyota Motor Company president Eiji Toyoda predicts that 1981 will be slightly better for the industry.

For $649 South Carolina's Historic Charleston offers a Chippendale tilt-top tea table made by Baker Furniture. $1,670 will purchase a Kittinger reproduction of a Queen Anne mahogany side chair from Colonial Williamsburg. **********Among other institutions whose furniture is being reproduced are Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts, Historic Newport, R.I., Sleepy Hollow Restorations in New York, Philadelphia's Independence Hall, Monticello in Virginia and Georgia's Historic Savannah. **********For museums such reproduction programs mean additional income; their endowments have been so depleted by rising costs that, in some cases, collections are threatened. The manufacturers pay the museums a fee as well as a percentage of the profits. As a result curators find themselves ''cloning their furniture to preserve it,'' said Mary Jean Madigan, editor of Art & Antiques magazine and a former museum curator. **********The trend is growing. In the near future the ''ball and claw market'' will have several more entries. An Ivy League university is negotiating with manufacturers to reproduce its noted collection.  The Museum of American Folk Art in New York is planning a reproduction program for its Shaker furniture. In April 1982 Winterthur Museum in Delaware will launch reproductions of its American Queen Anne and Chippendale furniture. **********Despite the spate of reproductions coming on the market, such furniture is nothing new. The Centennial celebration of 1876 created such intense interest in Colonial America that it inspired a flood of furniture reproductions. In 1936 Colonial Williamsburg was the first to approach manufacturers to license reproductions; ultimately it opened Craft House, an on-site retail outlet.

After all, if one bought a $100,000 policy five years ago, it would only provide $55,000 of coverage in today's dollars, and the small return on whole-life policies doesn't even match the rates paid on passbook savings accounts. **********Yet the same inflationary forces that undermine the dollar make the average family ever more vulnerable in the event of the breadwinner's untimely death. The income of most families hasn't kept up with inflation, so most have taken on more debt than ever. And even without extra debt, a policy bought just a few years ago is unlikely to go far in helping a family maintain its existing standard of living. **********In such circumstances life insurance is still useful. Few insurance companies even pretend to promote life insurance as a way of building savings any more. But they stress the protective aspects of their product and have offered a slew of new policies designed to compensate for the effects of inflation. Those particularly targeted are in the 30-to-50 age group with dependent children or spouses. **********Essentially, life insurance falls into two broad groups - whole life (also known as permanent life) and term policies.  Most whole life policies require a fixed premium for a specified amount of coverage during a period of time. Often, part of the premiums are returned as dividends, increased coverage or as a form of savings as the years pass. **********There was a time when whole life policies were a form of savings account, with the policyholder looking forward to receiving a certain amount of cash after the insured period ended. Many whole life policies still have the cash-value feature, but in inflationary times one can earn a lot more on the same money invested elsewhere. Such policies come in a mind-boggling variety of forms, many of these custom-tailored to the policyholder's personal needs. **********By comparison, term policies are relatively simple. Usually, the coverage declines each year over the term of the policy - as does the premium. The idea is that the coverage should be highest when the policyholder's beneficiaries are most vulnerable. Sometimes, the burden of heavy early premiums is eased by charging an average payment each year. Coverage declines over the policy's life, but charges are fixed. **********Which is the best depends, of course, on the individual's needs.  But many insurance experts have come around to the view that term policies are the most practical for the average head of family. **********''The best policy for most people is one that provides pure protection, such as in a renewable, annual, term policy,'' said John T. McNamara, vice president and actuary at Alexander & Alexander Inc., a large international insurance brokerage house. While the premium will usually rise with each annual renewal, he explained, especially if the coverage is not reduced, the cost is actually less on a current basis than that on most whole life policies. **********''Forget about the fringes and other gimmicks,'' Mr. McNamara continued. ''In these inflationary times, one can also forget about cash values. There are far better ways to accumulate savings, such as money market funds.'' **********Those seeking protection, Mr. McNamara said, should make a preliminary study of their protection needs before discussing it with an insurance agent. **********''They should ask themselves what their dependents would need if they died today,'' he said. ''How long would they need it? What do they expect their economic situation to be until then? The insurance agent can help later on with the inflation and other factors.'' **********The problem with term policies comes when the policyholder passes 60 or 65 years of age, when insurers usually decline to issue these policies. **********''Ninety-nine percent of term policyholders outlive their coverage,'' said Julius Vogel, senior vice president and actuary at the Prudential Insurance Company of America, the nation's largest.  This happens usually when the children are grown and the chief dependent is the policyholder's spouse. ''What happens next is that the term buyer is too old to afford such coverage, assuming he or she can get it.'' **********When the individual is wealthy and has large assets to protect, whole life policies are often necessary. ''Death duties have to be paid in cash, and if the estate is tied up because the assets are not liquid it could force distress selling of assets,'' said Mr.  McNamara. ''But people with important estates can usually afford whole life.'' **********Among the many variations of whole life policies, he continued, are those in which the policyholder can borrow some of the cash value of the insurance, and have the interest, which may range from 5 to 8 percent a year, as a tax-deductible item. **********This is done by buying the whole life policy and paying for it with a ''minimum deposit.'' By borrowing some of the future cash value many of these plans provide, one can work it so that in the first seven years only four annual payments are actually paid. The rest is borrowed at the cheap rates of interest, Mr. McNamara said. **********Mr. Vogel of Prudential offered a few other tips: ''We agree that these times demand the pure protection that is offered by term policies. But one can get the best of both. For example, one can obtain a whole life coverage at quite economic premiums by averaging the payments. This often involves paying somewhat more in the early years and using the dividends and cash value to offset inflationadjusted higher costs later on.'' **********Another of the many approaches involves a combination of whole life and term coverage in a policy that provides dividends. These usually cost more than simple declining coverage term policies. **********Under one such plan, Mr. Vogel said, a person aged 30 years could get a $100,000 term policy that decreases in coverage over a 20-year period for a first-year premium of $263. At age 35 the same policy would have a first-year cost of $340; at 40 years, $497. **********Assuming that a 35-year-old policyholder doesn't touch the dividends, ''the dividends would build as the coverage declines over the 20 years to the point where the premium in the final year would be $45'' and the coverage $20,000."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/14/business/heck-s-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-march-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 54, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HECK'S INC reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "print_headline": "HECK'S INC reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/23/business/advertising-flip-charts-help-to-sell-a-president.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 743, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Flip Charts Help to Sell A President", "print_headline": "Advertising; Flip Charts Help to Sell A President", "body_text": " **********THERE were quite a few in the running for the job, but a consultant screened them and reduced the number to a manageable dozen. Then the client took over and further trimmed the competition to two and asked for presentations. The winner was the one that used the flip charts. **********Does this sound like an agency competition for a client? It wasn't. It was actually an agency looking for a new president.  The agency was David Deutsch Associates and the flip-chart user was Stephen R. Fajen, 40 years old. They were brought together by Robert S. Marker, former chairman of the executive committee of Needham, Harper & Steers and chairman of McCann-Erickson, now a consultant, who had known three of the Deutsch partners during his McCann phase and had Mr. Fajen as his assistant at Needham. **********The three partners, David Deutsch, 51 and chairman, who is giving up the president's title; Rocco E. Campanelli, 52, executive vice president, and Robert G. Kilzer, 44, senior vice president, are all from the creative side of the business - two art directors and a copywriter. **********They had called their old associate, Mr. Marker, in to develop a five-year plan for the agency because the partners felt they were overwhelmed with work. **********Mr. Deutsch recalled: ''One night Bob said to me, 'I know what you need, a new president.' And I said, 'Wait, that's my job.' ''Then he said, 'You need a fourth wheel.' That fourth wheel is Steve Fajen.'' **********The flip-chart presentation that tipped the scales came after Mr.  Fajen and his single competitor had already met with the agency partners four or five times, sometimes with their wives, and after Mr. Deutsch had put these questions to them: ''What would you do as president?'' And, ''Why do you want to be president?'' **********Mr. Fajen responded by saying that he did not want to shoot from the hip and asked if he could make a presentation instead.  One of the charts of particular interest was headed ''Agency Evolutions.'' In it, the presidential contender grouped agencies according to their size and labeled the six groups (starting at the bottom) as Survivors, Legitimates, Contenders, Vergers, Comfortables and Giants. **********Mr. Fajen plans that his new employer will be one of the Contenders, in there with the likes of Waring-LaRosa; Avrett, Free & Fischer; Rosenfeld, Sirowitz & Lawson; Ammirati & Puris, and Ally & Gargano. **********Those are the agencies, he explained, that, by virtue of their style and work, are frequently invited to compete against bigger agencies. **********Mr. Fajen would seem to have every reason to believe that he and his new associates belong with such a group. Collectively they have worked for 12 of the top 30 agencies and have gained experience with 70 advertisers, in every category. **********The new, pipe-smoking president, for example, having come out of the A.C. Nielsen Company, worked for Jack Tinker & Partners, the J.  Walter Thompson Company, McCaffrey & McCall and Needham, where he was general manager of the New York office and assistant to Mr. Marker. **********He is sure to find the atmosphere and clients different from the old homestead, since in his new agency, with its $12.5 million in annual billings, each of the 18 clients averages $400,000 in billings. Not exactly the big time, but everyone seems happy, and no matter how big an account, all ads have the same purpose: to sell. **********Mr. Fajen was given some stock and bought some more, but the man with his name on the door continues to be the man who is chief executive and has 51 percent of the stock. He insists on such control, Mr. Deutsch said, because he can then ''control the atmosphere -the people who come and go - and the quality of work that the agency produces.'' **********As to his motivation for joining a much smaller agency, the new president said, ''I decided to trade down for the fun of it and for the ability to make a difference in the place where I work.'' **********''While we never stop learning in this business,'' Mr. Fajen said at another point, ''there comes a time when you must trade in your mentors for partners, roll up your sleeves, then get your own coffee and your own accounts.''

But this week the dollar reached a 10-year high against the French franc, hit a record high against the Italian lira and has shown signs of strength relative to other currencies, including the West German mark. **********Yesterday, the dollar ended mixed in the United States and abroad after setting new highs against the French and Italian currencies. **********New Money Supply Signal **********Whether the dollar will continue to gain, currency analysts say, depends largely on the course of interest rates both here and abroad. The report yesterday of further strong growth in the money supply was a signal to many that interest rates are likely to be pushed up still higher next week, further strengthening the dollar. **********''For a year now, the broad movements in the dollar have closely followed what is happening to interest rates,'' said Anne Parker Mills, a vice president at the Irving Trust Company. ''We're now back in a period of rapidly rising U.S. interest rates and the dollar has been following suit.'' **********For the United States, the dollar's sustained climb represents the end -at least for the present - of a troubled four-year period, when there seemed to be nothing it could do to curb the use of costly foreign oil or stem the flight of investors from the dollar. **********Central bankers huddled, trade ministers parleyed, rescue packages worked for a while, and then faded away. The dollar might stage a recovery for a month or two, but then would plummet again. **********The turnabout in the dollar has seemed to parallel the fortunes of the Reagan camp. Things started looking up for the American currency, at about the time that the prospects of a Reagan victory seemed to take shape. The country had by no means defeated its inflation problems. But because of recession and energy conservation, it had had some success in slowing oil imports and narrowing the huge trade deficits. **********''The lesser oil imports and the more favorable trade balance are definitely a factor in the dollar's recovery,'' said Jonathan Francis, director of foreign exchange for Chase Econometrics. **********In recent weeks, the sharp upward swing in short-term interest rates has made dollar-denominated investments more attractive.  Increasingly, good balance-of-trade figures and widespread confidence in the Reagan economic program have also made the dollar more attractive. Other Economies Affected **********But the dollar's new momentum, though barely visible to most Americans, is setting off stunning reverberations in other countries. Their energy bills - paid in dollars - are climbing, which is touching off new inflationary tendencies in their economies. **********''What we are doing in fiscal and monetary policy has international implications,'' said Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president for international economics at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. ''Of course, none of these countries like a strong dollar, since they have been living off the weak dollar and lower oil prices. But it's a fact of life that they will have to live with for a while, since there are a lot of things going for the United States.'' **********Indeed, the higher American interest rates have put pressure on some European countries to raise their own interest rates to compete with the dollar, despite their generally weak economies and high levels of unemployment. Most have tried to resist, widening the differential between their interest rates and those of the United States. **********For the less-developed countries, already hard-put to pay for oil imports and their extensive borrowings, the stronger dollar is making their burden even greater. **********Currency experts say that some European countries may yet push interest rates higher to strengthen their currencies, but they do not expect that to happen soon. **********But if foreign rates do start to rise, the dollar could soften, even if American rates remain high.  ''It is really the differentials that push up the dollar,'' said Morris W. Offit, chief executive officer at Julius Baer Securities Inc., an international money management firm. ---- Dollar Ends Mixed By The Associated Press **********The dollar was mixed against foreign currencies here and abroad yesterday.

Haig Jr. said today that ''the hours are growing rather short'' to prevent Nicaragua under the leftist Sandinist Government from becoming a totalitarian state like Cuba. **********He refused to rule out any military action in the region, asserting that ''it serves no constructive purpose to draw fences around the limits of American policy when nations are proceeding to push against our fundamental values.'' **********In a separate interview today, Edwin Meese 3d, the White House counselor, also expressed concern, saying that ''the hour is late in the sense that there has been a military buildup in Nicaragua'' through Cuban assistance. **********Both Mr. Meese and Mr. Haig noted that President Reagan had seemed to rule out the sending of American combat troops into Nicaragua when he said there were ''no plans'' to dispatch troops anywhere in the world. **********But they both stopped short of saying whether they thought any other military action should be taken to stop what they regarded as ominous trends in Nicaragua. Naval Blockade Held Possible **********In answer to questions on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS News, Mr.  Meese said that a naval blockade, or some joint action outside of Nicaragua, was a possibility. **********''Whether we'd utilize a naval blockade or not would depend on circumstances,'' he said, ''and at this point we wouldn't want to say what we will do or on the other hand rule out any particular action that might be appropriate.'' **********Mr. Haig, who has taken the firmest stand in the Administration against Cuban and Soviet-bloc involvement in Nicaragua, said that despite American offers of friendship there had been a steady ''drift toward totalitarianism'' there. **********He said that ''it is vitally important'' that the remaining ''forces of freedom'' in Nicaragua as well as the other governments in the hemisphere recognize that ''it is incumbent upon us to work in political, economic and security areas to try to prevent this drastic outcome.'' **********For many weeks there has been a behind-the-scenes debate within the Administration on what to do about the situation in Nicaragua, whose leftist Sandinist leadership has reportedly imported large amounts of Soviet-bloc military equipment through Cuba and steadily suppressed voices of opposition. There is said to be no disagreement on the seriousness of the situation in Nicaragua, but rather a major difference of opinion on whether military action even as limited as a blockade of Soviet-bloc arms should be contemplated by the United States. **********Mr. Haig is said to be the most outspoken in feeling that this country should not shirk from military action if necessary since to allow Nicaragua to become a Cuba-like bastion on the Central American mainland would be seen worldwide as a major Soviet-bloc victory, would endanger the security of the other countries in the region, and raise questions about American resolve in such areas as the Middle East. **********Defense Secreatary Caspar W. Weinberger and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were reported by a senior Pentagon official last week to be much more wary of even limited military action against Nicaragua.  They were said to fear that American public opinion would not support any American military involvement in the region and this could cause the Pentagon loss of support for key programs such as the buildup in strategic arms and the rapid deployment force for the Persian Gulf. **********Mr. Weinberger, appearing on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC News, said today that ''vital interests'' of the United States were involved in Nicaragua but steadfastly refused to discuss what military options were under consideration. **********''We are well away from the syndrome of drawing a line in the sand and saying thus far and no farther,'' Mr. Weinberger said. He said it was necessary to prepare a number of options for President Reagan to consider ''in a perfectly calm and reasonable fashion.'' **********Meanwhile, he said, the United States was taking steps to improve the economic and living conditions in the whole area through such initiatives as the economic plan for the Caribbean area announced last summer by the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Canada. **********Mr. Haig, reflecting his own concerns, was considerably more dramatic than Mr. Weinberger and Mr. Meese in discussing Nicaragua.  Appearing on the ABC News program ''This Week'' with David Brinkley, the Secretary of State said that the Administration had made ''very dedicated efforts'' to make clear to the Nicaraguan leadership that ''we are prepared to have full, normal and complementary relationships.'' **********He was referring to a trip to Nicaragua last summer by Thomas O.  Enders, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs.  Mr. Haig said that the Sandinists were told that if they remained ''a pluralistic, democratic society''they would be eligible for ''the full level of American assistance, aid and cooperation.'' **********Such aid was suspended earlier in the year by the Administration because of Nicaragua's support for the insurgents in El Salvador.  ''Unfortunately, the leadership has rejected those approaches,'' Mr. Haig said, ''and has steadily increased its drift toward totalitarianism.'' **********He cited the repeated closing in recent weeks of the newspaper La Prensa, the closing of opposition radio broadcasts, the arrest of leading figures in the private sector and ''the suppression of the free labor movement and the right to strike.'' **********Talking about the arms buildup in Nicaragua, Mr. Haig said that simultaneous with the political crackdown, ''we've seen a high influx of sophisticated armaments from the Eastern bloc, from the Soviet Union, directly through Cuba.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/18/business/roundup-of-quarterly-sales-and-profits-at-306-major-corporations.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1740, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ROUNDUP OF QUARTERLY SALES AND PROFITS AT 306 MAJOR CORPORATIONS", "print_headline": "ROUNDUP OF QUARTERLY SALES AND PROFITS AT 306 MAJOR CORPORATIONS", "body_text": " **********Revenues Net Income Jan.MarchChangeJan.MarchChange1981From '801981From '80($ 000)(%)($ 000)(%)- AEROSPACE Boeing Co.$2,420,100+13$144,100 + 3 General Dynamics Corp.1,267,000+1830,800 15 Grumman Corp.419,100 85,400 11 Lockheed Corp.1,334,700+2536,300 +203 McDonnell Douglas Corp.1,626,400+1441,300 5 Northrop Corp.435,200+1523,100 + 1 United Technologies Corp.3,334,600+15107,100 + 16 AIRLINES American Airlines Inc.$ 952,500+ 9$3,900 * Braniff International Corp.325,200 13(23,600) . . . .

The warm air is scented with jasmine and incense, the stores drape silver papier-mache stars in windows, but the downtown streets are curiously lifeless. **********''Merry Christmas, poppa!'' shout swarms of begging half-American children to foreigners.

She is eking out a living teaching English and hopes next year to join her parents who fled to the United States during the fall of this city, then called Saigon. 'It's So Difficult Now' **********She starts to laugh nervously. ''I've become so skinny, so ugly,'' she said. ''My face is old.'' Her eyes turn wet. ''It's so difficult now.'' **********She starts to speak but says conversation with an American is dangerous and starts to slip away. ''Life is hard,'' she whispers.  At the Majestic Hotel, a middle-aged employee looks up and watches a group of American Vietnam War veterans depart after their recent visit to discuss with Government authorities reports of American servicemen still missing after the war. ''Saigon is no more,'' he says. ''Saigon is dead.'' **********The city is certainly quieter and perhaps cleaner than it was a decade ago. Every symbol and sign of the American and South Vietnamese presence -building names, streets, billboards that once advertised Coca Cola - have been stripped away. **********Tu Do, the raffish main street, has been renamed Dong Khoi (General Uprising), which commemorates the Communist takeover in 1975. The famed Caravelle Hotel is now the Son Doc Lap (Hotel Freedom) and is filled with Russians. **********There are posters everywhere exhorting Vietnamese to work in the fields, pictures in shop windows of Ho Chi Minh smiling angelically, Vietnamese and Soviet flags linked.  Around the city, most well-known buildings are intact but seem a bit dilapidated.  The old United States aid headquarters, which spent billions assisting the South Vietnamese, has laundry drying on its windows.  Cercle Sportif, the last stronghold of French colonialism, is a workers club. The American Embassy is used by Vietnam's gas and oil authority. The landmark Continental Palace Hotel is shut down but may open soon as a barracks for foreign sailors. Peddlers Hawk Their Goods **********Changes are everywhere, yet the Christmas season has somehow stirred memories of the old Saigon. Outside the cathedral, peddlers hawk toys and cards and tinsel. There are holiday sweet cakes in Givral's and in La Pagode, the popular coffeeshop, which is still crammed with bored youths, wearing American sweatshirts and Adidas sneakers. They seem utterly untouched by the ''liberation.'' **********Yet the bulk of the city's residents seem bereft, hard pressed.  Officially there are 200,000 unemployed, but the figure is probably closer to four or five times that. **********A special hospital has been set up for malnourished children. Wages are low - civil servants earn the equivalent of $30 to $40 a month, about the price of a pair of shoes. Inflation Has Doubled **********Inflation of many basic staples has doubled over the past years.  The shops are crammed with black market goods - Heineken beer, Salem cigarettes, champagne, tubes of shaving cream, medical supplies - mostly sent as gift parcels from abroad. **********Especially poignant, somehow, are the ceramics - jade and porcelain that families sold to buy official exit visas.  It is unclear who buys these things: the Russians, the major foreign group, are known as ''Americans without money.'' Nonetheless the wheeling-dealing black market economy, now as before, lingers, with Communist officials turning a blind eye to it. **********In his office in the old French-built city hall, Le Quang Chanh, deputy chairman of the People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City and a founding member of the National Liberation Front, said that his aim was to make ''hard work and production'' the dominant values of the city instead of ''luxury and entertainment.'' 'First Social Evil' **********Mr. Chanh, a man in a green bush suit and wearing eyeglasses, said that the ''first social evil'' he had found in the city was prostitution. ''We built schools for these women. We cured them of their disease and tried to make them human beings again.'' **********''We have resolved this problem,'' he said.  Unresolved, however, is the legacy of prostitution - the Vietnamese-American children who beg and prowl the city streets and are objects of scorn in socialist Vietnam. Their number is estimated at 8,000. Pathetically, some of them hold up photographs of their mothers and fathers, usually a G.I. with his arm draped around the young woman. **********During the visit of the four American Vietnam War veterans, the children touched their arms, besieged them with photographs and letters, struggled to speak English and gazed at the four with awe. **********The American group was led by Robert O. Muller, executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America. His companions were Michael Harbert, a former Air Force sergeant; Tom Bird, a former infantryman, and John Terzano, who was a Navy seaman.  All are members of Vietnam Veterans of America. **********As the Americans boarded their van to leave the city, they handed out candy and gum and some money to the children, who waved feverishly and blew kisses. Two fair-haired little girls began to weep. It was heartbreaking."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/16/business/texas-pacific-land-trust-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TEXAS PACIFIC LAND TRUST reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "TEXAS PACIFIC LAND TRUST reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/11/business/other-business-the-gas-this-dentist-uses-is-neon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 385, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE GAS THIS DENTIST USES IS NEON", "print_headline": "OTHER BUSINESS; THE GAS THIS DENTIST USES IS NEON", "body_text": " **********Just a year ago, Dr. Shel Kupper started a store-front dental practice on West 10th where Sutters Bakery had stood.

A senior American official said that a communique scheduled to be issued Wednesday would capture the tone of Mr. Weinberger's remarks and would warn the Soviet Union to be aware of a new resolve in the United States and the Atlantic alliance.

Then Angel Nuno, the secretary of Caltojar's Town Hall, got the idea of painting imitation Picassos on its white walls and low adobe buildings. **********''At first we thought of paying homage to Velazquez,'' related the energetic Mr. Nuno. ''But then we realized that it was the year of Picasso and that 'Guernica' was about to be brought to Spain. And most of the older students in the village knew who Picasso was.'' **********Mr. Nuno got the idea last Easter and soon - well before Madrid's official cultural establishment had begun its observances of the 100th anniversary of Pablo Picasso's birth - the walls of Caltojar began to sprout Picasso doves, harlequins, guitar players, demoiselles of Avignon and self-portraits. And Caltojar inaugurated its own, full-size ''Guernica'' two weeks before the original painting, after returning from New York, was unveiled in October at an annex of Madrid's Prado. **********People in Caltojar live by raising sheep and growing wheat on the hard Soria plain, now cracked by drought, but they took eagerly to painting Picassos. Angel Molina, the 32-year-old Mayor, was so tickled with his portrait of the poet Antonio Machado, painted on a building facing his home, that he added a copyright mark and his signature, ''Sr. Alcalde,'' or Mr. Mayor. Children Do the Most **********Teen-agers and schoolchildren did most of the work. At night, with a movie projector, they cast images of the Picassos of their choice on the walls and traced them. By day, they painted. A sign on the country highway that runs through Caltojar warns: ''Caution: children painting.'' **********A total of 51 paintings and a huge free-standing copy of ''Guernica'' have been finished. Others are planned.  Collective effort is not always the hallmark of Soria villages, from which young people are fleeing to the cities. The province is dotted with deserted villages and others where only the old remain. **********Caltojar is unusual in the province in having enough children to merit an elementary school of its own. Many rural children are bused long distances to school. Village Priest Demurs **********The local reviews have been fairly positive.  ''We people who have lived all our life in the country don't understand these things,'' said Wenceslao Galan, an 81-year-old farmer in a tattered beret. ''But we think they're pretty, and it makes people talk about our village.'' **********One mild dissenter is the village priest, the Rev. Hernan Larena, who was found busily cleaning stones and dirt from a pile of beans at the doors of Caltojar's 12th century church. **********''The people here are a little cold,'' said Father Larena. ''They do not exactly fulfill their Christian duties. And the men - the men here are a little revolutionary.'' **********Others scoff at the priest's assertion, saying he is simply upset because a lot of people have been painting on Sundays instead of going to mass. **********''Some people want to give this a political interpretation,'' said Julian Andres, a 26-year-old teacher at the one-room school.  ''Someone even asked if all the kids here were Communists. But it is a cultural thing.'' Village's Renown Spreads **********There is so little politics in Caltojar that all seven members of the municipal council, including the Mayor, are independents. In national elections, the villagers have mostly voted for the centerright Government party, with others voting Socialist. **********Caltojar's painting spree has brought the village renown well beyond the boundaries of Soria Province. At official invitation, Mr.  Nuno has taken delegations of children to Barcelona, the home of the Picasso Museum, and to Madrid, where they were invited to the ''Guernica'' opening. **********Almudena Ayuso, a 10-year-old girl and occasional painter, was impressed by the glass and metal cage that surrounds the original ''Guernica.'' **********''They put it there so that no one will steal the painting,'' she said. ''But I like ours better. It is new and clean.'' Now Mr. Nuno is organizing a trip to Paris, with help from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. And he is looking farther. The Allure of New York **********''I have heard about things happening in America that for us are utopias,'' he said. ''Maybe there is some American millionaire who would like to bring us over there so we could see the skyscrapers and 'Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.' We will go to the Museum of Modern Art.  Write that down. I'm sure we will go.'' **********Other villagers seem to find Caltojar's sudden fame a bit too much to handle.  ''It's so noisy,'' said a woman dressed in black. ''Every weekend people coming to look at the paintings. And during the week, I bet there are at least four cars every day. It makes you afraid to be in the streets.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/26/world/tass-assails-solidarity-office.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tass Assails Solidarity Office", "print_headline": "Tass Assails Solidarity Office", "body_text": " **********The Solidarity information office in New York City provides ''further confirmation'' of the independent Polish union's links to Western anti-Communists, the official Tass press agency charged today.

A spot check, however, showed that most of the financial institutions still regarded the bonus accounts as an effective way to attract depositors for the one-year savings certificates. **********''The way the I.R.S. went about this was quite unfair to the consumer,'' said Gerald McEvoy, a senior vice president of the Lincoln Savings Bank. **********''We will be talking to all the people who have signed up here and assure them that they will be able to withdraw their money on Oct. 1 without a penalty.'' How Plan Would Work **********He added that Lincoln would begin to advertise a new program next week, but he was unsure if it would offer consumers the same 35 percent interest that it advertised last week. **********Under the new ruling, a consumer who invests $2,000 now in a bonus program at 35 percent would earn $57.53 in interest during a onemonth period. On Oct. 1, the consumer can either withdraw the $2,057.53 or invest it in the one-year savings certificate created under the tax law passed by Congress in July. **********An individual can earn up to $1,000 in interest tax-free on the new certificate, while a married couple filing a joint return can earn up to $2,000 tax-free. Tax experts have said that the certificates make the most sense for a person who is in a tax bracket above 30 percent. Comments From Banks **********''We're going to start our ads running immediately,'' said Greg Sullivan, assistant vice president of the Dime Savings Bank of New York. His institution offered consumers an 18 percent interest rate with a 1 percent bonus until Oct. 1. **********The Chase Manhattan Bank said it would honor the 40 percent interest it promoted last Friday and yesterday. However, a Chase spokesman said the bank had not decided whether it would offer a 40 percent rate in the future. **********The Dry Dock Savings Bank said it would free depositors, who had already signed up for their bonus package, from the mandatory tiein. However, the savings bank will discontinue its bonus program. **********The savings and loan institutions began to promote bonus packages last month to compete for some of the $250 billion that is expected to flow into the savings certificates. The bonus accounts introduced by the banks and thrift institutions in the competition for this money are actually repurchase agreements - loans made to the institutions - that are generally sold only to corporate customers at market rates of about 17 percent. Advertising Interrupted **********Most financial institutions stopped advertising the bonus packages after the I.R.S. said over the weekend that it had ''substantial doubts'' about the tax-exempt status of the bonus packages. **********''The whole thing is an outrage,'' said Paul A. Schosberg, president of the Savings Association League of New York State. ''The way they handled it will have a chilling effect on the 'All Savers' certificates.'' **********He added that he expected most New York banks to resume their offers for the repurchase agreements in an attempt to draw potential customers for the one-year savings certificates. **********''The underlying rationale - to position the largest possible number of depositors for the 'All Savers' - is still there, and I would expect a whole new round of ads to be hitting the papers by the weekend,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/12/world/at-least-1000-people-are-killed-as-nigeria-crushes-islamic-sect.html": {"writer_name": "Gregory Jaynes", "pub_date": "1981-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AT LEAST 1,000 PEOPLE ARE KILLED AS NIGERIA CRUSHES ISLAMIC SECT", "print_headline": "AT LEAST 1,000 PEOPLE ARE KILLED AS NIGERIA CRUSHES ISLAMIC SECT", "body_text": " **********At least a thousand people, and possibly many more, were killed here over the last two weeks as members of an Islamic cult attacked the local authorities, and Government forces were sent to quell what Nigerian officials said they believed to be a Libyan-backed insurrection. **********There is no evidence in this northern town of a million people to suggest Libyan interference. But a high-ranking assistant to Nigeria's President, Shehu Shagari, said in an interview earlier this week that ''we have every reason to believe Libya was involved.'' Nigeria has expelled Libya's diplomats from the capital of Lagos, 800 miles to the south, and has called home the Nigerian envoy in Tripoli. **********Cult Is Annihilated **********The full story of what happened here is still unclear. What is known is that a fanatic cult, led by a man from Cameroon named Alhaji Mohammadu Marwa, started the violence. In the end, the cult was annihilated by a Government that painfully remembers the Biafran war in which more than a million Nigerians lost their lives in the 1960's. **********Nearly every Nigerian lost a relative or a friend in the civil war over Biafra. The killings here have reminded the Government how easily the situation could get out of hand in Nigeria. As a result, it is likely that the authorities will step up security measures. **********Despite the absence of proof, Western diplomats in Lagos tend to believe that Libya had a hand in the troubles here, if only in providing financial assistance to the cult. Alarm Over Libyan Plans **********The authorities in Lagos, as well as in other African capitals, have been alarmed by Libya's announced intention to merge with Chad after helping the Government in Ndjamena defeat insurgent forces in a civil war. **********Islamic scholars said that Mr. Marwa, the head of the cult, had been expelled from here twice in the last 17 years for disruptive activities. He and nearly all his followers were killed on Dec. 30 and 31, according to some reports. **********Kano is a center of Moslem worship and trade in Nigeria. The old section of the city is ringed by a crumbling mud wall. The new section is made up of tens of thousands of mud tenements and alleys just wide enough to be negotiated by people and goats. Into an area right between the two, where the city's major markets stand, came Alhaji Mohammadu Marwa last year to establish a settlement for his 3,000 to 5,000 followers. **********According to the head of Islamic studies at a nearby university, who did not want to be identified, Mr. Marwa first seemed to espouse relatively harmless Islamic fundamentalist beliefs. He condemned materialism, prohibiting his followers from wearing watches or owning bicycles. They were forbidden from going to bed at night in possession of more money than they would need to get through the following day. **********However, Mr. Marhwa's beliefs eventually began to deviate from Islamic tradition. He told his followers that they did not have to face Mecca during prayer, as Moslems do the world over, and he reduced the number of daily prayers from the traditional five to three. **********Later, there were reports of kidnapping of young boys and girls, and the taking over of nearby houses by force.  ''He would ask, 'Is this God's house or yours,'' said a professor who requested anonymity. ''If the occupant said God's, then they as God's representatives would claim it. But if they said it was not God's, then they would would still claim it for God from the infidels.'' Reports of Black Magic **********Then came reports that the cultists were practitioners of juju, or black magic. Juju, although still prevalent in the south, is not seen here very often. However, superstition is entrenched in many parts of Nigeria. For example, human eyes are used used in a charm that is said to make a thief invisible and impossible to catch. **********The prevalence of superstition in Nigeria enabled Mr. Marwa to convince his followers that they were invincible. Armed with only bows and arrows and a small number of stolen automatic weapons, they charged Nigerian forces who were firing mortars, machine guns and bazookas. **********In October, there was a clash between the cultists and the police here. Although a policeman was killed, Kano's Governor, Abubakar Rimi, did not take any public action against the cultists at that time. **********On Dec. 18 and 19, about 50 policemen were killed in a battle with the cultists. Some residents of Kano said the fighting started because Mr. Marwa's son had been killed in a confrontation with the police. Others said it started because the Government had privately given the cultists a deadline to leave Kano. Mr. Rimi's press secretary refused to allow journalists to interview the Governor earlier this week. Governor Delays Acting **********The police asked the Governor to request federal intervention, but he did not act.  The police also appealed to citizens to help contain the fanatics.  Vigilantes set up roadblocks to catch members of the cult. Each of the cultists was said to have a tattoo, a cross in a circle, on the abdomen. People were stripped and, when a tattoo was found, often summarily executed. **********On Christmas Day, as the Governor was preparing to leave for a conference in Lagos, a mob attacked his house. That was apparently the final straw. He stayed in Kano and called for federal assistance. **********Last week, two days before New Year's, the army moved in. People in the quarter occupied by the cult were warned to leave the area or be shelled. Then the army opened fire. 'It Was Unfortunate Really' **********''You should have have seen it,'' said Muhammad Hassan Ali, a journalist for the the state television here. ''They were killing them like goats, like donkeys even. It was unfortunate really, but they were given a warning.'' **********Another journalist, Tunde Amao, a reporter for The Daily Times, was killed by a stray arrow.  After the troops had collected all the bodies, the official death toll was put at 1,000. However, Mr. Ali said that it was at least 10,000. Half a dozen other witnesses said the figure was about 7,000. The bodies were piled on garbage trucks and buried in mass graves. **********For the next few days, prisoners were summarily executed, according to witnesses. One businessman saw 80 people, including children, gunned down in a field near his house. Only piles of shoes remained in the field."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/20/business/edwards-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EDWARDS INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "EDWARDS INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/15/world/around-the-world-france-to-continue-study-of-neutron-arms-project.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "France to Continue Study Of Neutron Arms Project", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; France to Continue Study Of Neutron Arms Project", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy said today that the Government ''has decided to continue studying'' development of a neutron warhead tested by France last year. **********In a speech before the Higher Institute for National Defense, Mr.  Mauroy said the warhead was a tactical weapon ''which can increase our deterrent potential.'' **********He went on: ''This capability remains to be developed and that's why the Government has decided to continue studying'' the project. **********France tested a neutron warhead in June 1980 but has not yet decided whether to add it to its arsenal.

The French election supplanted Common Market and other international questions as the main item on the agenda. **********Participants in the discussions this afternoon and evening, which took place here at the Prime Minister's country residence, Chequers, 40 miles northwest of London, said that bad feeling between Mr.  Schmidt and Mrs. Thatcher appeared to have eased. Sharp Clash at Last Meeting **********The two clashed sharply at their last meeting seven weeks ago in the Dutch city of Maastricht, particularly over the question of fishing rights within the European Economic Community.

In recent years, an informal Paris-Bonn entente has tended to dominate the community to the exclusion of Britain. **********Mr. Schmidt spent much of the flight from Bonn analyzing the results of the French election, his aides said. He was reported to have concluded that there would be fundamental changes in French economic and social policies but that continuity could be anticipated in the field of foreign affairs. **********A senior official traveling with the Chancellor emphasized the importance of the French-West German treaty of 1963, which, he said, should guarantee good cooperation between Mr. Schmidt and Mr.  Mitterrand. The official also called attention to warnings by Mr.  Mitterrand about the seriousness of the Soviet threat to European security, arguing that these showed that the French President-elect shared the views of the entire Western alliance. Personal Friendship Aided Ties **********But Mr. Schmidt has met Mr. Mitterrand only twice, and the German official conceded that he could not hope, at least at first, to establish with Mr. Mitterrand - even though both are Socialists - the kind of relationship that he has enjoyed with Mr. Giscard d'Estaing.  The Paris-Bonn entente rested to a considerable degree on their friendship. **********It is this situation, Mrs. Thatcher believes, that gives Britain its opportunity.  At the same time, there was some apprehension in the West German camp, and even more in the British, about the consequences of a French President's having been elected with Communist help and possibly being compelled to include Communist ministers in his Government. The Chancellor said on the airplane this morning, according to one aide, that Western Europe faced an unsettled period during which it would be difficult to calculate the probable course of French foreign policy. **********Similar views were expressed in Brussels, where the defense ministers of the European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization met today. They were said to have agreed that the victory of Mr. Mitterrand was ''not disquieting'' but to have expressed some concern about the degree of influence Communists would be able to wield over his administration. **********Both Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Schmidt voiced hope that they would be able to see Mr. Mitterrand soon. The first meetings, officials here suggested, will probably come at the next Common Market summit meeting in Luxembourg at the end of June - about the same time that Mr. Mitterrand is expected to call parliamentary elections in the hope of winnng a left-wing majority.

''I express the hope that the Soviet Union and France will continue to promote mutual understanding between East and West in the interests of restraining the arms race and achieving disarmament,'' Mr. Brezhnev wrote. **********The Soviet media, which had shown preference for President Valery Giscard d'Estaing during the election campaign, reported Mr.  Mitterrand's victory today with strong emphasis on the support given him by the French Communist party. **********Both Tass and Izvestia, the Soviet Government daily, depicted the Socialist candidate's victory as a demand by French voters for major economic and social changes. **********In this context, the Soviet commentators quoted a statement by Georges Marchais, the French Communist leader, declaring readiness to join hands with the new Government. **********Despite the portrayal of the Socialist election victory as a mandate for social change and as a potential opportunity for French Communists, there seemed little doubt that Mr. Giscard d'Estaing'r defeat was regarded as a setback for Soviet policy objectives in Europe."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/10/business/advertising-venpub-new-concern-now-controls-venture.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 325, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Venpub, New Concern, Now Controls Venture", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Venpub, New Concern, Now Controls Venture", "body_text": " **********Venpub, a new company formed by Joseph D.

Shostakovich Accuses Bureaucrats **********In the interview, Maxim Shostakovich accused Communist bureaucrats of demeaning Soviet artists by trying to prescribe what is acceptable art and by treating them in an arbitrary way against which there was no appeal. **********''Everything that sounds pessimistic is rejected,'' he said of Soviet attempts to define art.  ''Even a woman who is painted as carrying a hundred pounds of potatoes on her back has to be depicted as smiling optimistically.'' ''That applies to music, too,'' the conductor continued. ''The party wants to express through culture that everyone is satisfied.'' Mr. Shostakovich said his monthly salary of 600 rubles, about $900, made him the Soviet Union's second highest paid conductor. But, he added, a suit costs 200 rubles. Musicians Denied Exit Papers **********The chief reason for his defection was the humiliating treatment at the hands of cultural bureaucrats, he said. Two days before leaving for the recent tour of West Germany, for example, the authorities refused exit papers to five of his best musicians. **********''I had to find substitutes within two days,'' Mr. Shostakovich said. ''If he was a talented Jew I couldn't take him along.  Of the five musicians who were refused papers, he said, ''one had a brother in America.'' He added: ''Another was a close friend of Yuri Aronovich, my predecessor, who also defected to the West. The third behaved in a way functionaries disapproved of during his last trip abroad. The fourth once got drunk at an inopportune time.'' **********Mr. Shostakovich was the conductor of the Symphony Orchestra of Central Television and Radio at the time of his defection. Questioned Before Travels **********Mr. Shostakovich said that Soviet musicians were regularly examined before going abroad by a travel commission on questions such as the difference between capitalism and Communism, or on current events, such as who were the political leaders of the country they were to visit. **********Asked about the authenticity of a book published in the West after his father's death, and described as his memoirs, Mr. Shostakovich replied: ''These are not my father's memoirs. This is a book by Solomon Volkov. Mr. Volkov should reveal how the book was written.'' **********Mr. Shostakovich said language in the book attributed to his father, as well as several contradictions and inaccuracies, led him to doubt the book's authenticity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/28/business/freeze-ordered-on-profit-made-on-st-joe-options.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 342, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FREEZE ORDERED ON PROFIT MADE ON ST.

Some of these critics say that either he does not have a foreign policy or it is in disarray. **********Tuesday night in Chicago, the President answered that a speech was not ''necessary'' and might even be ''counterproductive,'' and that anyway, international relations was just ''common sense.'' **********Defenders of the President argue that there are clear lines of policy, but good political reasons for not making a speech yet.  These charges and explanations are standard fare for the early months of any Administration.  Those who like what Mr. Reagan is doing say he has a policy, and those who do not like it say he does not have one.  William G. Hyland, a national security adviser to President Ford and now with the Carnegie Endowment, thinks that there is a sound policy. He said: ''The basics are pretty obvious, flowing from the Presidential campaign: Contain Soviet expansionism through a major defense buildup and tough rhetoric without actually closing any doors to negotiations. And until there is a clear direction to Soviet-American relations, everything must be subordinated to this.'' **********Political Reasons Cited **********Some senior officials in several different departments maintain that the President has political reasons for not laying out a detailed policy now. The most important reason given at this time is that Mr. Reagan wants nothing to get in the way of Congressional approval of his economic programs. **********In this view, a major foreign policy address is bound to raise a political storm. As several White House aides explained the dilemma: If Mr. Reagan gave a very conservative speech, as his instincts would dictate, many foreign countries, the foreign policy establishment in the United States and much of the news media would be irritated with him; if he gave a middle-of-the-road speech, conservatives would criticize him. **********A measure of what some in the Administration see as the political problems from the right was a report issued several weeks ago by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization. Even after the Administration urged increases of several billion dollars in military spending, the foundation report said, ''Thus far the new Administration has given few signs that it understands the urgency of correcting the vulnerabilities of U.S. strategic forces.'' **********Representative Les Aspin, a Wisconsin Democrat who finds much of what the President is doing excessive, does not think he has a policy. Mr. Aspin commented: ''Saying that he's not giving the speech because this will create political problems just doesn't wash. He already has political problems with his foreign policy, and these won't go away until he personally enunciates a position and stops the bickering in his own Administration.'' 'The World Is Too Complicated' **********Robert E. Osgood, a professor at Johns Hopkins University and an adviser to Mr. Reagan in the Presidential campaign, said the President was correct in resisting pressures to give ''an overarching speech and state some grand design, because the world is too complicated and it would mislead more than inform.'' Mr. Osgood also thinks that the direction and single theme of the Reagan foreign policy are quite clear, but that they do not constitute ''a policy.'' A policy to Mr. Osgood entails explaining what priorities are and how pieces fit together, obtaining the support of America's allies and showing how it is all going to work. **********Mr. Osgood, like many other foreign policy specialists, also contends that common sense is not enough. ''The world is uncommon and unpredictable, with too many variables and conflicts to be resolved by common sense without knowledge and a conceptual framework,'' he said. **********While Mr. Osgood is not critical of the time Mr. Reagan has taken so far, he, like others who hold similar views, maintains that the President will soon start paying a price in Congress, in his own bureaucracy and in foreign countries. So far, Mr. Osgood said, they are getting ''mixed signals, and they would respond better if they knew what we were doing.'' **********Richard M. Scammon, a public opinion expert, says that while the President's failure to give a major speech on foreign policy might be hurting him among some people in Washington, it has done him no harm with the American people in general. ''The polls show solid support for his foreign policy,'' Mr. Scammon said. ''Media complaints won't hurt him with the public in the short run, but if the press continues to hammer on the issue, it will begin to hurt him in the long run.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/05/business/us-car-makers-adding-more-aluminum-plastic.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 618, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. CAR MAKERS ADDING MORE ALUMINUM, PLASTIC", "print_headline": "U.S. CAR MAKERS ADDING MORE ALUMINUM, PLASTIC", "body_text": " **********American auto companies, in an effort to increase fuel efficiency by making lighter cars are using more parts made of aluminum and plastic.  \"The most exciting development programs currently under way in Detroit include doors, hoods and trunk lids made from reinforced plastics,\" said Gregory Galagher, transportation market manager for PPG Industries' Fiber Glass division in Pittsburg. **********\"In addition structural parts made of composite will include wheels, rear springs, bumper systems and similar components.\" **********At General Motors, the nation's largest auto maker, \"lightweight materials are going to play an important role,\" James Sines, manager of purchasing, forward planning and research, said in a telephone interview from Detroit. **********\"It's going to depend not only on what the steel people do, but on what their competitors do.

In 1980 it was 3,228 pounds.  In 1970 car steel accounted for 2,443 pounds, or 63 percent of the weight.  Last year, steel in the average car totaled 59 percent, or 1,919 pounds. **********While steel content dropped 4 percentage points over 10 years, the use of plastic and aluminum in cars roughly doubled, plastic to more than 6 percent from less than 3 percent, and aluminum to nearly 4 percent from 2 percent. **********The plastic industry, which began a big development program after the 1973 oil embargo, appears ready for a major breakthrough in the auto market, with high-strength reinforced materials. **********PPC recently rebuilt a Cadillac Seville almost entirely out of fiberglass composites, shaving about 700 pounds from the car's weight. **********Plastic, however, must overcome production problems - auto makers are still geared for steel, with huge capital investment in steel stamping and assembly facilities. **********Aluminum, which might more easily be used as a steel substitute, also has its problems.  Marvin Gantz, a vice president for mill products at the Aluminum Company of America, recently told securities analysts that the passenger-car market \"is less than thriving at the moment. **********PLANT CONSTRUCTION CANCELED **********Alcoa abandoned a multimillion-dollar plant-construction project in Davenport, Iowa, last year after losing promised orders from the auto industry. **********Aluminum's price has risen more than 50 percent in the last three years, but Alcoa contends that aluminum has a long-term advantage. **********\"When taking into account fuel savings present with use of light materials such as aluminum, we believe the cost is actually cheaper in the long run,\" said Gordon Wangersheim, an Alcoa spokesman. **********Mr.Wangersheim uses the example of a car hood.  He estimates it would weight 42 pounds and cost $12.40 if made from steel, 16 pounds and $24.70 if made from aluminum.  But the lower weight would save 42 gallons of gasoline over 1000,000 miles, giving aluminum a cost advantage over steel. **********But since the mid-70's, the steel industry has been working to develop thinner, stronger steels."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/02/business/waldheim-assails-tight-money-policy.html": {"writer_name": "Victor Lusinchi", "pub_date": "1981-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 511, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WALDHEIM ASSAILS TIGHT-MONEY POLICY", "print_headline": "WALDHEIM ASSAILS TIGHT-MONEY POLICY", "body_text": " **********Kurt Waldheim, Secretary General of the United Nations, today sharply criticized what he termed ''too exclusive reliance'' on monetary policy in the fight against inflation because of its impact on interest rates. **********Opening the annual summer session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, Mr. Waldheim named no country as he echoed Continental European criticism of the monetary policy now being followed by Washington and London. **********France and West Germany, for example, contend that their currencies are being weakened because investors are buying dollars to profit from the higher American interest rates resulting from Washington's tight monetary policy. **********Mr. Waldheim first criticized what he saw as excessive reliance on monetary policy in the fight against inflation because, he said, the ''causes of the inflationary process are too varied for it to be effectively countered by any one type of action.'' Factor in Instability **********Then he added that the high interest rates that such a policy engendered caused instability because ''partner countries have to adjust their financial policies to prevent large outflows of capital.'' **********Deploring the ''erosion of the system of multilateral cooperation'' in the economic field, Mr. Waldheim said that unilateral measures in financial markets and new trade barriers did not augur well for the International Development Strategy for the third world adopted by the General Assembly. **********For the developing countries, he said, the higher interest rates cause a very large increase in debt-carrying costs. Mr. Waldheim added that new protectionist trade measures, or even the threat of them, similarly discouraged the investment that was necessary, ''if production structures are to be adjusted and new jobs created.'' **********Earlier at a news conference, he said he took ''strong exception'' to the statement by a third world journalist that in proposing ''zero growth'' the United Nations budget was putting into practice ''Reagan-Thatcher'' economics,'' a reference to the tight monetary policies put into effect by President Reagan in the United States and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Britain. **********The reporter, Chakravarthi Raghavan of the Rome-based Inter Press Service, asked Mr. Waldheim why he had presented the $1.5 billion budget for the two years 1981-82 without an express mandate from the General Assembly when ''it is going to have a devastating effect on the United Nations system's capacity to respond to the development strategy.''

I would call those Islam and our belief in the family.'' **********Saudi officials privately acknowledge that the world has a legitimate interest in how the kingdom will progress, as fabulous oil wealth and the technology that this is buying rub against ancient piety and ingrained traditionalism. The Birthplace of Islam **********The vast desert land was the birthplace of Islam, so what happens here has meaning to all the world's 600 million Moslems.  The Government understands the West's concern over a safe flow of Saudi oil, they said, but it resents ill-informed Western criticism of the stricter practices of Islam, as observed here, such as stoning of adulterers and the veiling and seclusion of women. **********Comparisons with the experience of Iran anger Saudi officials who contend that Saudi Arabia has a different style of monarchy with a tradition of consultation. King Khalid does not wear a crown or sit on a throne. **********''There are also not very many Saudis - perhaps not more than five million -so it is easier to spread the wealth around,'' a West European diplomat remarked. **********The 1980-85 economic plan envisages investments of about $300 billion for social improvements, defense, agriculture and gas-based petrochemical plants to earn foreign exchange when oil income eventually tapers off. **********A recent visitor, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, heard the Minister of Planning, Hisham Nazer, declare that all Saudis were entitled to free education and health care, unemployment and injury benefits. Prices for some essentials are subsidized. **********''It may sound as if the Saudi Government is following a policy of handouts,'' he told Mrs. Thatcher, who is a vigorous champion of self-reliance and free enterprise. ''But the policy is to insure a minimum standard of living and beyond that the good life will have to be earned.'' **********The Saudis have a flair for doing that. The opulence of some is legendary. Yet even the remaining shacks and shanties of Riyadh and the commercial city of Jiddah have cars outside and television antennas on the roofs. Saudi Partners Are Required **********Jidda business executives said non-Saudi companies could only operate if they had Saudi sponsors or partners, who swap expertise in mastering local conditions for a share in the profits that are made as Saudi Arabia rushes to spend its oil dollars. **********Islam does not discourage making money, provided that the prosperous give alms to the poor.  As conservative religious authorities see it, Islam is liable to be at risk when wealthy young Saudis fly off for the summer to London, Paris or Bangkok and cultivate a taste for permissive ways, a diplomat said. **********Spiritual values are perceived as further threatened by the presence of many non-Moslems in a foreign work force of at least 1.5 million, required because so far too few Saudis have the technological skills to run a modern economy and very few are inclined to undertake manual labor. 'I Love My Kingdom' **********In turn, young technocrats may be irked by the restrictions that prevail in Saudi Arabia, although Saudis themselves say too much stress should not be put on this. ''I have been to England,'' a 22-year-old minor official said. ''I like it for the summer months.Then I am happy to return to my kingdom. I love my kingdom.'' **********Foreign diplomats said that close links between the religious authorities and the 4,000-member royal House of Saud aided social cohesion. The Sauds emerged as a power in the Arabian Peninsula during the 18th century, in alliance with the purist Wahhabite movement that sought to cleanse Islam of what it saw as sacrilegious and idolatrous practices. **********King Khalid regularly consults with the Islamic authorities.  Officials say the strength of the Sauds has been that it has held fast to the fundamentals of Islam, while very gradually encouraging change in some attitudes that owe more to customs that have secured religious sanction than to strict Koranic injunction. A Girls' School Succeeds **********An example often cited is the introduction of education for girls.  Islam does not forbid this but has been invoked as an ally against it. The first girls' school opened in 1956, at the initiative of Princess Iffat, wife of the late King Faisal. She obtained her husband's backing for the project -evidence for the behind-thescenes influence of Saudi women. **********For about a year pupils could not be found for the new school. By 1960, royal patronage had made girls' education sufficiently acceptable for state-run girls' schools to open. **********Some resistance was encountered and in one town King Faisal sent troops to keep its new school open. He declined, however, to coerce parents into sending their daughters there and for some months the only occupants were the headmistress and her own child. Then resistance waned. **********Among problems to which Saudi planners now seek a solution is that of enabling many of the thousands of women who have been educated to work, which would trim demand for immigrant labor. Islam does not bar women from working but Saudi custom requires that they may not do so in the company of men. **********Jobs as nurses and airline attendants are among those done in Suadi Arabia by foreign women brought in on contract."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/15/business/du-pont-products.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Du Pont Products", "print_headline": "Du Pont Products", "body_text": " **********E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company said that it planned to phase out the manufacture and sale of its Lucite acrylic molding and extrusion-cube polymers.

As the single-digit bond yields of the 1970's were overtaken by double-digit inflation, many bondholders fled the market entirely. **********Issuers, caught between their need for long-term money and the investor's demand for a decent return and preservation of capital, scratched their heads and came up with the floating-rate note. These are issues where the stated interest rate, or coupon, is adjusted periodically. Introduced in this country by Citicorp in 1974, there are now about $3.9 billion of them outstanding in the corporate market, with another several hundred million worth in the tax-exempt sector. **********If interest rates increased, the theory went, the price of the floating-rate issues would stay near par because of the periodic raising of the note coupon. Now, the question is whether the innovative floaters will become a real marketing alternative, or will disappear should interest rates decline and become more stable. **********''The traditional fixed-coupon, long-term bond will return to its favored position among investors if the Reagan Administration can wring out the inflationary psychology,'' said Richard Wilson, a vicepresident at Merrill Lynch who has specialized in floating rate issues. **********Not everyone agrees.  ''I expect further permutations on the floating rate idea'' as investors learn more about living with double-digit inflation and interest rates, explained Robert Henry, an investment banker at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''We have not gone nearly as far as the Europeans in developing more standardized versions of long-term floating rate securities.'' **********With new, fixed-rate, Aaa-rated, 40-year telephone company bonds yielding over 14 3/4 percent, there is ample evidence that investors are expecting high inflation and interest rates to persist. ''You still see a lot of people today who are uncertain about where inflation is headed, and are only too well aware that they have underestimated it in the past,'' said Mr. Henry. **********James L. Sullivan, senior vice-president in charge of $3 billion of investments at the American General Insurance Company, said his new bond holdings are all in the floating, or adjustable-rate securities, which he expects to account for a third to a half of the his portfolio within three to five years. **********''The adjustable-rate issues help keep the yield of my portfolio near current market levels,'' he explained. ''Even if I swing $100 million of bonds in and out of the market with perfect timing, the improvement for the entire portfolio is small.'' **********E VEN if interest rates do decline sharply later this decade, Mr.  Sullivan plans to stick with floaters. ''A lot of investors who think they are locking in high yields with long-term, fixed-rate bonds will have to reinvest that money in five to seven years because the companies will refund those old, high-coupon issues,'' he said. **********The shortcomings of floaters became apparent shortly after the groundbreaking Citicorp issue of 1974, a $650 million offering of notes due 1989, with a coupon adjusted every six months, to a slight premium over the equivalent yield on three-month Treasury bills. In 1975-76, the yield on the notes dropped below 6 percent, or less than what could be earned with other short- or long-term issues. Investors began to redeem their notes in bunches. Today, only about $160 million of the issue is still outstanding. **********Other deficiencies in the floating rate issues of Citicorp and a host of imitators became apparant in 1980 when interest rates changed rapidly. The semiannual changes in the coupon where not frequent enough to keep pace when six-month Treasury bills, for example, jumped from about 12 percent in early February to 15.7 percent in late March. And rates on Treasury bills, because they are considered the safest and most liquid of all investments, rose far less than other alternative investments, including bank certificates of deposit or commercial paper. **********A subsequent Citicorp issue in 1980 attempted to correct those ills by adjusting the coupon monthly. Also, the new issue, which was sold in minimums of $100,000 due to Federal regulations, set the coupon according to a formula that included the yield of bank C.D.'s as well as Treasury bills. **********Another type of floating rate issue, also pegged to Treasury bills, allows the investor to convert his holdings into a long-term, fixed-rate bond. There are about $1.6 billion of such issues outstanding - from companies ranging from Chase Manhattan to Beneficial Finance - and most specify that the investor has the option to convert to a long-term, fixed-rate issue with a coupon of about 8 1/2 percent. **********''The convertibility does not seem to be worth much today because bond yields are so much higher, but the jury is still out since the right to convert does not expire for several years,'' one investment banker said. **********Yet another variety of floater calls for the new coupon to be adjusted according to the yield on 10-, 20-, or 30-year Treasury bonds. (Since yields of long-term issues are more closely linked to expected inflation than short-term issues, many investors prefer the long-term link.)

Both moves reflected promises made during last spring's election campaign. **********The 788.1-billion-franc budget proposal - equal to $143.3 billion - contrasts sharply with budgets being planned in the United States, Britain, West Germany and most other Western industrial countries, all of which are committed to conservative economic polices aimed at reducing inflation by limiting public spending. **********The proposed budget will be submitted to the French Parliament where the Socialists have a majority. No substantial changes are expected. Government Plans Biggest Deficit **********Although most French citizens would pay more taxes next year and the rich, for the first time, would pay a wealth tax, the Government still planned to run the biggest budget deficit in French history - 95 billion francs, or $17 billion. **********Today, Pierre Beregovoy, the presidential chief of staff, described the new budget as a step toward ''fiscal justice'' and an expression of the Government's will to ''fight for employment by stimulating the economy calling for national solidarity.'' **********Government spokesmen stressed that next year's budget deficit would be relatively small compared with those of many other Western countries, and therefore should not promote inflation or undermine the franc. **********But the Government's revenue projections assume the economy would grow by 3.3 percent next year because of the stimulus it was administering. That forecast is higher than many private projections. **********Moreover, next year's planned deficit would follow an anticipated budget deficit of about 75 billion francs this year that has already helped push the inflation rate to 15 percent and gravely weakened the franc on currency markets. **********Selling pressure on the franc mounted today following announcement of the proposed budget. The currency closed in European trading at 5.5570 francs to the dollar, up from 5.53 yesterday. 65,000 New Jobs Planned **********Under the proposed budget, the Government plans to create 65,000 new public sector jobs, in order to reach its target of 125,000 new jobs during 1981 and 1982. The Government also has increased by 45 percent incentives, such as subsidies for training, that it would give companies to encourage them to hire more employees. A total of 18.6 billion francs has been budgeted for such incentives. In addition, the Government would increase spending on public works program by 30 percent and on housing by 34 percent. **********Inexpensive loans and other subsidies to industry, such as grants for research or energy conservation investments, are due to rise 54 percent. **********Military spending would also increase by 18 percent, reflecting President Mitterrand's tough anti-Soviet stance and frequent warnings about the rapid buildup of Soviet nuclear weaponry. The overall military budget is expected to equal 3.89 percent of total economic output next year, compared with 3.85 per cent this year. **********To help raise money for its spending sprees, the French Government plans to impose a wealth tax ranging from five-tenths of 1 percent to 1.5 percent on fortunes of more than 3 million francs. In order to combat evasion of the tax, the Government also announced yesterday that henceforth the names of both buyer and seller will be recorded in all gold transactions on the Paris market, thus eliminating the well-established practice of anonymous tradin g. Income Tax Increases Scheduled **********In addition, French income taxpayers paying more than 15,000 francs next year would have their tax increased by 15 percent in an exceptional step intended to help finance the soaring cost to the state of unemployment compensation. Banks and oil companies would conti nue to p ay this year's ''windfall profits'' tax, while taxes on gasoline, tob acco and motor vehicle licenses would all be sharply raised. **********The cutback in the nuclear program would eliminate about one-third of the nuclear generating capacity the defeated Gaullists had planned to build during the next two years. It came in the form of an announcement that the Government had decided to build just five 1,300-megawatt reactors and one 900-megawatt reactor over the twoyear period. **********During the election campaign, President Mitterrand sought to win the votes of environmentalists by saying that France's civil nuclear program was ''excessive, even dangerous '' and promising to review it. But the cutbacks ordered today also reflected a decline in France's projected electricity needs as a result of the economic downturn."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/09/business/united-siscoe-mines-ltd-reports-earnings-for-year-to-march-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNITED SISCOE MINES LTD reports earnings for Year to March 31", "print_headline": "UNITED SISCOE MINES LTD reports earnings for Year to March 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/03/business/company-news-noranda-increases-bid-for-macmillan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 265, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Noranda Increases Bid for MacMillan", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Noranda Increases Bid for MacMillan", "body_text": " **********The battle for control of MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. of Vancouver, Canada's largest forest products company, intensified today as Toronto-based Noranda Mines Ltd. raised its cash-and-shares offer for the company to the equivalent of $62 a share, or $626 million (Canadian). **********The offer, which would raise Noranda's holdings in MacMillan to 49 percent, from 8 percent, follows by one day the British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation's offer to raise its stake in MacMillan from 20 percent to 49 percent by paying $56 a share cash, or $347.2 million. **********According to William Procter, a forest-products analyst for Gardiner Watson Limited, a Toronto investment concern, ''the Noranda offer is clearly better and is up in the realms of a very fair offer.'' **********The bidding war was begun by B.C.

(July 5), gave an amusing example of why economics always seems so confused. In a most convoluted mathematical calculation, Mr. Malkiel attempts to show that an investor lending at 13 percent, with a prevailing 10 percent rate of inflation, will receive a net yield of 3 percent. He reasons as follows: An investor lends $1,000 for one year at 13 percent, receiving $130 in ''interest.'' But at the end of the year the investor receives back a devalued principal which Mr.  Malkiel somehow concludes is now worth $900 in year-one dollars. He then goes on to calculate that $900 (adjusted for inflation) plus $130 (inflated, unadjusted) minus $1,000 (not inflated) equals $30. **********Let's try to get an answer in real dollars. First, $1,000 at 10 percent inflation is devalued in one year to 1000/@ 1.10 equals $909, not $900. We might forgive Mr. Malkiel for casually ''rounding off,'' but suppose our investor moves overseas where we now find her investing $1,000 at 110 percent a year with an annual inflation rate of 100 percent. She gets $1,100 in ''interest'' and a devalued principal back which is now worth, not zero, but $1,000/2.00 equals $500. Using the dubious ''Malkiel Equation,'' we might conclude $500 plus $1,100 minus $1,000 equals $600, or a whopping rate of return of 60 percent. **********Tsk, tsk, professor, it's really all so simple. Remember, interest also gets hit by inflation. To get net, we take $1,000 (principal) plus $1,100 (interest) equals $2,100. Since inflation is 100 percent, $2,100 buys only half that, or $1,050 of goods at last year's prices. Thus, net equals $1,050 minus $1,000 equals $50, or 5 percent. Only if the investor receives the interest immediately upon investment, and reinvests it at the prevailing inflation rate, will she receive, in this example, a net yield of 10 percent. (This is something I've never quite gotten my bank to do.) **********Mr. Malkiel's example will be left as an exercise for the reader.  However, for the still perplexed investor, the correct answer is $27.27, or (if you'll forgive the rounding) 2.7 percent. Be sure to try and work this out though because next week we will cover compounding.

T here is no link between these things.'' **********He was replying to a reporter's question, after the weekly Cabinet meeting, about statements in Washington that Congressional rejection of the sale would disrupt plans to strengthen United States military ties with Israel. **********The growing emphasis on a link has been interpreted here as a reflection of the Reagan Administration's increasing concern over the developing Senate opposition to the deal, and an inclination to hold the pro-Israel lobby responsible for any defeat. Charge of Interference Rejected **********Mr. Begin rejected an accusation by Senator John Tower, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, that the Prime Minister had intervened in domestic American politics by opposing the sale of Airborne Warning and Control System planes, known as Awacs, to the Saudis. **********''There is no basis to this accusation, but I do not want to enter into an argument with a U.S. Senator,'' Mr. Begin said. ''In the debate between the two arms of government, the executive and legislative, we won't intervene.'' **********Israel's tactic, in an effort to avoid antagonizing the Reagan Administration, has been to try to walk a careful line, stating its opposition while staying out of the conflict between Congress and the White House, hoping that the sale will be defeated but that Israel will not be blamed for a defeat. **********The Israeli press has reported that the Israeli Embassy in Washington, for example, has been directed to keep a low profile in the debate. Mr. Begin has even drawn criticism at home, with newspaper editorials and opposition Labor Party leaders accusing him of weakening the fight against the Saudi arms deal in exchange for the vague and dubious notion of ''strategic cooperation.'' 'A Totally New Situation' **********The cooperation being considered would include stockpiling American weapons in Israel for use by American troops in an emergency, and joint air and naval maneuvers. **********Shimon Peres, the Labor Party chairman, said last week: ''We in the Labor Party would not have agreed to pay the price which Begin paid for his strategic agreement. That price was the Awacs. We always had a constant agreement with the U.S. that since we are at a numerical and quantitative disadvantage, we should enjoy qualitative superiority, including in armament. Now, with the sale of Awacs to the Saudis, we are for the first time facing a totally new situation.'' **********In fact, Mr. Begin has argued forcefully against the proposed sale of five Awacs to Saudi Arabia, and against the provision of extra fuel pods, bomb racks and missiles for F-15 fighters that the Saudis are purchasing. **********''I spoke to the President for an hour and a half and expressed our opposition to this double sale,'' Mr. Begin said. ''I told the President explicitly, illustrating with maps - we brought maps - to prove how these Awacs could view almost all of Israel, and out of the seven airfields, five of them, and so forth.'' Awacs Could Be Targets The Israeli apprehension is based on the fact that Saudi Awacs co uld detect Israeli aircraft, and direct Saudi fighters against th em, long before the Israelis could spot the Awacs or the Saudi fi ghters. The Awacs has radar and computerized command equipment su perior to the instruments aboard the Hawkeye E-2C, which the Is raelis fly to direct their fighters into combat. **********Some Israeli officials have said that a Saudi Awacs would be a first target in any warfare, but one American expert, who asked not to be identified, doubted that the surveillance plane would be so easy to shoot down. **********''Israel would lose in excess of a dozen aircraft trying to shoot this down,'' the American said. ''It sees you 200 miles before you see it. It would call up Saudi F-15's, which would fly just outside the Israeli perimeter and wait, and they'll enter from a difficult angle and ambush the Israelis.'' **********He noted that in proposing the original procurement of the expensive planes -each one costs about $1 billion - the United States Air Force argued in 1976 that the Awacs could ''survive sufficiently well'' against the Warsaw Pact, which has 2,000 fighters, and that ''survivability in other, less demanding environments is unquestioned.'' 'What Are You Worried About?' **********The idea of shooting down planes that would have, at least initially, American crew members aboard has bothered Israeli officials. Prime Minister Begin commented on it in a speech to P arliament la st May 11. **********''Some respected and important Americans gave us some simple advice,'' he said. '' 'What are you worried about? You have a marvelous air force. If they are stationed near the Israeli border instead of in the eastern part of Saudi Arabia, you simply shoot them down.' **********''And at the same time, they tell us that for many years to come, there will be Americans and Saudis in those planes after the Awacs are sold to Saudi Arabia. What strange advice we get from Washington. We are supposed to shoot down the planes and kill not only the Saudis, who are our enemies, but also the Americans, who are our friends. Very strange advice indeed.

As usual, the losers were long the market because most small traders do not sell short. They are fearful of selling goods they do not own in the hope that prices will decline before they have to deliver them. **********But there was one kind of small speculator that actually made money in the first half without making any decisions at all. Nor did they spend one night worrying about a morning call for more cash margin from their brokers. The reason: they were members of commodity pools, which are similar to the mutual funds involving securities. **********Commodity pools have been proliferating at a rapid rate in the past year or so to serve small speculators unable or unwilling to trade on their own. Most of the major pools are sponsored by leading brokerage houses and managed by independent professionals who receive a fee and portion of the profits. **********''The growth of the pools is indeed astounding, particularly in light of the lackluster performance of most markets in the last 18 months,'' said Andrea Cocoran, chief counsel of the trading and markets division of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, during an interview in her office in Washington last week. **********''Our agency began registering commodity pool operators on April 1, 1979, when the total was some 600.'' she said. ''In 1980, the number grew to 786, and as of last April, there were 1,084 registered operators and the number is growing.'' **********Barbara Stern, special counsel of the C.F.T.C. division, said in the same interview: ''Thus far there have been few problems with the pools sponsored by brokerage houses. The troubles have been confined to swindlers pretending to run legitimate pools.'' **********As a result, the C.F.T.C. is tightening its regulations governing commodity pools. Oddly, one of the agency's reforms instituted last Wednesday exempts pools with less than $200,000 in assets as well as those with fewer than 15 members, while supervision of the large pools have been inexplicably tightened. **********Another oddity is that the only private monitor of the performance of commodity pools is Norwood Securities Inc., a Chicago brokerage house that does not handle commodity business. Jay Klopfenstein, president of Norwood, said in a recent interview: **********''We began to monitor the pools some two years ago because we knew they were going to become a very important element in the financial services business. Besides, many of our securities customers also trade commoditiies and only knew the results of their own pool's performance from monthly reports. They didn't know how the others were doing.'' **********But Mr. Klopfenstein emphasized that he only records the performance of pools that provide him with detailed data each month.  He also has devised the Norwood Index, which has become the Dow Jones of pool watchers. **********The index showed that the assets of the 26 pools rose 3.8 percent in May compared with a gain of nine-tenths of a percent the month before. The index for June is expected to be published later this week. **********According to his information, the following brokerage houses are forming commodity pools as a first venture or ''clone'' to existing ones: Merrill Lynch, $30 million; Thomson McKinnon Commodity Partners I, $10 million; Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Heinhold, $15 million; A.G. Becker's LaSalle Street Futures Fund, $15 million; Piper Jaffray (Minneapolis) Midwest Commodity Fund I, $10 million. **********Again, Mr. Klopfenstein stressed that the list only contained pools that brokerage houses had told him about.  ''We still can't make year-to-year comparisons because they are being created at a fast pace,'' Mr. Klopfenstein said. ''What we can state is that most did quite well during the price slump in the first half because most of them followed their computer instructions and were short the market during this period. Now it looks like commodity prices in general may have reached a bottom for the time being.'' **********Thomas A. Russo, a specialist in commodities at the New York law firm of Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft, observed yesterday: **********''The next big step in commodity pools will be taken later this year, when the big and not-so-big brokerage houses run their own pools, instead of just underwriting them. After all, they have the sales force and their in-house commodity research.'' **********Most important, Mr. Russo said, the reservoir of commodity traders is relatively small, numbering perhaps 200,000 active accounts. Given the heavy losses sustained by small speculators in the past 18 months, many are now unable or unwilling to risk their capital in these highly volatile markets. **********''If the brokerage houses want to keep their commodity departments as profit centers,'' Mr. Russo said, ''they will need more than new products such as financial instruments. They will need safer methods to trade futures. The proliferation of futures markets in recent years has not really increased the number of traders. For many houses it has just increased the overhead. That's why everyone is forming pools.'' **********While this may run counter to the glowing trading statistics furnished each month by the Futures Industry Association, many brokers and exchange officials concede that the sharp rises in volume increasingly represent trading among floor traders and other professionals, rather than the public's participation. **********This week, the F.I.A. will report that futures trading in June soared a further 27 percent, to 8.5 million contracts, with the total for the first six months up 24 percent from the 1980 level, to 47.5 million.

His appointment to the F.T.C. is expected to have a strong impact on the way the regulatory agency works. **********''My basic philosophy reflects the President's own,'' Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview. ''I have, like most economists, a great appreciation for the marketplace, which needs regulatory relief. It's not that we need to cut the pie smaller, we need to make the pie grow larger.'' Government regulations, Mr. Miller feels, represent one of the chief negatives in the equation - an equation that started out to redress inequities but has since become part of the problem. ''Simple changes have ramifications beyond the original scene, and there ain't no such thing as a free lunch,'' Mr. Miller said. **********Under Mr. Miller, the commission is likely to find itself working within a very narrow mandate. Remarking that he still faced confirmation hearings, Mr. Miller declined to discuss his plans for running the F.T.C. **********The F.T.C. has encountered hard times in the last several years, as the mood of the country shifted to one of regulatory caution. In the early and mid-1970's, the commission broke new ground in the area of antitrust law and consumer protection, as it operated under new powers from Congress and broad interpretations of old mandates. Crackdown by Congress **********But last year, Congress cracked down on the agency's powers. The Reagan Administration has already cut the commission's budget and attempted to remove its antitrust authority. Most of the antitrust cases that brought it into the limelight during the last decade have quietly died since January or have been severely curtailed. **********''Jim has the talent of focusing on what are the important things that need to get done and not getting sidetracked,'' said one budget official who has worked closely with Mr. Miller. **********As an example of that focus, others cite the swiftness with which Mr. Miller was able to get a coalition of support behind President Reagan's Executive Order 12291, which requires executive branch departments and regulatory agencies to do cost-benefit analyses of new regulations and submit the results to the Office of Management and Budget before issuing new regulations. Research Aide With Two Groups **********Mr. Miller received his undergraduate degree in economics from the University of Georgia in 1965. He received his doctorate, also in economics, from the University of Virginia in 1969 and afterward served as a senior staff economist with the Department of Transportation. During 1972, he also worked as a research associate at the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute, both Washington-based economic research organizations. **********From 1972 to 1974 he was associate professor of economics at Texas A & M University, as well as a consultant to the Department of Transportation and the National Bureau of Standards. **********From 1974 to late 1975, he was a member of the senior staff of the Council of Economic Advisers, as well as being an adjunct scholar with the enterprise institute. In October 1975, he served as assistant director for government operation and research on the Council on Wage and Price Stability. Resident Scholar at Institute **********Beginning in 1977 and until his budget appointment this year, he was an enterprise institute resident scholar and co-director of its Center for the Study of Government Regulation. **********Mr. Miller was born on June 25, 1942, in Conyers, Ga., the eldest of six children. His father, James C. Miller Jr., is a retired Delta Air Lines pilot; his mother, Annie, is a real estate broker. **********Mr. Miller married the former Demaris Humphries and they reside in the District of Columbia and have three children: Katrina, 11 years old;, Felix, 10, and Sabrina, 8. **********Mr. Miller relaxes by riding his motorcycle, backpacking with his family and operating his ham radio set.

''Everybody is prepared to give a government the benefit of doubt when it's just been installed but this points to a pattern of behavior.'' **********The United States mission here refused to comment on Mrs.  Kirkpatrick's meeting with the South African officer.  There is anxiety over the meeting, said Bishop Desmond Tutu, the general secretary of South Africa's Council of Churches, ''not as an isolated thing but in relation to the whole tenor that appears to be emerging in Washington over policy on South Africa.'' **********Bishop Tutu said he had been told of the meeting by Mrs.  Kirkpatrick yesterday, during a half-hour visit he made to her office, which was arranged before his arrival in New York Saturday, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/22/business/continental-airlines.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Continental Airlines", "print_headline": "Continental Airlines", "body_text": " **********Continental Airlines said that Texas International Airlines was violating the independence of the trust which holds a 48.5 percent interest in Continental.

She emphasized the need to open more jobs to women, set up more child care centers, change the education system, revise family laws and legalize abortions. **********Greece's new First Lady is tall and blond with the unpretentious charm of a Midwestern farm girl. She comes from Elmhurst, Ill., and studied journalism and public health at the University of Minnesota. Papandreous Met in Minnesota **********It was there that she met and married an economics professor, Andreas Papandreou, in 1951. He had left Greece in 1940 before the invasion of Mussolini's troops, and had gone to Harvard University, where he obtained a doctorate in economics in 1943. **********Mr. Papandreou became an American citizen in 1944. He served in the United States Navy for two years before going to the University of Minnesota to teach. In 1955, the Papandreous moved to the University of California at Berkeley, where he served as chairman of the Department of Economics. **********Their four children were born in America. George Jeffrey, 29 years old, has just been elected to Parliament from the district of Patras, where his father and grandfather ran before him. Gayle Sophia, 27, who has just finished her master's degree in economics in Sussex, England, recently married and expects to get a job soon.  Nicholas, 25, is studying for a doctorate in Princeton and Andreas Jr., 23, is studying at the London School of Economics. **********It was in 1959 that Andreas Papandreou decided to return to Greece, his wife recalls. Mr. Papandreou, who had gone back with Fulbright and Guggenheim grants, was asked by Prime Minister Constantine Caramanlis to set up the Center of Economic Research in Athens. He resumed his Greek citizenship, won a seat in Parliament and was given a Cabinet post in the 1964 Government headed by his father, Prime Minister George Papandreou. Colonels Arrest Father and Son **********The rapidly growing influence and Socialist ideas of Andreas Papandreou were said to be among the main factors that prompted the 1967 colonels' coup. Both father and son were arrested. **********George was released six months later and died the next year.  Andreas was charged with high treason, kept in solitary confinement for eight months, then released under a Christmas amnesty and expelled. **********Andreas spent his seven years of exile as a professor of economics, first at Stockholm University, then York University in Toronto.  During his exile, he organized the Pan Hellenic Liberation Movement, a coalition of groups opposed to military dictatorship. **********Mr. Papandreou and his family returned to Greece in 1974 when the junta collapsed after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. He then founded the Pan Hellenic Socialist Movement, called Pasok. It grew in seven years from a small group with 13 percent of the vote and 12 seats in Parliament to become the major political force in the country with 48 percent of the vote and 172 seats in last Sunday's election. 'Margaret Taught Us Everything' **********His wife started to build up the women's movement in 1975.  ''Margaret taught us everything, how to make a modern organization,'' says Titina Pantazis, a young woman who has just been elected on the Socialist ticket as deputy to the European Parliament. ''She is the brains behind the women's union and has been elected president several times, but always refuses, preferring the post of vice president.'' **********Mrs. Papandreou says her main activity has been to mobilize women, wherever they are - in the marketplaces, beauty shops, hospitals and particularly in the villages. There are now chapters of the Women's Union all over Greece. **********''But there's still a strong belief that women belong at home,'' she said. More Women Candidates **********She is pleased that there were more women running in the last election - 205 compared with only 103 in 1977 - but she is disappointed that there were not many more. And only 12 women - 8 of them Socialists - were elected to the 300-seat Parliament, just two more than in the last Conservative-dominated legislature. **********Mrs. Papandreou rarely appeared with her husband during the election campaign, preferring to take part in women's rallies. She went to Piraeus to show support for the actress Melina Mercouri, who later won a seat in Parliament and has been named Minister of Culture and Sciences. **********Miss Mercouri arrived at the rally late with a dramatic flourish, wearing the party's green colors and stealing the show with slogans, ''No to American Bases!'' and ''Out With NATO!'' Mrs. Papandreou showed up quietly and on time. In a correct, if stilted, Greek she made a strong plea for women to vote Socialist. **********''We've had enough of high prices and high cost of living of this archaic educational system, the lack of child care centers,'' she said. ''We've had enough of living in areas where our relatives or friends die because of lack of doctors, of hospitals, of emergency treatment. We've had enough of Government bureaucracy and corruption, of getting improper and dangerous abortions.'' 'Second-Class Citizens' **********She went on, ''We've had enough of being second-class citizens, always pushed to the margin, never listened to, never given rightful positions in decision-making bodies.'' **********Militant men in the Socialist ranks generally approve of Mrs.  Papandreou's discretion and say she has played ''an appropriate role,'' concentrating on the Women's Union. **********In a recent interview with a Greek newspaper, Mrs. Papandreou said she had been interested in women's rights ever since her high school days, when she wanted to play on the school basketball team, but it accepted only boys. **********''Since then, a quiet rage developed in me over the unfairness of the system,'' she said.  Almost wistfully, she expressed the hope that one day she would be seen by Greeks as not only the wife of Andreas Papandreou but also as Margaret Papandreou, a woman with her own personality and political activities, particularly her work with women. **********Several years ago, she began writing children's books with a message - in Greek ''with some help.'' She has written ''an antiimperialist book'' and a ''women's lib book'' for children aged 5 to 8. **********''Children's fairy tales are political,'' she says. ''All the books we read as children talk of kings, princesses, poor and rich, strong and handsome men, pretty women made for the home. This is the children's version of the capitalist system's ideology.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/15/world/libyan-vows-not-to-deny-us-oil.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 270, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LIBYAN VOWS NOT TO DENY U.S. OIL", "print_headline": "LIBYAN VOWS NOT TO DENY U.S. OIL", "body_text": " **********Col.

Dome is heavily in debt after its $1.43 billion acquisition of 52.9 percent of Hudson's Bay Oil from Conoco Inc. last June. **********Mr. Gobert also said that Dome's announcement last night of its Beaufort Sea drilling results indicated that Beaufort's oil potential ''ranks with the North Sea.'' **********Dome said one of the structures it was working, the Kopanoar, had an indicated potential of 1.8 billion to 4.5 billion barrels of oil and another, the Koakoak, could yield 2 billion to 5 billion barrels.

Cities Service is fretting over the flirtations of Nu-West and Mesa Petroleum. Garfinckel, Brooks Brothers, Miller & Rhoads is on the run from Allied Stores. Nowadays executives of even the largest corporations are whispering among themselves: How do we defend our company when a corporate raider tries to snatch it up? **********''A takeover attempt is the single most important thing that will happen to the management of a corporation,'' said Martin Lipton, a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and a well-known specialist who has aided such companies as McGraw-Hill, St. Joe Minerals and United Technologies to repel unwelcome suitors. Displayed on a shelf in his Park Avenue office are miniature ''tombstones,'' newspaper ads announcing earlier takeover offers. **********Conoco couldn't do it, but there are ways of thwarting a raider.  Once an offer has been made, the odds of eluding a suitor are about 1 to 4, and, understandably, takeover specialists believe a company's first line of defense is to even refuse to play the game. **********When an executive gets a call from a person he spots as a likely raider, he should make himself scarce and tell him nothing, said several takeover advisers. The slightest insight the raider might glean into the state of the company can become lethal ammunition. Several investment bankers believe that Conoco's undoing began when Ralph E. Bailey, the chairman, agreed to sit down and talk with Edgar Bronfman, the chairman of the Seagram Company. **********''Problems always start to arise when a company agrees to talk and the raiding company begins to commit its prestige to an offer,'' said Mr. Lipton. **********After an offer is made the time constraints the target must work under are enormous. When a company makes an offer for the shares of another, the target has 20 business days to respond, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. In that 20 days, takeover specialists, including investment bankers, lawyers and public relations advisers, are called in to direct the management in what often turns into around-the-clock work. **********''It was not unusual to get a call at 2 A.M. on Sunday morning asking me to go to the printer,'' said one young man who worked for a public relations firm that specialized in takeover work. He has since left that job for one that is less nerve-wracking. **********The investment banker analyzes the financial adequacy of an offer and may suggest such strategies as making a tender offer for the company's own shares as a way to raise the value of those shares and at least make the company more expensive. The lawyer culls the offer for antitrust problems, regulatory conflicts and securities violations, and the public relations adviser concentrates on the public-interest issues. **********Just last week, Cities Service tried to discourage Mesa and Nu-West by filing lawsuits charging that the two companies manipulated its stock. Garfinckel officers called Allied's bid ''inadequate'' and also approved lucrative management contracts for the company's executives. **********While both of these defenses may prove helpful, a survey completed by Goldman, Sachs & Company that traced the outcome of 114 takeover attempts showed that 72 percent of the companies were eventually taken over and the defensive tactics proved most helpful in delaying the process long enough for 39 percent of those taken over to find a more desirable partner. **********How have some of the companies that managed to escape the clutches of another company beaten the odds?  A public relations expert, Richard E. Cheney, a vice chairman of Hill & Knowlton, has made a career out of trying to defend companies from takeovers. He recalled the 1967 case of Federal Paper Board. **********''I got a call from the president of Federal Paper to come down to the law offices of White & Case,'' he said. The day before, the president of Federal Paper had lunched with the president of Simkins Industries, a small paper company and learned that he was ready to make a cash offer for more than 50 percent of Federal's stock on Monday morning. **********John Kennedy, the president of Federal, called the board and its advisers to meet and by Sunday afternoon Federal's board had split the stock, raised the dividend, announced record earnings for the current year and projected even better earnings for the following year. **********Even before it was out, the bid had been beaten back. On Monday morning, when the offering was made, the price of Federal's stock opened higher than the price Simkins was willing to pay and it retreated. **********When Harold W. McGraw Jr. learned that American Express had made an offer for McGraw-Hill in 1979, the grandson of the publishing giant surprised even employees by the vehemence of his attack on James Robinson 3d, chairman of American Express. **********Gershon Kekst, president of Kekst & Company, a firm that specializes in advising clients on the public relations aspect of a takeover, credits Mr. Lipton with recognizing after a weekend of strategy sessions that in this case, the public relations effort would be crucial. **********''To convince the shareholders and public that the conflict-ofinterest problems in this case just weren't a ruse, we wanted Harold McGraw himself to express publicly the same sense of outrage that he expressed privately with Marty and I,'' Mr. Kekst said. **********Mr. McGraw had several reservations, such as whether some of its publications like Business Week would be able to cover topics thoroughly in which American Express had some interests. **********At a news conference and later in full-page advertisements that ran in several major papers, Mr. McGraw recounted the contents of a fiery letter to Mr. Robinson in which he called the offer illegal and improper, and accused American Express of lacking integrity and corporate morality. **********McGraw-Hill sued, American Express countersued and McGraw-Hill cried ''unjust'' to the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and Congress. Mr. Robinson soon realized that the company he might end up with would be quite different from the one for which he had bargained - he not only wanted the publishing business but the executives and writers that worked for it - and he let his offer expire without purchasing a single share. **********In the battle between the Occidental Petroleum Corporation and the Mead Corporation that began with Occidental's bid in August 1978, a little-used specialist, Stanley Pottinger, a partner in the Washington law firm of Troy, Malin & Pottinger, was called in by Mead's outside counsel, Joseph Flom, an attorney for Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. **********Mr. Flom has distinquished himself as one of the best takeover lawyers in the field, and Mr. Pottinger's expertise is litigating on liabilities that the raider may have, such as a huge product liablity suit that could cost millions or a problem with toxic chemical liabilities. Because his research can result in some complicated and serious lawsuits, he will only work on a case when the client's outside counsel requests his services. **********The skeletons that Mr. Pottinger unearthed in Occidental's case exposed the oil company to millions of dollars in potential liability, and forced the company to make new disclosures to the S.E.C. **********Lawsuits brought by other parties, Mr. Pottinger said, later resulted in some out-of-court settlements, but before that the whole affair became embarrassingly bitter for Occidental, and by Dec. 20 the directors of the oil company had voted to withdraw their offer. A statement issued at the time said that one reason for the decision to drop the bid was ''the ferocity of the Mead management opposition.'' **********''The two companies have to be in a clear adversarial position before we are called in,'' said Mr. Pottinger. ''The target company doesn't want to loosen boulders at the top of the hill on the raider unless it is very sure. Once you begin to go to court and discover liabilities you can't simply shake hands after the tender dispute comes to a close. That litigation goes on.'' **********Managements worried about covering their flanks from raiding companies can take some security in knowing that a bitter battle can sour an acquiring company from ever again making an unsolicited offer. **********Northwest Industries lost out in a bid for B.F. Goodrich in 1969 after the tire company bought a trucking concern to complicate the antitrust issues. **********The defense team topped the strategy off by Mr. Cheney's discovery that Northwest's chairman had been attributing several quarters of poor earnings on bad weather. The press releases with the weather excuses were collected and pasted up in an advertisement that ran under the headline: ''It only snows on Northwest.'' **********''What we carried away from that was to never enter an unfriendly bid again,'' Paul J. Weir, Northwest's chief financial officer, said. ''When you buy a company you are looking for the management and even after a battle is over it becomes difficult to retain and work with the management.'' **********Mr. Weir contends, however, that in hindsight it would have been better for Goodrich shareholders to accept the Northwest offer. ''If they would have accepted the offer they would have been 750 percent better off today,'' said Mr. Weir. ''They are the real losers.'' **********Mr. Lipton used to believe that the most effective defense strategy was to litigate on the basis of antitrust issues. These issues at least delayed Mobil's bid for Conoco, which was higher than Du Pont's, long enough to make Conoco's shareholders believe that final clearance for Mobil was iffy and it was better to go with Du Pont. **********With the Reagan Administration taking a more liberal view toward big mergers, however, Mr. Lipton said that at least for the next four years antitrust litigation might not be as effective. When antitrust issues aren't applicable, Mr. Lipton said that he then goes through the panoply of defense options. **********These include possible regulatory conficts, disclosure questions, breech of fiduciary responsibility and just watching closely, hoping to catch a mistake that the raider might make. If a raider can be nabbed on just one offense it may be enough to squelch the attack. He cautions, however, against, overkill. **********One of his colleagues in another firm went down Mr. Lipton's list of defenses and used them all. ''In certain circumstances,'' writes Mr. Lipton, in an outline of takeover practices, ''more may turn out to be less.''  TAKEOVERS:THE PLAYERS **********When an executive finds that he wants to buy another corporation or someone is trying to buy his, one of the first things he will do is assemble a strategy team of lawyers, investment bankers and public relations and shareholder advisers. Here are some of the people and firms that have figured in recent major battles: **********Lawyers: The two best-known takeover lawyers are Joseph Flom of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, and Martin Lipton of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.

It was the day's most-active issue on the Big Board. **********Canadian Pacific Enterprises, which is attempting to take over Hobart against its will with an offer to pay $32.50 a share, had no comment. It is understood to be reviewing the offer but is regarded as too unpredictable for Wall Street analysts to say what it might now do. Some analysts felt that Dart & Kraft's offer was so favorable that Canadian Pacific would find it difficult to improve upon. **********For the first time in many months, professional arbitragers found that they were unable to penetrate the secrecy normally imposed in merger talks. Even so, Wall Street analysts had heard reports that not only Dart & Kraft but also American Brands Inc. and the Raytheon Company had looked at the company. **********Before its merger with Dart Industries last year, Kraft Inc., then a food company, reviewed a number of diversification steps, including the purchase of Hobart, but did not pursue them. In explaining why it was now seeking Hobart, a spokesman said yesterday that it was ''not experienced'' then in managing a number of different companies but felt that it was now, since its merger with Dart. **********The bid for Hobart is understood to have developed in mid-January, at the suggestion of the Merrill Lynch White Weld Capital Markets group, soon after Hobart's directors rejected the Canadian Pacific proposal. Financial Data Studied **********The Merrill Lynch group, as financial adviser to Hobart, showed Dart & Kraft executives enough of Hobart's internal financial data to prompt a closer look. By the end of last month, at a meeting in Troy, Ohio, Hobart's headquarters, John M. Richmond, chairman of Dart & Kraft, and David B. Meeker, chairman of Hobart, discussed the matter privately but issued no statements. **********Wall Street arbitragers, convinced the merger was set, bid up the stock in heavy trading to around $35, feeling certain the plan would be approved at a regular Dart & Kraft board meeting on Feb. 5 and announced shortly thereafter. But no word came, convincing arbitragers that they had guessed wrong and the stock sagged to around $33. A Dart & Kraft official said the subject was not on the agenda then because more work remained to be done on the venture. **********Despite Hobart's assertions that it preferred to remain an independent company, its board of directors is known to have authorized Merrill Lynch to approach Dart & Kraft, among others, as a white knight to rescue it from a takeover it viewed as hostile. By next Friday, Canadian Pacific would have been free to buy Hobart at $32.50 and the only possibility of rescue - except for Dart & Kraft - would be a court decision in New York, due soon but very much in doubt. **********Even while seeking a white knight, Hobart has been waging a major campaign to enlist legislative support, convincing a number of Senators and Congressmen, mostly from Ohio, to call for hearings directed at the Canadian Pacific takeover bid. In hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday, W.J. Stenason, president of Canadian Pacific Enterprises Ltd., testified that if it won Hobart, the company would remain a good citizen under Canadian control. Mr.  Meeker testified that he was offered a top job and threatened with a takeover when he turned down the offer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/business/business-people-schenuit-s-nelson-unit-is-sold-to-its-officers.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1981-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 336, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business People; Schenuit's Nelson Unit Is Sold to Its Officers", "print_headline": "Business People; Schenuit's Nelson Unit Is Sold to Its Officers", "body_text": " **********Last year when Allegheny International Inc. bought Schenuit Industries, a small conglomerate based in Baltimore, A.P.

TOLD OF TALK TO AMAX INSIDER", "print_headline": "S.E.C. TOLD OF TALK TO AMAX INSIDER", "body_text": " **********Thomas C. Reed, a former Air Force Secretary, has testified before the Securities and Exchange Commission that one of the persons he talked to in advance of a $4 billion takeover bid for Amax Inc., the giant mining company, was Ian MacGregor, a prominent Wall Street investment banker and a member of the Amax board of directors. **********Only one day before the takeover bid became public, Mr. Reed, now a West Coast businessman, placed an order for a substantial amount of Amax call options and subsequently sold them at a profit of several hundred thousand dollars. **********Mr. Reed has denied that he acted on inside information or otherwise acted improperly, and so has Mr. MacGregor. If the S.E.C.  concludes otherwise, however, both Mr. Reed and any Amax insider who guided him could be charged with violations of Federal securities law. **********According to Wall Street sources who have read Mr. Reed's deposition, the gist of his testimony was that Mr. MacGregor had told him that the Standard Oil Company of California was trying to organize itself for another takeover bid for Amax, with Mr.  MacGregor's encouragement, but that Socal might not go ahead because of opposition by Amax's management. Fear of a Controversy **********Mr. Reed, these sources said, also maintained in his testimony that he did not act on anything Mr. MacGregor had told him because Mr.  MacGregor's remarks suggested that a takeover might not occur. **********One Wall Street investment banker, who has substantial holdings of Amax stock, said he feared that a public controversy over Mr.  MacGregor's comments, however innocent they might have been, could be enough to prompt Socal to abandon its offer. **********Amax stock jumped 4 points, to 68 1/2, last Thursday, the day of a regular Amax board meeting. Then it slid 3 points on Friday, to 65 1/2, when Amax had nothing to say about Socal. Wall Street professionals had been hoping Socal might sweeten its offer. **********Reached by telephone in California last Friday, Mr. MacGregor, who is now chairman of the financially troubled British Steel Corporation, acknowledged that he had discussed the takeover situation with Mr. Reed on the phone in January. He denied, however, that he had given Mr. Reed inside information. He also said he had not had any subsequent conversations with Mr. Reed. **********''I told him the same as I've told everybody else,'' Mr. MacGregor said, ''that Socal already had 20 percent of Amax, had made one offer for the company and had been rebuffed. They stayed with the 20 percent, so they must have been happy with it. I said now they'd have to make up their mind what they wanted to do among the three things they might do: nothing, sell what they have or make another tender offer. A Conversation's 'Acid Test' **********''All I told him,'' Mr. MacGregor continued, ''was that one of these days Socal should be doing something about Amax - pursue it further or retire from the situation. That's the same thing that almost any Wall Street observer would say. I didn't tell him to buy any stock, and I didn't buy any stock myself. That's the acid test, isn't it? **********''Lots of people have asked me about it in the last six to nine months, and I give them exactly the same answer,'' he went on. ''It would enable Mr. Reed to make up his own mind what gambling he wanted to do - but there were three outcomes.'' **********Mr. MacGregor was asked if he, as an Amax director, felt that the comments had disclosed confidential information. He replied: ''There's nothing confidential about that. That's purely speculation. I don't believe there's anything damaging about it.'' **********Mr. MacGregor, currently a limited partner of Lazard Freres, said he used to see a lot of Mr. Reed and regarded him as a close friend, ''a friend of the Amax family.'' **********According to Mr. MacGregor, when Mr. Reed discovered he was back in the United States on business, Mr. Reed phoned him to discuss other matters. Mr. MacGregor said the conversation dealt mainly with Mr.  Reed's interest in politics abroad and Mr. MacGregor's interest in the new Reagan Administration. Mr. Reed raised the Socal question only at the close of the conversation, Mr. MacGregor said. Outlook for S.E.C. Questioning **********Mr. MacGregor also said that he had already been told that any Amax director whose name turned up in the S.E.C.'s investigation could expect to be called in for questioning. He said, however, that he had not heard directly from the commission and that he had not retained an attorney. **********A spokesman for Amax said the company was aware of Mr. Reed's deposition but was not aware of any of its contents.  Mr. Reed's testimony before the S.E.C. was part of the agency's continuing investigation into unusual trading patterns in Amax call options before Socal's March 5 announcement that it would pay about $78.50 a share for the 80 percent of Amax stock that it did not yet own. **********As part of that investigation, California employees of the brokerage firm of Dean Witter Reynolds were reported last month to have purchased 538 Amax call options for $3,750 the day before the Socal offer and to have sold them later for $500,000. **********Mr. Reed, who is the son of Gordon W. Reed, another Amax board member, acknowledged in a formal statement at the time that he had purchased a total of 500 Amax options on Jan. 30 and Feb. 2 plus 500 on March 4, the day before Socal's offer, reportedly through Dean Witter's San Rafael, Calif., office. Mr. Reed denied at the time that his purchases were based on advance knowledge. Agency Remaining Silent **********Mr. Reed's lawyer said last Friday that he would not comment on the situation because of pending litigation. **********The S.E.C. is widely known to be investigating, but it declined to comment in any way, as is its policy.  Mr. MacGregor, interviewed by phone while he was visiting a West Coast Amax plant, said Mr. Reed called him, possibly on a visit to Houston. '' 'Is there anything happening between Socal and Amax?' '' he recalled that Mr. Reed asked toward the end of a short conversation. **********''One of these days, I said, Socal has to move forward or backward.'' Mr. MacGregor recalled. ''I said I don't think management has been moving forward, so they might have to move backward. Socal might have to do something else, like selling its 20 percent interest.'' He said he told Mr. Reed that it seemed to him that the situation ''has to come to a head sooner rather than later.'' Mr.  MacGregor maintained that the remarks about Socal lasted ''a minute or less at the tail end of a short call.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/09/business/first-connecticut-bancorp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FIRST CONNECTICUT BANCORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "FIRST CONNECTICUT BANCORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/17/business/zions-utah-bancorporation-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ZIONS UTAH BANCORPORATION reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "ZIONS UTAH BANCORPORATION reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/27/business/prudential-federal-savings-loan-assn-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 50, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRUDENTIAL FEDERAL SAVINGS & LOAN ASSN reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "PRUDENTIAL FEDERAL SAVINGS & LOAN ASSN reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/27/business/dentsply-international-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DENTSPLY INTERNATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "DENTSPLY INTERNATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/03/world/repression-in-guatemala-increases-as-us-is-seeking-to-improve-ties.html": {"writer_name": "Warren Hoge", "pub_date": "1981-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1912, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REPRESSION IN GUATEMALA INCREASES AS U.S. IS SEEKING TO IMPROVE TIES", "print_headline": "REPRESSION IN GUATEMALA INCREASES AS U.S. IS SEEKING TO IMPROVE TIES", "body_text": " **********Violent Government repression of leftist and moderate groups in Guatemala is increasing at the very time that Reagan Administration officials are looking for a way to repair relations with the military regime of Maj. Gen. Romeo Lucas Garcia. **********On the night Ronald Reagan was elected President, fireworks filled the skies of this capital city of 1.3 million people and marimba bands played in front of the United States Embassy. **********The nation's leaders expected the Reagan Administration to resume military assistance suspended since 1977 and otherwise deal more sympathetically with them. **********United States law prohibits arms aid to countries guilt of continuous violations of human rights. In Guatemala, there have been more than 5,000 killings of people in opinion-making positions since 1978, decimating university faculties, moderate and left-of-center political organizations and other groups. There have been no arrests or investigations. **********Officially, Guatemalan leaders say they want nothing more than to be left alone by the United States. More telling of their mood, however, were the welcome-back parties thrown for Lieut. Col. David W. Patton of the United States Army, a military aide from before the Carter Administration who has just returned for a new assignment. **********''It was like the second coming of Bolivar,'' a participant said.  Although the Reagan White House has been clear in its shifts from Carter strategies on El Salvador and Nicaragua, it has given no signal as yet of what it intends to do in Guatemala. The post of Ambassador, vacated last summer with the removal of Frank V. Ortiz Jr., is still open. **********State Department officials have told inquiring Republican members of Congress eager to re-establish links with Guatemala that a decision will be made in May. **********''It is very important to our interests in the region to reestablish relations with the Government of Guatemala, and we are actively pursuing ways in which to do so,'' said a high-ranking State Department official. **********Besides wanting to halt the spread of political convulsion in Central America, Washington would like to bring stability to a country that has recently turned up evidence of oilfields that could supply 10 percent of United States needs. **********Complicating the State Department's task is a terror campaign being conducted by the Lucas Garcia Government not only to combat the 2,000-member guerrilla movement that is having increased success in the countryside but also to eliminate centrist politicians that Washington could ultimately identify with. **********Seventy-six leaders of the Guatemalan Christian Democratic Party, which is associated with the Christian Democratic Party of President Jose Napoleon Duarte in El Salvador, have been slain in the last 10 months. Ten officials of the left-of-center Social Democratic United Revolutionary Front have been killed. **********The two parties have been terrorized into not participating in elections scheduled for next year. The field will be left to six right-wing parties. The current front-runner is Mario Sandoval Alarcon, an extreme rightist who has said that he has a 3,000-member private army. **********This will almost certainly reduce voter participation to less than the 35 percent turnout that was estimated in 1978, when President Lucas Garcia was elected. 'In Guatemala We're Adrift' **********A foreign visitor to Guatemala who met with a wide range of national leaders said that within two months of his trip the five most impressive people he had met had been killed. **********''At least in El Salvador the United States had a tiny little island to cling to,'' he said. ''In Guatemala we're adrift.'' This has occurred under a President who was elected on a platform pledging change and who has been delivering modestly on his promise.  Guatemala spends more on public housing and health than any other Central American nation, and the Lucas Garcia Government has been dividing up large farms confiscated from Germans after World War II and giving title to workers now sharecropping them. **********Despite promotion campaigns on radio, in newspapers and on highway billboards, these achievements have attracted little notice.  Two developments account for the Guatemalan Government's reluctance to steer a more moderate course. One is the fear generated by reports that Indians, who make up more than half of the population of nearly seven million, are starting to abandon their traditional isolation and join the opposition forces. The other is the belief that the same influences that provoked uprisings in Nicaragua and in El Salvador are at work in Guatemala. 'We Are in a War' **********''We are in a war, and in a war atrocities happen on both sides,'' a businessman said. ''We think the new Administration recognizes that this area has been marked for conquest by the Soviet Union.'' **********The show of faith that Guatemalan leaders are awaiting from the United States is resumption of military aid and training for their 18,000-member army. The assistance was suspended four years ago in a dispute over human rights abuses and indications that Guatemala might use force in its territorial dispute with neighboring Belize. **********The Guatemalans have been resourceful since then, turning to France for aircraft, Argentina for antiguerrilla strategy, South Korea for uniforms and Yugoslavia for howitzers. But Guatemala's fleet of UH-1H Huey helicopters, an essential ingredient in its campaign to flush out rebels, will only be able to fly for several more months unless the Guatemalans can obtain spare parts currently blocked in the aid suspension. **********Even holdovers from the Carter Administration in the State Department have accepted the notion that past policy toward Guatemala did not succeed in reducing human rights violations. The State Department now reasons that the army runs the country and that the army is therefore the sector that American diplomacy must engage. Restrictions Under U.S. Law **********To resume military aid, the Administration must come to terms with restrictions in the foreign military assistance law, which prohibits shipments of arms to nations that commit ''gross and consistent'' human rights violations. Guatemala initiated the rupture in military cooperation with the United States, so the law has not been formally invoked. But the language in the law regarding human rights precisely describes the situation in Guatemala today. **********Killings of people in opinion-making positions have decimated university faculties, student groups, moderate and left-of-center political organizations, rural cooperatives, newspaper and radio staffs, peasant leagues, unions and churches. In recent weeks there have been massacres in Indian villages aimed at frightening residents into ignoring guerrilla calls for support. **********Every day newspapers carry pictures of new kidnapping victims, with assurances from their families that the person was not involved in any political activities and pleas that the victims be returned to their homes. **********The number of killings in the Lucas Garcia years now exceeds 5,000, but there have been no arrests or investigations. The only people to survive the kidnappings have been members of wealthy families abducted by leftists for ransoms that have reached as high as $4 million. **********The pace of the guerrilla kidnappings has quickened, too, as the polarization of Guatemalan politics further radicalizes the left.  Henrique Roesch, head of the Guatemalan Coffee Association, was interrupted three times in a one-hour conversation with a visitor recently to take calls reporting abductions of planters. **********From the evidence, killing alone does not satisfy the vengeful motives of the security forces. The coroner in one of the city's four morgues said that two of every three bodies bore signs of torture.  Virtually all of the murder victims found in the countryside are manacled and indicate beatings, facial disfigurements or violence to sexual organs. **********Leftist guerrilla tactics include ambushes of army convoys and killings of suspected informants, business leaders and doctors who refuse to treat wounded rebels. Victims of the guerrillas are usually not tortured. The insurgents often occupy villages briefly, explain their cause and then melt back into the hills before the security forces arrive. **********During Easter Week there were 152 killings. Eleven of the victims were soldiers. Others included the secretary general of the Christian Democratic Party in the western department of Huehuetenango and the leader of Social Democratic United Revolutionary Front in Escuintla, Guatemala's second largest city. **********In the same period, 15 social action groups, including international organizations such as the Church World Service and local assistance groups that grew out of relief efforts after the 1976 earthquake, received letters warning them to deport foreigners and disband local staffs or face ''elimination.'' Most foreigners working in such organizations have already left Guatemala. Letters Linked to Regular Army **********The letters were signed by the ''Secret Anti-Communist Army,'' a designation that is so openly associated with the regular army that one recipient simply called a general he knew to inquire whether the threat against him was genuine. The officer said it was, and the man left Guatemala for Mexico last weekend. **********Elias Barahona y Barahona, a former press secretary to President Lucas Garcia who went into hiding in September, told Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, that stationery with the letterhead of the Secret Anti-Communist Army was stocked in the office of the Minister of the Interior, who is responsible for internal security. ''Hit lists,'' according to Mr. Barahona, were drawn up by the Army Chief of Staff in an annex to the National Palace, an aquamarine, Art Deco compound that is shuttered and under heavy guard. **********Foreign diplomats say that the hard-line approach of the Lucas Garcia Government is strategically counterproductive. The best evidence is that the terror campaign, in claiming so many noncombatants as its victims, has not diminished the ranks of the guerrillas but has instead helped their recruiting efforts. Tourists Are Staying Away **********Tourists, in response to reports of the violence and to several organized boycotts, are staying away in such numbers that hotel occupancy has fallen to 50 percent from 80 percent in 1979. **********Guatemala has become diplomatically isolated in the region and abroad. Its economy, the most robust in Central America, has suffered from the flight of capital and the reluctance of foreign investors to put any more money into such a strife-torn country. Its relations with Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama and Venezuela are strained, and two recent Guatemalan trade fairs in France and West Germany were disrupted by protests. **********These developments appear to have only reinforced the Government's resolve to stick to its present course. ''Are not these people violating our human rights when they interfere in Guatemala and not let us have the government we want?'' asked Roberto Alejos Arzu, a prominent industrialist and presidential candidate in the 1982 elections on whose farm some of the Cuban exiles who invaded the Bay of Pigs 20 years ago trained. **********Senator Christopher J.

Many are holdovers from his previous administration. **********A major appointment was the elevation of former Gen. Ariel Sharon, a conservative hawk in what is expected to be a very conservative Government, as Minister of Defense, one of the nation's key posts.  Mr. Sharon served as Minister of Agriculture during Mr. Begin's first term and oversaw the development of Israeli settlements on land captured from the Arabs in the West Bank during the 1967 Middle East war. **********Five-Week Battle for Key Posts **********Mr. Begin made his announcement to reporters tonight, flanked by members of his new Government, many of whom had battled for five weeks to insure their jobs and obtain perquisites for the interests they represent. **********As late as this afternoon, the bitter infighting continued and there were indications even as Mr. Begin announced his new Cabinet appointments that the feuding was far from ended. **********Mr. Begin said he would formally present his new administration, dominated by members of his Likud bloc, to Parliament tomorrow. A 12-hour debate, probably consisting mainly of bitter denunciations from the opposition Labor Party, is expected. **********In the new administration, Yitzhak Shamir is expected to continue as Foreign Minister and Yoram Aridor as Finance Minister. Yosef Burg will continue as Minister of Interior and will also serve as Minister of Religious Affairs. **********In recent days, the concessions made by Mr. Begin to the small religious parties have been the subject of intense debate here and a topic of bitter criticism in some of Israel's press. **********Mr. Begin tried to smoooth over some of the controversy tonight, telling reporters that Likud had not had to be pressed into accepting the demands of the religious blocs because ''this is a Jewish state.'' Stronger Discipline Foreseen **********The Prime Minister also tried to put the best possible construction on the narrowness of his majority in Parliament, asserting that it would enhance discipline in the coalition because ''all members will know they must be wanted so the Government can serve all four years and three months of its term.'' **********As Mr. Begin spoke, speculation intensified that the new Government was such a patchwork and had such theocratic tendencies that it would not last long and that new elections were in the offing. **********The three religious parties made sweeping gains in the negotiations for the new Government despite their having lost seats in Parliament in the elections on June 30. The power of these blocs increased because the opposition Labor Party came close to defeating Mr.  Begin's Likud, getting 47 seats to Likud's 48. Because both major groups were well short of the needed minimum of 61 seats, the minority parties became crucial once again in forming a majority Government. **********At tonight's ceremony held at Mr. Begin's office, a coalition agreement containing 83 clauses, written in Hebrew, was signed by the participating factions. Just about all of the clauses dealt with the religious concessions that had been wrested from Mr. Begin by the National Religious Party, the ultra-orthodox Agudat Israel Party and a new religious party called Tami that is a factional offshoot of the National Religious Party. **********The new Government is expected to be tougher on such issues as autonomy for the Palestinians of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip than the one headed by Mr. Begin since 1977 because of the departure of more moderate elements that held positions of power.  Composition of New Coalition **********The new coalition will consist of the 48 members of Likud, which is composed of several factions; six members of the National Religious Party, which lost six seats in the last election; four members of Agudat Israel and three members of Tami. **********Many of the religious concessions were made to the Agudat Israel Party, which is essentially an anti-Zionist religious entity responsible to a group of rabbis called the Council of Torah Sages.  The party professes to have no political ambitions, seeking only religious benefits for its members. Some of the criticism here has focused on the fact that Mr. Begin, an ardent Zionist for decades, has made concessions, particularly concerning exemption from military service, to a group that professes no interest in the governance of the state's affairs. **********These are some of the concessions: **********- Greater financial aid to students in yeshivas, or religious schools. **********- Eventual cessation on the Jewish Sabbath of flights by Israel's national airline, El Al, which would cost the state as much as $50 million a year. **********- Cessation of activity on the Sabbath in the port city of Haifa, where many cruise ships dock during the weekend, bringing much-needed tourist dollars. **********- An end of work on the Sabbath in Government-owned companies, such as the rail system and oil-drilling organizations. **********- Abolition of university dormitories occupied jointly by men and women. Exemption Pledge Causes Furor **********A furor has already erupted over a pledge by the Government, not specifically contained in the coalition agreement, to exempt for up to three years from military service ''newly observant'' Jews who wish to study Orthodox theology. **********The idea of military exemption is extremely touchy in this nation where women are subject to the draft. Mr. Begin said tonight that details on this issue, which has aroused anger among members of his own party as well as the National Religious Party, which is Zionist, would be worked out in a separate letter to Agudat Israel to be sent by the new Defense Minister, Mr. Sharon. **********''Nothing will be kept secret from the public,'' Mr. Begin said in response to questions about the special exemptions for those who might suddenly decide to pursue Orthodox Jewish studies. **********The last clause of the coalition agreement also touches on a very controversial concession to the Agudat bloc. It contains a pledge to amend the Law of Return, under which anyone who is a Jew is granted Israeli citizenship automatically, to exclude conversions to Judaism made by any but Orthodox rabbis. **********This has provoked a great outcry not because the number of conversions is high - experts here say it is minimal -but because it is seen as a blow against the validity of the rabbinate of Reform and Conservative Judaism. These two groups are the predominant branches of Judaism in the United States, and members of both provide extensive funds and services to Israel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/21/business/data-card-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-28.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DATA CARD CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 28", "print_headline": "DATA CARD CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 28", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/21/world/us-accused-of-favoring-curbs-on-free-press.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1981-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 473, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. ACCUSED OF FAVORING CURBS ON FREE PRESS", "print_headline": "U.S. ACCUSED OF FAVORING CURBS ON FREE PRESS", "body_text": " **********The chairman of the International Press Institute charged today that the United States, while publicly criticizing a United Nations-backed campaign for a so-called ''new world information order,'' was moving toward support of projects contrary to the aims of a free press. **********Cushrow Irani, chairman of the Zurich-based organization, which monitors challenges to journalists and news organizations around the world, said that American support for the newly created International Program for the Development of Communications was ''naive'' and mistakenly based on a fear of ''interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.'' **********The communications development program, now being organized within the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, would provide financial and professional support for press and broadcasting projects in developing nations. **********U.S. Seeking to Curb Criticism **********The development program was largely a United States initiative, which the State Department's Bureau for International Organization Affairs has supported in the hope that material aid to poorer nations would dampen criticism that Americans remain insenstive to the needs of the third world's press. **********Mr. Irani, who is publisher of the Indian daily The Statesman and one of the third world's most outspoken critics of the Unesco campaign, said today that the United States was preparing to make a financial contribution to the international develoment program through the Agency for International Development.

So runs a current advertising theme for the Coca-Cola Company, the world's largest soft drink company and a recurring investment favorite on Wall Street. But some brokerage houses are restraining their enthusiasm this hot summer as far as Coke's stock is concerned. **********In mid-June, when the stock was selling at $40 a share, Lawrence Adelman of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. informed clients: ''We have lowered our investment rating for Coca-Cola stock to Hold/ Sell from Hold.'' He went on to suggest that ''profit-taking in the issue be considered once again.'' **********Last Friday the stock closed at 34 on the New York Stock Exchange.  Within the last 12 months, its price has ranged between 40 1/4 and 29 1/8. **********In his comments, Mr. Adelman cited the outlook for ''disappointing'' trends in both earnings and volume for Coca-Cola, reflecting the impact of foreign currency transactions as well as sluggish economic activity in important overseas markets. **********Oppenheimer & Company, sounding basically the same theme, removed Coke from its recommended list of stocks on June 23. Its analyst, Joseph C. Frazzano, also expressed disappointment that Coke's earnings momentum was lagging during a period of plummeting sugar prices, when profits ordinarily could be expected to accelerate. **********Coincidental to the lowered ratings, both brokerage houses also reduced their earnings estimates for Coke, which showed a profit last year of $3.42 a share. Mr. Frazzano revised to $3.75 a share his previous earnings projection of $3.90 for 1981. The 1982 estimate was cut to $4.35 a share from $4.45. **********At Dean Witter, estimates for Coke's earnings this year were lowered to between $3.70 and $3.80 a share from $3.90. Projected earnings for next year were reduced to $4.30 a share from $4.50. **********But opinion on Wall Street runs two ways much of the time, and attitudes toward Coke's shares are no exception. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., for example, carries Coke on its current ''Buy'' list, along with higher estimates for the profit picture. It projects earnings at $4 a share this year and $4.70 a share in 1982. **********And, as if to underscore this difference of opinion, Drexel rates Pepsico Inc. - the archrival of Coke in soft drinks - as neutral, while Oppenheimer carries Pepsico not only on its roster of recommended issues but also on its ''emphasis'' list. **********In a time period of up to one year, meanwhile, Merrill Lynch's research department regards both stocks as ''O.K. to buy.'' Assessments at the Value Line Investment Survey, however, tilt in favor of Pepsico. In its latest appraisal, the advisory service said: ''Pepsico continues to carry our highest rating for relative price performance over the next 12 months.'' **********Value Line expects Coke's shares to show only average market performance during this same period. It noted that, unlike the Coca-Cola Company (whose impressive array of soft drink products includes such other brand names as Tab, Sprite, Fresca and Fanta), Pepsico derives considerably more than 50 percent of its operating profits from operations outside the soft drink business. In fact, Value Line regards Pepsico's snack foods division - said to enjoy an annual growth rate of more than 20 percent - as virtually certain to edge out beverages as the prime profit center for the company by 1983. **********As for Coke's earnings prospects for 1981, there appears to be no disagreement among Wall Street houses that the improvement will top the prior year's performance. Profits edged higher by less than 1 percent last year from $3.40 a share in 1979, a year that reflected poor results in some key foreign markets and an eight-week strike at a Mexico City bottler. **********Traditionally, Coke's profits have shown a yearly growth rate of about 12 percent, according to some followers of the company. Between 1975 and 1980, its common stock traded as high as 47 5/8 and as low as 26 5/8. During the late 1960's and early 1970's, Coke's stock became one of the ''Nifty Fifty'' darlings favored by bank trust departments and other institutions. But soon afterward the stock plunged, along with other glamour favorites. From a split-adjusted peak price of $75 a share in late 1973, the stock fell as low as $22.25 a share the following year. **********Present-day bulls on the stock, such as Drexel Burnham Lambert, point to Coke's new top management as one of the things they like.  Earlier this year, Roberto C. Goizueta became chairman and chief executive officer. Under his leadership, some analysts say, Coca-Cola is looking for new worlds to conquer by diversifying its operations.  Possible areas of acquisition are believed to include entertainment, leisure or food companies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/16/world/us-deal-embroils-tiny-island-nation.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Trumbull", "pub_date": "1981-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 876, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. DEAL EMBROILS TINY ISLAND NATION", "print_headline": "U.S. DEAL EMBROILS TINY ISLAND NATION", "body_text": " **********With an election scheduled for Sept. 8, the Prime Minister of this tiny, impoverished South Pacific island nation is in serious political trouble over an investment deal with a California businessman involving more than $640,000 in Government funds. **********Not long after this former British colony just south of the Equator became independent in 1978, Prime Minister Toalipi Lauti handed over the Government funds, equivalent to about one-fifth of the country's annual budget, to a visiting American businessman, Sydney Gross of Encino, Calif., to be invested at a promised 15 percent annual interest. **********Around the same time, associates of Mr. Gross in a west Texas real estate venture collected about the same amount from individuals, local government bodies and the Church of Tuvalu for plots of land that promoters advertised as having a rich agricultural potential.  The Church of Tuvalu is a Protestant denomination to which most of the 9,000 or so Tuvaluans belong, **********Hundreds of Tuvaluans, who are members of the Polynesian group found on Pacific islands extending from Hawaii to New Zealand, bought into the Texas development, expecting that ''future generations could live and work in the United States,'' Pulekai Alofa Sogivalu, the editor of the Church of Tuvalu's newspaper, said in an interview. **********American Sounded Alarm **********Then another American, Dr. Richard Finney of Lexington, Ky., who once lived on Nanumanga, a remote Tuvalu atoll whose island council had invested heavily in the Texas promotion, heard of the deal and sounded an alarm. **********Dr. Finney sent a letter to Prime Minister Lauti that began, ''I do not know your name, but I am writing to you to help the people of Nanumanga.'' This was followed by highly critical comments on the Texas property, quoting state and Federal officials. **********Later the Parliament of Tuvalu demanded that Prime Minister Lauti retrieve the money given to Mr. Gross for investment. According to Tuvaluan officials, the Californian had paid the promised interest meticulously but had asked for more time to send back the principal. **********''We don't even know where the principal is invested,'' Henry Naisali, a Member of Parliament and a leading critic of the transactions, said in an interview. Secretary to Government Iotana Iotana added, ''The Government is very concerned.'' 'Barren and Mountainous' **********Meanwhile, according to Mr. Sogivalu, the editor, many of the Tuvaluans who had contracted to purchase the Texas land have defaulted on their installment obligations and fear that their downpayments have been forfeited. Earlier, a news release by the Federal Trade Commission in Washington had described the plots, which are in Culberson and Jefferson counties, as ''barren in parts and mountainous in others.'' **********Prime Minister Lauti, apparently undaunted by the political storm over his investment activities, was hopeful for his young nation's economic future when interviewed recently in Suva, Fiji, where he had stopped en route to London for the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. **********''The problem is a lack of natural resources,'' he said of the nine verdant but economically unproductive coral atolls in the Tuvalu group. The name of the country, formerly known as the Ellice Islands, is translated loosely as ''eight standing together,'' apparently not counting the isolated and uninhabited ninth atoll, Niulakita. **********Funafuti, the main atoll and national capital, was an American logistics base during World War II, as were the outlying atolls of Nanumea and Nukufetau. **********Tuvalu, which is part of the British-aligned Commonwealth of Nations, has hardly been touched by Western influence except on Funafuti. Here the Government offices, an eight-room hotel and other service facilities are housed in simple one-story buildings that provide a faint patina of urbanization in an idyllic post-card setting of palm trees fringing a serene lagoon. Content With Simple Life **********Prime Minister Lauti estimated that 80 percent of the Tuvaluans subsist in traditional fashion, living off coconuts, other fruits, a few easily cultivated root crops and fish. Their meager cash - per capita income is estimated at $240 a year - comes from a modest output of coconut products, handicrafts and remittances from the hundreds of Tuvaluans working aboard foreign ships, on the phosphateproducing island of Nauru and elsewhere outside the country. **********Foreign specialists working on various improvement projects in the chain agree that most of the Tuvaluans are content with their simple way of life, bereft of such modern amenities as electricity except on the two main atolls of Funafuti and Vaitupu, where the country's only high school is situated. **********''People are happy, and you see nothing like the grinding poverty of Asia,'' said Arthur Dahl of Carmel, Calif., who is making an environmental survey for the South Pacific Commission, an intergovernmental development group. **********Since independence came nearly three years ago, Prime Minister Lauti said, Tuvalu's top money earner has been the sale of colorful postage stamps produced in a joint venture with a British company.  Last year, he said, the stamps brought in $700,000 in Australian money, which is Tuvalu's national currency, and sales are expected to go well over $1 million this year because of a new series commemorating the British royal wedding."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/28/business/the-week-in-business-bronfman-s-surprise-bid-for-conoco.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Week in Business; BRONFMAN'S SURPRISE BID FOR CONOCO", "print_headline": "The Week in Business; BRONFMAN'S SURPRISE BID FOR CONOCO", "body_text": " **********Seagram, the company that Edgar M.

The bill also repealed a 38-year-old law that has prohibited Western Union from offering international cable and telex services. **********The legislation sets specific procedures to be followed by the commission in authorizing domestic competition. Thus, it will likely be some months before the international carriers offer domestic service.

This savings and loan association with assets of $443 million introduced what it called a one-year rollover loan and a five-year rollover loan in November 1979. Fixed-rate loans were also available at an interest rate one percentage point higher than the rollover loan. It developed that 94.4 percent of the borrowers chose the rollover loans. That represented 1,205 loans totaling $51 million. **********''People hope and expect that the rates will go down,'' said James Petty, senior vice president. ''And we priced it right. You must price it below the fixed rate.'' **********It is also likely, some real estate specialists say, that buyers planning to move within a few years are less worried about ''locking in'' their monthly repayments over the life of the loan. **********A confusing new language is developing to describe subtly different forms of home mortgage loans. In the savings and loan industry, the most frequently heard terms are rollover mortgages or renegotiablerate mortgages. One savings and loan officer described the word ''renegotiable'' as poor use of language. ''There is no renegotiation after the term of the loan ends,'' he said, ''only adjustment of the interest rate.'' **********Accordingly, even the thrift institutions may come to adopt the term that the Comptroller of the Currency has used in recent regulations authorizing national commercial banks to make such loans. The Comptroller calls them adjustable-rate loans, and this may ultimately become the generally accepted term. **********The basic principle is the same -periodic adjustment of the interest rate during the life of a long-term loan to reflect changes in the cost of money as reflected in some index. Under the Comptroller's regulation, the rate cannot change more than 1 percent every six months, and there is no total limit in the life of the loan. This is more liberal for lenders than rules of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board for federally chartered savings and loan associations and savings banks, but that may change. **********In the metropolitan New York area, experience with flexible-rate mortgages is in the early stages. Market activity is hardly brisk with interest rates above 15 percent, and some hard-pressed lenders are out of the home mortgage market entirely. **********On Long Island, a mortgage office at the Suburbia Federal Savings and Loan Association, which has been offering what it calls threeyear rollover loans since last September, said that many people take it, even though there is no spread in rates with conventional loans, because they ''think the rates will come down.'' The volume of lending has been low. **********An example of what different pricing can mean in dollars was provided by an officer of the Westchester Federal Savings and Loan Association, which has been offering what it calls renegotiable-rate mortgages. The buyer can get such a mortgage at present with a 15 percent interest rate and a 30-year repayment schedule for principal and interest. Alternatively, the buyer can choose a fixed-rate mortgage at 15 1/2 percent based on a 25-year repayment period. **********On a $50,000 loan the initial monthly payments would be $632.23 for the renegotiable mortgage. Rates can change every three years. On the fixed-rate mortgage, monthly payments would be $659.88. **********Mortgage terms vary among lenders. Some are said to have priced conventional loans at 17 percent or to have stopped making them altogether. There does not seem to be a widespread use of ''spread'' between the cost of flexible-rate and fixed-rate mortgages as a way of stimulating business. **********When interest rates are adjusted in mortgages, the borrower's monthly payments do not necessarily change. Amortization, or principal, payments can be lowered to hold monthly debt payments steady. But the Comptroller's rule guards against excessive use of ''negative amortization,'' in which the home owner piles up debt and never comes to own equity in the house, a situation that caused many to lose their homes in the Depression. **********To promote its rollover loans, People's Savings in Toledo also offered the features of assumability or portability. Assumability means that a loan can be taken over by a new purchaser at whatever point it is in its five-year cycle. Portability means that the borrower who has a loan can get a new loan for a house at the same rate for the rest of the five-year cycle. **********Edward O. Knowles, president of People's Savings, is a forceful advocate of the flexible loans. Last January the association introduced still another option, a one-year loan convertible to a five-year or a fixed-rate loan. It was offered at 12 1/2 percent, which was two percentage points below the fixed rate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/12/business/the-itkins-ride-the-work-station-boom.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 999, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE ITKINS RIDE THE 'WORK STATION' BOOM", "print_headline": "THE ITKINS RIDE THE 'WORK STATION' BOOM", "body_text": " **********Almost half a century ago, three brothers from Brooklyn joined forces as office furniture repairmen, pushing dolleys laden with freshly repaired goods along New York city's trolley tracks.  Canvassing skyscrapers floor by floor, the Itkin brothers ventured into sales, and gradually succeeded in unravelling the tight-knit fraternity of office furniture dealers. **********Today, ''The Itkins,'' boasts a bustling Madison Avenue showroom, a sprawling warehouse and a fleet of snappy green trucks. It is also the largest retailer of office furniture in the nation. **********Indeed, despite a folksy image and a philosophy of ''servicing the hell out of clients,'' the second generation approach to doing business is a far cry from the family's earlier days as ''cold call'' salesman. **********And at a time when many sectors of the economy are reeling from high interest rates and general investor malaise, first cousins Lewis and Leonard Itkin have managed to capitalize on one area that has been hot - office space -and used the accompanying boom in high technology (and high fashion) corporate enviroments to their advantage. Pacing his unprepossessing office overlooking the gleaming showroom edownstairs, Lewis Itkin - the ''outside man'' or go-between for some 550 manufacturers and 3,000 new clients annually - seizes an array of glossy catalogs. Leonard - the administrator or ''inside man'' in Itkin parlance -sits down unobtrusively on a well-worn sofa. The pitch about the changing officegeer territory begins: **********''When our fathers first started the product was very simple: a desk, a chair and a filing cabinet,'' declared Lewis Itkin, who entered the family business in 1963, in good time to be trained in the art of salesmanship by his relations. (At one time, as many as 7 Itkins worked together; the number dwindled to two at the beginning of 1980, when the last senior Itkin retired.) **********''Now, as manufacturers have gotten into panel office systems with anywhere from 400 individual components, things just aren't so simpleany more,'' c ontinued Mr. Itkin. ''This market is exploding and everyone from the guy with one room to an organization like ours is after it.'' According to the Business and Institutional Furniture ManufacturersAssociation, manufacturers in the office furn iture market garnered sales of $3.4 billion last year, up from $1.2 billion in 1975. The figure this year is expected to climb to $3.7 5 billion.  Of this sum,fifty percent of the installations are curren tly in so-called systemsfurniture. In contrast, ten years ago, the sy stems market - work stations composed of panel partitions and mod ular components such as electronic computer printout files - held a l ess than 5 percent sliver of the market. **********But in a business so rough and tumble that suppliers will not disclose a client's name for fear of sending scores of contractors scurrying to its door, (the Itkins eschew specificity beyond claiming to have made deals with 69 Fortune 500 companies in New York), the two cousins have carved out a comfortable financial niche. **********This year, the Itkins, who describe their relationship as ''symbiotic,'' predict sales of more than $10 million, an increase of 25 percent over last year's revenues. The company's average fee for an contract job is roughly $300,000, representing a 10-30 percent markup over manufacturers' costs. The reason for their success? It may lie in their advertising agency's story boards.  Smith and Greenland's, high visibility and low cost campaign ($300,000 annually) deflates the ego of unchic office dwellers through full page newspaper advertisments that read: ''Does your office look so bad that instead of going public you go private,'' or ''Do even pigeons avoid sitting outside your office.'' **********Predictably, some competitors sniff at the Itkin's romance with the Madison Avenue hardsell. ''The Itkins was built on advertising and selling to the street trade,'' noted Lawrence Glasow president of the New York based Empire Office Equipement Company, the largest contractor on the East Coast with $30 million in sales last year.  ''We have a solid corporate base.'' **********And the company does not appear to top every architect and interior designer's roster of furniture dealers. '' We use a great many furniture dealers, and they are not one of them, remarked Richard Carlsen, director of interior design at Swanke, Hayden, Connell Architects, a leading corporate architure and interior design firm. **********''The Itkins deal very strongly in specific product lines and are very agressive in terms of their client relations,'' Mr. Carlsen explained. ''In our view, a furniture dealers' main contribution is as a middleman, coordinating dates between a manufacturer and client. But the Itkins are less interested in this, than in getting clients to buy everything offered by the Itkins.'' **********But many clients beset by architects, interior designers and manufacturers are reasssured only too eager for the headache-free solutions the Itkins promise, not to mention their unflappable image. **********''The Itkins are very fine and honorable gentlemen. More than the product, they are selling confidence,'' observed a senior vice president at the Seamans Bank for Savings where the Itkins have had a hand in opening some 8 branches. The executive who requested anonymity paused and added, ''Occasionally they have promised furniture when they were really only keeping their fingers crossed, but in this business something always fall through the cracks.'' **********As part of the continuing scramble to convince clients that their empty office space - an estimated 4.5 million square feet this year - will be more speedily filled under Itkin supervision, the company has just installed an intricate computer system. The system tracks the progress of orders as they wend from manufacturer to freight carrier, from warehouse to Itkin truck to customer and also monitors the $500,000 warehouse inventory roster. **********''You can live in an empty apartment, but you can't work on the floor,'' says Leonard Itkin adding ''If you're paying $50 a square foot, God help you if you don't move in on time.'' end"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/11/business/lincoln-income-life-insurance-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LINCOLN INCOME LIFE INSURANCE CO reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "LINCOLN INCOME LIFE INSURANCE CO reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/14/business/patents-invention-licenses-to-ibm.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1981-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 172, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; Invention Licenses To I.B.M.", "print_headline": "Patents; Invention Licenses To I.B.M.", "body_text": " **********WASHINGTON A VERY productive inventor, who received a patent this week for a patient-monitoring device, announced that he had just licensed the International Business Machines Corporation to use more than a score of his earlier inventions that concern information handling. **********Jerome H.

But Prime Minister George Rallis insists that his conservative camp is an ''awakening giant'' that will prevail. **********Mr. Papandreou has sought during the campaign to counter the Government's attempt to portray him as a revolutionary Marxist.  Tempering his more radical earlier views, he is competing with the Prime Minister for the backing of Greece's centrist voters, who have remained largely uncommitted since the breakup of the center parties following their poor performance in the last elections, in 1977. **********''We are the party of change, of national and social rejuvenation, not of upheaval as our opponents want to portray us,'' the 62-yearold Socialist leader said at one of his huge rallies. **********For Mr. Papandreou, son of the centrist Prime Minister, the late George Papandreou, this will be the third attempt to gain power since the rule of the Greek colonels was ended in 1974. His meteoric rise has followed his success at the 1977 elections, when his Panhellenic Socialist Party doubled its share of the votes, reaching 26 percent, and tripled its representation in Parliament, raising it to 94 out of 300 seats.

They say that he is wary of possible displeasure in the military and of upsetting the international balance of power and that he realizes there is no easy alternative source of arms supplies. The United States supplies Greece with 90 percent of its military equipment. **********His associates describe Mr. Papandreou as preparing the ground with his remarks for a tougher negotiating stance with the West. They also say that he has abandoned earlier plans to seek the outright withdrawal of Greece from the European Economic Community and has decided to move instead for a renegotiated special relationship or a referendum on Greek membership. Domestic Policy Is Basic Appeal **********He insists that Greece's foreign policy cannot only be Westernoriented but must also take account of the nation's ''position as a European, Balkan and Mediterranean country.'' **********His party's principal appeal, however, derives from its domestic policy. He has called for a strict separation of church and state, the institution of civil marriage, changes in education and improved health care. Avoiding the term ''nationalization,'' he has called for ''socialization,'' or increased worker participation, in 12 key fields, among them banking and insurance, shipbuilding, energy production, mining and defense-related industries. **********Prime Minister Rallis, a mild-mannered 63-year-old lawyer who has been in office since May 15, 1980, cannot match the crowd-pleasing campaigning of his rival and privately concedes that he detests campaign rallies. But he is seeking to present his party, which polled 42 percent of the vote in 1977, as the guarantor of stablility and steady progress in the face of growing demands for quicker change. **********''Voters have the tendency to regard our existing achievements as natural,'' he said in an interview. ''But when the danger appears that these achievements will be abolished, won't they defend them with their votes? We are the only ones who can guarantee an untroubled course toward progress and stability.'' Return to Democracy Cited Mr. Rallis presents the main successes of his ruling party, known as New Democracy, as being the restoration of democracy after the fa ll of the military dictatorship in 1974, the achievement of po litical stability and membership in the Common Market. **********He says Greek per capita income has more than doubled in the last seven years, reaching $4,380 in 1980, outstripping that of Yugoslavia and Portugal and approaching the levels of Spain and Italy. He predicts that the inflation rate - the nation's most persistent economic problem - will be reduced this year from 25 to 20 percent.  He maintains that inflation is a necessary price to pay for continued economic development and full employment. **********Countering oppposition charges that New Democracy has neglected social improvements, he says, for example, that more schools have been built since 1974 than in the century and a half before then. **********On foreign policy, he says New Democracy is responsible for improving Greece's international prestige and for broadening relations with neighboring Communist countries and the Arab world.  He defends Greece's nine-month-old membership in the European Common Market as a ''privilege,'' one that he says Spain and Portugal would like to have, and he charges that the Socialists ''want to render Greece a third-world and nonaligned country'' - a development that he says would benefit Turkey since it would cut the Greek armed forces from their basic sources of supply. Third Vote Since 1974 **********''I have no doubt,'' he says, ''that the majority of our people reject this combined anti-American, anti-Western and anti-European policy, and that is perhaps why the Panhellenic Socialist Party has modified its policy of late.'' **********While the October election will be the third since 1974, it will mark the first time that New Democracy will be led by someone other than Constantine Caramanlis, now President. A victory for Mr. Rallis, who has been accustomed to being regarded as an underdog, would go far toward establishing him as a leader who was no longer in the shadow of Mr. Caramanlis. **********New Democracy has been attempting to broaden its appeal - beyond its 1977 showing of 42 percent of the vote - both by competing with the Socialists for the centrists and by absorbing supporters of the far right. Mr. Rallis claims credit for uniting the two wings of the divided party he inherited when he became Prime Minister, succeeding Mr. Caramanlis. **********Mr. Rallis first entered politics in the 1950's, burdened with the background of being the son of a man who was Prime Minister during the Nazi occupation of Greece and who was later sentenced to life imprisonment. The current Prime Minister's own political credentials were firmly established when he was imprisoned three times for outspoken criticism during the colonels' rule in 1967-74. **********He says he expects his party to confound the experts on Oct. 18 by polling more than 50 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/17/world/israeli-says-friendship-with-us-has-been-damaged-by-sale-to-saudis.html": {"writer_name": "David Shipler", "pub_date": "1981-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 740, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAELI SAYS FRIENDSHIP WITH U.S. HAS BEEN DAMAGED BY SALE TO SAUDIS", "print_headline": "ISRAELI SAYS FRIENDSHIP WITH U.S. HAS BEEN DAMAGED BY SALE TO SAUDIS", "body_text": " **********Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir accused the Reagan Administration today of damaging the friendship between Israel and the United States by agreeing to sell sophisticated weapons to Saudi Arabia. **********He said that Israel could not afford an extensive arms race and warned that the arrival of new weapons in the Middle East was creating an explosive situation for which the United States shared responsibility. **********It was Israel's first sharp criticism of the new Administration, and it reflected rising concern in Jerusalem over the emerging American policy of arming pro-Western Arab countries. **********Speaking in Parliament, Mr. Shamir hailed the ''deep sense of friendship which binds our two peoples and countries.'' But he denounced the recent decisions on Saudi arms. **********Israel is heading for parliamentary elections June 30, and Abba Eban, a former Foreign Minister in a Labor Government, also denounced the sales, saying that sophisticated military hardware did not insure the stability of a regime. Saudis Will Get Gear for F-15's **********The Administration has notified Congress of its plan to supply the Saudis with detachable fuel tanks and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles to increase the range and firepower of about 60 F-15 jet fighters slated for delivery. The added equipment could make the planes effective against Israel. **********In addition, officials in Jerusalem have been in an uproar over press reports that Washington would also sell the Saudis four Awacs intelligence-gathering and command aircraft. **********Deputy Defense Minister Mordechai Zipori said that with the planes, Saudi Arabia could monitor all of Israel's military activities, locating troops, aircraft, tanks and artillery pieces. They would ''expose all of Israel's secrets,'' he said. ''We would not be able to take even one move without them knowing about it.'' **********Mr. Shamir had originally sought to mute Israel's protest over the Saudi sales to avoid a confrontation with the new Administration on an issue that seemed a lost cause. But the climate in Jerusalem has developed into one of heightened anxiety, especially over the reports of the Awac aircraft being offered, and in that context, Mr. Shamir told Parliament: **********''The friendship and understanding between the United States and Israel have been marred recently by the American decision to supply Saudi Arabia with sophisticated auxiliary equipment for F-15 airplanes as well as with four Awac aircraft, as has now been reported in the media.'' Promises to Israel Are Dismissed **********He dismissed American promises to keep Israel ahead in weapons technology. ''The President, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense believe that it is possible to redress the damage by supplying weapons systems to Israel under special conditions,'' Mr.  Shamir said. ''To our regret, we must state that we do not see this as a solution, or as a way out. **********''The state of Israel will not be able -even from the economic point of view -to withstand such an arms race.'' Israel has also been fighting tentative West German plans to sell Saudi Arabia advanced Leopard tanks.  Mr. Shamir deplored what he called ''a massive flow of all types of weapons, including the most advanced, into this region from every possible source: the United States, the Soviet Union and the European countries. These massive quantities of weapons do not strengthen the West in this region; they do not serve any positive purpose, but they do jeopardize peace and endanger Israel.'' He Scoffs at Label of 'Moderate' **********The Foreign Minister scoffed at the American portrayal of Saudi Arabia as moderate and pro-Western. ''This state has participated in all the wars against Israel,'' he said. ''It orchestrated the conference which declared jihad against us. It is the major financier of the P.L.O.'s terrorism. It works persistently and aggressively against the peace process. Any additional military equipment given to it will ultimately serve all of the extremist elements in the region that oppose peace and stability.'' **********A less-concerned voice was heard from the military ranks, however.  In a radio interview, the former air force commander, Gen. Binyamin Peled, said the Awacs could be shot down with ease. ''An air force like ours, with F-15's and some other things, will find it relatively easy to bring down big buses like these,'' he said. ''These aircraft are practically defenseless if anyone really intends to bring them down and has the range to reach them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/17/world/a-power-line-across-zaire-nearly-ready.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1981-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 825, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A POWER LINE ACROSS ZAIRE NEARLY READY", "print_headline": "A POWER LINE ACROSS ZAIRE NEARLY READY", "body_text": " **********After seven years and many delays, the construction of the Inga-Shaba power line, the longest and most powerful in the world, will be completed this month. **********The line runs 1,100 miles from the Inga Dam near Kinshasa on the Congo River to this remote copper-mining town in the heart of the southern, mineral-rich Shaba Province. It cuts through forest and bush and stalks over rivers, its 8,500 120-foot-high towers posing a striking contrast to the villages of straw-roofed huts in their path. **********When it comes on stream next year, carrying half a million volts across a great swath of Africa, the line will stand as a monument to engineering tenacity, and as a symbol of a developing country's vulnerability to market forces beyond its control. **********For critics it will also represent a lasting, large-scale reminder of the hubris of the country's leader, President Mobutu Sese Seko. Copper Boom and High Hopes **********Work on the line by an American-led consortium began in 1974 when the price of copper - the mineral that fuels Zaire's economy - was high. The copper boom, economists say, swelled state coffers, individual pockets and presidential visions of grandeur. General Mobutu took credit for the idea of a line that would build a new unity between the north and south of his vast country and provide Africa with power. **********Then, the price of copper fell drastically, oil prices went up and the cost of foreign technology rocketed. Critics say the line is just one of a number of projects that were conceived in the boom years on a scale that has now outstripped the nation's resources. **********Its original purpose was to link the Inga Dam complex with Shaba Province in order to fuel a 200 percent expansion of the copper mines. It was also, critics say, a matter of presidential prestige. **********Shaba already had its own hydroelectric resources, which are still, experts say, enough for present production. When the bottom fell from the copper market, the plan to expand production was dropped too, so the power needs of the industry could have been met at lower cost by rehabilitating Shaba's own aging hydroelectric system. Cost Overruns and Invasions **********Initially planned for completion in three years at a cost of $350 million, the line will now cost over $800 million. Delays have been caused by problems with financing, invasions of Shaba from across the Angolan border in 1977 and 1978, the soaring price of imported equipment and Zaire's inability to pay its debts. America's Export-Import Bank is guranteeing the loans for the project. **********The line has brought some employment and improved roads to the areas its crosses, but it does not provide power for these regions.  For instance, halfway down its length at Kananga, the railways run on diesel fuel and electric power is provided by fuel-oil generators and hydroelectric equipment. A switch to power from the Inga-Shaba system would sharply reduce local bills. However, the line marches straight past Kananga and, according to officials, a spur into the town would cost a further $80 million. **********There are those who defend the line. An official from Morrison-Knudsen International of Boise, Idaho, the concern that leads the construction consortium, said that sooner or later towns like Kananga would be connected to the Inga-Shaba line. In addition, the official said, Shaba's own hydroelectric equipment, some dating back to the 1920's, is in poor shape, so the completion of the line will be timely. Potential for Development **********In the long term, an American official said, the vast power resources of Inga-Shaba - the great waters of the Congo River basin contain enough power potential to light up all of West Africa -could play a central role in Africa's development, a process that has been slowed in this region by high oil costs, low mineral prices and falling agricultural production. **********Morrison-Knudsen, which has 280 Americans and 2,000 Zairians working on the line, has faced mammoth logistical problems.  Equipment is imported by sea, unloaded at Matadi on the Atlantic, sent by road or rail from there to Kinshasa, loaded onto barges for a river trip and then put back onto the railways or onto trucks for onward transport, often to places where there were no roads before the line crews moved in. One hundred and forty thousand tons of equipment has been moved this way. **********The line crews, some American, some Italian, have cut 4,000 miles of roads through inhospitable land. In some places, large trees have grown up around sections of the line built only three years ago.  Tropical storms whip the shield wire with lightning. Local people, engineers say, have found uses for the steel from which the towers are made and have taken to unbolting sections and carrying them off.  Maintenance is thus a never-ending job."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/10/world/around-the-world-israel-officially-rejects-saudi-peace-proposals.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 179, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel Officially Rejects Saudi Peace Proposals", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Israel Officially Rejects Saudi Peace Proposals", "body_text": " **********Israeli officials today dismissed Saudi Arabia's Middle East peace proposals as a plan to destroy Israel.

The three traders asserted that the losses had eroded their capital position and had resulted in their suspension from the exchange. **********Last week, O'Connor & Associates, another Chicago firm, sued Dean Witter Inc. and A.G. Becker, charging that the firms ''aided and abetted'' insiders in the purchase of options to buy shares of Amax.  In an amended complaint, filed yesterday in Federal court in New York, O'Connor asked for a jury trial and named Thomas C.

Each call option, the type in dispute, represents a contract to purchase 100 shares of stock at a given price before a specific expiration date. **********The options had given the purchasers the right to buy the underlying stock in coming months at prices well above the levels at which Kennecott and Amax were traded before the Standard Oil Company of California arranged to buy Amax for $4 billion, and Standard Oil (Ohio) offered $1.77 billion for Kennecott. Immediately after the offers were announced in the last 10 days, the Kennecott and Amax stocks shot up in price, increasing the value of the options many times over. For example, some Amax call options to purchase Amax stock at $45 or more in March multiplied in value more than 70 times as Amax stock doubled to $58. **********The Chicago board, the Amex and the Securities and Exchange Commission have said that they have their own investigations pending in the Amax and Kennecott cases.

There was also tension in Beirut as sporadic exchanges of rockets and machine-gun fire continued along the line dividing predominantly Christian East Beirut and the predominantly Moslem West Beirut. **********Syrian forces are in Lebanon as members of the Arab force sent in 1976 to police the truce that ended the civil war in which Christian forces fought Moslem militias and their Palestinian guerrilla allies.

The word is heard everywhere in Kampala, where food is kwisha, water is kwisha and gasoline is kwisha. Kampala is all but kwisha. **********There was a time when the crusty old colonialists of Kenya came here for holidays in a more benign climate and, more important, to buy goods that could not be found at home. Uganda was wealthier. The fifth largest exporter of coffee in the world, it had the foreign exchange to import luxury items. The stores were jammed. **********The other morning, at the Apolo Hotel, the grandest hotel in the region when it was opened in 1965, coffee was kwisha. That night, beer was kwisha. All day, water was kwisha. **********The Apolo, in fact, is the tallest testament in town to Uganda's sad slide. It has 15 stories and 300 rooms and it stands on the highest of the seven lovely green hills that comprise Kampala. When it was opened, the President of the newly independent nation was Apolo Milton Obote, and thus the name. A Fine Wine Cellar **********In those days, great ivory tusks formed a parenthesis through which guests entered the lobby, where the stuffed magnificent heads of Cape buffalo gazed dully over carefully tanned lion and zebra hides. Profiteers took the rooms up top, looking down from their balconies on the manicured lawns - here and there the name ''Apolo,'' spelled out in bursting blossoms - that sloped away into a capital where building cranes were busy raising commercial buildings. The capitalists availed themselves of the 24-hour room service. In the cellar was a million dollars in wine. **********Idi Amin overthrew Milton Obote in 1971. Some conquering armies behave more badly than others, but nearly all like to make command posts of the poshest hotels. The Apolo, renamed the Kampala International, got through Mr. Amin's occupation by yielding up its cellar, its silverware and a few hides and tusks. It still functioned, though. **********The Amin dictatorship lasted eight years. Uganda had no economy when Tanzanian troops marched into Kampala in 1979 and set up temporary headquarters at the Kampala International, which they tore apart at the seams. Two coups later, an election was held and Apolo Milton Obote regained the presidency. **********The hotel's new general manager, Ron Hermer, a Briton, then received, in his words, ''a rather strong indication from a high authority that the hotel should be renamed.'' Life at the Apolo: A Nightmare **********Life at the Apolo today is a nightmare, and Mr. Hermer admits it.  If he has any reason to be thankful, he says, it is that he does not have the foreign exchange to have the signs made that would proclaim, from four sides of the top of the hotel, ''Apolo.'' Such is the tenuousness of Mr. Obote's hold, and such is the plethora of rebellious groups around that, according to the manager, ''The signs would just be shot out.'' **********Such is Mr. Hermer's candor that he told a first-time guest ''poor you'' and explained, ''I'm just here until they can con somebody else into the job.'' **********For all its problems, the hotel enjoys -or suffers, to use the manager's word -100 percent occupancy. Two years ago, Tanzanians filled it and the bills piled up on the cashier's desk because no one had the courage to ask the troops to pay. As the soldiers moved out, taking the room keys with them, civil servants whose houses had been looted and other city residents who simply felt safer up high moved their families in. Now the few phones that work ring ceaselessly as the hotel staff tries to collect the rents. **********Booking in is tough, but nothing that a big enough bribe will not take care of. Recently, while parting with money for the favor, a first-time guest took note of the deteriorative evidence in the lobby. Moths had gotten to the hides and something had left the Cape buffalo head with a stupid, cross-eyed look. A receptionist, who had first said, ''rooms kwisha,'' found an unoccupied room on the 12th floor. Cold Brown Baths Available **********From that point on, a certain amount of resourcefulness and stamina was required. The elevators did not work, the room had no key. A man with a credit card and a deft touch can release a locked door, and he did. A dirty man with a sharp eye will have remembered, upon finding dry taps, that he passed a fire hose 50 yards back down the corridor. Speculating that the hose was connected to rain barrels on the roof, and finding himself right, a man can have a cold brown bath. **********Toward evening, as kites, maribou storks, pied crows and bats fill the air above Kampala, the town looks pleasant enough from a 12thfloor balcony. A little later the sky gets filled with garbage raining down from rooms above in which families have cooked their dinners.

Then General Foods created Jell-O pudding.  Now, if the giant food company has its way, there will be Jell-O Pudding Pops, frozen pudding on a stick. **********Conceived four years ago, test-marketed since 1978, Pudding Pops promises to be one of the most successful products to emerge in recent years from the General Foods kitchens. The company refuses to say when it will be introduced nationwide. But General Foods, which has already sunk millions of dollars into the new product, clearly has great hopes for Pudding Pops. **********''It's potentially a very large business,'' said Peter Rosow, general manager of the company's desserts division, who predicts that it will make major inroads on the lucrative ice cream market. **********Pudding Pops is only one new product at General Foods, which introduces several each year. Currently, it is also testing Jell-O Slice Creme, a freezer cake mix, and Jell-O Gelatin Pops, whipped gelatin on a stick. The Unfilled Niche **********These are just a few of hundreds of new products on which consumer goods companies annually gamble as they seek that increasingly elusive, but immensely profitable, unfilled niche in the marketplace. **********It is difficult to give a precise measure of the new-product business. According to Martin Friedman, editor of New Product News, 682 new food, household, beauty and health care products were introduced in the first six months of this year, an exceptionally high figure. However, other marketing experts quibble with Mr.  Friedman's criteria - he lists old products in new flavors and colors - and some even dispute the upward trend he detects, arguing that newproduct introductions reached a peak in the expansionist 1960's. **********But there is no dispute that the introduction of a new product is a high-risk venture. According to Mr. Rosow, only one in 10 consumer products that get to the test-market stage succeeds nationally. ''A lot of products go national and never get their original investment back,'' said Alden Clayton, managing director of the Marketing Science Institute, a Harvard-affiliated organization. **********General Foods takes more such gambles than most companies. The reason, apart from the company's sheer size and concentration on food, is that its volume comes from ''many mature food categories - coffee, gelatin,'' said Lawrence Adelman, a first vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds. ''So it has a greater need to launch new products.'' He added that General Foods outspends any other packaged food company on research and development: $79 million in 1980, $96 million budgeted for 1981. **********Jell-O pudding was a prime example of the ''mature'' food category. Although its business is large and highly profitable, the vast base was a barrier to major volume growth, which General Foods recently declared to be a key corporate objective. ''To grow dramatically, you have to introduce new products,'' Mr. Rosow said. A Snack-Time Problem **********At the same time, eating patterns had changed, to the detriment of Jell-O pudding. While mothers still wanted its ''wholesome goodness'' for their children, Mr. Rosow said, afternoon snacks such as ice cream and packaged cakes were usurping the place of conventional desserts that were not readily portable and required preparation time. ''The question was, 'How can we put pudding in the path of the afternoon snack opportunity'?'' said Mr. Rosow. ''What we did was to freeze it and put it on a stick.'' **********Even its flavors were borrowed from traditional Jell-O pudding: chocolate, vanilla, banana and butterscotch. The reason, Mr. Rosow said, is that ''its credentials are pudding credentials.'' **********General Foods scientists say that the development of Pudding Pops was not quite that simple, but the technology involved was certainly less sophisticated than that of other new General Foods products such as Lean Strips, a textured protein substitute for bacon, or frozen Crispy Cookin' french fries. The dessert division does have some higher-technology products under development, but with Pudding Pops, Mr. Rosow conceded, ''it is hardly the Manhattan Project.'' **********The big financial outlay, therefore, began with the marketing of Pudding Pops. In the preliminary stage, known as pre-test-marketing, General Foods researchers circulated a drawing and description of the product to households around the country. Encouraged by the response, the company manufactured and distributed door-to-door a limited sampling of Pudding Pops. The Best-Laid Plans . . . **********''However sophisticated the research, it's hard to rely on the information you get from consumers,'' Mr. Rosow said. ''People sometimes say things because they want to please you.'' Partly as a result, the best-laid marketing plans have sometimes gone awry. ''The company that brought you Pampers also brought you Pringles,'' he said, referring to the troubled history of Procter & Gamble's processed potato chip. **********Encouraged by consumer reaction, however, General Foods decided to test-market - a costly if cautious decision. In test-marketing, ''You have all the inefficiencies of small scale, in manufacturing and distribution,'' Mr. Rosow said. In 1978, Pudding Pops were introduced into stores in Cincinnati and Denver. Minneapolis and Salt Lake City followed a year later. Sales are said to be ''extremely good'' in all four test markets, where a box of a dozen Pudding Pops sells for $1.99. **********Another favorable sign is that Pudding Pops are being imitated by competitors, according to Mr. Rosow. Shortly after General Foods began test-marketing Pudding Pops, Popsicle Industries introduced Good 'n' Puddin'. The product is selling very well nationwide, said Eugene Welka, Popsicle's marketing director, who refused to comment on Mr. Rosow's view. **********The proliferation of rival products, as well as the expense of test-marketing, puts some pressure on General Foods to ''roll out'' Pudding Pops nationwide. ''The objective is to get a product national as quickly as possible,'' Mr. Rosow said. He refused to confirm or deny a suggestion by a competitor that Pudding Pops will roll out next month, or even to acknowledge that a decision has been made. **********It is important to get it right. ''By the time a product like Pudding Pops goes national, the up-front investment is really enormous, running into the tens of millions of dollars.'' Mr. Rosow said. **********Furthermore, ''it takes five to seven years to break into the black,'' he added, so General Foods must be sure that the product has enduring consumer appeal. ''All of us in this industry worry about the product that is a fad,'' he said. ''You never get your money back.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/02/business/xerox-lifts-prices.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Xerox Lifts Prices", "print_headline": "Xerox Lifts Prices", "body_text": " **********The Xerox Corporation said it will raise the price of medium- and high-volume copiers and duplicators an average of about 9 percent in the United States effective Jan. 4.

But after decades of legislating on every conceivable aspect of race relations, the lawmakers are starting to find that changes occur spontaneously, without having been entered on their agendas. **********An example is the crumbling of apartheid on the glorious beaches of the Cape peninsula, which extends like a tiny comma from the bottom of a vast continent. **********It took plenty of lawmaking and law enforcement to get the various racial groups segregated on their various beaches, with the most handsome spots, the least windswept, going by scant coincidence to the people who picked the lawmakers. Apartheid did not come to the Cape's beaches until the 1960's and it was not until the 1970's that the great work of separation seemed to have been finally achieved. **********One can still see ''Whites Only'' signs and scent the fragrance of coconut oil, which indicates that the browning torsos in the vicinity were once of a paler hue. But wherever you look you are bound to see family groups that are obviously ignoring the signs. **********Mostly they belong to the people of mixed race who are classified here as coloreds and who account for a clear majority of the peninsula's population. There is no suggestion of a political act in their refusal to confine themselves any longer to what a white South African would describe as ''their own beaches.'' Indeed, they seem to think that they are on their own beaches, whatever the signs say. White Beaches Overwhelmed **********However, on certain days - major holidays like Christmas or New Year's Day, which fall in the summer here, -blacks as well as coloreds now overwhelm the white beaches. An Afrikaner editor of relatively liberal attitudes who was on such a beach last Christmas acknowledged that he found the experience disturbing enough to make him wonder how liberal he really was. A colored professor reacted differently. ''It was a good sight to see in Cape Town,'' he said.  ''This part of the country is one day going to wake up to the fact that it is part of Africa.'' **********On a typical weekend it is not an invasion so much as an infiltration, with colored families clustering at the edge of the white beaches. At St. James Beach on False Bay, the nonwhites mostly stayed on a rocky outcropping, going to the beach only when they were ready to face the pounding surf. But some set their canvas chairs up on the sand. **********Whites nearby seemed not to notice or care. A colored constable, who is technically supposed to enforce apartheid on the beaches but doesn't, looked on approvingly. The municipality of Cape Town, for which he works, has given up on apartheid on the beaches, he explained, leaving it to the provincial police, who remain unyielding. **********If whites complain to him, the constable said, he refers them to the provincial police and then goes to warn the coloreds in the vicinity that there is likely to be a scene. The penalty for being a nonwhite on a white beach is a fine of 50 rands, the equivalent of about $75, or 50 days in jail. **********''But the people are getting brainy,'' the constable said. ''They know there's safety in numbers.'' If there are enough of them, he said, the officials can either call out the riot policemen or leave the offenders alone. ''If they call out the riot police,'' he added, ''they'll have a riot and that's bad for the country's image.'' So gradually beach integration creeps up, like the tides. **********Looking for a new basis for exclusion, some white communities on the peninsula have decided to put up turnstiles and charge admission, shifting the standard from race to class. **********It is hard, sometimes, not to speak of a colored professor or a colored constable, because in almost any South African situation the category of race makes itself felt and words have to be found to express it. But politically alert people who carry identity cards that classify them as colored no longer use the word except ironically. **********As a political statement, expressing a sense of solidarity among all the disenfranchised, they prefer to call themselves blacks, but that leaves them without a convenient word for referring to Africans who are also called blacks. One circumlocution when distinctions become necessary is to refer to brown blacks and black blacks.  Another is to refer to so-called coloreds or to accompany the word colored with a plunking two-fingered gesture to indicate that quotation marks have been attached. ''It's so cumbersome,'' said a faculty member of the University of the Western Cape, an institution that is officially colored but ''so-called colored'' to most of its students. ''You have to define your terms every time you use them,'' he said. **********Though Richard van der Ross, rector of the university, said he was comfortable using ''black'' or ''colored,'' depending on context, ''so-called colored'' struck him as an absurdity because, he said, it seems to imply that those being described are not really coloreds and that there are some other people, somewhere else, who are. **********The term most offensive to Richard Rive, a novelist and critic, is ''nonwhite'' because it defines people negatively. ''But one does speak in terms these days of nonblacks,'' he said. **********Another man with a sense of political and linguistic nuance said the only tolerable circumlocution was to refer to ''those people classified as coloreds.'' Although he is happy to be called black, he said, ''the ideal is to achieve a common identity.'' **********One of the great lost causes of the apartheid era has been the fight to save District 6, a colored neighborhood in the center of Cape Town that was exuberant and often bawdy before the need for any redefinition was felt. District 6 was the closest thing to a ''homeland'' that the coloreds had in South Africa, but in 1966 it was proclaimed white under the Group Areas Act. **********What ensued was the 15-year bureaucratic equivalent of a guerrilla war between the functionaries of the Ministry of Community Development - a euphemism in this context since its purpose was removal, not development - and the local population, which evaded and resisted eviction notices. **********That struggle is nearly over now and the bureaucrats have plainly won. The population of the district, once 40,000, has fallen in the past year from more than 10,000 to barely 3,000; this time next year it will probably be zero."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/28/business/4th-quarter-worrying-retailers.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1981-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1234, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "4TH QUARTER WORRYING RETAILERS", "print_headline": "4TH QUARTER WORRYING RETAILERS", "body_text": " **********Although shoppers were much in evidence on Saturday, many of the nation's merchants, after a difficult Christmas season, are facing the final month of their last 1981 fiscal quarter with discomfort. **********More than a few believe it will show the scars of erratic sales and the costly markdowns taken during the first four weeks of December.  The outlook for the fourth quarter, which for retailers ends on Jan. 31, is cloudy, a special source of concern since the period normally provides more than 50 percent of the year's profits and 30 percent of sales. But most analysts see the quarter's results as unchanged or down from the 1980 quarter. They also see it as an uncertain harbinger for the early months of the new fiscal year. **********'Still Cause for Concern' **********In addition to the spotty holiday sales, industry analysts say, the quarter may well end up suffering from weak January sales. **********''Sales volume for Christmas 1981 was ahead of last year for most retailers, with some companies showing healthy sales gains while most others were slightly ahead,'' said Robert M. Zimmerman, director of retail industry services for the Coopers & Lybrand accounting concern. ''Nevertheless, there is still cause for concern over fiscal 1981 retail performance figures.'' **********The accounting executive, noting that, ''for most retailers 1980 was a marginal year,'' said that any 1981 sales gain must be evaluated against that weak base. Extensive Price-Cutting Cited **********''In addition, price-cutting and price-shopping were extensive during this Christmas season, so that gross margin dollars will not increase in proportion to sales,'' he added. ''There is also a strong possibility that many of the off-price purchases made in December will reduce the traditional bargain shopping in January.'' **********One of the major hindrances to improvement in the final quarter, compared with a year earlier, is the inventory remaining.  Post-Christmas stocks are higher than most retailers would like, and it is likely that this will be so at the end of January as well. **********Over the weekend, stores from New York to Los Angeles and from Maine to Texas began their post-Christmas clearances in a sweeping effort to pare inventories and take advantage of the normal January bargain-hunting.

In the 34th Street area, the shopper stream was steady most of the day. Gimbels, Ohrbach's, Lerner's and particularly Macy's Herald Square were busy. The main floor at Macy's, with its overhanging wreaths and ''Nutcracker Suite'' music, and especially its crowds, resembled a typical day at the height of the pre-Christmas season. 'Expecting Big Things' **********At Gimbels, M. Ronald Ruskin, chairman of the 10-store Gimbels New York chain, said: ''We are expecting big things over the next few weeks. The break in the calendar will help, with Saturday, normally a big shopping day, being the first day after Christmas, against Friday last year, and the same for the New Year's weekend. Our attitude after our Christmas experience is that the consumer is being very selective, as shown by the fact that it was not the usual freefor-all Christmas. We intend to operate in the future convinced that that will be a major factor in consumer psychology.'' **********In Houston, Robert T. Sakowitz, chairman of Sakowitz Inc., an apparel specialty store chain in Texas and Arizona, said, however, that while consumers were being very selective they were also interested in advancing the seasons by seeing early selections. ''We brought in early spring goods in November and got a strong reaction that will help us on color and silhouette selection,'' he added. **********But Mr. Sakowitz, while savoring his company's strong 20 percent year-to-year sales gain in December thus far, also reflected views of other retailers by saying in a telephone interview: **********''The inventory turnover rate is the key to the business today, in a time of high inflation and high interest rates. In men's clothing, for example, it has been traditional for major suppliers to insist that retailers buy for the entire season and take delivery as it develops. But we decided not long ago to buy four to five times a year, with individual delivery each time. This gave us a chance to create new excitement with each arrival and it has improved our inventory turnover rate about 30 percent in that type of goods.'' Interested in Value **********Both retail executives observed that the recent holiday season showed that the public was especially interested in items with recognizable value and quality as opposed to entire lines of merchandise or storewide promotions. ''It's no more a matter of just filling up the selection to take space,'' Mr. Sakowitz said. **********Mr. Ruskin said, ''We cannot expect the consumer to get excited about advertising blouses at a third to a half off; it has to be a nationally branded blouse, with which the shopper can identify, and at values that she knows are real.'' **********In the meantime, the remainder of the all-important fourth quarter lies ahead. ''Basically, I think that the final quarter's earnings for most retailers will be from flat to down compared to 1980, but not disastrously,'' said Monroe H. Greenstein, senior analyst for Bear, Stearns & Company. **********''This year's Christmas was very promotional, but so was 1980's,'' he added. ''So we are not comparing poor gross margins with good gross margins a year ago; this year's final period, though, might be worse.'' **********The quarter's profits will be aided by lower last-in, first-out charges in inventory accounting than had been originally estimated because inflation has slowed in general merchandise, Mr. Greenstein added. ''Most estimates had been that the inflation rate would be between 6 and 7 percent,'' he went on, ''but my feeling is that it could come in the next reading and be applied to the final quarter at about 5.5 percent.'' Difficult Comparison Seen **********The Bear Stearns analyst predicted that retail earnings for the first 1982 fiscal quarter, which will begin Feb. 1, would be ''poor.'' He added: ''The recession will continue, with the consumer remaining very selective, while the comparable quarter in 1981 was much stronger than anyone expected. So the comparison with the prior year will be difficult, probably leading to small sales gains and a trend to declining earnings.'' **********Mr. Zimmerman, of Coopers & Lybrand, said, ''The 1981 fourth quarter will not be a disaster for most retailers but neither will it be the salvation of a generally mediocre year. And the first half of 1982 promises no relief. Sales demand is not expected to be strong and tight inventory control will continue to be mandatory.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/09/world/more-oil-price-cuts-seem-likely-as-global-oversupply-continues.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Martin", "pub_date": "1981-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1155, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MORE OIL PRICE CUTS SEEM LIKELY AS GLOBAL OVERSUPPLY CONTINUES", "print_headline": "MORE OIL PRICE CUTS SEEM LIKELY AS GLOBAL OVERSUPPLY CONTINUES", "body_text": " **********Day after day, reductions in the price of crude oil have been shaking the already unsettled world petroleum markets. And further price erosion seems inevitable, oil analysts and oil company officials said yesterday. **********As an indication that major oil producers will announce further price cuts soon, traders reported yesterday that spot prices for crude oil sold on a noncontract basis had plunged as low as $32 a barrel, roughly equal to the lowest official price charged by any member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. **********''This thing is really a zoo,'' said a top official of one international oil company. ''We have entered a totally new environment.'' **********Actions Taken Abroad **********Britain offered last Friday to drop the official price of its North Sea crude by $2 a barrel, an offer that refining companies rejected as not enough. And African oil producers, among those most aggressive on pricing in OPEC, are said to be offering discounts of as much as $4 a barrel from their official prices, which exceed $40 a barrel. **********Mexico, a major oil producer, has already announced a $4-a-barrel price cut, and Persian Gulf producers have eliminated the surcharges they formerly attached to official prices. Saudi Arabia, which accounts for 40 percent of OPEC production, charges $32 a barrel, and the price range among the other members of OPEC is from $36 to $41 a barrel. **********The present situation, oil analysts say, could give way to a wholly different kind of chaos. Speculation was rampant yesterday that Israel's surprise attack on an Iraqi nuclear reactor might cause a retaliatory oil embargo, similar to the one in 1973, by Arab oilproducing states against the United States and other supporters of Israel. Some analysts also fear that Iran and Iraq, both of which have substantially increased oil output in recent months, may resume their war and be forced to cut production again. **********For the present, however, the price cuts are working to reduce the retail price of gasoline in the United States and to stir conjecture that OPEC's grip on the industrialized world may be weakening. The price cuts also demonstrate the power of the cartel's biggest producer, Saudi Arabia, to force its will on the other members by flooding the market with 10.3 million barrels of oil a day. **********Saudi Arabia's official production ceiling is 8.5 million barrels daily, but it increased the output to put downward pressure on prices. This rise in production created the current worldwide oil glut, with the oversupply estimated at 2 million to 3 million barrels daily. **********The Saudi goal is to force high-priced producers - Libya, Algeria and Nigeria in particular - to bring prices down. Most oil analysts think such moves are imminent. **********''Something has got to give on prices and give pretty quickly,'' said Ian Sanderson, coordinator of foreign crude oil supplies for the Phillips Petroleum Company. Saudis' Long-Term Plan **********Rumors persist in the oil industry that after such price reductions, or even before, the Saudis would raise their price to $34 from $32 in an attempt to unify their price with those in the rest of OPEC, where the current base price is $36 a barrel. This would provide a basis for introducing a long-term pricing plan that the Saudis favor, a plan that oil industry experts estimate would increase inflation-adjusted crude oil prices by approximately 2 to 3 percent annually. **********All the petroleum price reductions so far, as well as those expected to occur, will probably not be entirely passed on to consumers, who nonetheless have already seen gasoline prices decline by nearly 10 cents a gallon over the last few months, to an average national price of $1.35 a gallon. Pump prices might go down another 5 cents, analysts suggest. **********For every $1 change in the price of a barrel of crude oil, the price of a gallon of gasoline changes slightly more than 2 cents if all of the changes are passed along to motorists. Filling Strategic Reserve **********The Reagan Administration is taking advantage of the present soft prices to step up buying for the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. By the end of this month, the reserve is expected to total 160 million barrels, a 40-million-barrel increase during the last four months. **********''Obviously we're doing our best to take advantage of things,'' said Danny Boggs, White House energy aide. ''We don't want to miss the turn in the market.'' **********In less than a week, following OPEC's inability to assert control over the situation at its meeting in Geneva, the new weakness of oil prices has been underscored by these developments: **********- Mexico, which exports about 700,000 barrels of oil a day to the United States, cut the price of its two principal grades of crude oil by $4 a barrel, an amount equivalent to 9.5 cents a gallon. **********- The British National Oil Company, which sets the price of the high-quality, low-sulfur crude produced in the British sector of the North Sea, offered to cut its price by $2 a barrel. A major oil company planner, calling the offer ''clearly inadequate'' to spur sales of North Sea oil, predicted it would have to be further reduced, perhaps by $5 a barrel. **********- Several smaller oil-producing countries have cut prices - Malaysia by 70 cents a barrel yesterday and Ecuador by $3.80 a barrel on Friday. **********- Oil traders say Libya, Algeria and Nigeria have been offering special discounts of as much as $4 a barrel on their oil. **********- Spot prices of almost every variety of oil in the world continue to fall. Industry officials reported yesterday that some Saudi crude, the least expensive in the world, was being offered on a spot basis for $32 a barrel, its official price. This represents a drop of $7.25 in the spot market so far this year. Fee on Imports Debated **********Talk is being heard in Congress that the time may be right to consider such measures as imposing a fee on imported oil. Such a step would increase prices in the United States, thereby continuing to dampen demand and lessening this country's dependence on foreign producers. **********Although such a move would be inflationary, it could benefit the Federal Treasury by billions of dollars. ''If the Saudis raise the price, they get the money,'' argued an aide to a Democratic Senator.  ''If we raise the price, we get the money.'' **********''We should accelerate moves to make the glut a permanent fixture,'' said Elihu Bergman, executive director of Americans for Energy Independence. He urges taking advantage of the producers' current lack of power to push rapid conversion to alternative fuels and to encourage energy conservation efforts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/27/business/caldor-tie-approved.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 49, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Caldor Tie Approved", "print_headline": "Caldor Tie Approved", "body_text": " **********A merger of Caldor Inc. into the Associated Dry Goods Corporation in a $313 million cash-and-securities transaction was approved by shareholders of both companies, the retailers announced.

Some analysts attributed the slow sales to continuing problems in the general economy. **********''Sales are not as strong as I would have expected, given the rebates,'' said Harvey Heinbach of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. ''The rates of sales are much slower than what we had in February, when rebates were kicked off,'' he added. The costly rebate programs have been beneficial to the dealers, however, he said, because increased sales help reduce costly inventories that require high-interest loans to carry. **********The rebates, which range from $500 to more than $1,000, are scheduled to expire at G.M., Ford and Chrysler by March 21.  Another analyst, Arvid Jouppi of John Muir & Company, said he was not disappointed in the sales levels. ''There is a latent demand for cars,'' he said. ''If the consumer is given any incentive at all, he'll go for it, as is evidenced by the most recent periods.'' Slowdown Is Expected **********Both agreed that, because of the increased sales resulting from rebates, a period of slower sales would follow, probably in April.  This is the traditional beginning of the spring selling season, when sales levels usually increase. **********Total industry sales in the March 1 through 10 period, including those at Volkswagen of America and an estimate of sales for the American Motors Corporation, were 204,031, up 8.6 percent from last year, when sales were off sharply as a result of the recession, rising gasoline prices and the attraction of smaller, fuel-efficient foreign cars. There were eight selling days in both periods. **********The Chrysler Corporation, which has been offering a 7 percent rebate, showed the most significant increase in year-to-year sales gains - up 51.2 percent, to 25,900 new cars this year, from 17,128 last year. Chrysler's rebate program began Dec. 4 and was extended recently to run through March 17. Chrysler has also held prices steady, while the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company had recent increases. **********General Motors, which is offering $500 to $700 rebates on most of its smaller models, reported an increase of 7 percent in the period, to 125,549 new cars, from 117,296 last year. G.M. sold 61.5 percent of all domestic cars sold in the early March period; Volkswagen's market share was 1.9 percent, while Ford held 21.7 percent, and Chrysler 12.7 percent. **********Ford was the only domestic producer to show a year-to-year decline in the latest period - down 3.6 percent, to 44,227 new cars this year, from 45,871 last year. Ford was also the only company to have rebates at this time last year. The Ford rebate program of shaving 10 percent from the base price of some models allows the customer a rebate on cars ordered now for future delivery, but whose sale will not be reported for several weeks. Neither G.M. nor Chrysler has this rebate provision. Optimism at Ford **********Ford officials remained optimistic about future sales: ''The consumer cash programs are breaking up the industry's sales logjam,'' said Philip E. Benton Jr., vice president of sales for Ford's North American operations. **********Volkswagen sales increased 5.4 percent on sales of 3,855 cars, compared with 3,657 last year. Industry estimates put American Motors' sales in the period at 4,500 units, up 14 percent from 3,943 sold in the period last year. The company reports sales on a monthly basis only. **********For the year to date, in which there were 58 selling days, compared with 59 last year, General Motors sales were down 12.3 percent and Ford sales were down 12.7 percent.

Revenues were $5.5 billion in both quarters. **********Rand V. Araskog, chairman, president and chief executive officer, attributed the downturn to losses on translating foreign currencies into dollars. In addition, he said, the quarterly earnings figure was reduced because of I.T.T.'s settlement of a lawsuit brought by the Internal Revenue Service over its 1970 acquisition of the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. In the settlement, announced last week, I.T.T. agreed to pay the Government $17.8 million. Operating Improvement Expected **********The company said that its revenues and operating earnings would be higher for 1981 than they were in 1980, with the gain experienced largely during the second half of the year. However, because of Federal accounting requirements covering the translation of foreign currencies, Mr. Araskog said, reported earnings may be lower. **********Mr. Araskog described as ''frivolous and silly'' the ruling by a Federal Trade Commission judge yesterday that the Continental Baking Company, an I.T.T. subsidiary, had engaged in anticompetitive practices, adding that I.T.T. would appeal the ruling by Miles J.  Brown, an administrative law judge in Washington. **********''It would be ridiculous for us to try and run a business in the mode set by some administrative judge,'' he said.

He asserted that the fees ''are really inadequate'' because board membership is considered entirely separate from executive duties, and because the I.T.T. employees sit on no other boards of directors. **********Mr. Araskog also asserted that the I.T.T. board had no immediate intention of restructuring the company's top management by separating the positions of chairman, chief executive officer and president. **********I.T.T., which is based in New York, reported net income of $894 million last year on sales of $23.8 billion.

The letters come from presidents, prime ministers, diplomats, United Nations staff members and concerned citizens. **********Vice President Bush, Fidel Castro of Cuba, Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa of Nepal and Juvenal Habyarimana, the President of Rwanda, have written. But letters from world dignitaries are outnumbered by those from untitled correspondents. **********The mail is collected by Emilio de Olivares of Peru. He works on the staff of the outgoing Secretary General, Kurt Waldheim, and will move to a job with the inner cabinet of Mr. Perez de Cuellar, his longtime Peruvian friend. 'Greater Peace and Justice' **********''Freeze the arms race,'' reads the cover of a red-and-white Christmas card from a North Manchester, Ind., resident. Inside, he wrote, ''Our fervent wish is that your office will guide the world to greater peace and justice through a strengthened United Nations.'' **********Mr. de Olivares withheld the name of the author of this letter, as he withheld those of others that have not been answered.  A former pilot from Ohio suggested building a railway around the world to promote global harmony. Two New Yorkers, perhaps upset over the stock market, sent a mailgram that read, ''Thank God you are not an economist.'' **********Letters from third-world countries frequently expressed pleasure at the selection of a Secretary General from a developing nation. The writers said they hoped that Mr. Perez de Cuellar would devote his attention to improving their lot. **********''God Almighty has chosen you not only as the spokesman for the superpowers but an Ambassador (a messenger) to tell the superpowers of their responsibility to poor, illiterate, backward peoples of Latin America, Africa and Asia,'' said an engineering professor from Dacca, Bangladesh, in a typewritten, three-page letter. Hobbies and Interests Cited **********Some of those writing Mr. Perez de Cuellar appeared to be trying to drum up business. A partner in a Syracuse law firm sent his congratulations. He also enclosed a brochure extolling his firm's work for third-world clients. **********Some correspondents wrote of their hobbies and interests.  A man from Skokie, Ill., proposed a musical dictionary substituting notes for words. For example, he wrote, the note A could mean ''all'' or ''beginning;'' A-sharp could stand for ''humans;'' B for ''other,'' and what he called a ''B quartersharp'' could mean ''love.'' How this might improve communication he did not say. **********''I wish for Mr. de Cuellar to carry out total success for our Negro Catholic Society,'' an elderly man from Jacksonville, Fla., said in his letter, written in a shaky scrawl across six pages. A 72-year-old Canadian wrote to complain that his country still owed symbolic allegiance to a British monarch. Not All Letters Are Friendly **********A family from Newton, Mass., sent a privately printed, illustrated and bound copy of two original Christmas tales in rhyme. The inscription read, ''Best wishes for your important work toward collaboration and world sharing and peace.'' **********Not all of the mail was friendly. An Atlantan wrote: ''It is time for the U.S. to resign from the U.N. and get the U.N. out of our country. The U.N. is a luxury and we can no longer afford luxuries.  We are sick and tired of carrying your burden.'' **********But a man from Hyderabad, India, voiced the most common sentiment.  His letter said, ''Let flowers shower on you for every spectacular deed and let you be the pearl in the eyes of people of the world.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/business/amax-adobe-stake-sold-to-francana.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 219, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMAX ADOBE STAKE SOLD TO FRANCANA", "print_headline": "AMAX ADOBE STAKE SOLD TO FRANCANA", "body_text": " **********Amax Inc. agreed yesterday to sell its 30 percent interest in the Adobe Oil and Gas Corporation to Francana Oil and Gas Ltd. of Calgary, Alberta, for $32 a share, or $140.3 million, canceling an earlier deal to sell it for a lower price. **********The metals concern, which is based in Greenwich, Conn., had previously agreed to sell its Adobe interest to the Williams Companies of Tulsa, Okla., for about $105 million in a deal subject to Amax board approval. **********Late last week, however, Francana offered $123 million.

Brezhnev to President Reagan, challenging Mr. Reagan's picture of Soviet-American global competition but urging that the two leaders augment their correspondence with a personal meeting because ''private conversation is better.'' **********''We do not seek confrontation with the U.S.A. nor do we wish to infringe upon legitimate American interests,'' Mr. Brezhnev said. He echoed President Reagan's comments that a meeting between the two ''should be well prepared'' and suggested that ''we could yet return to the questioning of its timing, I believe, at a moment acceptable to both of us.'' **********The Soviet leader wrote to Mr. Reagan on May 25 in response to the President's letter of April 24, written during Mr. Reagan's stay in the hospital after he had been shot. In his speech Wednesday, Mr.  Reagan quoted extensively from his April letter, and Soviet officials said this was what prompted the release of the Brezhnev response. **********No New Political Initiatives **********The portions of the Reagan-Brezhnev correspondence disclosed by both sides in the last 72 hours have revealed no previously unknown diplomatic or political moves. Instead, they contain fairly familiar political debate and disagreement between Moscow and Washington, much of which has been reflected in public statements by the two Governments. **********The Soviet leader blamed the United States, specifically the Carter Administration and, by implication, even Mr. Reagan himself during the years he was out of office, for the deterioration in Soviet-American relations. **********Then, as if warning the President of the political risks in letting a chill fall over Soviet-American relations, Mr. Brezhnev commented that ''in the final analysis, let us be frank, it brought no laurels to Carter.'' **********''Isn't it so, Mr. President?'' he asked.  He took the Reagan Administration to task for expanding on the Carter Administration's efforts to revitalize the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, for seeking to extend the American military presence into the Persian Gulf region and for throwing the mantle of American protection over that area. 'Through Our Eyes' **********''Try, Mr. President, to see what is going on through our eyes,'' Mr. Brezhnev wrote. ''Attempts are being made to revitalize the U.S.- made military and political alliances; new bases are being added to those which already exist thousands of kilometers away from the U.S.A. and are aimed against our country; the American military presence abroad, in general, is being increased and expanded; large areas of the world are being declared spheres of 'vital interest' to the U.S.A.'' **********In response to Mr. Reagan's earlier objections to the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, Mr. Brezhnev argued that ''there should be no double standards,'' evidently implying that Soviet action there was no different from other American interventions abroad. **********Moreover, he complained that the United States intention was being ''openly announced in Washington to go on supplying arms'' to what he described as the ''the bands'' raiding Afghanistan ''from the outside.'' He seemed to imply that anti-Communist insurgency in Afghanistan was entirely a matter of incursions from beyond Afghan frontiers. An Appeal for Negotiations **********While he acknowledged ideological ''differences of opinion'' with Mr. Reagan, Mr. Brezhnev included in his lengthy letter an appeal for ''honest and constructive negotiations'' on ''practically all major questions existing between us - be it restraining the arms race, eliminating the most dangerous sources of tension in various areas of the world, or measures for confidence-building and developing a mutually beneficial cooperation.'' **********He closed with another push for the summit meeting that he first suggested in a speech to the 26th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party on Feb. 23. **********Although Mr. Reagan and his top policy advisers have responded positively, they have not wanted to seem overly eager for a Reagan-Brezhnev meeting and have repeatedly insisted on the need for adequate and lengthy preparations. **********The Reagan Administration took office convinced that Mr. Carter had displayed too great an eagerness for negotiations and top-level meetings with the Soviet Union and that Moscow had used this as leverage to gain negotiating concessions. **********In his letter, Mr. Brezhnev also seemed at pains not to be in too much of a rush for a meeting with Mr. Reagan, a topic that he reportedly raised in another letter sent in October that has not yet been released."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/19/business/company-news-the-turnaround-at-us-steel.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1981-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE TURNAROUND AT U.S. STEEL", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; THE TURNAROUND AT U.S. STEEL", "body_text": " **********It was a dramatic turnabout at the United States Steel Corporation - a return to a profitable year. But surprising to industry analysts was the report that even the company's steel division, despite a decline in shipments, was in the black. **********The company, which reported 1980 earnings of $504.5 million, following a loss of $293 million the year before, has attributed the improvement to sharp manpower reductions, more efficient use of plant and equipment and a high level of capital spending, and stresses that it will continue along this course. **********The turnabout in the steel division, during a period when industry shipments declined 16 percent, to 84 million tons, and most of U.S.  Steel's plants operated at 50 percent capacity, was a dramatic one, analysts said. They recalled that in 1979, when steel shipments had climbed to a robust 100 million tons, the steel division of the nation's largest steel company had lost money. **********''Considering the operating rate,'' said Charles A. Bradford, the steel industry analyst for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., ''that's a monumental achievement.'' **********Even if the company announces in its annual report, when the operating profit of each segment will be broken out, that steel showed only a small profit, he said, ''that's still a hell of an improvement.'' **********He shared the view of David M. Roderick, the company's chairman, however, that U.S. Steel still has a long way to go in improving its steel business. ''It's gone from a bad company,'' Mr. Bradford said, ''to an average company.'' Plant Closings a Factor **********Mr. Roderick, who took over as chairman in 1979, has brought the company through a period of consolidation and a redeployment of its assets. Interviewed in the company's Washington office, he cited a number of reasons for the turnaround in steel, but emphasized that the permanent closing of 15 older plants with the loss of 12,500 jobs in November 1979 was one of the most important steps. That drastic action resulted in a loss of $561.7 million in the fourth quarter of 1979. **********''Thank God we did it,'' he said. He estimated that if the closed plants had been in operation last year, the company would have run up a loss of more than $100 million. **********The closings permitted management to concentrate on turning around more viable plants. It was also an incentive to the remaining problem plants such as Fairfield in Alabama, the Gary and South Works in the Chicago area and the works in Beaumont, Tex., to work hard to turn their plants around. 'The Clock Was Running' **********''Let's face it, when you do what we did in '79, I think you create a sense of urgency,'' Mr. Roderick said. Local management and the rank and file, he added, realized that ''the clock was running.'' **********Thoughout 1980 Mr. Roderick reminded them of the clock with repeated warnings that such plants would be closed unless cuts in manpower and more efficient use of equipment brought considerable improvement in productivity. **********Mr. Roderick noted that there would be a continuing drive to increase yield by using less manpower.  The number of blast furnaces, which are used to make iron from which steel is smelted, has been reduced to 27 from 46. The company's capacity to produce raw steel, however, is expected to shrink to about 34 million tons from the 38 million produced in 1978. Spending Remains High **********Mr. Roderick emphasized, however, that it was too simple to point only to manpower reductions. Another major reason for the the greater efficiency in steel, he explained, was that the company kept capital spending at a high level even though orders for the steel industry were low in three of the last five years. **********''We've spent $6.8 billion, much of it in the last five years,'' he said, seated on a beige couch in his office.  Only a part of the money went into steel, however, with a major share spent for diversification into chemicals.  Mr. Roderick still maintains, however, that new spending will go to those businesses that provide the highest rate of return. Chemicals, oil and gas and coal thus may be given precedence over steel in the competition for capital investment. Cash Reserve Increased **********Not that U.S. Steel is short of money. For most of the year, it has been building up its cash reserves, which will stand at about $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. **********The purpose of increasing its cash, Mr. Roderick said, was to prevent borrowing under current high interest rates and to have money on hand should an attractive acquisition in chemicals, coal or natural gas and oil come along. **********As for steel, he predicted that investment would be directed toward rapidly expanding segments such as goods for oil countries. Such goods are in heavy demand as a result of increased oil drilling. **********Though capital spending will increase to about $1.3 billion this year, compared with $975 million last year, most steel plants will have to try to increase their efficiency with existing equipment. **********Frank M. Hogan Jr., superintendent of the Fairless Works, for example, dreams of the time he can replace his outdated open hearth furnaces with modern basic oxygen furnaces that produce steel faster and cheaper. **********Such a shop, however, would cost more than $300 million, an investment that the company is unlikely to make under the present return. Mr. Hogan is optimistic, however, that the investment eventually will be made. Japanese Technology Studied **********Thus he has put emphasis on increasing quality and efficiency.  Several of his managers have gone to Japan to study technology and production methods there. **********Mr. Hogan said that on a scale of 1 to 10, the Fairless Works operated at a level of ''about 3'' in production efficiency, compared with what he would like to see. ''We've just scratched the surface,'' he said, ''But we have started.'' **********He is also exploring the possibility of adopting the idea of quality circles used in Japanese plants under which groups of workers and immediate superiors are made responsible for meeting certain standards of quality. **********The frank acknowledgement of the superiority of Japanese methods is the result of a more pragmatic attitude of Mr. Roderick and William R. Roesch, the president. In the past, the company sought to develop much of its own technology; now its executives emphasize that U.S.  Steel will turn to whomever has the best. While the Japanese could not be copied exactly, Mr. Hogan said, ''You can take the principles and improve things.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/13/business/advertising-192620.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 687, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising", "print_headline": "Advertising", "body_text": " **********Philip H. Dougherty Filling A Niche With Beer **********NEAL W. KAYE Jr., a young man with big ideas, was in town from New Orleans last week to see about getting his beer sold in Europe. He does not have a brewery but that has not stopped him so far. **********Mr. Kaye has been selling Coy International Private Reserve down home since February. And down home they know where the beer's name comes from. They know that the Kayes pronounce their name Coy. That goes for both Junior and Senior, who are president and chairman, respectively, of Neal W. Kaye Inc., a major beer wholesaler that sells about 40 brands of beer in the New Orleans market, including Schlitz, for whom the father worked from 1947 to 1968. The senior Mr. Kaye is also president-elect of the National Beer Wholesalers Association. **********What has the industry watching the Kayes is their historic move of separating the manufacturing function from the marketing function in the beer business. **********Having perceived a niche in the market, the Kayes had a formula concocted by a brewmaster and are now lining up independent brewers to turn out Coy with their excess capacity with the goal of becoming a national and international brand. **********In a visit here the other morning, Neal Kaye Jr., who is 33 years old, made it all sound possible. Coy is already selling in six states and Mr. Kaye was about to go to his second meeting with Henry Verbruggen, a Brussels business consultant, who, he said, was instrumental in getting Wrigley's and Mars candies into European distribution. **********Mr. Kaye thinks that while the American brewing industry, led by Philip Morris' Miller, prefers light beers, the products of the baby boom (like himself) have matured enough to desire more flavorful brews. To fulfill such a desire, he maintains that they must turn to something like Heineken, the Dutch import. **********''I know the public is in the market for taste,'' Mr. Kaye said, ''and they can't get it in an American beer, at least for a decent price.'' **********That's the niche.  And with filling it in mind, the Kayes went to the brewmaster at the Pearl Brewing Company in San Antonio who brewed a combination of beer and ale. The junior Mr. Kaye is expecting the taste to do much of the selling because, comparatively speaking, Coy does not get that much of an advertising boost. **********''Beer,'' he remarked, ''doesn't have to be high-spending. There have been some that weren't, like Heinekin and Moose Head.  ''Spontaneous combustion occurs when all the elements are right,'' he said.  The brand has gotten some advertising, like the billboard that says, ''The first great international beer brewed in America.'' And then there is the themeline, ''The world belongs to you.'' **********The agency is Watts Wall & Associates, New Orleans, through which the Kayes spent about $50,000 for initial advertising - radio beginning in mid-April and running through Memorial Day, and billboards up for the month of May. **********Mr. Kaye also said that he believes that a wholesaler can motivate retailers to recommend a brew to consumers. He seems also to believe that anyone can sell well at a low price because that is what he has been doing in his own territory. Coy is in sixth place after Schlitz and Dixie, fourth and fifth best sellers in New Orleans. But it is ahead of Heienken, Pabst and Old Milwaukee. **********All the beer is coming from Pearl Brewing and is moving through wholesalers in Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, where the advertising programs are co-op and where, unlike New Orleans, the brand is generally selling at premium prices. Young Mr.  Kaye is talking to other brewers to line up manufacturing and distribution in the rest of the country. **********''The brewers love the idea,'' he said, ''and the wholesalers want a number of products so that they can hedge their bets.''

Plastic was just right for that. **********''People thought it was a joke, making an oval mirror,'' he said, ''but it went over like the Hula-Hoop.'' **********In three years, sales went to a million dollars from $300,000 on that item alone. The oval door mirror, Marsel's bread-and-butter product, now retails for about $12. **********Oval mirrors are only one of 180 mirror products Marsel makes now.  In recent years it has outgrown the space it occupies in a handful of multilevel industrial buildings at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where it has a tenant for 10 years. So two years ago Marsel began what has been a periodic undertaking since it came into being in the back of a knitting store on South Fifth Street hard by the Williamsburg Bridge. It began to look elsewhere. **********One by one the company rejected, among other possibilities, the College Point Industrial Park, the former Rheingold brewery and the former Brooklyn Army Terminal. New construction was deemed too timeconsuming. The Army Terminal property, which the Koch administration hopes to see rehabilitated as industrial space, Mr.  Barlow described as unacceptable because of low ceilings and not enough clear space between support columns on the floors. ''The basic structure is unsound for industry,'' he said. **********Eventually he chose an eight-year-old building at 101-01 Foster Avenue in the Flatlands Industrial Park, which the Board of Education's central repair shop had occupied on a lease. In a contraction of its repair operation, the ''shop'' was moving from the immense two-level building. It has 320,000 square feet of clear space on two floors. **********Marsel signed a 12-year lease at about $2.50 a square foot last September with the Rentar Development Corporation, the developer of the Flatlands Industrial Park, and is refitting the interior itself.  Production operations are gradually moving in. The move is to be completed next month. George Sachs of the State Commerce Department coordinated the relocation. The lease arrangements were handled by R.B. Miller Realty and J.B. Greiner Realty. **********Marsel Mirror is the kind of company that officials strive to hold in the city, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. It is laborintensive. Of the 600 employees, 500 are production workers who are unskilled when they start. Soon, they are spraying or wiping paint onto frames, or affixing plastic framing on glass, or air-gunning fittings onto mirrors for hanging. Of the 500 workers, about half earn under $10,000 a year. **********The products are hand-assembled. ''It's very hard to automate this,'' said Jack Feldman, the plant manager, as gloved employees wrapped the pliable plastic frames around mirrors. **********About 60 percent of the workers live within a mile of the plant.  The availability of this labor pool is a big factor keeping Marsel in Brooklyn, Mr. Barlow said. The subway stops almost across the street from the new plant, but also there is more parking space there. A larger number of workers are expected to drive to work. **********In the new location, Mr. Barlow expects to expand to about a thousand employees within two years.  At the Navy Yard, Richard J. Aneiro, president of the Commerce Labor Industry Corporation of Kings, known as Click, which manages the yard for the city, said that 100,000 square feet of the Marsel space had already been leased by the expanding Cumberland Packing Corporation, makers of Sweet 'n Low, a big Navy Yard tenant. A company from Manhattan is taking 60,000 square feet. **********Rents at the yard range from about $1.50 to $2.50 a square foot, with separate billing for steam. The Navy Yard has 4.3 million square feet of industrial space in addition to its drydocks and piers. **********In the Flatlands, Rentar built 12 buildings with about two million square feet of industrial space in the 1968-72 period on 96 acres of urban renewal land leased from the city. But now it is negotiating to turn back the five remaining sites to the city, which is doing its own industrial development on city-owned land through the Public Development Corporation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/24/business/apogee-enterprises-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-may-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "APOGEE ENTERPRISES INC reports earnings for Qtr to May 30", "print_headline": "APOGEE ENTERPRISES INC reports earnings for Qtr to May 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/21/business/gaf-head-steps-down-after-10-months-in-post.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1981-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 434, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GAF HEAD STEPS DOWN AFTER 10 MONTHS IN POST", "print_headline": "GAF HEAD STEPS DOWN AFTER 10 MONTHS IN POST", "body_text": " **********The GAF Corporation announced yesterday that Jay R.

Meanwhile, he will dismantle the cumbersome administrative machinethat had been set up by the Carter order. **********The State Department, for example, was to notify foreign Governments of all American regulatory actions on substances to be exported. Products deemed ''extremely hazardous'' were to be placed on the State Department's commodity control list. The Commerce Department was to grant an export license only if the importing country, when fully informed, had no objection to the product. **********Industry attacked the order as an unnecessary hindrance to exports. It will ''insure that sales go to foreign firms,'' said Lewis A. Engman, president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. **********To Mr. Carter, however, it was an act of benevolent self-interest - showing other countries that ''they can trust goods bearing the label 'Made In U.S.A.' '' **********Reagan aides had tried to get the Carter White House to delay the controversial order, which had been two and a half years and five drafts in the making. **********But Mr. Carter's consumer affairs assistant, Esther Peterson, prevailed against the Secretary of Commerce, Philip M. Klutznick, who opposed the order, and got the President to act just five days before the Reagan inauguration. **********The order was formulated after controversies over the export of children's sleepwear treated with Tris, a flame retardant, and of Leptophos, a pesticide. **********Tris-treated garments are banned in the United States because the substance is suspected as a carcinogen The pesticide, also banned here, was linked to the death of domestic animals in Egypt. Other pesticides as well as some drugs, aerosol sprays and X-ray equipment are also banned here but sold abroad. Enterprise Zones **********Up to 10 years of tax relief for companies that set up shop in such economically depressed urban areas as the South Bronx or Watts in Los Angeles are offered in a new bill just introduced by two members of the House of Representatives from New York. **********The measure, co-sponsored by Representative Jack Kemp, a conservative Republican, and Representative Robert Garcia, a liberal Democrat, is being reviewed by a White House task force and could become the centerpiece of the Administration's urban policy.  President Reagan supported the concept of enterprise zones during the election campaign. **********Property taxes would be cut 20 percent in the designated areas.  Business tax rates would drop 15 percent. Social Security payroll taxes on employers and employees would plummet 90 percent for workers under 21 and 50 pecent for those who are older. **********To Representative Kemp, who believes that tax cuts are critical to restoring prosperity, the measure is the ''pragmatic, utilitarian'' answer to urban deterioration, and to Representative Garcia it means ''jobs, jobs, jobs.'' **********But there's little enthusiasm from urban interest groups who see only the immediately lower tax receipts. In the spirit of the times the bill makes no provision for Federal grants. The National Urban Coalition, which is seeking to redraft the measure, finds the whole thing ''rather unimpressive, notwithstanding the appeal of its broad develoment theme for cities.'' Iran Found Short of Funds **********The International Chamber of Commerce has been taking a hard look at Iran's balance sheet, and according to its Middle East Affairs director, John Sarpa, finds Teheran ''falling considerably short of its revenue needs.'' **********The message being passed on to American companies is to be very cautious about any resumption of trade until the precise method of payment is nailed down. **********''There isn't a company in its right mind that would deal with Iran right now,'' he adds, ''given the revelations of the former hostages and the state of bankruptcy. Last week the Bank Markazi, the Iranian central bank, went from bank to bank in Europe trying to raise $15 million. It finally got the funds, but only after being turned down a number of times. **********Helping to deplete reserves is an $800-million-a-month bill for imported food, which may explain why the country is now so eager to build up its oil production. House Prices Falling **********Don't look now, but your house may be depreciating in value. The National Association of Realtors reports that the median price of an existing home decline in December by $1,300 to $63,000. **********''It's largely because of high mortgage interest rates, which are keeping sales down, encouraging purchases of smaller homes, and causing sellers to ask lower prices for their homes,'' says the association's chief economist, Dr. Jack Carlson. Data Sought on the Prime Rate **********Representative Fernand J. St. Germain, a Rhode Island Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, has just asked the nation's banks to provide his panel with a detailed analysis of how banks arrive at their prime rate. **********Mr. St. Germain wonders how good a gauge of interest rates the prime really is, since, as he notes, at times last year two-thirds of the business loans made by large commercial banks in New York were made at rates below the prime. **********He thinks the misleading nature of the prime is unfair to consumers and small business. ''Perhaps your more sophisticated borrowers are well aware that the prime rate is not the prime rate, but the small business and the consumer are none the wiser,'' he wrote in a letter to chief executives of the 10 leading banks.

On Tuesday these four producers vowed to hold their prices at $40 to $41 a barrel even though their oil is almost identical to the North Sea's low-sulfur crude. **********The Norwegian company, Statoil, said yesterday that its 10 percent cut would drop the average price of its North Sea crude to just below $36 a barrel, from $40 a barrel. The new price is retroactive to June 20. **********On June 15 the British National Oil Company lowered the price of its most plentiful grade of North Sea crude by $4.25 a barrel, to $35. 'A Major Departure' in Pricing **********Norway produces about 510,000 barrels of oil a day in the North Sea. Most of Britain's daily output of 1.8 million barrels of oil comes from the North Sea. **********''The Norwegian and British reductions signify a major departure in world oil pricing,'' said Charles A. Mink, manager of worldwide crude supplies for the Phillips Petroleum Company, a large North Sea producer. ''This time instead of following the lead of the Africans, Norway and Britain have recognized the significant changes in the market and have decided to base their prices on the $32-a-barrel rate charged by Saudi Arabia instead.'' **********Oil economists say the differential between Saudi light crude and the oil from Africa and the North Sea should normally be about $3 to $4 a barrel. The African and North Sea oil is regarded as worth more because of its proximity to the marketplace, low sulfur content and dependability of supply. During the oil shortages of the late 1970's, however, the differential grew to nearly $10 a barrel. **********It was partly to force the African producers to restore the traditional differential that Saudi Arabia, with its production of 10.3 million barrels a day, has been helping to create a worldwide oil glut of 2 million to 3 million barrels a day in excess of consumption. Impact on Demand Analyzed **********''If the African OPEC countries do not lower their prices,'' said Barry Good, oil analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company, ''they are not going to have any demand. If they do come down, they are going to put tremendous pressure on the middle-level OPEC producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Iraq to lower their prices accordingly to stay competitive. It is at that point the Saudis should be able to dictate the unified price they want.'' **********Mr. Good said the Norwegian move would make it much more difficult for Mexico to raise the price of its crude oil, as it has threatened to do. **********Only three weeks ago Mexico reduced its oil price by $4 a barrel, to $30.60, to hold onto its share of shrinking world oil demand. The director general of Mexico's state-run oil enterprise, Petroleos Mexicanos, was forced to resign in the political furor raised by the price cut. Since then Mexican officials have said they want to bring the price back to, or near, its former level. **********United Press International reported from Mexico City yesterday that Mexico was considering raising its prices and reducing its petroleum production to help counteract the worldwide glut of oil. Cutback in Exports Hinted **********Quoting sources close to Pemex, as the state oil enterprise is generally known, the news agency said Mexico was weighing a cutback of 15 to 20 percent in its exports of 1.5 million barrels a day.  Roughly half of Mexico's oil exports go to the United States. **********Mexico was also reportedly studying the possibility of raising its prices as much as 20 percent.  A Pemex spokesman, Miguel Tomassini, said that ''we cannot confirm or deny'' the reports.  ''The oil companies have been putting the squeeze on all the North Sea producers to lower their prices,'' said Mr. Mink of Phillips Petroleum. ''They argue that they can't buy it for $40 a barrel, put it through their refineries and make money in today's motor fuel market.'' **********The prices oil companies are willing to pay for petroleum produced in the United States continue to decline. The Ohio-based Marathon Oil Company announced yesterday that it was reducing the price it will pay for Wyoming and Montana high-sulfur crude by $1 a barrel, to $33. The day before, Marathon had reduced the price it would pay for low-sulfur crude by $1 a barrel, to $35."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/02/world/american-owned-cars-set-afire-in-west-germany.html": {"writer_name": "John Vinocur", "pub_date": "1981-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 531, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERICAN-OWNED CARS SET AFIRE IN WEST GERMANY", "print_headline": "AMERICAN-OWNED CARS SET AFIRE IN WEST GERMANY", "body_text": " **********Arsonists destroyed automobiles belonging to United States military personnel and set an office building afire today in incidents that West German investigators said had a clearly anti-American character. **********The burning of seven cars at an Air Force housing unit in Wiesbaden, and the partial gutting of facilities of the Social Democratic Party in Frankfurt, accompanied by the painting of anti-American slogans, followed a major explosion yesterday at Ramstein Air Base, the American Central European Air Force headquarters near Kaiserlautern. **********Twenty people were injured in the explosion yesterday, which the police said appeared to have been caused by a bomb, although the Air Force continued to maintain that the cause was undetermined.

The economy posted declines in personal income and housing construction, two components that ordinarily generate demand for textiles, and those declines could have hurt sales severely. **********But sales of products ranging from pillowcases to bath and kitchen accesories rose between 5 and 6 percent, to nearly $9 billion.  However, as participants in the recently completed Bath, Bed and Linen Show at the New York Coliseum were quick to point out, the industry has been regrouping to combat negative economic developments and redefine a mature domestic market. Thus far, the transformation has been successful: Since 1975, retail sales of home textile products have risen nearly 180 percent. **********Manufacturers and retailers now emphasize fashion, not utility.  ''We have to give the consumer a reason to buy these products,'' says Janet Morgan, managing editor of the Home Textiles Section of Home Furnishings Daily. ''Our stuff doesn't wear out very fast, which cuts into the replacement market, and the industry is extremely price-competitive.'' As a result, she adds, ''more and more manufacturers are adopting a concept selling approach, where the consumer is shown a package of color coordinated articles for the bath, bedroom or kitchen.'' **********A burgeoning home improvement market and rising interest in foreign sales are also important. According to Donald H. Roberts, executive director of the National Bath, Bed and Linen Association, consumers spent nearly $45 billion on remodeling and home additions last year, up 75 percent from 1975."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/26/world/france-s-president-facing-9-opponents-in-today-s-election.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Eder", "pub_date": "1981-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1215, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FRANCE'S PRESIDENT FACING 9 OPPONENTS IN TODAY'S ELECTION", "print_headline": "FRANCE'S PRESIDENT FACING 9 OPPONENTS IN TODAY'S ELECTION", "body_text": " **********The 10 candidates in France's presidential race were silent today for the first time in weeks as the nation entered the one-day campaign recess that precedes tomorrow's round of voting. **********The balloting, for which 36 million citizens are registered, will be the first of a two-part election to choose a president for the next seven years. The two candidates drawing the most votes will qualify for the runoff on May 10; the other eight will be eliminated. **********There are no firm indications about the results, either for tomorrow's preliminary or for the runoff two weeks later. By law, no polls have been made public in the last week, and the polls published a week ago gave no clear leads. **********Giscard Expected to Lead **********The general expectation is that the vote will be close and that President Valery Giscard d'Estaing will probably face Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist candidate in a runoff election on May 10. **********However, Jacques Chirac, the Mayor of Paris and the candidate of the Gaullists, is believed to have advanced dramatically in recent weeks, drawing the votes of conservatives who are fed up with Mr.  Giscard d'Estaing but do not want a Socialist president. There was a flurry of rumors a few days ago that Mr. Chirac would outpoll Mr.  Mitterrand, though this now seems unlikely. **********Such an upset, if it occurred, would pit the two conservative candidates against each other in the final round and would leave the half of France that normally votes for the left without a candidate. Importance of Communist Vote **********The fourth important contender is Georges Marchais, leader of the Communists. The most recent polls put him in third or fourth place, slightly ahead of or behind Mr. Chirac. Mr. Marchais is given no chance to win, but the size of his vote will be important. A decline of much more than 20 percent would mark an important decline for the French Communist Party and might produce a change in its leadership and tactics. **********Mr. Marchais has conducted a vigorous and lively campaign, however, and he seems to have bounced back after earlier signs that he was in trouble. **********It has been a quiet campaign by French standards, producing more irritability than passion. Only a handful of the thousands of teams that glue posters onto walls, trees and public toilets - and onto rival posters - have been beaten or shot at. Swiss Tourist Killed in Blast **********A bomb was set off at a Corsican airport when Mr. Giscard d'Estaing landed there, and a Swiss tourist was killed, but it was not thought to have anything to do with the campaign except for subsequent charges that the President was using it to get a sympathy vote. **********In addition, the financial markets have been quiet.  By all indications, the voters feel less strongly about their choice than at any time in 20 years, yet the turnout is expected to reach the usual level of about 85 percent. Whatever happens, the French do vote. Expressing an opinion is of the utmost importance in this country, even when people do not have one. **********None of the issues proposed by the candidates seem to have seized the public imagination. All the candidates are offering to do something about the 1.6 million unemployed. Mr. Mitterrand proposes to create 200,000 public-service jobs; Mr. Chirac proposes to stimulate the economy; Mr. Giscard d'Estaing is holding to a modulated version of austerity in hopes that the economy will pick up. **********Mr. Mitterrand's program includes the nationalization of private banks and some of the large industrial companies, but he has not been stressing it in his campaign. On foreign policy, although the candidates have been swiping at each other, there is not much variation from the traditional French position: go with the West, and take time out for side trips. Skepticism About the Future **********Certainly, polls and interviews show little public awareness of the particulars of each candidate's program. They find, on the other hand, considerable skepticism that things will look up much, either in France or the rest of the world, no matter who wins. **********And yet, in a relatively low-key fashion, the campaigns have addressed the traditional French tendency to polarize into right and left at election time. The voting will show whether the messages have been received, but with the end of the first round of campaigning, two basic themes had emerged. **********The nine candidates seeking to unseat Mr. Giscard d'Estaing have stressed the need for change. Mr. Chirac attacks the President for growing stale, for lacking vitality and for being out of touch with the mood of the country. He offers himself as a fresher replacement, telling the voters that by supporting him they can have change without the dangers of Socialism. Same Governors for 20 Years **********Mr. Mitterrand's principal theme is not so much the policy changes he has proposed as the need to provide alternation in a democracy.  His point, and it is a popular one, is that the same political clan - the Gaullists and their divided heirs - have held power for more than 20 years. The processes of government, he charges, have become stratified and corrupt because of this continuity in power. **********Mr. Giscard d'Estaing has defended his record vigorously, and he does have things to defend. Even Le Monde, which opposes him bitterly, noted several achievements in a front-page editorial this week. He has regularly been telling his audiences that during his first seven years in office he built the foundations of French prosperity. Now he would like another seven years ''to construct the upper floors.'' **********But increasingly, and this theme will undoubtedly dominate the runoff campaign if he faces Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing has been playing on most Frenchmen's distrust of the Communist Party. He argues that Mr. Mitterrand can only win the runoff with the support of the Communists and that such support will make him dependent on them. Difficult to Reject Argument **********The Socialists, who are bitter rivals of the Communists, reject the argument. But since it is true that they would need the votes of Communists in the second round, they find it difficult to reject in full cry. Mr. Mitterrand asserts that if he is elected it is because the nation endorses his democratic version of Socialism and that such support will allow him to build a democratic majority for change in the elections he would call for the National Assembly. **********Underneath the programs and proposals, the rhetoric and debate, the French are trying to sort out conflicting feelings. There is a desire for change. There is also a concern about its dangers, and the question of whether Mr. Mitterrand or Mr. Chirac can be trusted with it. **********Today's Le Monde carried a cartoon that summed it all up.  Marianne, the symbol of France, stands with a ball and chain fastened to one leg, a hacksaw held hesitantly in one hand, and a look of bafflement on her face.

Since January the Japanese have also offered to resume economic aid to South Korea, and last week Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ito went to Seoul in an effort to improve relations. **********Tamio Amau, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that ''whether we like it or not,'' there had been a difficult atmosphere in relations with Seoul in the last few months, but he said the difficulties had been ''at least somewhat smoothed out by Mr. Ito's visit.'' **********The improvement is likely to be welcomed by the Reagan Administration, officials said, as evidence of timely Japanese support for the newly established regime of President Chun Doo Hwan. Case of Dissident Hurt Relations **********Japanese relations with Seoul were strained because of the death sentence given to the South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae Jung by a military court last year. President Chun's commutation of Mr.  Kin's sentence to life imprisonment in January was followed by the lifting of a temporary suspension of $92 million in Japanese economic aid to South Korea. **********Foreign Minister Ito represented Japan in Seoul last week at the inauguration of President Chun for a seven-year term.

A Syrian MIG-25 was shot down, the Israeli military command reported. **********A claim by the Syrians that they downed an Israeli plane was denied by a military spokesman in Jerusalem.  It was the first serious clash since a cease-fire in Lebanon took effect last Friday. Palestinian forces have carried out scattered rocket attacks on Lebanese Christian villages along the Israeli border, but Israel has not returned the fire. The region remained quiet today. **********The air battle came a day after Syria contended that the terms of the cease-fire barred Israeli flights of any kind over Lebanon, reconnaissance or otherwise. Israeli officials had made clear, in agreeing to the truce, that reconnaissance flights would continue. **********''We have to carry out the overflights,'' Prime Minister Menachem Begin said today, ''to know what is going on and to find out where there are the P.L.O.'s bases so we can attack them without hurting the civilian population.''

Buildup **********Israel has said that it would not tolerate the P.L.O.'s use of the cease-fire to build up its military presence in southern Lebanon, from which northern Israeli towns were shelled in the weeks preceding the truce. **********Mr. Begin mocked a Syrian threat, broadcast yesterday on the Damascus radio, to shoot down Israel's reconnaissance planes.  ''If a Syrian representative says so,'' the Prime Minister declared, ''I will say to him: 'It is easier said than done, because today we have shot down a MIG-25.' '' **********He was applauded by his audience at the Fifth International Conference of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists.  The MIG-25 is one of the Soviet Union's top interceptors, capable of flying up to three times the speed of sound and reaching an altitude of 80,000 feet. **********Since April 1979, a military spokesman said, Israel has shot down 15 Syrian planes over Lebanon, including the MIG-25 downed today. The Israelis say they have not lost any piloted aircraft, although several unmanned reconnaisaance aircraft have been downed over Lebanon. Sensitivity on Beirut Raid **********Mr. Begin's reference to civilians and the Palestine Liberation Organization reflected a growing sensitivity here to international condemnation of the July 17 air attack by Israel on a heavily populated quarter of Beirut. Mr. Begin announced at the time that P.L.O. installations would no longer be spared even if they were in civilian areas. **********Today, however, he stressed Israel's commitment to minimizing civilian casualties and he tried to draw a distinction between attacking Beirut and attacking P.L.O. headquarters that happened to be in Beirut. **********''We did not attack Beirut,'' he said. ''We attacked the command and headquarters of the P.L.O. terrorist organization which gives an oath that this country is going to be destroyed, that this people is going to be destroyed. Never again will Jewish blood be shed with impunity.'' Israel Makes Gesture to U.S. **********Israel appears interested in maintaining the fragile truce to demonstrate its good will to the United States, where angry reaction to the Beirut bombing caused further delay in suspended shipments of 10 F-16 fighter-bombers. Washington's resumption of deliveries is expected to hinge partly on a restoration of calm in the border region. **********David Kimche, director general of the Foreign Ministry, said in a radio interview today that accepting the cease-fire had been a ''difficult decision.'' **********''For us, the obvious thing would have been to have carried on an really once and for all, to have finished off this problem. And we didn't. We stopped, we agreed, because we took the United States interests into consideration. This is understood, and I do believe that this will lead to an improvement in relations.'' **********However, Mr. Kimche's assertion that continued air strikes could have finished off the problem ''once and for all'' was not bolstered by any military evidence, and military sources said they had no such impression. **********Mr. Kimche also said that the P.L.O. had begun to move equipment into the area since the cease-fire, but military officers said they were unable to confirm this. **********Despite occasional Syrian attempts to intercept Israeli aircraft, the Israelis say, there has been no movement of Syrian antiaircraft missiles, which were deployed last April in the Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon, toward P.L.O. bases or Beirut. **********Palestinians and Lebanese leftists, who have asked that Syrian missiles be emplaced around Beirut, have been told that Syria has too few batteries to do this, according to reports from Beirut, but that it would assist the shipment of weapons from other Arab countries into Lebanon."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/23/world/reagan-war-over-words-news-analysis.html": {"writer_name": "Hedrick Smith", "pub_date": "1981-10-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 884, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "News Analysis", "print_headline": "REAGAN WAR OVER WORDS; News Analysis", "body_text": " **********The dispute in Western Europe over President Reagan's comments about the possibility of a battlefield nuclear exchange reflects no basic differences over nuclear strategy but rather the acute state of political nervousness in the Atlantic alliance. The President's remarks did not signal any shift in either American policy or the doctrine of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. **********But West European diplomats explain, and privately American officials concur, that the European press fastened on Mr. Reagan's comments because many Europeans are deeply uncertain about the general direction of the Reagan Administration's policies and they do not share Washington's sense of peril about a Soviet attack in the mid-1980's. **********''From Europe, Reagan looks to be extremely aggressive, more than in Washington,'' said a veteran European diplomat just back from a trip to the Continent. ''The other day he touched a sensitive European nerve on the nuclear issue and he seemed to reinforce his image as a tough guy. And that caused trouble.'' **********''The problem in Europe,'' added an experienced American official, ''is that we're dealing with a postwar generation which thinks detente was good for them, that the Soviet threat can be contained and the real danger now comes from Reagan and these gung-ho guys in Washington. They don't believe we're serious about disarmament and arms control. They're nervous and this Administration has not done a whole lot to reassure Europeans on this score.'' Leftward Pull in Europe **********According to this view, Europe is being pulled to the left politically at a time when the United States has taken a more conservative turn. Specialists here point to Socialist victories in France and Greece, with the new Greek leader, Andreas Papandreou, talking of pulling his country out of NATO and removing American military bases. **********In Britain, the left wing of the Labor Party also favors withdrawal from NATO and disarmament. In West Germany, the Netherlands and other northern European countries, the growing neutralist movement has been pressing those Governments to forswear plans to deploy a new generation of tactical nuclear missiles like the Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in Europe in 1983 to offset 250 or more Soviet SS-20 missiles in Eastern Europe. **********It is pressures like these that caused NATO defense officials, meeting in Scotland yesterday, to override the objections of Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger and approve what is known as ''the zero-level option'' - that is, scrapping plans to deploy those American missiles if the Russians withdraw their SS-20's from Eastern Europe. **********Because the Russians are expected to refuse any such pullback, practically no one here considers the ''zero-level option'' very practical. But it is taken as a measure of the need West European governments feel to appease the sentiment for arms control in their own countries. Wishes of the People Involved **********As Hans van Mierlo, the acting Dutch Defense Minister, was quoted as saying yesterday: ''We see ourselves as suppliers of security, but we often forget that we are supposed to respond to the wishes of the people. It's important that the Europeans see that we are striving for their goal. Then if that goal is not reached, it won't be because we didn't try.'' **********But European attitudes are complex and pose a problem for American administrations. Such European leaders as Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany want American protection and have asked for American tactical nuclear weapons to be stationed on their soil, but they are then confronted with a public opinion that dislikes the risks entailed. **********Plans for the deployment of Pershing 2 and cruise missiles have brought about acute political anxieties in Europe, as Mr. Schmidt himself explained, because people in crowded regions of Central Europe fear that this will increase the Soviet tendency to target their homeland. ''Ask more Europeans if they support NATO and they say yes,'' said an American official. ''But ask them if they want NATO missiles in the next neighborhood, and they get very, very nervous.'' **********The problem is compounded because now, as for nearly two decades, many Europeans have been fearful that Washington would answer a Soviet attack in Europe with tactical weapons rather than turning quickly to all-out nuclear retaliation with strategic forces based in the United States. For nearly 20 years the NATO doctrine of a flexible response has been to try to deter attack, meet it at the lowest level, and then proceed to global war. **********But there has been a persistent European fear that Europe would have to bear the brunt of a nuclear war while the United States was spared. It is this ''European nuclear allergy,'' as American officials term it, that President Reagan set off last weekend. **********Against a backdrop of political unease about Mr. Reagan, resentment of high American interest rates and worry about the prospects for arms control, his comments were a flashpoint. ''Technically, the President really didn't say anything new,'' said one official. ''But the problem is that anything we say on this issue now is a problem for the Europeans. So once again, this Government has shot itself in the foot and had to scurry around to try to cure the wound.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/23/business/reagan-names-gold-role-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 262, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reagan Names Gold-Role Unit", "print_headline": "Reagan Names Gold-Role Unit", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration has named a ''gold commission'' made up of 17 men - most of them Government officials - who are to begin meeting soon ''to assess the role of gold in the domestic and international monetary systems,'' Treasury Department officials said today. **********A department statement said the commission, headed by Treasury Secretary Donald T.

Texas International already owns 52 percent of Phoenix and is offering half a share of its stock for each Phoenix share still in public hands. **********An earlier share-for-share exchange plan between the two oil and gas exploration and production companies was withdrawn last January, about a week before Texas International announced a wildcat discovery in the Eloi Bay off Louisiana. **********Texas International has justified the revision of the terms on the ground that the new find doubled the company's value. But some minority stockholders are skeptical and the reserves are as yet unproven. **********The scaled-down offer for Phoenix was presented to that company's board a week ago. Now several Wall Street sources and a former director argue that Texas International is using its control position to acquire Phoenix at a bargain price. **********Last week's offer is in lieu of Phoenix's liquidation. Phoenix employed Morgan Stanley & Company to arrange a buyout but the investment banker has been unable to obtain an offer acceptable to the Phoenix board. Texas International, which needs capital, had hoped to use its share of Phoenix's liquidation proceeds to finance the development of a number of promising oil and gas properties, including Eloi Bay. **********Phoenix's $30 million annual cash flow apparently is not enough to develop the company's own 700,000 acres of oil and gas properties in the United States, Canada and abroad. Phoenix's proven reserves comprise 6.2 million barrels of oil and 162 billion cubic feet of natural gas. **********Wall Street critics argue that Texas International is moving too easily from one side to the other in efforts to consolidate its interest in Phoenix. Last week, for example, Morgan Stanley was hired to defend Texas International in case an unfriendly takeover bid should materialize - an unusual arrangement in view of the fact that the investment banker is serving Phoenix in its ongoing liquidation program. **********Moreover, three members of the Phoenix boardwork for Texas International while another is an employee of the controlled company. Arthur Lipper 3d was the fifth member of Phoenix's fivemember board until he resigned following the announcement of the new merger proposal. **********In a telephone interview Mr. Lipper said that ''Texas International has a meaningful burden of fiduciary responsibility to Phoenix minority shareholders which is yet to be understood or accepted'' by it. **********One close observer of the takeover scene commented that, once a company owns a controlling interest in another company, it does owe a fiduciary obligation to the minority holders. There would be no such duty if the pre-existing management of the controlled company agreed in advance to a two-step takeover, as happened in Du Pont's takeover of Conoco. But when a company first obtains a controlling interest and then negotiates for the balance, questions of fairness are often raised. **********As for the offer itself, Mr. Lipper said: ''I would be surprised if an investment banker could find the present proposal to be fair. To do so would, in my opinion, require a finding that Texas International was selling at a price of less than half of what its market value should be.'' **********Texas International closed on Friday at 39 3/8, off 3/4. Phoenix Resources, which traded on the over-the-counter market as high as 44 1/2 shortly after announcing promising results from an Arctic oil discovery in midyear, closed on Friday at 18 3/4 bid. The last quotation before the exchange offer was announced was 25 bid, on Dec. 4. **********Ward Holliday, the senior vice president of Texas International, reached at the company's Oklahoma City headquarters, was asked about Mr. Lipper's comments. **********He said: ''It is our view that as directors we have an obligation to treat all shareholders fairly. We believe that we have done so in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Texas International has made what we believe to be a fair offer and the Phoenix board has taken the offer under consideration and has employed Morgan Stanley to advise it on the fairness of that offer. I don't believe that Texas International nor the Phoenix board members who are employed by Texas International would have further comment.'' **********Mr. Holliday did not see a conflict of interest in Morgan Stanley advising Phoenix as to the fairness of the Texas International offer on the one hand and counseling Texas International with regard to potential takeover bids on the other. **********Asked about any potential conflict, Fabianne Gershon, a Morgan Stanley vice president and spokesman, said, ''No comment.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/14/world/us-panel-says-indochina-refugees-may-increase.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1981-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 714, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. PANEL SAYS INDOCHINA REFUGEES MAY INCREASE", "print_headline": "U.S. PANEL SAYS INDOCHINA REFUGEES MAY INCREASE", "body_text": " **********The United States must be prepared for continuing and possibly increased flows of refugees from Indochina, particularly Vietnam, according to a State Department report released today. **********In the report to Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., a fourmember panel that has just completed a 25-day tour of Southeast Asia endorsed the general direction of United States refugee policy, saying that most of the Vietnamese ''boat people'' were legitimate political refugees. **********But the report said many of the people from Cambodia and Laos, especially the lowland Lao, appeared to be fleeing for economic reasons, to improve their basic living conditions, rather than from a fear of persecution. **********The panel, headed by Marshall Green, former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, foresaw ''a long-term continuation of the exodus of boat people from Vietnam'' and ''the potential for increased land refugee flows from Laos and Cambodia, in view of worsening conditions of life and the threat of widening hostilities.'' **********The State Department commissioned the study in part because of a widespread belief that those trying to leave Indochina today were much different from those who fled five years ago. **********In addition, there is a growing debate over the wisdom of maintaining refugee programs at current levels while the United States cuts back on domestic social programs. In Congress, Senator Walter D. Huddleston, Democrat of Kentucky, has charged that ''the great majority of those claiming to be political refugees are, in reality, economic refugees'' and that the State Department was recruiting refugees to fill unused quotas set by Congress. **********The panel rejected such allegations, but it warned the Administration not to ''stretch the concept of refugee beyond its proper boundaries, lest the term itself be debased.'' Lists 'Worrisome Aspects' **********There were several ''worrisome aspects of our Indochinese resettlement program'' listed in the report: **********- Charges that an increasingly large proportion of the refugees are motivated primarily by such factors as economic betterment rather than by persecution. **********- The fact that more and more of the refugees have neither immediate family connections in the United States nor ties dating from the period of American involvement in Indochina. **********- Charges that there is a growing tendency among refugees to exploit the welfare system and complaints about the high costs of resettling refugees. **********- The fact that as other countries resettle fewer refugees, the United States is absorbing an increasingly large proportion of them.  Since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, the panel said, 1.4 million refugees have come by boat and by land from Vietnam and across Thailand's borders from Cambodia and Laos. About 1,060,000 Indochinese refugees have been resettled outside Southeast Asia since 1975. Of that number, 504,000 have come to the United States, according to the report. **********''The Vietnamese constitute the hard core of the long-range refugee problem,'' the panel said. The flow of Vietnamese boat people continues at the rate of 8,400 a month, an increase of one-third over last year, while the flow of Lao and Hmong refugees has decreased significantly, the panel said. **********There could be an upsurge of refugees at any time because of the continuing turmoil in Indochina, the panel said. Definition of Term Cited **********''All of those who fled their homeland are generically referred to as 'refugees,' '' the panel said. ''In the strict sense of the term, however, it appears that some number of them, difficult to ascertain with accuracy, may not qualify as a 'refugee' within the meaning of that term.'' **********Under the United Nations definition accepted by the United States, a refugee is a person who is unable to return to his or her homeland because of a ''well-founded fear of persecution'' because of race, religion, nationality or political beliefs. **********The panel found it ''disturbing that some refugees in Southeast Asian camps are fully aware of the United States welfare program.''

Botha and Defense Minister Magnus Malan. **********South Africa's readiness to negotiate seriously on the constitutional questions, after months of insisting that thorny procedural issues involving the role of the United Nations had to be resolved first, represented a gain for the Reagan Administration, the main sponsor of the revived initiative. But the intentions of Prime Minister P.W. Botha in the many-sided negotiations remain as much of a riddle as ever, in part because of the political risk he would run if he decided to push through with a settlement that would be seen on all sides as a significant white retreat. **********Enormous Turnout of Whites **********The possibility of a white backlash here and in South Africa was shown last night in the turnout of more than 1,000 whites - an enormous crowd for Windhoek, where the white population is only 30,000 - for a rally at which Prime Minister Botha was accused of betrayal for even considering the Western proposals. **********The rally was sponsored by the Herstigte Nasionale Party, the only party in the territory, which is now said to have a plethora of 46 parties and would-be parties, to register an outright rejection of the proposals. Speakers including Jaap Marais, the party's leader in South Africa, called for resistance to a United Nations force if it finally arrives here next year to carry out the Western plan. **********The diplomatic exercise that will take place here tomorrow and the next day, when the Western representatives meet local political leaders, seems designed to allay the fears of minority ethnic groups and parties that the South-West Africa People's Organization, an insurgent movement that has kept up a low-level guerrilla war on the country's northern border, might be able to achieve an unquestioned dominance in a pre-independence election. **********But political leaders across the spectrum here all agree that the central question remains the attitude of the South African Government, which appears to have two objectives that are nearly mutually exclusive. These are to avoid charges, such as those made by Mr. Marais last night, that it was ''selling out'' the territory's 100,000 whites, most of whom are Afrikaans-speaking South African citizens; and to avoid, at the same time, any appearance that it was sabotaging the Reagan Administration's effort to redeem its policy of ''constructive engagement'' with South Africa by bringing Namibia to internationally recognized independence. Little Room to Maneuver **********Having argued for years that a victory by the insurgent movement would represent an unacceptable danger, because it would bring Soviet influence to South Africa's borders, Mr. Botha and his colleagues appear to have left themselves little room in which to maneuver if they really mean to take the political risk in order to reap whatever rewards they think they might get from a grateful Administration in Washington. **********Black political leaders here who have been consistently skeptical of South Africa's motives in the protracted negotiations now say they believe Mr. Botha may have embarked on a course that could end in a settlement. So do some whites who have gone along with the diplomatic maneuvering of the last four years in the confident faith that it was all a charade. **********Particular note is taken of an interview with Foreign Minister Botha that was broadcast three times in Namibia last week. In it he said that South Africa had to put its own interests first and that the cost of sustaining the guerrilla war - especially since the economy here is now visibly running down as a result of prolonged uncertainty over the territory's future - might be too great for South Africa to bear. **********''My frank opinion is that they're committed,'' said Jannie de Wet, a leader of the National Party here, the largest of the three white parties and an offshoot of the governing party in South Africa. Nationalists' Reaction in Doubt **********The National Party, which cloaks a demand for segregated schools and hospitals by calling for ''ethnic rights,'' is the one party whose reaction to the Western plan was seriously in doubt this evening. Since it represents a majority of Afrikaaners in the territory, it is also the party whose reaction is most important to South Africa. **********Acceptance of the constitutional plan would not be enough to insure the carrying out of the Western plan, for a mine field of negotiations lies ahead on the issue of how the United Nations might now show itself to be an impartial executor of the independence plan after having declared its support for the insurgents in a series of General Assembly resolutions.

In addition, reports were circulating that Kuwait had increased its price by $4, to $35.50, although buyers had not yet received official word. **********Oil analysts said the developments were ominous because they indicated that Persian Gulf countries had decided to take full advantage of the maximum price increase approved by OPEC, despite widespread expecations these nations would be more moderate. In addition, prices of the big Middle East producers tend to set the tone for oil prices everywhere. Non-OPEC oil exporters such as Mexico, China and Canada have also raised prices in recent weeks, and Britain and Norway are expected to follow suit. **********Effects on Gasoline Prices **********Thus, one major oil company official calculated yesterday, if the Qatari and Kuwaiti actions set a new world price standard, and if the decontrolled prices of domestic United States oil rose accordingly, the price of gasoline could rise as much as 10 cents a gallon. **********Immediately after the OPEC meeting, most analysts predicted gasoline price rises of 4 cents to 7 cents a gallon.  But if the big Persian Gulf producers, particularly Saudi Arabia, decide to match their neighbors' prices even partly, the impact would be considerably greater than these earlier estimates, analysts said. **********Currently, Saudi Arabia is selling its basic crude for $32, more than $5 less than Kuwait and Qatar could receive if they applied the various surcharges that they have in the recent past. **********''There is no question that Saudi Arabia will eventually try to close that gap,'' said John H. Lichtblau, the director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. **********Saudi Arabia sends the United States about 1.3 million barrels of oil a day, about 21 percent of total American imports.  The prices attributed to Qatar and Kuwait startled some observers, because refiners can not currently make a profit on Middle East oil that sells for much over $36, due to softness in the products market. **********The impact of the actions will have a ''profound effect'' particularly in Europe, because refineries there are geared to run on the heavier Middle Eastern crudes, one analyst said. **********Moreover, the moves appear to disrupt earlier efforts by Venezuela, Indonesia and several other producers to keep increases below the sanctioned $4. **********Qatar produces about 500,000 barrels of oil a day, exporting about 35,000 to the United States. Kuwait produces about 1.2 million barrels daily, sending less than 5,000 to the United States. **********Despite the lack of official word from Kuwait, Oil Buyers Guide, a weekly trade journal, said it was certain the Kuwaitis went up by $4. Moreover, some buyers of Kuwaiti crude said they expected to be informed of a $4 increase soon. **********Because of various surcharges, the new prices are higher than they seem at first. Kuwait, for example, has been charging an extra $5.50 for half its oil. Thus, on average, its new price is expected to be about $37.75. This is still below a spot price of about $40, according to industry sources. **********Qatar has been adding as much as $6 a barrel to some of its sales, but analysts were uncertain if and how this would be applied to the new price. **********The speed with which crude price increases work through the system was evident yesterday in separate announcements by the Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Oil Corporation that they were increasing heating oil prices by about 2 cents a gallon.

''The men and boys who fought on this field somehow understood that government must be close to people and responsive to them,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''Today in our country those concepts are threatened by government's bloated size and the distortion of its true functions.'' **********One area of agreement between the two leaders did emerge, however.  At a breakfast meeting with reporters, Mr. Mitterrand said his Government would be willing to contribute troops to a peacekeeping force in Sinai (Page A5.) **********Mr. Reagan and Mr. Mitterrand arrived at the battlefield at about 11 A.M., under heavy security that limited their activities and prevented most of the crowd of 60,000 from seeing them.

The chief executives' view was of the camera stand and of the troops assembled on a grassy ridge several hundred yards away. **********Security agencies had canceled earlier plans for Mr. Reagan and Mr. Mitterrand to review the troops from an open jeep. Instead, soldiers from the United States, France, Great Britain and Germany marched by the speakers' stand, as did hundreds of civilians dressed in the costumes of the soldiers who fought the campaign that insured the success of the Revolution. British troops under Lord Cornwallis surrendered to a combined American-French force here on this date in 1781. **********Personal feelings between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Mitterrand are said to be positive. But private talks yesterday at Williamsburg, the reconstructed colonial village near here, failed to resolve key differences between them. **********At Cancun, Mr. Mitterrand wants to lay specific plans for a world energy system, while Mr. Reagan favors more generalized talks. Also, Mr. Mitterrand's Government is planning arms sales to Libya, over American objections. Finally, Mr. Mitterrand believes the United States should provide more generous foreign aid to poor nations and should encourage movements for social change in those nations. **********For example, he has recognized the leftist insurgents in El Salvador as a legitimate political force, while the Reagan Administration supports the ruling junta there. **********Mr. Mitterrand today raised the subject of social and political change by saying that the American revolutionaries provided an example for the modern world. Remarks by Mitterrand **********''Let us listen together to the voices which come from all continents,'' the French President said in a part of his address.  ''The aspirations of the peoples of the world today are just as legitimate as those of our forefathers,'' he continued, speaking through an interpreter. ''They are loyal to their example and let us understand them, those of us who have the responsibility of governing the places of our countries in these difficult times, and let us act so that their message be heard before it is too late.'' **********Mr. Reagan's remarks were more narrowly focused, dealing mainly with the domestic economy, the military buildup and patriotic themes. Asserting that ''we have come to this field to celebrate the triumph of an idea,'' Mr. Reagan called for a rededication to the original principles of American government that, he said, are now jeopardized. **********''Our people are struggling under a punishing tax burden many times heavier than that which ignited our first rebellion,'' Mr.  Reagan said. ''Regulations that inhibit our growth and prosperity would be incomprehensibke to the colonists who revolted because of the Stamp Act.'' **********''But of equal concern to me,'' Mr. Reagan added, ''is the uncertainty some seem to have about the need for a strong American defense.'' Contending that weakness invites attack, Mr. Reagan said, ''We are rebuilding our defenses so that our sons and daughters need never be sent to war.'' **********Despite their differing emphasis, Mr. Reagan's and Mr. Mitterrand's speeches contained no direct criticisms.

OPEC's indecisiveness thus, in effect, saved American drivers 3 cents or more a gallon, oil analysts calculate. 'Good News for the Consumer' **********''Obviously this is good news for the consumer,'' said John H.  Lichtblau, executive director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. **********If, as expected, some African and Middle Eastern countries that now charge $36 or more unilaterally reduce their crude oil prices, consumers would save more. Several OPEC nations are talking about such price reductions because the worldwide oversupply of oil has made it difficult for them to sell their crude at their current prices. Nigeria, Algeria and Libya, all oil exporters to the United States, charge $40 a barrel. **********The price of regular unleaded gasoline in the United States now averages $1.34 a gallon at self-service stations and $1.41 at fullservice stations. **********The long-range implications of the OPEC meeting may prove considerably more important than any immediate financial savings, according to analysts, academics and company officials interviewed after the oil ministers adjourned yesterday without reaching an agreement. **********Most important, Saudi Arabia proved that it was indisputably the first among equals in OPEC, which has 13 members. Virtually every OPEC member was arrayed against the kingdom, but the Saudis' stubborn resistance to a price increase of more than $2 a barrel prevailed. **********The meeting sought a single base, or benchmark, price from which each member might add premiums or offer discounts, depending on the quality of their oils and their proximity to markets. The Saudis now use a $32 benchmark, while all the other OPEC members use $36. Failure of a Compromise **********Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the Saudi oil minister, said his Government was prepared to raise its benchmark to $34, but the meeting broke up after an unsuccessful attempt to convince Sheik Yamani to increase the Saudi price by another dollar, to $35. **********''Fundamentally, one has to say it is the Saudis, and the Saudis alone, who will determine how things will go in the future,'' said Walter J. Levy, a noted oil economist. Added Theodore R. Eck, chief economist of the Standard Oil Company (Indiana), ''There's only one vote in OPEC that counts.'' **********But the hastily called meeting also provided other insights.  Analysts noted that OPEC had now held six top-level meetings over the past two years without agreeing on a single price for oil, calling into question the organization's effectiveness. In particular, OPEC again demonstrated a glaring inability to lower prices officially despite the weak oil market. Domestic Political Questions **********Analysts suggested that this inflexibility, largely the result of domestic pressures within the producing countries, could severely hamper OPEC's ability to deal with always changing circumstances. **********''We're closer to a breakup of OPEC than at any time since it was formed in 1960,'' said Robert LeVine of E.F. Hutton & Company.  This view was reinforced by a number of oil company officials who said that OPEC was embarrassed by the apparent collapse of an agreement by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Venezuela that was forged in the days before the full ministerial meeting began on Wednesday. **********In particular, they said that Sheik Yamani would not have attended the meeting unless he was fairly sure of a consensus on a $34 benchmark. Prices Have Doubled in 2 Years **********In part, OPEC appears to be at least a temporary victim of its own success. **********Following a doubling in oil prices over the past two years, demand for OPEC oil has fallen by nearly a third, to about 21.5 million barrels a day. **********This has called into question OPEC's evident need to devise an effective system to curtail production in order to raise prices, in effect to divide a smaller pie. This is something it has never been able to accomplish. **********''What this demonstrates is that OPEC has difficulties in coordinating not just prices, but production,'' said Morris A.  Adelman, an energy expert at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology. ''They have to do something about market shares.'' Oversupply Will Continue **********The Geneva stalemate will most likely mean a continuation, and perhaps an expansion, of the abundance of crude oil that has prevailed most of this year. **********Saudi Arabia's announcement yesterday that it would reduce its daily oil production of about 10 million barrels a day by 10 percent, at least for one month, was viewed by analysts as insignificant and by other OPEC countries as sort of a bone that Riyadh had arrogantly deigned to toss them. **********The current weak market for oil has been caused in large part by high Saudi production, which has been running almost two million barrrels daily over its usual level. The oversupply of oil is generally reckoned at just about two million barrels daily, too. **********A top planner for one of the world's largest oil companies suggested that a Saudi cut of at least two million barrels daily would be needed to tighten the market sufficiently to strengthen prices. Nigerian Output May Rise **********The kingdom's reduction in output will be minimal if Nigeria fulfills a widespread expectation that it will soon cut its prices in order to sell more of its oil, which is considered overpriced at $40. Mr. Lichtblau of the research foundation estimated that a 10 percent cut in Saudi exports could increase Nigeria's by 30 percent to 40 percent. **********Such a move, analysts believe, would almost certainly be followed by Algeria and perhaps by Libya. Then, several Middle Eastern countries, including perhaps Iran, would be under heavy pressure to cut prices. With falling prices, an insufficient cut in Saudi output and growing production elsewhere, analysts concur, the oversupply would persist with a vengeance. Chronology of Prices **********Following is a chronology of the major pricing decisions taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its individual members over the past three years that have led to the current wide range of OPEC prices. All prices are for 42-gallon barrels. **********Dec. 31, 1978: OPEC announces a four-stage price increase to lift the base price from $12.70 to $14.54 by Oct.1, 1979. **********February 1979: Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Libya and Kuwait raise their prices beyond the planned levels. **********March 27: OPEC members agree to apply immediately the $14.54 price that had not been due until Oct.1. **********March 28: Nigeria announces a $4 surcharge. **********June 28: OPEC votes to raise their minimum price to $18 and to allow a maximum of $23.50. Some free-market prices reach $40. **********October: Kuwait, Libya and Iran raise their prices beyond the planned maximum. **********Dec. 20: OPEC meeting ends without an agreement on uniform prices, with members being allowed to set their own. Subsequent listed prices vary from Saudi Arabia's $24 to Libya's $30. **********May 14, 1980: Saudi Arabia raises its prices to $28. **********June 10: OPEC sets a minimum price of $32 and a maximum price of $37. But Saudi Arabia refuses to budge from $28. **********Sept. 18: At an OPEC meeting, in a partial compromise, Saudi Arabia agrees to raise its price to $30, while other members agree to freeze prices until the end of 1980. **********Dec. 10: After an OPEC meeting, Saudi Arabia increases its base price to $32, while other members use a benchmark of $36. This price, with premiums added, means some members can charge up to $41. **********May 26, 1981: OPEC members meet but are unable to agree on a single price schedule. Saudis keep price at $32, but other members range from $36 to $41. Aug. 21: OPEC fails again to unify prices."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/01/world/israel-jails-arab-as-soviet-spy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 65, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel Jails Arab as Soviet Spy", "print_headline": "Israel Jails Arab as Soviet Spy", "body_text": " **********An Arab physician convicted of spying for the Soviet Union has been sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment by an Israeli court.

Local police switchboards got alarmed calls from otherwise sober Britons reporting the sightings. A bird? A plane? An unidentified flying object? No, a gigantic, illuminated light bulb, emblazoned with the trademark of Osram, a leading British light bulb maker. **********There are among its critics those who allege that advertising involves nothing more substantial than hot air. True or not, one advertising man in Britain is, in effect, building a thriving business on nothing more. **********Colin Prescot is chairman and chief executive of the Hot Air Balloon Company, one that specializes in aiding companies to advertise their goods with balloons that often resemble the products they promote. The company has made 25 balloons in all and currently has a list of 15 clients including, besides Osram, British American Tobacco, Smirnoff vodka and Ricard Pastis, the French beverage. **********Mr. Prescot, a 30-year-old balloon pilot, started the company a little over four years ago on the theory that the hot air balloon, more so even than the the Goodyear blimp, was a promising promotional medium. Last year the privately owned company recorded sales of about $11 million. **********''This was rather inflated by 100,000 ($223,000) we were paid for our stunt work in a major feature film,'' said Mr. Prescot. ''But nontheless we're still hoping for slightly higher sales this year.'' **********Mr. Prescot figured that unlike a page in a magazine or a 30-second spot on the radio, a great big balloon is a difficult object to ignore. **********''We're not trying to tell the public that Brand X baked beans have the best-tasting tomato sauce. We're trying to create an image, a presence, a style,'' explained Mr. Prescot, a banker's son who was educated at Britain's top boys' boarding school, Eton, went on to J.  Walter Thompson and spent seven years in advertising. **********In 1978 an independent media company quantified the value of a balloon campaign through coverage in the press and television at an average of seven times its cost. For example, it was estimated that British American Tobacco's State Express 555's cigarettes had a total of 30 minutes free exposure on television from its balloon campaign, something that is of particular value since television cigarette advertising is banned in Britain. **********Almost invariably, Mr. Prescot and his team work directly with clients, rather than through advertising agencies. Indeed, the agencies tend not to be overwhelmingly enthusiastic about balloons.  ''You do it as part of a promotion and it can never equal the usefulness of the major media,'' said Bill Muirhead, a director of the advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi. **********So, said Mr. Prescot, ''Whenever I have a good idea that I think might interest a specific client, I will approach him and explain about what we do.'' **********One idea was the light bulb. ''With such a boring product,'' Mr.  Prescot said, ''most advertising money will be spent on the trade trying to get your particular brand stocked in the shops. But when our company discovered the technology to make a bulb-shaped balloon and to light it up, we approached Osram.'' **********Another Prescot brainchild was the ''Cloudhopper'', a one-man, basketless, harness balloon. ''Everyone said this wouldn't work. But when we found this new polyester-based, silicone-proofed material that can withstand internal temperatures of up to 200 degrees Centigrade (twice the recommended capability of a normal hot air balloon) it seemed like a possibility,'' he said. **********He approached vodka makers Smirnoff, since their advertising slogan is, ''Well, they said anything could happen.'' The flying machine, which is light enough to be carried by the pilot and allows for approximately one hour's flying time, was developed by a Swedish aeronautical engineer, Per Lindstrand, and made by his company, Colt Balloons Ltd., in Oswestry, as are all Hot Air Balloon products. **********The Smirnoff Cloudhopper was launched from Tower Bridge with Colin Prescot as pilot dressed in a suit and tie with a bowler hat and umbrella. ''This attracted instant media coverage all ove the world,'' Mr. Prescot said. **********Other Prescot products include a balloon shaped like a bottle of Ricard Pastis, another fashioned after British Telecom's merchandising character, Buzby, and another in the blue-flamed shape of Mr. Gas, a figure used by the Gas Board. **********On the other hand, Mr. Prescot said, ''Some companies feel a sophisticated image is better conveyed without using an unusuallyshaped balloon.'' For example Lambert and Butler decided that twin balloons with an integrated livery of Range Rovers and trailers and ground crew uniforms all in silver and black indicated most clearly an impression of style and elegance for their cigarettes. Similarily, a special gold fabric was found for the otherwise conventional balloon that promotes Terry's All-Gold chocolates. **********For an annual operating fee of $15,000 his team supervises the design and construction of the balloon. Each client buys his own balloon and basket, costing from $16,000 to $36,000 and boasting a three-year life for advertising purposes. **********Each time the balloon flies, and most manage about 50 flights a year, it costs the client $580 a day, plus expenses, payable even if bad weather forces cancellation of the flight. **********Most clients spend upwards of $50,000 a year in ballooning, Mr.  Prescot said, ''which is a very small proportion of a normal advertising budget and highly cost-effective.'' **********The weather, and most notably the very seasonal nature of the work, poses staffing problems too. The Hot Air Balloon company has just four full-time employees; the rest, and that includes an additonal 30 in the summer, are paid on a daily rate. **********How do clients feel about the service?  ''We've learned that one cannot build up a whole crowd-gathering promotion solely on the expectation of a balloon going up,'' said Jacques Martin, British representative of Ricard. ''There are too many days when the weather is not good enough, expecially with an unusually shaped balloon such as ours. **********''Secondly, the price structure was intended for companies wanting to fly a balloon periodically, but having a daily rate is clearly a very expensive business if you want to use your balloon every day for six months as we did. We'll have to change that.'' **********'' But,'' he added, ''on balance, we're certainly pleased enough to want to continue doing it again this year.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/04/world/schmidt-s-arms-policy-suffers-severe-setback-at-a-regional-meeting.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 322, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SCHMIDT'S ARMS POLICY SUFFERS SEVERE SETBACK AT A REGIONAL MEETING", "print_headline": "SCHMIDT'S ARMS POLICY SUFFERS SEVERE SETBACK AT A REGIONAL MEETING", "body_text": " **********Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's policy of supporting a 1979 NATO decision to deploy additional nuclear missiles in Western Europe, if arms control talks fail, suffered a serious setback today when a regional conference of Mr. Schmidt's Social Democratic Party voted overwhelmingly for a review of the decision. **********A regional party conference in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg voted to petition that the Social Democratic Party review its commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization decision at a national party conference in early 1982, to see whether the ''official basis'' of the decision still existed or whether a ''revision is necessary.'' **********The conference delegates called for the ''immediate start'' of arms control talks and said that a ''moratorium, limited in time, regarding the stationing of strategic weapons in Europe can be a reasonable part of the talks.'' **********Mr. Schmidt used his influence at a national party conference in West Berlin in 1979 to win support for the NATO decision, despite strong opposition from the left wing of his party.

'Logical Buyers' **********Among the long list of ''logical buyers'' - all described as ''capable of doing something but not necessarily involved'' - were Getty, Phillips, Texaco, Mobil and Allied, all regarded as possible bidders for Cities Service. **********Potential bidders for other oil company included Tenneco, Pennzoil and even General Electric, which already has vast coal and other natural resources interests through its ownership of Utah International. Still other possibilities mentioned were Sohio, through British Petroleum, its majority stockholder; Gulf, Standard Oil of California and Union Oil. **********Even foreign buyers, such as Deminex of West Germany and Petrofina of Belgium, were thought to be interested in picking up an American company. **********Because premature disclosure of actual negotiations would make prices move sharply higher, dozens of normally approachable executives, along with Wall Street lawyers and investment advisers, refused all comment. **********And despite strong market feeling that the $87.50-a-share Du Pont bid for 100 percent of Conoco seemed almost unassailable by competiting bidders, the Seagram Company, which had earlier offered to pay $73 a share for 40 percent, refused yesterday for the second day to disclose what its next move might be. ' **********A Seagram spokesman said late yesterday that ''the situation is still under study.'' Its advisers are Shearson Loeb Rhoades and Lazard Freres. **********One Wall Street analyst who asked not to be identified maintained that if Seagram attempted to ''stay in the game'' for Conoco it would have to raise its price to somewhere around $90 a share and at the same time increase the amount of shares it would to buy from 40 percent to around 51 percent, a step that would increase the cost to Seagram from $2.5 billion to around $4 billion in cash. 'Another $1.5 Billion?' **********''Will Edgar write a check for another $1.5 billion?'' this analyst asked. **********Edgar Bronfman, Seagram's chairman, is widely regarded as ''an unemotional buyer,'' that is, one who buys companies on the basis of underlying values. **********Other Conoco watchers note, however, that the oil company has been valued by independent analysts at substantially more than $100 a share. **********Moreover, Texaco and a secret bidder are also known to have shown serious interest in Conoco.  Conoco disclosed that it had received an all-cash offer for $85 a share from an undentified bidder, and, to clear the air, Texaco said yesterday that it had not made a firm merger offer. This raised the possibility that the secret bidder was Seagram itself or, possibly, some other big oil company. **********As for Cities Service, informed sources said that whichever company or companies emerged as bidders would first have to deal with Nu-West Group Ltd., a Canadian real estate company with oil and gas interests -and some 8 percent of Cities Service stock. **********In such a situation, these sources said, the buyer and Nu-West would decide how much Cities Service's properties in Canada were worth. Then Nu-West would buy enough Cities Service stock so that it could then swap the stock in exchange for the Canadian properties. **********This, the sources explained, would guarantee that the increasingly nationalistic Canadian Government would not raise objections to the takeover of Canadian operations because, under this arrangement, the Canadian holdings would remain with Nu-West.

One reason is that politicians have been barred from any role in the preparatory moves.

'Assembly Without Politicians' **********Turker Alkan, a professor of political science at Ankara University, was openly critical in a recent interview of the military rulers' plan for ''an assembly without politicians'' to prepare a constitution for future politicians. **********Politicians and intellectuals are reported generally agreed, however, that the military takeover last Sept. 12 was necessary to restore security in the country. Since then, most of the activists and supporters of the principal extremist organizations have been arrrested; the others have gone underground or fled abroad. Political killings, which averaged 30 a day before the military takeover, have been reduced to under one a day. **********With its gains against political terrorism, the military leadership has begun drafting rules for a constituent assembly to convene on Oct. 23.

Former Politicians Barred **********The second task of the assembly, from which members of political parties that existed at the time of the military takeover are to be barred, is to prepare laws governing future parties and elections.  These reportedly are to be ready by the spring of 1983, with general elections expected to follow in the fall of that year. **********The great majority of the Turkish people appear to support the five-member National Security Council, headed by Gen. Kenan Evren, because it has largely succeeded in achieving its immediate aims - the restoration of the authority of the state and the virtual ending of the ''political terrorism'' stemming from clashes between extremist groups. Although many people are suffering from austerity measures, they seem inclined to blame past politicians for the economic problems. **********The restrictions introduced over the last year by the junta, however, have tarnished Turkey's relations with its closest partners in Western Europe. **********While the military rulers have stressed from the outset that they remain committed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and their goal of membership in the European Common Market, the Market has discouraged a ny application now. The European Parliament has suspended Tur key's membership, and the European Council threatens itsouster.

This has pushed production costs up, forcing wholesalers and then retailers to raise their prices. **********Ioannis Paleokrassas, the Minister of Economic Coordination, said yesterday that the Government had applied to the Common Market for subsidies for imports of frozen meat as a means of keeping down prices. **********The problem began soon after Greece joined the market on Jan. 1 when meat dealers raised their prices as much as 20 percent. Several wholesalers who were arrested maintained in court that market membership meant that prices should be allowed to find their own levels based on supply and demand. The Government insisted that antiinflationary controls would continue and meat prices not be allowed to rise more than 4 to 5 percent. Butchers Fight for Share **********The Government has sent policemen to force compliance and keep order, while butchers have fought for a share of the dwindling supplies. **********''There are ample supplies of meat available both within Greece and from abroad,'' said Nikos Hajipantazis, one of Greece's largest meat producers and importers, who was among those arrested and charged with price violations. ''But the Government must first allow free competition and the laws of supply and demand to operate, so that prices will find their own natural levels. With present soaring production costs it is impossible to stick to the prices prevailing before community membership.'' **********Retail merchants, however, charge that through political connections Mr. Hajipantazis holds a monopoly on supplies. ''We are killing ourselves at the central market to get some of his meat,'' said Dimitris Koukas, a retail butcher. ''Most of us in Athens have closed down our shops because we have little else but chickens to sell.'' Inflation Upsets Public **********Wholesalers have demanded a Government-approved wholesale price for veal of $4.17 a kilo, or 2.2 pounds, and $2.65 for pork, similar to Common Market levels but in both cases 15 cents more than the Government's last offer. When the producers and importers sharply reduced their supplies last week in an attempt to force compliance, the Government countered by placing large meat orders directly with Common Market producers. **********With elections scheduled for November at the latest, the Government's uphill drive to keep prices down is also political.  Inflation has been running at 26 percent annually and has been a major cause of discontent. New increases in fuel prices are expected to be announced in the next few days, which may further aggravate inflation. A rise in the price of basic foods, however, would be directly linked by the consumer to membership in the Common Market and would play into the hands of the opposition Socialists, who have criticized Greece's entry and consistently warned of a price explosion. **********While Mr. Hajipantazis says acceptance of the wholesaler' demands will not affect retail prices, Government officials say it will mean an increase of up to 32 cents a kilo of meat for the consumer. Mr.  Koukas says the increase will be at least 43 cents and will bring a sharp public reaction since meat prices have already been raised 12 percent since Jan 1."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/06/business/defining-an-estate-tax-limit.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Cowan", "pub_date": "1981-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1417, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEFINING AN ESTATE TAX LIMIT", "print_headline": "DEFINING AN ESTATE TAX LIMIT", "body_text": " **********''By taxing estates heavily at death, the state marks its condemnation of the selfish millionaire's unworth life.'' - Andrew Carnegie, 1889, industrialist, multimillionaire, philanthropist, advocate of estate taxes. **********''Current estate and gift tax law imposes almost impossible burdens on the most productive sector of the economy.'' - Testimony to Congress, 1981, by Robert L. Spence, chairman of the National Committee to Preserve the Family Business. **********WASHINGTON, July 5 - The problem of heeding both Mr. Carnegie and Mr. Spence is before Congress this year as it considers how much to relax the Federal tax on transfers of wealth by inheritance and giftgiving. **********It is a problem of line-drawing. President Theodore Roosevelt recommended to Congress in 1906 a progressive inheritance tax on ''fortunes swollen beyond all healthy limits.'' Then and now, the legislator's task is to define the limit. **********Two weeks ago, after a quarter-hour of debate, the Senate Finance Committee voted, 17-0, to raise the present $175,000 estate tax exemption in stages to $600,000. That was portrayed as a belated - and equitable - adjustment to inflation. A driving element has been the appreciation of farm land values of the 1970's. Some analysts say that rising land prices represent an income to farmers that escapes income tax. Benefit to Spouse **********The committee also voted to permit an unlimited deduction for a surviving spouse, effectively deferring any estate tax during his or her lifetime if the survivor is the sole heir. The present exemption is 50 percent or $250,000, whichever is more. **********''There's going to be a powerful incentive for people to remarry,'' quipped Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine.  If the provisions approved by the Finance Committee are part of the final 1981 tax bill, as seems likely, the number of taxable estates would fall by 90 percent. However, there may be less here than meets the eye. Only 2.8 percent of all persons who die in 1981 will leave a taxable estate, according to Congressional analysts. Those 56,000 taxable estates will owe $7.3 billion of taxes, a lot of money, but only 1.2 percent of all Federal revenue. Fewer Taxable Estates **********The Treasury has estimated that the annual revenue loss would climb from $1.9 billion in the 1983 fiscal year (which will start Oct. 1, 1982) to $4 billion by the 1985 fiscal year. The committee provision would apply to estates of people who die after Dec. 31, 1981, and would reduce the number of taxable estates to 6,500, according to the Treasury. The Finance Committee would make no change in the present estate tax rates, which range from 18 percent to 70 percent on taxable transfers (bequests or gifts) above $5 million. **********Nominally, the committee adopted the Reagan Administration's proposal on estate taxes. But the underlying reality was that the Administration had embraced legislation sponsored by Senators David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, and Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, both members of the Finance Committee. **********Reducing estate taxes fits in with the Administration's preference for tax changes to encourage saving, investment and the accumulation of wealth. In addition, there was a tactical motive - to win the support of conservative Democrats in the battle over taxes that is likely to occur on the floor of the house of Representatives later this month. A Grass-Roots Issue **********To such pro-Reagan Democrats as Representative Kent Hance of Texas and Dan Daniel of Virginia, easing the estate tax is an important grass-roots issue. **********Advocates of lower estate taxes contend that the issue is the preservation of family farms and businesses. A Republican member of the Senate Finance Committee from Minnesota, David Durenberger, said that in his state ''the average farm is $1 million.'' Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, retorted that ''the average farm is 40 acres and a mule when we're talking about wheat subsidy.'' **********Senator Moynihan, himself a champion of lower capital gains taxes, purported to be perplexed by the proposal to ease estate taxes. ''Why are we doing this?'' he asked, tongue in cheek. Two or three such interjections seemed to say that the New York Democrat felt that the legislation had not been persuasively presented. But Senator Moynihan did not vote against the amendment. No Senator did. Nor did any witness oppose it at hearings early in June. **********As seen by liberal Democrats such as Donald C. Lubick, who was the Treasury's assistant secretary for tax policy from 1977 to 1981, the issue is one of preserving a progressive Federal tax system, one in which rates rise with income. ''If the income tax is not hitting large amounts of income, then the estate tax is a back-up to get some progressivity,'' Mr. Lubick said. Further Cuts Seen Likely **********Mr. Lubick said that reduction of the estate tax should be seen in a wider context. He noted that Congress in 1980 reinstituted law that makes it possible to escape capital gains tax by holding an appreciating asset until death. Mr. Lubick also noted that Congress reduced the maximum income tax rate from 91 to 70 percent in 1964 and this year is likely to cut it to 50 percent. **********Jay Angoff of the Tax Reform Research Group asserted that a graduated estate tax promotes democratic equality of opportunity. ''I don't think it's fair for some people to be born into the world rich as Rockefeller and some people with no money,'' he said. **********Senator Wallop argued that ''estate taxes force farmers or familyowned businesses to sell out to large corporations.'' But the Senator's office was unable to offer supporting evidence. Said a Wallop aide, ''I don't really think you'll find hard statistical evidence.'' Farms Sold to Farmers **********As far as anecdotal evidence goes, some long-time observers of farm life say that when a piece of a farm must be sold to pay estate taxes, the buyer is usually a nearby farmer. **********For years, President Reagan has said that he favored repeal of the estate and gift taxes. Considering that position, the Finance Committee Chairman, Senator Robert Dole, Republican of Kansas, said the Administration had taken ''a rather mild approach.'' **********The second-ranking Democrat, Harry F. Byrd Jr. of Virginia, himself an heir to extensive land holdings, said he thought that an approach that left unchanged a maximum estate tax rate of 70 percent did not go far enough, although he applauded the larger exemption. No Revision Since 1976 **********First enacted in 1916, the estate tax was last revised in 1976, the first change since 1942. As several witnesses reminded the committee, the exemption for gift taxes of $3,000 a year to each recipient has been unchanged since 1942 despite inflation. The pending bill would raise the exemption to $10,000. That would make it possible for a husband and wife to each give each of their children $20,000 a year tax-free. **********Although enacted in 1916 to raise revenue to help finance a military build-up, an estate tax had been used temporarily to help finance the Civil War. Its ideological roots were in the progressivism of the 1880's and 1890's. **********''Its roots and later history are both bound up with the Democratic dream of equal opportunity for all,'' according to Boris I. Bittker and Lawrence M. Stone in their law school textbook on taxes. United in Professed Sentiment **********Such sentiments may be swept aside in the present climate in which both parties profess to favor greater saving and capital formation. **********A Republican member of the Finance Committee, Senator Steven D.  Symms of Idaho, said that the estate tax should be repealed because ''the estate was built with money that already has had tax paid on it.'' **********That prompted Senator Dole to say that repeal might come after 1984, the year President Reagan has set for balancing the budget.  As for protecting equal opportunity, Senator Symms told a reporter, ''if it worked out like that'' the tax would be worth keeping. But, he argued, its principal effect is to cause forced liquidation of family-owned businesses, such as the sale of independent newspapers to large corporate chains. **********Although a few academicians and tax specialists may favor the estate tax, no constituency for keeping it has come forward. If that continues to be true, repeal may not be far off."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/26/business/holly-sugar-dissidents.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOLLY SUGAR DISSIDENTS", "print_headline": "HOLLY SUGAR DISSIDENTS", "body_text": " **********The head of a New York investment group said today that the group ''will continue its campaign to oust the present board'' of the Holly Sugar Company, despite a setback from a Federal judge. **********Unied States District Judge Zita Weinshienk issued a temporary injunction yesterday barring Arcanum I Partners, headed by Michael S.

He gave no indication whether the Israelis might have intentionally dropped a delayed action weapon to hamper damage-control efforts. **********Mr. Rimbaud said that he had had a perfect view from a compound about 550 yards away as the Israeli jets made two runs above the reactor building to drop bombs. He said that ''the Israelis chose their hour perfectly'' to minimize casualties. Nearly all the French technicians had finished work and left the site before the attack began, he said. **********Mr. Rimbaud was one of the first French technicians to leave Iraq after the attack. Employees of two Italian companies also worked at the Iraqi plant and a spokesman for one of them said in Rome yesterday that about 25 of the company's 100 employees were returning to Italy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/20/business/company-news-warm-response-to-budget-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1981-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 958, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WARM RESPONSE TO BUDGET PLAN", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; WARM RESPONSE TO BUDGET PLAN", "body_text": " **********Corporate America yesterday welcomed President Reagan's economic program - particularly his proposals to encourage investment - as a long-needed change in Government policy. **********Many of the nation's top business executives said that they expected the President's economic plans, if approved by Congress, to lead to increased investment in new plant and equipment. They also believe that his proposed tax revisions will put the consumer in a better buying mood. **********But as the businessmen passed from near-euphoria after the President's address Wednesday night to a more analytical mood, many were unable to cite the definite effects the proposals might have on their companies. **********''The total program will encourage us to increase our capital expenditures program, but we aren't prepared at this moment to say how,'' said Marshall Hahn, president of COMPANY NEWS: Reagan Impact the Georgia-Pacific Corporation, a leading forest products company.  ''We're pleased to see the efforts to control inflation by cutting federal spending and by accelerating the depreciation allowances.'' **********The J.C. Penney Company expects that the President's proposals for improved depreciation allowances for businesses will stimulate retailers' returns on their investment in stores and other facilities. ''That, in turn,'' said Donald V. Seibert, chairman, ''will help to increase cash flow and stimulate additional investment.'' **********But Mr. Reagan's forecast that his three-year slowdown in income tax rates would put $500 billion in consumers' hands over the next five years drew some skepticism from Mr. Seibert. ''Tax cuts, in helping to improve the economy, will of course mean that retailers will get their share. But tax cuts do not have the immediate effect of tax rebates.'' **********However, Henry H. Henley Jr., chairman of Cluett, Peabody & Company, said he believed the Reagan program ''will stimulate the economy right off because of an improved public attitude.'' The chairman of the apparel company said he expected retailers to receive a prompt stimulus in sales: ''Our business should respond positively.'' **********But there were also caveats from other executives. Irving S.  Shapiro, chairman of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, noted that improved depreciation policies were needed because ''industry has been decapitalized.'' But Mr. Shapiro, while agreeing on the Federal budget cuts, observed that the total Reagan program might prove inflationary. **********''All we've got to rely on is an economic theory,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''No businessman can run his company on an untried business theory. I expect Congress to go ahead with the depreciation proposals and the first-year tax cut, and then sit back on the tax cuts for the other years to see how the initial phase works.'' **********Reginald H. Jones, chairman of the General Electric Company, said, ''We endorse the concept of a smaller public sector, and achieving it by simultaneously lowering taxes and expenditures. **********''But it seems to me that there is considerable confusion about the role of the Export-Import Bank, which is primarily a lending, not a spending agency. Cutting its lending authority has minimal impact on the budget but will have significant negative impact on United States exports. Reducing the lending authority of the Export-Import Bank thus cripples our international competitiveness.'' Stronger Credit Markets **********In the financial community, the mood also was one of hope, and at Dillon Read & Company, a prominent investment banking house, there was ''cautious optimism.'' Charles A. Ballard, managing director, said, ''For the first time in at least a decade, the President will not be part of a creation of a fiscal policy based on social programs.'' **********Regarding his company's position if the President's proposals go through, he said: ''We see a trending of improvement in the capital markets. We don't necessarily anticipate wild rallies in the debt or equity markets, but rather a trend to more stable markets. That could amount to our ox being gored, because the return to stability away from market volatility may mean fewer opportunities for investment bankers.'' **********At the General Motors Corporation in Detroit, Roger B. Smith, chairman, said that he was ''heartened'' by the President's intention to pursue significant reductions in projected government spending, tax changes geared to promote savings and investment and reductions in the costs of government regulation. Textile Makers Enthusiastic **********The textile industry also greeted the Reagan program with enthusiasm. **********David W. Johnston Jr., chairman of Dan River Inc., said that he particularly welcomed those portions of the budget designed to provide incentives for capital formation and investment. **********Whitney Stevens, chairman of J.P. Stevens & Company, called it all ''very encouraging,'' while Otto Stolz, chairman of Cannon Mills Inc., said that, on balance, ''the program merits substantial support.'' **********In San Francisco, Karl Slacik, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Levi Strauss Inc., said: ''The accelerated costrecovery system should have a beneficial effect upon our expansion of existing facilities and our addition of several new facilities within the next year. The tax reductions on investment income and capital gains will stimulate savings and productive investments.'' Comments on Medicaid Cuts **********In the medical services field, Karl D. Bays, chairman of the American Hospital Supply Corporation in Evanston, Ill., observed: ''I don't think the cutback in Medicaid will affect us. It's true, there is a lot of abuse in the Medicaid program, and I think it's a good idea to move more authority back to the states where it belongs.'' **********And Morris Yoffe, president of American Medical Affiliates Inc., Jenkintown, Pa., which operates nursing homes, said that the President's program would trim ''a lot of waste and duplication - eliminating the health system bureaucracy will allow the free enterprise system to take effect.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/08/world/fewer-boat-people-afloat.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fewer 'Boat People' Afloat", "print_headline": "Fewer 'Boat People' Afloat", "body_text": " **********The number of Vietnamese ''boat people'' arriving in East and Southeast Asian countries in August was the lowest in 11 months, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/30/business/american-medical-affiliates-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERICAN MEDICAL AFFILIATES INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "AMERICAN MEDICAL AFFILIATES INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/03/business/advertising-agency-is-right-on-track.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 671, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Agency Is Right On Track", "print_headline": "Advertising; Agency Is Right On Track", "body_text": " **********STANLEY RAPP thinks his agency is on a winning streak. He has every right to. Rapp & Collins, since 1976 the direct marketing subsidiary of Doyle Dane Bernbach, ended last week by picking up its third piece of new business for the month, a short month at that. **********It is to do circulation promotion for Geo, the slick, generalinterest, monthly magazine from Gruner & Jahr, the German publishers, which is expected to have billings of more than $1 million. **********The month's biggest account was won the earliest - the RCA Record and Tape Club, which could bill $6 million or more. Then came the W.  Atlee Burpee Company, seed sellers and the country's biggest catalogue house, which will probably spend in the $2 million neighborhood. **********Each of the accounts is coming from an agency that is a subsidiary of a major agency, as is Rapp and Collins. Geo was handled by Wunderman, Ricotta & Kline, a subsidiary of Young & Rubicam. **********Bigness, you see, is the direction in which the direct marketing segment of the advertising agency is heading. **********As the bearded, 52-year-old Mr. Rapp said of the 1975 period: ''It was becoming apparent that Fortune 500 companies and other major marketers were becoming very interested in getting additional business by direct marketing.'' **********Slightly later, he added, ''An important consideration for being acquired is that a $20 million agency is not in a league to be considered by a $1 billion corporation as a source for meeting their needs.'' **********That was the feeling he and his associates had when D.D.B., Needham, Harper & Steers, and Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn, all big boys, came calling as suitors. That was about five years ago, a year after Young & Rubicam had acquired Wunderman, the largest agency of its kind. Since then almost all of the larger independent direct marketing specialty agencies have become part of the giant general agencies, a number of which have also acquired capabilities in health-care and recruitment advertising, sales promotion, and public relations fields, and become total communications companies. **********It is ironic, however, that the agencies with acquired direct marketing subsidiaries do not include Foote, Cone & Belding, because it was that international agency that was far ahead of the field when it decided late in 1964 to found a direct marketing agency and sent a headhunter after a couple of people to do it. **********As Mr. Rapp remembers it, when he was asked if he was interested in estabishing such a division, he said he would be willing if they could get Tom Collins, the copy chief at Wunderman, who he knew only by reputation. It turned out that Mr. Collins was presenting the same conditions about Mr. Rapp. **********''It was a marriage made in heaven; we've been together 16 years,'' Mr. Rapp recalled, noting that the writer decided a couple of years back to step out of management and spend more time at his farm in Liberty, N.Y. At the agency he has discovered the three-day week. **********R.&C. had begun as a division of F.C.&B. in 1965 with the Cleveland Institute of Electronics as its first client. In 1969, when it was billing a respectable $9 million, its client Capitol Records, billing $5 million, was acquired by Longines Symphonette, which decided to do the advertising in-house. **********''We became a much smaller agency,'' Mr. Rapp said, ''but problems are opportunities. And we made Foote, Cone an offer it couldn't refuse.'' It was a three-year buy-out. **********A couple of years later, however, the two were ready for a little more action and merged with Stone & Adler of Chicago, same specialty, same size. This marriage lasted until D.D.B. came along and its client list had too many conflicts with those of Stone & Adler. So they split, and Stone & Adler later became part of Young & Rubicam, the Jaws of the agency business."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/22/business/bankamerica-realty-investors-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-apr-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANKAMERICA REALTY INVESTORS reports earnings for Qtr to Apr 30", "print_headline": "BANKAMERICA REALTY INVESTORS reports earnings for Qtr to Apr 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/05/business/soviet-buys-more-grain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 243, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Buys More Grain", "print_headline": "Soviet Buys More Grain", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union has bought another 400,000 tons of American grain.

Dealers acknowledge that their market remains quite volatile, and the pattern of sharp swings with successively higher peaks in rates is one reason why investors are cautious about buying long-term issues. **********''Long-term yields have just established record highs for the fifth time in the last 16 months,'' analysts at Salomon Brothers observed in the July 31 issue of Comments on Credit. **********May Revive Speculators **********While investors are wary, many market participants said this week's Treasury auctions should attract investors and speculators who have been dormant for the last month or so. ''There are no numbers to prove it, but I've got a strong feeling that this market will do all right,'' commented George Hester, vice-president at Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis's government dealer subsidiary. Along with others, he noted that some foreign interest is evident for upcoming issues, as are trading accounts at the thousands of securities firms and money managers across the country. **********There will be an ample selection of new Treasury issues in many maturities. **********- Today the Treasury sells $4.3 billion each of three- and sixmonth bills in minimun denominations of $10,000. **********- Tomorrow the Treasury sells $4.25 billion of 3 1/4-year notes due November 1984 in minimum denominations of $5,000. **********- On Wednesday the Treasury sells $2.25 billion of 9 3/4-year, 14 percent notes due May 1991 in minimum denominations of $1,000. **********- On Thursday, the Treaury sell $2 billion of 29 3/4-year, 13 7/8 percent bonds due May 2011 in minimum denominations of $1,000. **********- On Friday, the Treasury sells $4.5 billion of one-year bills in minimum denominations of $10,000. Reminiscent of May **********If buyers do appear in force, it would resemble the early May Treasury financing, which was the catalyst for a six-week buying spree that carried the 13 7/8 percent Treasury bonds due 2011 to a price of 110. Since mid-June, however, prices have been mostly lower until late Friday when the same bonds were offered at 99 1/4 to yield 13.98 percent. **********Yields in the Treasury market this week would look very familiar to an investor who participated in the May refunding and then went on a long vacation. The 3-year, 10-year and 30-year issues sold then correspond to this week's note and bond offerings, and late Friday the outstanding issues were offered with yields of 15.78 percent, 14.68 percent, and 13.98 percent. **********Whether or not interest rates are higher than last May's comparable issues, salesmen will try to convince buyers that this is an opportunity to buy before interest rates decline. Besides a high yield from interest payments, a large capital gain would result. If for example, 30-year Treasury bond yields fell to 12 percent, their prices would rise about 14 points, or $140 per $1,000 bond. Inflation Incentive **********In a report analysts at Merrill Lynch pointed out that buyers have even more reason to buy now than they did in May, when yields were about the same. ''Economic activity posted a decline in the previous quarter and could continue to decline in the present quarter, several more months of favorable inflation numbers are now under out belts.  M-1B growth remains exceedingly sluggish and the Fed is easing -not tightening - its credit reins,'' the report said. **********If the uncertainty of investor demand and financing costs were not enough, securities dealers may find another yet another obstacle between them and a profitable underwriting of the Treasury's debt. **********The air traffic controller's strike could interrupt the Federal Reserve's transportation system, and cause a huge multibillion-dollar increase in the float, or checks in transit between banks. Increased float results in additional bank reserves, which the Fed will have to offset with temporary sales of securities that it owns. Unfortunatly, the Fed will not have perfect knowlege of reserves being added to the banking system by float, or any other aberrations. **********''It's the lousiest setting for a Treasury refunding I can think of,'' said William Melton, a money market economist at Irving Trust.  He explained that rates on overnight loans in Federal funds might fall during the week, which would cause aggressive buying of new issues even though the drop in the funds rate would be a result of the excess float, rather than any easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. **********Alernatively, Mr. Melton said, the funds rate could be unusually high if the Fed overestimated the reserves it must drain to offset the increase in float. The result then would be higher interest rates as dealers worried about higher financing costs while investors waited until the smoke cleared."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/18/business/citizens-utilities-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CITIZENS UTILITIES CO reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "CITIZENS UTILITIES CO reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/21/business/ipco-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IPCO CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "IPCO CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/16/world/excerpts-from-english-version-of-the-pope-s-encyclical-on-human-work.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 4041, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM ENGLISH VERSION OF THE POPE'S ENCYCLICAL 'ON HUMAN WORK'", "print_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM ENGLISH VERSION OF THE POPE'S ENCYCLICAL 'ON HUMAN WORK'", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from the official English version of the encyclical of Pope John Paul II ''On Human Work'': **********Through work man must earn his daily bread and contribute to the continual advance of science and technology and, above all, to elevating unceasingly the cultural and moral level of the society within which he lives in community with those who belong to the same family. **********And work means any activity by man, whether manual or intellectual,whatever its nature or circumstances, it mean s any human activity that can and must be recognized as work, in t he midst of all the manyactivities of which man is capable and to whi ch he is predisposed by his very nature, by virtue of humanity itself . Man is made to be in the visible universe an image and likeness of God Himself, and he is placed in it in order to subdue the earth. Fr om the beginning therefore he is called to work. **********Work is one of the characteristics that distinguish man from the rest of creatures, whose activity for sustaining their lives cannot be called work. Only man is capable of work, and only man works, at the same time by work occupying his existence on earth. Thus work bears a particular mark of man a nd of humanity, the mark of a person operating wit hin a community of persons. And this mark decides its interior char acteristics; in a sense it constitutes its very nature. Introduction **********Since 15 May of the present year was the 90th anniversary of the publication by the great Pope of the ''Social Question,'' Leo XIII, of the decisively important encyclical which begins with the words ''Rerum Novarum,'' I wish to devote this document to human work and, even more, to man in the vast context of the reality of work. **********Man's life is built up every day from work, from work it derives its specific dignity, but at the same time work contains the unceasing measure of human toil and suffering, and also of the harm and injustice which penetrate deeply into social life within individual nations and on the international level. **********While it is true that man eats the bread produced by the work of his hands - and this means not only the daily bread by which his body keeps alive but also the bread of science and progress, civilization and culture - it is also a perennial truth that he eats this bread by ''the sweat of his face,'' that is to say, not only by personal effort and toil but also in the midst of many tensions, conflicts and crises, which, in relationship with the reality of work, disturb the life of individual societies and also of all humanity. Work as Merchandise **********In the modern period, from the beginning of the industrial age, the Christian truth about work had to oppose the various trends of materialistic and economistic thought. **********For certain supporters of such ideas, work was understood and treated as a sort of merchandise that the worker -especially the industrial worker -sells to the employer, who at the same time is the possessor of the capital, that is to say, of all the working tools and means that make production possible. This way of looking at work was widespread especially in the first half of the 19th century.  Since then, explicit expressions of this sort have almost disappeared and have given way to more human ways of thinking about work and evaluating it. **********The interaction between the worker and the tools and means of production has given rise to the development of various forms of capitalism - parallel with various forms of collectivism -into which other socioeconomic elements have entered as a consequence of new concrete circumstances, of the activity of workers' associations and public authorities and of the emergence of large transnational enterprises. Nevertheless, the danger of treating work as a special kind of merchandise or as an impersonal force needed for production (the expression work force is in fact in common use) always exists, especially when the whole way of looking at the question of economics is marked by the premises of materialistic economism. **********Everybody knows that capitalism has a definite historical meaning as a system, an economic and social system, opposed to Socialism or Communism. But in the light of the analysis of the fundamental reality of the whole economic process - first and foremost of the production structure that work is - it should be recognized that the error of early capitalism can be repeated wherever man is in a way treated on the same level as the whole complex of the material means of production, as an instrument and not in accordance with the true dignity of his work - that is to say, where he is not treated as subject and maker, and for this very reason as the true purpose of the whole process of production. **********The development of human civilization brings continual enrichment in this field. But at the same time, one cannot fail to note that in the process of this development not only do new forms of work appear but also others disappear. Even if one accepts that on the whole this is a normal phenomenon, it must still be seen whether certain ethically and socially dangerous irregularities creep in, and to what extent. **********It was precisely one such wide-ranging anomaly that gave rise in the last century to what has been called ''the worker question,'' sometimes described as ''the proletariat question.'' Burst of Solidarity **********This question and the problems connected with i t gave rise to a just social reaction and caused the impetuous emergence of a great burst of solidarity between workers, first an d foremost industrial workers. The call to solidarity and common ac tion addressed to the workers - especially to those engaged in narr owly specialized, monotonous and depersonalized work in industr ial plants, when the machine tends to dominate man - was important and eloquent from the point of view of social ethics. It was the re action against the degradation of man as the subject of work and against the unheard-of accompanying exploitation in the field of wag es, working conditions and social security for the workers. This rea ction united the workingworld in a community marked by great solidari ty. Following t he lines laid down by the encyclical ''Rerum Novarum'' and many late r documents of the church's magisterium, it must be frankly recog nized that the reaction against the system of injustice and harm that cried to heaven for vengeance and that weighed heavily upon workers in that period of rapid industrialization was justified from the poin t of view of social morality. This state of affairs was favored by th e liberal sociopolitical system, which in accordance with its ''ec onomistic'' premises, strengthened and safeguarded economic init iative by the possessors of capital alone, but did not pay sufficien t attention to the rights of the workers, on the groundsthat human wo rk is solely an instrument of production and that capital is th e basis, efficient factor and purpose of production. Injustices Persist **********From that time, worker solidarity, together with a clearer and more committed realization by others of workers' rights, has in many cases brought about profound changes. Various forms of neocapitalism or collectivism have developed. Various new systems have been thought out. Workers can often share in running businesses and in controlling their productivity and in fact do so. Through appropriate associations, they exercise influence over conditions of work and pay and also over social legislation. But at the same time various ideological or power systems, and new relationships which have arisen at various levels of society, have allowed flagrant injustices to persist or have created new ones. **********There must be continued study of the subject of work and of the subject's living conditions. In order to achieve social justice in the various parts of the world, in the various countries and in the relationships between them, there is a need for ever new movements of solidarity of the workers and with the workers. This solidarity must be present whenever it is called for by the social degrading of the subject of work, by exploitation of the workers and by the growing areas of poverty and even hunger. **********The church is firmly committed to this cause, for she considers it her mission, her service, a proof of her fidelity to Christ, so that she can truly be the ''church of the poor.'' Conflict Between Labor and Capital **********The encyclical ''Rerum Novarum,'' which has the social question as its theme, stresses the issue of ownership or property, recalling and confirming the church's teaching on ownership, on the right to private property even when it is a question of the means of production. The encyclical ''Mater et Magistra'' did the same. **********The above principle, as it was then stated and as it is still taught by the church, diverges radically from the program of collectivism as proclaimed by Marxism and put into practice in various countries in the decades following the time of Leo XIII's encyclical. At the same time it differs from the program of capitalism practiced by liberalism and by the political systems inspired by it. In the latter case, the difference consists in the way the right to ownership or property is understood. Christian tradition has never upheld this right as absolute and untouchable. **********On the contrary, it has always understood this right within the broader context of the right common to all to use the goods of the whole of creation: the right to private property is subordinated to the right to common use, to the fact that goods are meant for everyone. Nature of Ownership **********Furthermore, in the church's teaching, ownership has never been understood in a way that could constitute grounds for social conflict in labor. As mentioned above, property is acquired first of all through work in order that it may serve work. This concerns in a special way ownership of the means of production. Isolating these means as a separate property in order to set it up in the form of capital in opposition to labor - and even to practice exploitation of labor - is contrary to the very nature of these means and their possession. **********They cannot be possessed against labor; they cannot even be possessed for possession's sake, because the only legitimate title to their possession -whether in the form of private ownership or in the form of public or collective ownership - is that they should serve labor and thus, by serving labor, that they should make possible the achievement of the first princip le of this order, namely the universal destination of goods and the right to common useof them. **********From this point of view, therefore, in consideration of human labor and of common access to the goods meant for man, one cannot exclude the socialization, in suitable conditions, of certain means of production. **********If it is true that capital, as the whole of the means of production, is at the same time the product of the work of generations, it is equally true that capital is being unceasingly created through the work done with the help of all these means of production, and these means can be s een as a great workbench at which the pre sent generation of workers is working day after day.  Obviously we are dealing here with different kinds of work, not only so-called man ual labor but also the many forms of intellectual work, including whi te-collar work and management. Protecting Ownership **********In the light of the above, the many proposals put forward by experts in Catholic social teaching and by the highest magisterium of the church take on special significance: proposals for joint ownership of the means of work, sharing by the workers in the management and/or profits of businesses, so-called shareholding by labor etc. Whether these various proposals can or cannot be applied concretely, it is clear that recognition of the proper position of labor and the worker in the production process demands various adaptations in the sphere of the right to ownership of the means of production. **********Therefore, while the position of ''rigid'' capitalism must undergo continual revision in order to be reformed from the point of view of human rights, both human rights in the widest sense and those linked with man's work, it must be stated that, from the same point of view, these many deeply desired reforms cannot be achieved by an a priori elimination of private ownership of the means of production.  For it must be noted that merely taking these means of production (capital) out of the hands of their private owners is not enough to insure their satisfactory socialization. They cease to be the property of a certain social group, namely the private owners, and become the property of organized society, coming under the administration and direct control of another group of people, namely those who, though not owning them, from the fact of exercising power in society manage them on the level of the whole national or the local economy. **********The princple of the priority of labor over capital is a postulate of the order of social morality. It has key importance both in the system built on the principle of private ownership of the means of production and also in the system in which private ownership of these means has been limited even in a radical way. Labor is in a sense inseparable from capital, in no way does it accept the separation and opposition with regard to the means of production that has weighed upon human life in recent centuries as a result of merely economic premises. When man works, using all the means of production, he also wishes the fruit of this work to be used by himself and others, and he wishes to be able to take part in the very work process as a sharer in responsibility and creativity at the workbench to which he applies himself. Rights of Workers **********While work, in all its many senses, is an obligation, that is to say a duty, it is also a source of rights on the part of the worker.  These rights must be examined in the broad context of human rights as a whole, which are connatural with man, and many of which are proclaimed by various international organizations and increasingly guaranteed by the individual states for their citizens. Respect for this broad range of human rights constitutes the fundamental condition for peace in the modern world: peace both within individual countries and societies and in international relations, as the church's magisterium has several times noted, especially since the encyclical ''Pacem in Terris.'' The human rights that flow from work are part of the broader context of those fundamental rights of the person. **********Experience confirms that there must be a social re-evaluation of the mother's role, of the toil connected with it and of the need that children have for care, love and affection in order that they may develop into responsible, morally and religiously mature and psychologically stable persons. It will redound to the credit of society to make it possible for a mother - without inhibiting her freedom, without psychological or practical discrimination and without penalizing her as compared with other women - to devote herself to taking care of her children and educating them in accordance with their needs, which vary with age. The Need for Unions **********All these rights, together with the need for the workers themselves to secure them, give rise to yet another right: the right of association, that is to form associations for the purpose of defending the vital interests of those employed in the various professions. These associations are called labor or trade unions. The vital interests of the workers are to a certa in extent common for allof them; at the same time however each type o f work, each profession,has its own specific character which should f ind a particular reflection in these organizations. **********In a sense, unions go back to the medieval guilds of artisans, insofar as those organizations brought together people belonging to the same craft and thus on the basis of their work. **********However, unions differ from the guilds on this essential point: The modern unions grew up from the struggle of the workers - workers in general but especially the industr ial workers - to protect their justrights vis-a- vis the entrepreneurs and the owners of the means of production. T heir task is to defend the existential interests of workers in al l sectors in which their rights are concerned. The experience of history teaches that organizations of this type are an indispensable element of social life, especially in modern industrialize d societies. Obviously, this does not mean that only industrial wo rkers can set up associations of this type.  Representativ es of every profession can use them to insure their own rights. 'For' but Not 'Against' **********Catholic social teaching does not hold that unions are no more than a reflection of the class structure of society and that they are agents for a class struggle which inevitably governs social life.  They are indeed advocates for the struggle for social justice, for the just rights of working people in accordance with their individual professions. However, this struggle should be seen as a normal endeavor ''for'' the just good: in the present case, for the good which corresponds to the needs and merits of working people associated by profession, but it is not a struggle ''against'' others. **********Even if in controversial questions the struggle takes on a character of opposition toward others, this is because it aims at the good of social justice, not for the sake of ''struggle'' or in order to eliminate the opponent. It is characteristic of work that it first and foremost unites people. In this consists its social power: the power to build a community. In the final analysis, both those who work and those who manage the means of production or who own them must in some way be united in this community. Limits to Union Demands **********In the light of this fundamental structure of all work - in the light of the fact that, in the final analysis, labor and capital are indispensable components of the process of production in any social system - it is clear that, even if it is because of their work needs that people unite to secure their rights, their union remains a constructive factor of social order and solidarity, and it is impossible to ignore it. **********Just efforts to secure the rights of workers who are united by the same profession should always take into account the limitations imposed by the general economic situation of the country. Union demands cannot be turned into a kind of group or class egoism, although they can and should also aim at correcting - with a view to the common good of the whole of society - everything defective in the system of ownership of the means of production or in the way these are managed. Social and socioeconomic life is certainly like a system of ''connected vessels,'' and every social activity directed toward safeguarding the rights of particular groups should adapt itself to this system. **********In this sense, union activity undoubtedly enters the field of politics, understood as prudent concern for the common good. However, the role of unions is not to ''play politics'' in the sense that the expression is commonly understood today. Unions do not have the character of political parties struggling for power; they should not be subjected to the decision of political parties or have too close links with them. In fact, in such a situation they easily lose contact with their specific role, which is to secure the just rights of workers within the framework of the common good of the whole of society; instead they become an instrument used for other purposes. **********One method used by unions in pursuing the just rights of their members is the strike or work stoppage as a kind of ultimatum to the competent bodies, especially the employers. This method is recognized by Catholic social teaching as legitimate in the proper conditions and within just limits. **********While admitting that it is a legitimate means, we must at the same time emphasize that a strike remains, in a sense, an extreme means.  It must not be abused, it must not be abused especially for ''political'' purposes. Furthermore, it must never be forgotten that, when essential community services are in question, they must in every case be insured, if necessary by means of appropriate legislation.  Abuse of the strike weapon can lead to the paralysis of the whole of socioeconomic life, and this is contrary to the requirements of the common good of society, which also corresponds to the properly understood nature of work itself. Elements for a Spirituality of Work It is right to devote the last part of thes e reflections about human work, on the occasion of the 90th anniv ersary of the encyclical''Rerum Novarum,'' to the spirituality of wor k in the Christian sense. Since work in its subjective aspect is always a personal action, an actus personae, it follows that th e whole person, body and spirit, participates in it, whether it is manual or intellectual work. It is also to the whole person that the word of the living God is directed, the evangelical message of salva tion, in which we find many points which concern human work and whic h throw particular lighton it . **********These points need to be properly assimilated: An inner effort on the part of the human spirit, guided by faith, hope and charity, is needed in order that through these points the work of the individual human being may be given the meaning which it has in the eyes of God and by means of which work enters into the salvation process on a par with the other ordinary yet particularly important components of its texture. **********The truth that by means of work man participates in the activity of God himself, his Creator, was given particular prominence by Jesus Christ - the Jesus at whom many of his first listeners in Nazareth ''were astonished, saying, 'Where did this man get all this? What is the wisdom given to Him? ... Is not this the Carpenter?' '' For Jesus not only proclaimed but first and foremost fulfilled by His deeds the ''gospel,'' the word of eternal wisdom, that had been entrusted to Him. Therefore this was also ''the gospel of work,'' because He who proclaimed it was Himself a man of work, a craftsman like Joseph of Nazareth. **********And if we do not find in his words a special command to work - but rather on one occasion a prohibition against too much anxiety about work and life - at the same time the eloquence of the life of Christ is unequivocal: He belongs to the working world, He has appreciation and respect for human work. It can indeed be said that He looks with love upon human work and the different forms that it takes, seeing in each one of these forms a particular facet of man's likeness with God, the Creator and Father. Is it not He who says, ''My Father is the vinedresser,'' and in various ways puts into His teaching the fundamental truth about work which is already expressed in the whole tradition of the Old Testament, beginning with the Book of Genesis?"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/28/business/business-people-executives-move-up-at-superior-oil.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1981-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 231, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executives Move Up At Superior Oil", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Executives Move Up At Superior Oil", "body_text": " **********Fred C.

''I don't know if they are new, but they are good.'' Essentially, the existing Israeli autonomy proposal interprets autonomy in an ''administrative'' sense, with Israel continuing to be responsible for the security of the West Bank and Gaza. **********In addition, the Israeli plan bans the creation of a Palestinian state or any other self-governing entity remotely resembling a separate nation. The plan also bars the inclusion of East Jerusalem and calls for a Palestinian administrative council, numbering between 11 and 15 members, that would handle purely local matters. **********So far, no West Bank or Gaza leaders, most of whom support the Palestine Liberation Organization, have indicated any interest in the Israeli plan. There were reports here today that Ariel Sharon, who as Defense Minister is in charge of the occupied West Bank and Gaza, has been meeting quietly with moderate Arabs in rural areas, apparently in an effort to gain some support for the plan while bypassing the recalcitrant mayors of the larger municipalities. Call for Renewing Talks **********The other day, Dr. Yosef Burg, the Israeli minister in charge of autonomy negotiations, said of the existing autonomy plan put forward by Israel, ''There is no need for new decisions. What is required is the renewal of the talks.'' **********Mr. Naor refused to either confirm or deny a report in today's Jerusalem Post, the English-language daily, that said Mr. Begin would present to Mr. Sadat a proposal that Israel abolish its current military government in the West Bank and Gaza in return for Mr.  Sadat's approval of Israel's definition of autonomy. **********The proposal, the newspaper said, was recommended by Defense Minister Sharon, who will accompany Mr. Begin to Alexandria along with other key ministers. **********There were no details in the newspaper account on what was meant by abolishing the current military structure.  The issue of autonomy for the 1.3 million Palestinian Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza who have been living under Israeli military rule since 1967 has been a stumbling block ever since the Camp David agreements between Egypt and Israel. Sadat Hopes for Accord in '81 **********Mr. Sadat said some weeks ago in a number of speeches and interviews that he wanted some sort of autonomy plan agreed to by the end of the year. The topic was one he brought up in his recent meeting in Washington with President Reagan. **********The issue of autonomy will also be discussed between Mr. Begin and Mr. Reagan when the Israeli leader meets the American President for the first time in Washington early in September. **********But reports from Egypt indicate that the Sadat Government does not foresee a quick resumption of the autonomy talks - something that Israeli leaders said today they wanted. Egypt's Foreign Minister, Kamal Hassan Ali, was quoted in the weekly October magazine published in Cairo as saying that the talks may not be resumed until December. **********Mr. Ali was quoted as saying that a gulf existed between Egypt and Israel on the very definition of ''autonomy'' and that there were differences, as well, over the construction of Israeli settlements in the occupied lands and over the annexation of East Jerusalem. **********Mr. Sadat is known to want a workable autonomy plan, or at least one that indicates that Egypt is fulfilling its commitment to the Palestinian Arabs, before the scheduled return of the last portion of the Israeli-occupied Sinai Peninsula to Egypt next April. **********Meantime, in a development related to East Jerusalem, one of Mr.  Begin's Cabinet members, Yitzhak Modai, Minister Without Portfolio, quietly moved his office to East Jerusalem on Friday in a step that came to light today.

However, he assured them that the people of the United States were ''as compassionate and caring as any on earth'' and would remain so. **********He conceded that the United States has made mistakes of its own in the past, declaring that ''we have overspent, overtaxed, and overregulated,'' mistakes that his Administration would undo. Those past mistakes, he contended, had been responsible for slow growth and soaring inflation -stagflation. **********Thus, in his maiden speech to the I.M.F. and World Bank group, Mr.  Reagan voiced the deeply felt free-market philosophy of his Administration. He declared that the nations that had made the most progress in the world were those that trusted in ''the magi c of the market.'' **********It seems unlikely that in speaking of the magic of the market, Mr.  Reagan had Wall Street in mind. In recent weeks he has been extremely critical of the Street for its lack of comprehension, particularly of his economic program. Nevertheless, it was that market known as Wall Street that came through for Mr. Reagan in the clutch this week and warded off what might have been a financial and economic disaster, here and abroad. **********Wall Street appears to have redeemed its reputation as the most efficient of markets - a huge and speedy accumulator, processor and evaluator of information. **********If Wall Street had not stood up and rallied, in the face of panic selling around the world from London to Tokyo, the worldwide sell-off might have turned into another Great Crash. **********The heavy volume of margin debt overhanging Wall Street had created conditions for a plunge in prices that might have made what Joe Granville advertized as ''Blue Monday'' rival ''Black Tuesday'' in 1929. **********That it instead became ''Green Monday'' was evidence, at least this time, of the Street's collective cool, realism and intelligence. **********This was a rallying cry heard round the world. Indeed, the strengthening of other markets yesterday signified the continuing financial dominance of New York, even though the United States economy has lost relative position in the world economy in terms of share of world output, share of foreign trade, rate of productivity growth and technological progress. But Mr. Reagan was at pains to remind those attending the I.M.F. and World Bank meeting that they should not underestimate the continuing economic importance of the American market to their well-being. He pointed out that the United States imports half of all manufactured goods from the oil-poor third world countries. **********The foreign financial markets were really waiting to see what New York would do, and when it rallied, the panic was dispelled.  Nevertheless, the financial markets remain wary of economic and financial troubles to come. Yesterday, while most foreign markets were rallying behind New York, Hong Kong - the truest of true believers in the magic of the market - remained skeptical. Should Mr. Reagan criticize its doubts or, applauding the cleverness of markets, pay heed to what Hong Kong is saying? **********Certainly there is still doubt, not only in Hong Kong but in Wall Street and European money centers that the Reagan Administration has yet found the answer to stagflation. Anxieties persist that its combination of huge tax cuts and tight money will continue to mean high interest rates and sluggish growth, or even slump, at home and abroad. **********Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, has called for undoing the damage of the tax bill, which he charges has devastated the revenue posture of the Government, with tax cuts that will cost $93 billion in 1983, $150 billion in 1984, $199 billion in 1985 and $268 billion in 1986. ''The only outcomes guaranteed by that kind of revenue loss,'' says Senator Hollings, ''are budgeting in the red, high interest rates and continued inflation.'' **********Besides trimming the tax bill sharply in the coming three years, Senator Hollings also proposes the immediate repeal of ''the illconsidered and hastily enacted provision for indexing the income tax'' and repealing the new oil tax breaks. **********Some of his colleagues, including moderate Republicans as well as Democrats, together with a remarkably large number of businessmen, would put heavier emphasis on scaling back military expenditures, in line with carefully developed strategic policy decisions. **********In his talk to the world's financiers yesterday, Mr. Reagan coupled his call for free-market ideology with a plea for pragmatism.

Haig Jr. is his ''primary adviser on foreign affairs,'' but White House advisers said that the strain between Mr. Haig and Mr. Reagan's senior staff was much more severe than had been publicly acknowledged. **********According to a Presidential adviser, Mr. Haig has threatened to resign eight or nine times since Mr. Reagan took office. Had he done so again yesterday, the adviser said, the acceptance of the resignation might have not have been opposed by Edwin Meese 3d, the counselor to the President, and James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff. **********The White House was uncertain until late last night whether Mr.  Haig might make good his earlier threats, some of which were regarded as mere mutterings of discontent, with a formal resignation. The question was not laid to rest, for the time being at least, until Mr. Haig met at 6 A.M. today with Michael K. Deaver, the deputy White House chief of staff, and later in the morning with the President. **********Haig Still Reported Disgruntled **********Even after the meetings and Mr. Reagan's subsequent statement of support, Mr. Haig was described by associates as disgruntled and uncertain about his future in the Administration. White House aides were telling political associates today, however, that they expected Mr. Haig to stay. **********Mr. Meese and Mr. Baker were described as infuriated by Mr. Haig's public criticism yesterday, before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, of Mr. Reagan's plan to put Vice President Bush in charge of the White House situation room during foreign or domestic crises. The Reagan inner circle regarded this criticism as another example of Mr. Haig's creating public controversies that have disrupted the Administration's plan to keep public and Congressional attention on Mr. Reagan's demand for quick passage of his economic program. **********Mr. Reagan tried to end the divisiveness as he left the White House for an afternoon of horseback riding by reaffirming Mr. Haig's role as ''chief formulator and spokesman for foreign policy'' and then blaming reporters for the controversy over Mr. Haig's remarks. **********''I don't know whether you'd like my reaction,'' Mr. Reagan said.''My reaction was that maybe some of you were trying to make the news instead of reporting it.'' Then, the President, clad in navy windbreaker, tan riding britches and knee-high boots with gleaming spurs, strode to the Marine helicopter for the 30-minute trip to the stables at the Marine base at Quantico, Va. **********It was unclear whether the President's carefully worded departure statement went far enough to lay to rest Mr. Haig's misgivings over the crisis-management arrangement, which was regarded, even by senior State Department officials, as a clear victory for Mr. Bush in the competition with Mr. Haig for primacy in the Reagan hierarchy. **********Just over an hour after Mr. Reagan's departure, Mr. Bush made a conciliatory statement toward Mr. Haig, saying that he would leave to the Secretary of State ''the day to day problem areas of foreign policy,'' such as El Salvador. **********But Mr. Bush added at his 3 P.M. press conference, ''When the President is not there, not on hand, I will be in the situation room, in charge until the President is available.'' **********As for Mr. Haig, the Vice President continued, ''To the degree there is some misunderstanding or reservation on his part, I refer you to him on it, really, because I just don't want to exacerbate things.'' **********The White House press secretary, James S. Brady, tried to draw a veil across what other White House officials described as discordant events in the West Wing after Mr. Haig's expression of discontent with the crisis-management plan yesterday morning. Mr. Brady insisted, despite Mr. Haig's remarks to the contrary, that the Secretary of State had been ''fully consulted'' on the plan. He also asserted that Mr. Haig had not threatened to resign and that any problems between Mr. Haig and Mr. Reagan were of ''external making.'' **********But other White House officials characterized Mr. Meese, in particular, as increasingly exasperated with Mr. Haig's attentiongetting statements and his drives for influence, dating back to his memorandum on Inauguration Day asking Mr. Reagan for broad authority over foreign affairs. **********Mr. Meese's patience was ''severely tested,'' one White House source said. Mr. Baker was said to have shared Mr. Meese's anger yesterday. Both men, another source added, had grown weary of Mr.  Haig's hints that he would resign unless he got his way. **********''He's threatened eight or nine times to resign,'' the official added, although he did not specify what issues had provoked the threats. **********Mr. Baker, Mr. Meese and Mr. Deaver conferred with Mr. Reagan in the Oval Office yesterday about Mr. Haig's remarks. Mr. Brady and David R. Gergen, the White House staff director who helps plan the Administration's publicity efforts, were also called in. There were also consultations with Mr. Bush, according to Mr. Brady. **********Mr. Meese's and Mr. Baker's anger was such that for the first time it seemed possible that they might not oppose Mr. Haig's resignation. ''At one point it was a flip of a coin'' as to which way Mr. Meese and Mr. Baker would go on such a question, the official said. Faced with a decision, he added, ''I don't think they would have gone to the mat to stop it.'' **********Mr. Reagan said the matter never went that far. ''He never once threatened to resign,'' the President said.  Mr. Deaver reportedly emerged as the peacemaker, making the telephone call in which Mr. Reagan told the Secretary of State of the forthoming announcement of Mr. Bush's new assignment and assured Mr.  Haig that he was still needed in the Administration."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/03/business/mine-merger-is-approved.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mine Merger Is Approved", "print_headline": "Mine Merger Is Approved", "body_text": " **********The Sunshine Mining Company, a leading silver producer, announced that its plan to merge with the Silver Dollar Mining Company, Silver Syndicate Inc., Sunshine Consolidated Inc. and the Big Creek Apex Company had been approved by directors of the four companies, all silver-mining concerns based in Wallace, Idaho. **********Under the agreement, valued at about $66 million, one share of Sunshine Mining common will be traded for 1.15 shares of Silver Dollar stock, 0.75 share of Silver Syndicate stock, 0.715 share of Big Creek Apex stock and 0.55 share of Sunshine Consolidated stock.

The Beatrix Potter Lift-Out Jig-Saw Puzzle ... **********Proliferating like bunnies, as it were, books and wares written and inspired by Beatrix Potter have been best sellers for generations and the products of a multimillion-dollar, globe-girdling empire. **********In these pre-Christmas weeks, sales of Potter merchandise have been cheeringly brisk despite the recession, Miss Potter's longtime New York publishing house, Frederick Warne & Company, reports.  Roughly 30 percent of its Potter book sales come in the fall-and-Christmas season - and this year, they have been running 15 percent higher than in the comparable period last year. **********That performance is especially envied in the competitive children's book industry because it comes fully 80 years after the shy Miss Potter, a British amateur artist and naturalist, brought out the first edition of ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit.'' The first 250 copies appeared in December 1901 in Britain, with illustrations she did herself. **********That trickle of books has swelled to a mighty stream of merchandising revenue: In the United States alone, sales of Warne's Potter books, and revenues from other Peter- and Potter-related merchandise it has licensed, will come to an estimated $7 million or more for in this, the 38th year after Miss Potter's death. And Potter book proceeds worldwide dwarf those recorded in this country, according to the Warne company, a 100-year-old subsidiary of the London publishing house of Frederick Warne, which looks after Miss Potter's literary estate. **********The British company's stock is closely held - the majority is owned by the Warne family and a connected clan, the Stephenses - and it does not discuss its operating results. But Potter books have been translated into a dozen languages and do surprisingly well in such unlikely bailiwicks as Japan, where more than 500,000 copies, in Warne-authorized Japanese translations, are sold each year. **********It was in 1902 that Warne, after earlier turning ''Peter'' down, brought out its own first edition of the book, which is about the adventures of a naughty young rabbit who lives with his family in a sandbank. Warne's large-scale printing was a quick commercial success, and there followed 22 other children's books, which have become classics. These include ''The Tale of Benjamin Bunny,'' ''The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin,'' ''The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse,'' and ''The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse.'' **********With ''Peter Rabbit'' and some other Potter titles in the public domain in this country, other houses have joined the rabbit wagon.  The Outlet Book Company, for instance, says that two collections of Potter tales, published under its Derrydale and Avenel imprints, are among its best-selling children's books. **********Miss Potter's will gave the Warne parent company control of rights to publish the Potter books and license the use of her characters.  Which is only natural, considering her close professional and personal ties to the Warnes: They published most of her works, and she became engaged to a member of the family, Norman Warne, who died of leukemia only weeks afterward. **********Warne executives in Britain do not say what their company does with the revenues from the Potter literary estate, but in knowledgeable publishing circles it is suggested that she evidently bequeathed all or most of its earnings to the Warne family, its London house, or both. She married late and died childless, and her attorney-husband, William Heelis, died not long afterward. **********As for profits, Richard Billington, chairman and president of Warne's American subsidiary, said the Warne companies have been in clover for many years. The parent concern has been doing well since World War I and the New York house for decades, he said. All told, Mr. Billington calculates, Warne has sold about 20 million Potter books in this country, including more than three million copies of ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit.'' **********Unit sales and revenues of Warne's Potter books in this country have been increasing from year to year, Mr. Billington reports, except for 1980, when the economy's woes kept them flat. This year they will be up about 5 percent, he says, amounting to more than 300,000 copies, including roughly 100,000 of ''Peter Rabbit.'' **********What's the secret of the appeal of Peter Rabbit, Squirrel Nutkin, Jemima Puddle-Duck, and the other Potter animal-characters?  ''Beatrix Potter was one person who managed to dress animals up while still retaining their true animal likenesses,'' says Mr.  Billington. ''Peter Rabbit is really a rabbit; he just happens to have a jacket on - he's not a Bugs Bunny, is he?'' **********Publishing experts add that grownups generally buy the children's books they liked when they were young.  Mr. Billington, who is 58, agrees. He raised his son, now 29, on Potter books. But he argues that the underlying reason the works live on is that once children are introduced to them, ''they love them, and ask for them to be read over and over.'' **********Part of the charm of the books, he says, is their dimunitive size - about four by five inches. Miss Potter, he reports, ''said they should be 'little books for little hands.' '' He also stresses her choice of names and words: ''Jemima Puddle-Duck. Is there a better description for a duck?'' he asks. ''Beatrix Potter had a great sense of the sound of words; she knew how to make them interesting to children.'' **********At the Outlet Book Company, Alan Mirken, president, emphasizes the Potter illustrations. ''There's a warm tone to them that makes people of all ages feel comfortable looking at them,'' he says. ''There's an extraordinary ability, apparently, for different generations to spend time reliving the tales.'' **********The opposition is particularly impressed. ''The success of the Beatrix Potter books is incredible,'' says John Briggs, president of Holiday House, a rival children's book publishing company. It puts out two books that have come to be known as modern classics - ''The Shrinking of Treehorn'' and ''Treehorn's Treasure'' - both written by Florence Parry Heide and illustrated by Edward Gorey. **********''It's encouraging that books of outstanding quality can survive from one generation to another,'' says Mr. Briggs. ''The Beatrix Potter books have a special appeal that's universal; they sell all over the world.'' **********The American Warne company's Potter books generally sell all over this country, says Mr. Billington, who is a British-born American citizen. They have been doing best in California and in the Northeast, but have been faring better lately in the South and Middle West. **********His company has nourished sales in recent years by packaging the 23 $3.50 Potter books in $75, maroon-wrapped sets, and marketing fourbook Potter sampler sets at $11.95. It has also begun publishing $1.95 paperback editions of Peter Rabbit and three other books. **********In addition, the house purveys a number of books that are about, or related to, Miss Potter. And it has licensed 19 manufacturers to turn out merchandise that is identified with her and her characters.  All told, American sales of the licenced products amount to $5 million or more a year, Mr. Billington says, and revenue from licensing is particularly welcome to his company since almost all of it flows straight down to the bottom line. **********The licensee companies range, rather spectacularly, from the C.R.  Gibson Company (birth announcements, jigsaw puzzles and the like) and the Quiltex Company (snowsuits, crib sheets and whatnot) to Josiah Wedgwood & Sons Inc. (earthenware nursery sets, children's tea sets etc.) and Eden Toys Inc., which makes stuffed animals depicting Peter Rabbit and 14 other Potter critters. **********Eden doesn't divulge sales figures for the animals, but it says Peter Rabbit does best, and good sellers include Benjamin Bunny, Jemima Puddle-Duck and Jeremy Fisher, which is a frog. In January, stores will begin selling a new addition to the Eden-Potter line: Samuel Whiskers, which is a rat. **********''These are more than just children's toys,'' says Barbara Goldberg, the company's product promotion manager. ''They appeal to all ages. They have a certain style to them. They're whimsical.  They're collector's items!''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/28/business/court-upholds-penn-central.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 201, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Court Upholds Penn Central", "print_headline": "Court Upholds Penn Central", "body_text": " **********A three-judge Federal appeals panel denied a request by two Penn Central Corporation stockholders to delay the company's Thursday meeting at which shareholders are to vote on its proposed merger with Colt Industries. **********The two-page decision, written by Judge Arlin M.

Olmer stood up to address last week's meeting of the Japan-United States Businessmen's Conference, the Japanese executives in the audience seemed to adjust their translation headsets a little tighter, while the American businessmen leaned forward that extra inch. Mr. Olmer is the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, and his comments were of more than passing interest to these high-level industrialists. **********Mr. Olmer, 46 years old, is familiar with the wall of obstacles that Japan has built against American imports. While he was at Motorola Inc., he helped it break into the lucrative Japanese public telecommunications market. In an interview last week, he discussed the state of American-Japanese trade. **********Q. How would you characterize America's trading relationship with Japan today? A. A number of people have observed that even at present we have become a developing country with respect to the Japanese. We ship them raw materials, and they send us manufactured goods. **********Our imports from Japan are now 50 percent larger than our exports to Japan. We find ourselves having to run faster just to prevent backsliding. Since 1970, our exports to and imports from Japan have each been growing at about 17 percent a year. If this trend continues, our deficit with Japan will be $22 billion in 1985 and $48 billion in 1990. **********Q. What American products do you think could be competitive in Japan but are being kept out? A. Citrus fruits, certain kinds of semiconductor and telecommunications devices, computers, petrochemicals, machine tools, auto parts, furniture, cosmetics and health care products. **********They have trouble penetrating for a number of reasons. Tariffs, for instance. A glass of American orange juice costs $5 in Japan.  There is also a whole area known as ''performance requirements.'' It is very difficult for a U.S. supplier of telecommunications equipment to go to Japan and say: ''I build a fine product. Try it.'' They don't want the product. They want to see how you build it, and they want to test it at every step of the manufacturing process. They also want to know the extent to which you provide a happy home and recreational activities for your employees. **********Q. Do American companies continue to hold a substantial competitive lead over the Japanese in high technology? A. The Japanese are in every area that is the wave of the future. They are not dominant in the leading edge of semiconductors and computers, but they are in those areas, and it would be absolutely foolish to underestimate their competence. **********I have asked this rhetorical question of a number of people: Would it be a matter of concern if by the end of this decade the U.S.  Defense Department had to rely on imports from Japan for substantial quantities of computers, semiconductors and telecommunication devices? I think there is at least a 50 percent probability that is going to happen. **********Q. How can American industry keep from conceding more ground to the Japanese? A. We can't let the Japanese have a protected home environment with assured sales from which to launch overseas competition. Selling in the Japanese market will help American companies learn more about the nature of competition. **********We have to make absolutely sure we are competitive, which means doing everything we can domestically to satisfy our American customers here. If we do that, I think it is going to be very difficult to keep us out of the Japanese market. **********Also, we have to train more engineers. **********Q. What is the Reagan Administration doing to improve the competitiveness of U.S. business? A. The President's economic recovery program and deregulation will help foster a healthy economy and our ability to compete. You can't be internationally competitive if your domestic economy is sick. **********In addition, we are going to make a sustained effort on a comprehensive basis to address the Japanese market-access problem.  It would be very helpful if we could find a way to cooperate with the Japanese Government at the highest level to help alter attitudes - not to change the fabric of Japanese society but to change fundamentally the way Japanese consumers look at foreign products.

Indian officials said that the talks would be held in September with a visit by an Indian delegation to Peking. **********Mrs. Gandhi also said that she had accepted an invitation to visit China at a mutually convenient date. **********First Visit by Top Aide Since '60 **********Mr. Huang's visit here was the first by a top-ranking Chinese leader since Prime Minister Zhou Enlai came to India in 1960. During his three days of talks, he appeared to have concentrated on building new friendship and getting India to agree to seek an early negotiated settlement of the border dispute. **********The two nations went to war in 1962 over a Chinese claim to vast Indian territories along the 2,500-mile Himalayan border. The Chinese seized, and still hold, a large piece of territory in Ladakh in the western sector but they later withdrew from the eastern sector in India's northeastern frontier region. **********The border dispute long kept the two Asian giants at loggerheads, but in the last few years both have tried to establish normal contacts and resolve their differences by negotiations. Initiative Taken by India **********The first major initiative was taken by India in 1979 when Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was then Foreign Minister, visited Peking. Mr.  Vajpayee was received well by the Chinese but his trip ended in failure because of the sudden attack carried out by the Chinese against Vietnam, a friend of India. **********Last year Mr. Huang was scheduled to return the visit but he canceled his trip after Mrs. Gandhi's Government recognized the Soviet-backed regime of Heng Samrin in Cambodia. **********Mr. Huang spent many hours in discussions here, talking mostly with Foreign Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao on Soviet involvement in Afghanistan and the Vietnamese presence in Cambodia. The views of the two sides on these matters were sharply at variance, according to officials, but these questions were relegated to the background. **********Mr. Huang said at a news conference that he was ''optimistic and positive'' about a ''fair, comprehensive and reasonable'' settlement of the boundary question. **********He was asked whether the settlement he envisaged would include any return of territory to India. ''The question involves a controversy and I would not like to address myself to it,'' he replied. **********Mr. Huang was also blunt in stating that the Chinese had not changed their attitude in disputes over Kashmir and Sikkim. China has sided with Pakistan on the longstanding Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir. Peking has also denounced the merger of Sikkim, formerly an autonomous Himalayan kingdom, with India in 1974 and has refused to recognize it. **********Nevertheless, Mr. Huang said that both sides had adopted ''a forward-looking attitude'' during the discussions and had agreed that the ''dispute and differences should not be allowed to stand in the way of developing our bilateral relations.''

Elsewhere, private citizens, perhaps inspired by the success of a similar drive in New York City, have begun fund-raising efforts to buy the vests for officers. **********Homicide Rate Is Down **********The shootings and the public outcries have come after a year in which Canada's homicide rate fell for a third straight time since capital punishment was abolished. According to Statistics Canada, in 1979 Canada had 579 homicide incidents, down from 616 in 1978 and 637 in 1977. For the first six months of 1980 violent crimes were up 4.8 percent over the same 1979 period, but homicides were down 9.1 percent. **********The death penalty was abolished in Canada in 1976, although some private groups, notably policemen, have since sought its reinstitution. First-degree murder is now punishable by a 25-year prison term without parole. Second-degree murder draws a 10- to 25-year sentence without the possibility of parole. **********The flurry of activity over the vests followed the recent incidents that left one policeman and a filling-station attendant dead and four other officers seriously wounded. One officer, Constable Larry Johnson of Hamilton, owes his life to a thick notebook that stopped a bullet headed for his heart. **********The most dramatic recent shooting occurred during the New Year's weekend when a gun store was broken into in Mattawa, about 180 miles north of Toronto. Shortly afterward, about midnight New Year's Day, Chester Blackmore, a service-station attendant in Burk's Falls, Ontario, was shot and killed after pumping $14 in fuel into a car.  The car then sped away. A witness, believing it to be a hit-and-run accident, alerted Ontario Provincial Police. Constable Is Shot 8 Times **********Apparently suspicious of a passing car, Constable Rick Verdecchia stopped the vehicle to check for a dented fender or other damage. Not finding any, he radioed an all-clear message. He was then shot eight times and dumped in a snowdrift, and his cruiser was moved off the road. **********Later that weekend, farther south, another constable, Neil Hurtubise, stopped a speeder and, as he approached the car, was shot five times in the face and chest. He managed to radio a call for help, however, and his accurate description set off an all-night manhunt with helicopters and dogs. Mr. Hurtubise is recovering. **********The assailants' car was found abandoned. After tracking them for three hours through snow-covered bush country, officers found a parked van. Inside, the officers found two heavily armed but unresistant suspects, Gary Fitzgerald, 18 years old, and Joseph Schoenenberger, 17, both from Windsor, Ontario. Both were charged with murder. **********The next day in Hamilton, a port city of 312,000 on the western end of Lake Ontario, Constable Johnson's notebook saved his life during a backyard struggle with a suspected housebreaker. And on Christmas Eve two patrolmen were shot and wounded by a murder suspect in Toronto, which has seen six officers fatally shot in recent years. **********The funeral of Constable Verdecchia, who was 35 years old, drew more than 1,200 fellow officers from the United States and across Canada.

This included provisions for a shortened workweek and a sticker system to keep vehicles off the road on designated days. **********The moves followed the abolition earlier this week of yet another Carter energy measure: requirements that the temperature of many buildings be kept below 65 degrees in winter and left to rise above 78 degrees in summer. **********The previously proposed appliance standards, the Department of Energy said, would not be imposed until it conducted a new economic analysis of them.

Need for Access to West **********These developments, according to some Western diplomats in Havana, underscore Cuba's determination to put more flexibility in its own economy and to gain better access to Western products, markets and financial resources, despite the United States trade embargo, which was imposed in February 1961 in response to Cuban confiscation of United States property and growing hostilities between the two countries. **********The drive for improved economic ties with the West, which now accounts for about 20 percent of Cuba's foreign trade, may also explain, these sources say, why President Fidel Castro's public responses to the Reagan Administration's harsh criticisms have been relatively restrained, leaving the door open for improvement in trade relations. **********According to Lawrence H. Theriot, Cuban desk officer in the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of East-West Trade, Cuba has $2.9 billion in external and hard-currency debt, of which $1.9 billion is to commercial banks at interest rates that float with current high market rates.  The other $1 billion is to official export credit agencies.  The interest alone on these loans creates a strong demand in Cuba for hard currencies - currencies that can be freely converted under rules agreed to by the International Monetary Fund. **********Mr. Theriot and Amadeo Blanco Valdes-Fauly, the Cuban Deputy Minister of External Commerce, said 1980 was a very good year for Cuba in the world marketplace.  Sugar, which accounts for 83 percent of Cuba's exports, reached a peak at 40 cents a pound and, although the harvest was poor, helped give Cuba a $500 million hard-currency trade surplus, against a $70 million deficit in 1979. **********Sugar prices, however, have dipped this year, and another significant source of dollars, visits home by Cuban exiles, seems likely to continue to dwindle.  These visits, which in 1979 yielded between $100 and $150 million by Mr. Theriot's estimate, this year will bring only $40 million, according to Jesus Jimenez, vice president of Intur, the Cuban state tourism organization. **********The Cayo Largo tourist project, which is expected to be under way by 1985, is an effort to attract the big-spending luxury trade, which now goes elsewhere in the Caribbean to beachcomb, relax and shop.  Cuban hotels are generally clean, but hot water and good service range from sporadic to nonexistent, and there is little to buy. **********On Cayo Largo, which lies in an archipelago east of the Isle of Youth, Mr. Jimenez hopes that 5,000 rooms in hotels, villas and cabanas can be developed in partnership with private foreign investors. **********Depending on how much they invest, these would go into partnerships with one of the 25 companies run by Intur, and these partnerships would take over the management and share the profits from the resort developments. **********There are more than 10 miles of wide beaches on the island, coral reefs and sunken ships nearby for scuba divers.  A golf course is planned, along with shopping and restaurants.  The accommodations will be low-density: \"We don't want to make it a Miami Beach,\" Mr.  Jimenez said. **********No casino gambling will be allowed, and it is unlikely that Cuban citizens will be able to shop in the stores for foreigners, which will ask for payment in foreign exchange or credit cards.  (MasterCard and Diners Club are already accepted at hotels in Havana.) **********According to Mr. Jimenez, Intur is now negotiating with a Japanese group, a Canadian company and Club Mediterranee, which he said wants to build a resort on the island and helped design the finishing touches on a 71-room Cuban hotel, the island's first, which will open next month. **********The Cubans are finishing a two-mile runway to accomodate jumbo jets at the island's airport, but there is as yet no tower and no terminal building. **********The Canadian group, negotiating to build the Hotel Lindamar, is CR International, which is based in Ontario and linked to the business empire of Cyrus Eaton Jr., who since the 1960's has arranged the construction of 11 major hotels in five Soviet-bloc countries and who withdrew from a 1978 project ot build a resort complex elsewhere in Cuba. **********Clara Reece, a British subject, is president of both CR International and Tower International, an Eaton enterprise, and she suggested that Transfer Embryo of Canada, an Ontario concern that freezes cattle embryos for transplants, send the Cuban Government a proposal. **********The Cuban dairy industry is successful and highly developed, and Fidel Castro's older brother, Ramon Castro, takes an active interest in it.  The Cubans replied to the Canadians that they would like to send five veterinarians and four others to see the project.  Two of those in the delegation were officials of Commercial Muralla. **********Dr. Barry Callaghan, technical director of Transfer Embryo, said the name Commercial Muralla meant nothing to him - he thought he was to deal with a delegation from the Cuban Ministry of AGriculture and from Ramon Castro's farm. **********His unfamilarity with the firm is not unusual.  Requests for information about Commercial Muralla were declined by Cuban authorities in Havana. United States officials, who suspect that Commercial Muralla is another in a series of Cuban companies that have been set up to get around the United States trade embargo, know little about the company, other than that it was organized in the summer of 1980 to sell products to the West and to make a profit.  It is organized outside of the usual foreign trade channels and reports directly to high officials in the Cuban Government. It seems to be growing quickly. **********In Havana, before the revolution, Muralla was a street where businessmen of European descent started small \"hole-in-the-wall\" enterprises that often grew into huge concerns. **********According to State Department officials, Commercial Muralla has been corresponding with many American companies.  And it was Commercial Muralla that handled Cuba's sales of cement to Mexico, which needed it for construction projects. **********For Cuba, more hard currency means more access to foreign technology, which, in turn, can generate more production.  Sometimes, as in the case of the cattle embryos, the increase would be for domestic consumption. At other times, it could generate more output for export. **********Cuba's second major export, for example, is nickel, and the country is now renovating its two existing plants and building a new plant at Punta Gorda. **********In March, during a visit by Canadian experts, Cuban officials said they were having difficulty with Soviet-made equipment and thought they could increase the output of nickel as much as 20 percent if they had Western technology.  An improvement of 1 percent, they said, would raise profits $4 million. **********Production increases, which are not reflected in official statistics, they explained, can and are being sold in the West for hard currency. Reports of this conversation come from reliable non-Cuban sources close to the discussions, but the truth of what the Cuban officials said could not be confirmed. **********Lorne C. Varcoe, president of the Canadian company, Dorr-Oliver Canada Ltd., would not comment in a telephone interview other than to say, \"You're on target\" and to observe that such a report \"could cause problems\" for the Cubans, with whom his company still wants very much to do business."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/26/business/congress-aims-to-cut-us-credit.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1981-05-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 861, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONGRESS AIMS TO CUT U.S. CREDIT", "print_headline": "CONGRESS AIMS TO CUT U.S. CREDIT", "body_text": " **********In handing President Reagan a resounding budget victory, both the House of Representatives and the Senate also acted in accordance with the President's wishes to check the rapid growth of Federal borrowing, which many economists consider a major contributor to the rise in interest rates. **********While most attention has been focused on the Government's direct spending and receipts, the less visible off-budget deficit, incorporating Federal credit demands, has been cut back significantly in the parallel versions of bills from both chambers. **********For the 1982 fiscal year, beginning in October, the House and Senate both voted to trim more than $3 billion from the credit, or off-budget deficit, projected for the current fiscal year, an amount of nearly $23 billion. **********Perhaps more significant, Congressional budget aides noted, the total direct and indirect Federal credit requirements next year would fall to 28 percent of all the credit in the financial system, from 33.5 percent envisaged in fiscal 1981. **********Private Economists Encouraged **********Although problems could still arise, for example, in financing to build up oil stocks in the strategic petroleum reserve, the budget monitors in the private sector have been encouraged by the Congressional action. **********''It is the vast amounts of credit pre-emption by the Federal Government, including guarantees and off-budget financing, that is placing excessive inflationary pressure on our system,'' said economist Alan Greenspan, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. **********''That Congress is now acquiescing to the cutbacks represents a very important change in overall policy,'' he continued.  Both chambers restricted direct loans and Federally guaranteed loans, and accepted many of the restrictions sought by the Administration on the total lending of the Federal Financing Bank, an institution set up at the request of the Treasury in 1973 to streamline Federal credit operations. It borrows from the Treasury and uses the funds to finance a score of programs run by other agencies. Cuts From Both Houses **********Both houses voted to reduce Federal Financing Bank lending by more than $3 billion in 1982, compared with the $4.7 billion reduction that had been sought by the Administration. The Federal Financing Bank accounts for most of the approximately $85 billion in Federal lending guarantees. **********They also sought to check two activities of the bank that have led to increasing off-budget lending activity in previous years: the ability of the bank to convert loan guarantees of an agency to an off-budget direct loan; and the purchase of loans from the agencies, again to remove the spending from the budget accounts to an offbudget item. **********As an example of the former, the Farmers Home Administration would guarantee a mortgage for a farmer who would in turn take that guarantee to the Federal Financing Bank, which would make him an offbudget loan at a favorable interest rate. **********The budget resolutions of both Houses seek to check the growth of these so-called loan originations of the bank by holding their total to $11.7 billion in 1982, compared with $11.3 billion in 1981. In 1977 the total was $5.3 billion. **********As an illustration of the latter practice, known as a loan asset sale, the Rural Electrification Administration would make a loan to a rural electric cooperative, which in turn would sell the note to the Federal Financing Bank. In this way the transaction would again be neatly erased from the budget. **********The budget resolutions of the two chambers would sharply reduce loan asset sales to $6.3 billion in fiscal 1982 from a projected $14 billion in 1981. Signs of Credit Restraint **********The overall figures for direct lending and loan guarantees are further indications of the degree of restraint that Congress wants to apply in the Federal credit activities. **********Although there are small accounting differences in the two legislative proposals, the overall direct lending figure for fiscal 1982 has been trimmed to a bit over $50 billion from the $73.5 billion for fiscal 1981 projected in the latest estimates of the Office of Management and Budget. **********Loan guarantees - in which the Federal Government underwrites a loan in the private sector, as in mortgage loan guarantees to veterans, or as was done recently to prevent the collapse of the Chrysler Corporation - are to be kept at $85 billion in 1982, roughly the same level as that projected for 1981. **********That the total would stay unchanged is still considered a victory for restraint in light of the 50 percent increase in guaranteed loans between fiscal 1980 and 1981. **********Most loan guarantee programs are financed directly in the securities market, giving rise to the belief that they are substantially different from direct loans and involve less Government intervention in traditional borrower-lender relationships. **********But according to Roger W. Mehle, the new Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, such a belief is a ''myth.'' ''Every dollar of Government-guaranteed debt financed in the public marketplace,'' Mr. Mehle observed, ''is like a Treasury borrowing and has a similar negative impact on private-sector rates.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/02/business/hospital-mortgage-group-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOSPITAL MORTGAGE GROUP reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "HOSPITAL MORTGAGE GROUP reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/20/world/swearing-in-of-papandreou-expected-to-come-tomorrow.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 494, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SWEARING-IN OF PAPANDREOU EXPECTED TO COME TOMORROW", "print_headline": "SWEARING-IN OF PAPANDREOU EXPECTED TO COME TOMORROW", "body_text": " **********Andreas Papandreou, whose Socialist party surprised even its most militant members with the extent of its election victory yesterday, is expected to be sworn in as Prime Minister on Wednesday. **********With the defeat of the pro-Western New Democracy Party, Prime Minister George Rallis is due to submit the resignation of his Cabinet to President Constantine Caramanlis tomorrow morning.

Michael Derchin, vice president and airline analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, cites the state of the economy, the recent threat of an air traffic controllers' strike, fare increases, aggressive competition from new and regional airlines and fare discounting in May, which probably induced some travelers to fly then instead of later. **********Mr. Derchin predicted that domestic passenger traffic on the trunk carriers, as 10 of the nation's large airlines are known, would turn out to be 5 to 8 percent less this month than it was in June 1980 - or maybe even less than that. The trunk airlines are American, Braniff, Continental, Delta, Eastern, Northwest, Pan American, Trans World, United and Western. **********Amid flight uncertainty surrounding the controllers' threat to walk out on June 22, many travelers chose not to fly. As a result, the country's scheduled airlines lost more than $40 million in ticket sales, the Air Transport Association, the main industry organization, estimated last week. Impact of Fare Changes **********Airline passenger traffic in May was relatively strong. But Robert J. Joedicke, an airline expert and first vice president at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, described domestic airline operations as an area of ''pernicious weakness in travel demand as a result of fare increases'' last winter. **********May's domestic and international travel on scheduled airlines was 3.6 percent higher than in May 1980, the Air Transport Association reported. It was the first year-to-year increase for any month since February 1980. For the first five months of this year, however, passenger traffic was 5.8 percent below the level of a year earlier. **********In appraising this summer's outlook, analysts declared that precise predictions were not feasible. ''It's very difficult to quantify,'' said Mr. Derchin of Oppenheimer. ''It's hard to read the booking patterns for the trunk airlines. Restrictions on discount fares have loosened up, and it's a lot easier for travelers to make last-minute arrangements.'' **********On the positive side, Mr. Derchin said: ''International traffic has been the bright spot this year, and advance international bookings look very strong, probably because of the strengthening of the dollar abroad. Travel is getting a lot cheaper.'' August Surge Expected **********Sally C. McElwreath, T.W.A.'s director of public affairs, said: ''On the international side, we expect a strong surge of passenger traffic in August as Americans realize the growing strength of the dollar, and the outlook for the rest of the summer domestically looks slightly higher than last year for us.'' **********For his part, Mr. Joedicke said the prospects for airline travel demand during the summer vacation period were enhanced by ''the extremely low promotional fares being offered in this peak season for some of the major travel markets.'' **********The airlines' efforts to attract additional passengers have been taking many forms. Last week United Airlines decided to match the new fare to Hawaii introduced by Western Airlines and Trans World Airlines. Both United's new fare and the joint Western-T.W.A. fare slash as much as $216 off existing discount round-trip tickets. But the carriers are offering their deep discounts for somewhat different sets of cities in the continental United States, and other provisions of their offers differ."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/02/business/geothermal-resources-international-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/11/business/advertising-grey-agency-adds-scoundrel-fragrance.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-05-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Grey Agency Adds Scoundrel Fragrance", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Grey Agency Adds Scoundrel Fragrance", "body_text": " **********Grey Advertising started the weekend with the good news that it would be adding Scoundrel fragrance to its fat kit of Revlon assignments. **********The perfume was introduced last September by the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, which recently resigned the brand after losing the Tums business out of Revlon's Norcliff-Thayer Division to Jordan, Case & McGrath. **********According to Leading National Advertisers, Scoundrel was backed by almost $3 million in measured media in the last quarter alone.

In that earlier article, I contended that, ranked in descending order of their probability, this increase in military spending would severely weaken this country's high-technology civilian industries as materials, equipment and skilled personnel are moved from civilian to military pursuits; produce shortages of materials, equipment and skilled personnel that will create ''bottleneck'' inflation in the sectors where the shortages occur, and stimulate general excess demand inflation in the rest of the economy just as it did during the Vietnam War. **********Perhaps because there is no counterargument, the economic defenders of the Reagan Administration's defense budget have been completely silent when it comes to the first point. Since our high-technology civilian industries exist in the same regions of the country and demand the same equipment and personnel as our military industries, a rapid military buildup can only occur by taking resources out of the high-technolgy civilian sectors. **********The effects are going to be particularly severe in the semiconductor industry since it is going to be facing a Japanese onslaught during the next three years. Since our military allies but economic competitors - mainly West Germany and Japan - are not planning to increase their defense spending, our computer industry will be hemorrhaging personnel just when it needs its best brains to survive. **********Engineers and skilled blue-collar workers will be moving from civilian computer companies, such as Wang Laboratories, to military contractors, such as the Raytheon Company, in the Boston area. **********The economic defenders of the Reagan Administration's defense budget also concede that bottleneck inflation will exist, but argue that it will be small. Bottleneck inflation added 1.2 percentage points to the nation's inflation rate during the first two years of the Vietnam War. Although it is true that 1.2 percentage points looks larger relative to a 1.7 percent inflation rate in 1965 than it does relative to 12.4 percent in 1980, it is still important. **********There is also every reason to believe that the economy has become more inflationary-prone with the experience of the past 15 years and that the same bottleneck would create more inflation in 1982 than it did in 1966. **********Bottlenecks depend upon how fast resources are being transferred from the civilian to the military economy. In the Reagan defense budget, military spending is to rise 9.1 percent a year after correcting for inflation. Given the time it takes to train new skilled blue-collar workers and engineers, there is no way that the supply of skills can keep up with this growth rate. **********There is also every reason to believe that the President has underestimated his defense budget. Whatever happens in the rest of the economy, demand will push up prices for military hardware. It will take more money than is now estimated to buy the equipment that the Defense Department wants. In addition, the President's budget has not allowed for the increased training and personnel costs that will be necessary to man all this new equipment. **********V IEWED as the fraction of the gross national product that must be reallocated to defense, the size of the burden depends upon whether you do or do not believe in the President's supply-side miracle - a much higher rate of growth in the G.N.P. According to the President's economic projection, the economy's real growth rate will average 4.4 percent from 1982 through 1986. If this occurs, the higher military budget will rise from 5.7 to 7.1 percent of the G.N.P. **********But in order for the economy to grow at 4.4 percent a year, productivity has to grow 3 percent. But productivity growth has been below 3 percent for the last 16 years, and actually falling in the last three years. Productivity will not recover quickly. New factories, better-trained workers, and new management techniques will all be necessary. **********Suppose that productivity were to stop falling but did not rebound, leaving the economy's growth rate at only 1.4 percent a year. In this case, the military budget would rise an extra 2.4 percentage points, to 8.1 percent of the G.N.P., from 5.7. At its peak, Vietnam required an extra 1.8 percent of G.N.P. **********The economic defenders of the Reagan military budget are correct in saying that general inflationary pressures can be controlled if we raise taxes and cut civilian spending enough. But is Mr. Reagan planning to do so? **********In President Reagan's projections, the Federal budget is to be balanced in 1984, with a $28 billion surplus in 1986. But this movement toward a balanced budget depends upon the supply-side miracle and that instantaneous recovery in productivity growth. If productivity does not recover and the economy's real growth rate is 3 percentage points less than Mr. Reagan predicts, there will be a $55 billion deficit in 1984 and an $86 billion deficit in 1986. In addition, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the President is underestimating 1982 expenditures by $25 billion. Add $25 billion to spending and you have a deficit of $111 billion in fiscal 1986. **********President Reagan's economic defenders also point out that unemployment is higher and capacity utilization lower in 1982 than it was in 1965. Those unemployed resources could be absorbed to expand defense production. **********But there is a problem. Those unemployed resources are not in the right geographic areas, industries or occupations necessary to expand defense production. There is also a question whether there is a lot of excess capacity on an inflation-adjusted basis. More than 7 percent of the population is unemployed, but up to now we have been told that more unemployment was necessary to stop inflation. **********I have a lot of sympathy for the view that America's inflation was not caused by excess aggregate demand and that more unemployment will not cure inflation, but it is interesting to note that those who just a few months ago were arguing that more unemployment was necessary to stop inflation are today arguing that the unemployed can be put to work in defense industries without creating inflation. **********One wonders what conservatives would be saying about inflation if President Reagan were planning to expand nondefense spending by $181 billion a year by 1986. ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Lester C.

Its showing was so strong that, barring an unexpected upset, it should hold a majority in the Assembly after the second round of voting next Sunday. **********Today's vote confirmed the major shift in France's politics that began with the election as President last month of the Socialist leader Francois Mitterrand, and it confirmed it more decisively than the Socialists themselves had expected. **********The voting seems to guarantee that Mr. Mitterrand will be able to introduce without serious parliamentary opposition the economic and social changes he has promised. It also seems to guarantee that he will be able to do this, if he chooses, without including Communists in his Cabinet. **********Almost 50 Percent Increase **********In France's two-round system, today's voting decides the two toprunning candidates for each Assembly seat. In next week's election, voters will make a final choice for each seat. **********Computer projections gave the Socialist candidates for the Assembly's 491 seats between 37 and 39 percent of the vote, an increase of almost 50 percent over Mr. Mitterrand's total in the first round of the Presidential vote. Communist Party candidates won a projected 16 percent, thus failing to make any significant progress after their big setback last month. **********Indeed, a significant result of today's vote was the confirmation that the Communist Party has been seriously weakened. After averaging a bit over 20 percent of the vote over the past decade, the party had slipped to just over 15 percent in the first round of the presidential elections. **********It was unclear, however, whether many Communists voted for Mr.  Mitterrand out of a new-found loyalty or because they thought their own candidate, Georges Marchais, had no chance to win. The fact that these lost voters have remained lost, despite the party's urging that a strong Communist delegation to the Assembly was necessary if real change was to take place, means that the party is in serious trouble.  Support for Front-Runners **********Because the Communists and Socialists have agreed to support in the second round whichever of their candidates leads after the first round, and given that the Socialists are mostly the front-runners, next Sunday's vote is expected to give them between 280 and 320 seats. At present the Socialists hold 117 Assembly seats. The number of Communist seats is expected to fall from 89 to about 50. **********Against what is both the biggest victory of the French left in this century and the biggest victory for the Socialists, the candidates of the right have won a projected 44 percent of the vote. **********The Gaullists, followers of Jacques Chirac, have taken about 21 percent of that, the followers of former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing about 19 percent and the rest has gone to splinter groups.  Projecting the Gaullist vote would produce about 75-80 seats; the supporters of Mr. Giscard d'Estaing might win 65 or 70. Complex Electoral System **********The figures may vary next Sunday; the mathematics of the French electoral system are too complex for precise projection in the second round. In addition, the electorate could vote differently. Finally, only 70 percent of the electorate voted today, the lowest figure in 20 years, and if many of those who abstained decided to vote next Sunday the figures could change. **********Tonight, leaders of the conservative groups were calling on those who stayed at home to came out and vote, figuring that more of them would suport the right than the left. **********The Communists' troubles were confirmed indirectly tonight by Mr.  Marchais, who admitted that it was a ''difficult'' time and indicated that a period of self-examination was likely. **********The virtually certain ability of the Socialist Party to dominate the National Assembly for the next five years along with its ally, the small, centrist Radical Left Movement, raised the question here tonight about whether the Socialists would continue their negotiations with the Communists on a common program that would permit the appointment of a few Communist Cabinet officials. **********Socialist spokesmen were ambiguous on the subject, but Interior Minister Raston Defferre stressed that although talks would continue it was still necessary for the Communists to accept a stiff list of Socialist policy conditions. Among these are condemnation of the Soviet Union for its military presence in Afghanistan and approval of the Western stand on nuclear missiles in Europe. **********Today's low voter turnout intrigued French commentators. It was the first warm and sunny Sunday in a cold and rainy spring, but, perhaps more important, the French have already been called on to vote twice in the past month and will have to vote again next Sunday. Fairly Lethargic Campaign **********The campaign over the past two weeks was fairly lethargic in comparison with the one that preceded the Presidential voting. The basic argument of the Socialists was that the French had decided on major changes in their social and economic life by electing Mr.  Mitterrand, and that the only consistent and intelligent thing to do was to confirm the decision by giving him the legislative majority he will need. **********The Gaullists and the Giscard d'Estaing followers argued, without much enthusiasm, that the French should do precisely the opposite.

The crown was last devalued in August 1977. **********Along with the devaluation, the Government announced an immediate price freeze to help slow domestic inflation and a planned reduction in the national value-added sales tax to spur Sweden's beleaguered industry. **********The minority center-liberal Government of Prime Minister Thorbjoern Faelldin has been under pressure to restore the competitive position of Swedish industry and stimulate exports. But, according to economic analysts, the devaluation will bring mixed blessings to the economy. **********While the cheaper crown will help exports of Swedish products manufactured by such giants as Volvo, Electrolux and L.. Ericsson, the devaluation will also raise the price of imported crude oil and other products vital to Swedish industry. **********Today's devaluation is against a basket of 15 currencies most important to Sweden's trade.  The basket is made up of a complex system of weighted currency components that are proportional to the average share of each of the 15 major countries in Sweden's foreign trade over the five years since the 1977 devaluation. The countries include such major trading partners as the United States, West Germany, Britain, Norway and Denmark. **********If the dollar rises against the crown, as it has over the past few months, the currency basket's index will automatically compensate for the increase by permitting the crown's value against other currencies in the basket to appreciate, financial analysts said. **********Sweden's value-added tax, to be lowered from 23.46 percent, to 20 percent, pending parliamentary approval in the fall, has been one of the highest sales taxes in the world.

''We must have a slower rate of expenditure if we are to resolve the problems of imbalance in Sweden's economy,'' Mr. Faelldin told a news conference. **********Flagging production, swelling imports, slackening investment and gaping budget and current account balance of payments holes have been the hallmarks of the Swedish economy over the last two or three years, the economic analysts said. **********As part of today's measures, the Government also announced a $115 million employment program calling for more construction projects in the public sector, housing and road building."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/16/business/pushing-the-maxwell-product-at-general-foods.html": {"writer_name": "Sandra Salmans", "pub_date": "1981-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1808, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PUSHING THE MAXWELL PRODUCT AT GENERAL FOODS", "print_headline": "PUSHING THE MAXWELL PRODUCT AT GENERAL FOODS", "body_text": " **********WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.  JOHN SUSKO, as the photographs papering his office attest, has played on the Maxwell House football team. Also the softball team, the tennis team, the basketball team and the baseball team. At one time or another, he has captained them all. **********Off the field, Mr. Susko is being judged on both the qualities thus represented: leadership and teamwork. The sandy-haired, sunburned 30-year-old is a brand manager for Maxwell House instant, which is the best-selling instant coffee in the United States and part of the coffee division of General Foods, critically important to the company. As such, he must tread the line between pushing his own product and playing in the larger context of corporate wellbeing. **********''We're fighting Maxwell House regular, Sanka, Brim,'' he said, citing some of the division's leading brands. But at the same time, he added, ''we look at ourselves as part of the Maxwell House Coffee Company.'' **********Such ambiguity is the lot of the brand manager, a low-level but key position and a well-trod rung to the top at many consumer goods companies. In brand management - a system elevated, if not invented, by packaged goods giant Procter & Gamble - an individual such as Mr.  Susko manages the market for his brand, participating in advertising, packaging and even production decisions, as well as overseeing promotion through trade discounts and consumer couponing. **********The brand manager is expected to vanquish all comers, notably Nestle's Nescafe and P.& G.'s Folger's. At the same time, his objectives - and his budget to achieve them - are defined by a multitude of bosses, who must weigh his needs against those of other General Foods coffee brand managers. **********Furthermore, recent trends at corporations have curbed the brand manager's freedom. ''Marketing has become more specialized, leading to development of separate corporate departments for media and promotion,'' Stephen Greyser, a marketing professor with the Harvard Business School, said. Indeed, at General Foods there is a separate consumer promotions department in coffee that comes up with coupon ideas, there are advertising specialists within the division, and all the Maxwell-brand coffees are advertised under one umbrella. **********''Also, the greater use of formal strategic planning models at the corporate level puts restraints on what individual brands are all about,'' Professor Greyser said. On General Foods's product strategy matrix, for example, Maxwell House instant has been classified as a ''maintenance'' product. That is better than a ''sell-off'' product, but less exciting than a ''grow'' product. **********Nonetheless, ''there's still a lot of responsibility, a lot of visibility in brand management,'' Mr. Greyser added. ''For a relatively young person, particularly in a consumer goods company, it is still an excellent first step to understanding what's going on.'' In short, it's an excellent showcase for up-and-coming managers, whatever the position on the matrix. **********The giant foods company had sales in the fiscal year ending last March 28 of $6.6 billion, of which $2.7 billion came from grocery coffee. Admittedly, General Foods has a host of well-known products, including Birds Eye, Kool-Aid, Jell-O and Minute Rice, and has lately been trying to broaden its business base, notably through the acquisition last May of Oscar Mayer. But the company was built on coffee, and most of its top executives have served time in the coffee division. James L. Ferguson, the current chairman and chief executive officer, is the first in that position who did not come up through coffee. (His experience was mainly in Birds Eye.) **********''If you can market coffee, you can market anything,'' observed Mr. Susko, explaining the product's importance as a training ground.  ''Coffee is a big-selling, heavily-marketed product. There's local competition. Commodity prices change constantly. You almost learn the business in a building-block kind of way,'' he added. **********The job does not demand personal brand loyalty - Mr. Susko, who does@n't even like the taste of coffee, drinks Tab and beer. It does demand a quick grasp of a wide variety of factors affecting any product thrown at the manager, and, Mr. Susko insists, it is ''fun.'' **********''These packaged goods companies have lots of young, interesting people,'' he explained. (The average age in his division is 30 years.) At a relatively early age, he added, ''You get pretty good responsibility.'' **********So far, his path has been fairly typical of brand managers. After studying economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Mr. Susko went to work for Procter & Gamble, peddling Tide, Cheer and P.& G.'s newest detergent, ERA, in Philadelphia. He left to acquire an M.B.A. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Alfred P. Sloan School of Management, with a summer break in marketing at Coca-Cola. **********In 1978, at the age of 27, Mr. Susko joined Maxwell House as an associate brand manager.  In the past three years, he has: marketed regular and instant coffee, mainly through trade promotions, west of the Mississippi; managed Yuban, General Foods's premium-priced brand; served as the main advertising agency contact on Maxwell House regular and instant, overseeing the transition in television commercials from Cora, the shopkeeper who harangued young couples, to ''that good-to-the-lastdrop feeling,'' crooned by Ray Charles. **********Three months ago, he took charge of Maxwell House instant, at the $40,000 to $50,000 salary range for brand managers at General Foods.  Such mobility is also typical of brand management, and Mr. Susko does not expect to stay for more than a year with Mick, as his product is called. Next on the agenda, in all likelihood, is decaffeinated coffee, and possibly a stint in new product development. **********As brand manager, Mr. Susko said, ''My most important priority is to meet the volume objectives for the year.'' This may not be easy, especially in a declining market. Annual coffee consumption in the United States has been slipping steadily since it peaked in 1962 at 40 gallons per capita, according to John Maxwell, first vicepresident, Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb. It fell to 27.8 gallons in 1980, and the decline is expected to continue, said Mr. Maxwell, noting that cold drinks are more compatible with the American lifestyle. **********F URTHERMORE, Mr. Maxwell noted, regular coffee, which had lost market share in recent years to instant coffee, is making a modest recovery - due perhaps to the new generation of cheap, fast electric drip coffee-makers. Instant coffee has leveled off, at less than 20 percent of the total market. **********Maxwell House instant has suffered from not only the declining market but also a surge in competition. Last year, P.& G., whose Folger's regular coffee outsells regular Maxwell House, brought out a new instant, High Point, that immediately captured 2.5 percent of the instant market; instant Folger's also gained share, to 11 percent. **********Mr. Susko's Maxwell House instant, which had peaked in 1972 with a 27 percent market share, slipped to 23.4 percent in 1979 and to 22.2 percent last year. Each market point is worth an estimated $12 million. **********In the long term, ''instant coffee's growth will come mainly from decaffeinated coffee,'' predicted Bruce Bramen, a category manager who is responsible for all Maxwell House-brand coffees. Still, Mr.  Bramen said, ''managing a business in a declining category is extra challenging.'' **********To manage his brand, Mr. Susko keeps his finger constantly on market's pulse. He confers almost daily with the four regional managers for the coffee division about promotions, arguing the best rates to give the trade, the wisdom of distributing a certain package size in a given market. He may talk to the consumer promotions department about ideas for coupons - will it be a 50-cents-off coupon? or a free coffee mug for three labels? - and discuss advertising strategy with the agency, Ogilvy & Mather. **********Up to half of Mr. Susko's time is spent in allocating his marketing budget. (He will not disclose its size, but General Foods' marketing budgets ''are huge,'' he said. ''I could probably retire on the rounding errors alone.'') The money is distributed two ways: through the trade - ''the products you see at the end of the supermarket aisle'' - and through consumer coupons. **********Nothing could sound more obvious, but in fact there is a delicate balancing act. ''You must look at external factors in the market,'' said Mr. Susko, citing the different regional methods of retailing.  Because there are many regional brands of coffee, and regional brands tend to market through trade promotions rather than coupons, Maxwell House and other national brands must try to match their specials.  ''Anything on the end of the aisle sells,'' Mr. Susko said. **********That is the policy in such markets as Chicago, where supermarket owners tend to feature and underwrite such promotions, offering a loss-leading ''$2.99 special,'' for example, placed prominently in the aisles rather than on the shelf, to lure shoppers into the store. **********But specials are avoided in other markets, such as Los Angeles, where groceries are sold heavily through discount stores. A General Foods trade promotion at 20 cents per jar there, for example, would produce only a modest markdown on the shelf; Folgers and Nescafe would be forced to follow suit, and ''all you've done is increase the cost of doing business,'' said Mr. Susko. **********In discount markets particularly, Mr. Susko said, ''consumer promotion is a more effective way to price differentiate,'' thus undercutting the competition through attractive coupon offers. But marketing directly to the consumer rather than via the trade can also be tricky. **********For one thing, while trade promotions virtually guarantee sales, consumers ignore most coupons (and thus the product). For another, the country has lately been swept by a wave of illegal coupon redemptions that costs couponers dearly. To prevent such abuses, General Foods, one of the nation's leading couponers, is issuing more coupons through the mail rather than as newspaper inserts. **********Mr. Susko allocates money for trade and consumer promotions at the start of each quarter, but the decision-making is anything but static. A change in the price of green coffee, an important factor in the price of the final product, can have a major impact on marketing decisions, and ''prices have been all over the place this year,'' he said. First, a glut brought prices tumbling down, then, last month, came news of a frost in Brazil. The cost of beans jumped 50 percent overnight. ''We look at different marketing scenarios all the time,'' said Mr. Susko. **********Every Monday morning, he pores over data from the A.C. Nielsen Company, measuring the previous week's sales against the targets set by the division. ''We're a little behind in volume now,'' he said, ''but we'll make it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/10/world/us-advisers-taking-care-in-el-salvador.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 625, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. ADVISERS TAKING CARE IN EL SALVADOR", "print_headline": "U.S. ADVISERS TAKING CARE IN EL SALVADOR", "body_text": " **********uf881 By EDWARD SCHUMACHER **********SAN SALVADOR, March 9 - The military advisers here live cautiously, avoiding publicity with almost as much care as they avoid the Marxist guerrillas who might want to shoot them. **********They have tried to blend in, but a group of several hundred journalists here has been hounding them for pictures and interviews.  The fear among the advisers is that they might become walking targets if pictures are published. **********At a news conference arranged by the United States Embassy today, one adviser, a helicopter maintenance instructor, said: ''What makes you nervous - and I'll be honest with you guys - is the press.

Nonetheless, in 15 minutes they painted a picture of apprehensive but patriotic American volunteers training capable and highly motivated Salvadorans. **********The maintenance instructor, a veteran of the Vietnam War, said there was ''no comparison'' between the Salvadoran soldiers and the South Vietnamese he had trained. He said the Salvadorans were superior in discipline, organization and motivation. **********''The Salvadorans' problem is not their capability,'' he said.  ''It's their support, their equipment. They are very capable. Their ingenuity is amazing.'' Helicopter Pilots Retrained **********The two officers are part of a helicopter training team of 14 that came here a month ago. The pilot said his job was mostly a matter of training Salvadorans to fly the 10 American Bell Huey transport helicopters on loan from the United States. The Salvadorans are already experienced in flying El Salvador's French-made helicopters.  The pilot said he trains four Salvadorans every five weeks. **********''The pilots are extremely capable, willing and eager to learn,'' he said.  The training, he said, takes place near the air base and the international airport.

Such attention is rated as exceptional here, for Mr. Sadat's visit is technically a private one. **********Yesterday Mr. Sadat said at a session of the European Parliament that he welcomed a plan approved in December by the Common Market.  The plan called for continued diplomatic efforts by the market to explore proposals that would guarantee Israel's security, gain Israel's withdrawal from occupied Arab territories and provide for Palestinian self-determination. **********This morning, at a news conference before leaving Luxembourg, Mr.  Sadat suggested that European involvement might go so far as to provide troops for enforcing any security guarantee worked out in an eventual settlement. Talks Through the Afternoon **********The meeting between Mr. Sadat and Mr. Giscard d'Estaing included a lunch and talks through the afternoon at the President's official residence, Elysee Palace. Mr. Sadat will remain here until Friday, when he will hold a news conference, but no further talks are scheduled. **********Mr. Sadat's visit marked a noticeable shift in the strained relations that have existed between Egypt and France in the recent past. **********Of all the Western European countries, France has tended to be the most critical of the Camp David accords and among those most favorable to recognizing the Palestine Liberation Organization. In recent years, furthermore, the French concentrated on cementing relations with the hard-line Arab countries, such as Iraq and Libya. **********All these things tended to put them at odds with Mr. Sadat, who was offended by the criticism of the Camp David agreeement and, more specifically, by the diversion of French political and economic efforts to Arab countries that were not only more radical but had more oil as well. Diplomatic Effort Complicated **********A number of recent developments have inclined the French to alter their course. The Iran-Iraq war, and other splits among the more radical Moslem nations, have complicated the French diplomatic effort. The P.L.O., weakened by the quarrels among its supporters, seems less of a sure thing, at least in the short run. France's relations with Libya have deteriorated steadily, most notably with the recent Libyan push into Chad. **********All this has made the French Government more interested in a rapprochement with Mr. Sadat. Furthermore, France's effort to rally Chad's neighbors against further Libyan expansion finds a natural ally in Mr. Sadat, an old enemy of Libya's leader, Col. Muammar elQaddafi. **********In addition, French officials studying the Middle East situation see possibilities for diplomacy that were not previously apparent to them. For one thing they are betting that the Labor Party will come to power in Israel in this summer's elections. **********Although Israel's relations with France have been far sourer than those of Egypt, Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader, visited Paris a few weeks ago. 'More Reasonable' Attitude **********Not long after this, some French officials began talking about a ''more reasonable'' attitude by Israel. They suggested that what they had seen of Labor Party attitudes, and what they had learned from their contacts with the P.L.O., suggested a degree of mutual softening. **********At the same time the French began to talk of better relations with Egypt, and of the prospect that in the course of this year the atmosphere for negotiating might improve. One well-placed official suggested that France might find itself strategically placed to use its good offices in getting indirect or even direct talks going between the Israelis and the P.L.O. **********It is expected that this summer there will be a reawakening of the European efforts to find a Middle East peace formula. And the French effort to improve relations with both Egypt and Israel is undoubtedly designed to give Paris a more effective role in any plan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/17/business/alagasco-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-23.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 42, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ALAGASCO INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 23", "print_headline": "ALAGASCO INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 23", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/01/business/economic-scene-specter-of-crisis-in-global-debt.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1981-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 871, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; Specter of Crisis In Global Debt", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; Specter of Crisis In Global Debt", "body_text": " **********THE shock wave from the attempt on the life of President Reagan spread through the world financial system within minutes. Panic was forestalled by the quick closing of the New York Stock Exchange and by the news that, following surgery to remove the bullet from his lung, the President was not in danger. **********Nevertheless, anxieties stirred by the assassination attempt will not quickly vanish.  Some threats to world financial stability come not from individual assassins or bands of terrorists but from governments themselves. A recent report by the heads of the four major foreign-policy research institutions of the United States, Britain, France and West Germany warns of three great dangers to the West: **********First, in contrast to a decade ago when the prospects were for detente and successful arms negotiations with the Soviet Union, the period now beginning ''is marked by increased tensions between East and West and enhanced Soviet military threats both in Europe and in third-world regions.'' **********Second, the West is facing an increasingly unstable third world, especially in the Persian Gulf, upon which it depends for economic survival. ''In effect,'' says the report, written by Karl Kaiser of West Germany, Winston Lord of the United States, Thierry de Montbrial of France and David Watt of Britain, ''the new importance of the third world for Western security is such that an extensive and prolonged interruption of oil supplies today would provoke a world economic crisis of a greater magnitude than the Great Depression of the 1930's.'' **********Third, the period ahead will be one of prolonged economic crisis worldwide, characterized in the West by very low growth rates, high inflation and high unemployment. These economic troubles, the report says, ''can be expected to sharpen North-South tensions, increase competition among Western nations themselves (including Japan) and produce dangerous social tensions within Western democracies.'' **********But there is a fourth potential crisis, stemming from those named above: the danger of a breakdown in the world banking and financial system. While this danger receives scare treatment from some profitseeking promoters, it is scarcely discussed publicly by government or central-bank officials or private bankers. **********However, a new study, ''Financial Disorder and International Banking'' by Jack Guttentag and Richard Herring of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, concludes that ''a crisis in international banking has become increasingly probable.'' **********The rapid growth of international banking activity, at a much faster rate than domestic activity, has exposed the banks to growing risks of borrower defaults and foreign-exchange losses. Light regulatory controls have allowed the banks doing huge amounts of business internationally to assume huge risks without challenge. **********''The most likely crisis scenario,'' say the Pennsylvania economists, ''would begin with a development that substantially raises the expenses or reduces the revenues of one or more countries with heavy outstanding indebtedness to banks.'' **********Climbing interest rates, as well as oil bills, are increasingly burdening poor countries.  Using floating-rate loan contracts in making Eurocurrency loans, Western banks have tried to protect themselves against interest-rate loss by shifting the risk to the borrower. But this, Mr. Guttentag and Mr. Herring warn, ''could lead to a credit shock to lending banks, to a loss of confidence in such banks and to a run by creditors of such banks including other banks.'' **********United States banks have taken big risks in covering the deficits of the oil-importing countries of the third world. The latest lending-exposure survey of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Comptroller of the Currency shows that, as of last June, American banks were owed $42.9 billion by nonoil-producing Latin American countries and $19.9 billion by nonoil-producing countries in Asia. The risks are compounded by the heavy lending done by West German, British, French and other foreign banks. **********Total foreign debts of the developing countries that do not produce oil have climbed to about $500 billion in the last decade, according to estimates by the Dresdner Bank of West Germany. **********The probability of an actual shock powerful enough to wreck the world banking system stemming from an inability of the poor countries to meet their debts may be low, as the great majority of private and central bankers insist. The loans are rolled over again and again, and the International Monetary Fund, with growing help from Saudi Arabia, will help the oil-importing countries meet their debts. **********But, according to Professors Guttentag and Herring, the probability of a major shock is growing, along with the diminished capacity of banks to withstand such a shock. This, they say, raises serious questions about the adequacy of existing ''lender of last resort'' facilities - that is, the existence of a plan and sufficient resources among Western governments for rescuing the international banking system in the event of a major crisis, like the one that wrecked it in 1931, plunging the world into the worst depression in history.. **********Even with a low probability of a major shock, the potential damage to the world economy is so enormous that it seems irresponsible not to be prepared to deal with such a shock promptly and strongly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/30/world/poland-says-articles-by-american-concocted-tales-of-underground.html": {"writer_name": "John Darnton", "pub_date": "1981-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1396, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POLAND SAYS ARTICLES BY AMERICAN CONCOCTED TALES OF 'UNDERGROUND'", "print_headline": "POLAND SAYS ARTICLES BY AMERICAN CONCOCTED TALES OF 'UNDERGROUND'", "body_text": " **********The Polish Foreign Ministry and the Solidarity trade union have denounced as a fabrication articles by an American who visited Poland four months ago. **********The visitor, Harley Lippman, a former exchange program student in Poland, said he had a close relationship with Solidarity leaders that enabled him to meet secretly with Polish soldiers who said they would fight against a Soviet invasion. The articles also purported to describe his experiences traveling ''underground'' for 27 days, accompanied by Solidarity activists, to evade a police deportation order. **********Mr. Lippman wrote about a week's stay in the apartment of Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader, whom Mr. Lippman claimed to have known while he studied in Poland from 1975 to 1977. 'Article Lacks Any Hard Facts' **********Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Solidarity's national spokesman, speaking on behalf of Mr. Walesa, said ''the article lacks any hard facts that can be verified.'' . **********''The only statement that can be verified is Mr. Lippman's claim that he spent a week living with Lech Walesa in his apartment,'' Mr.  Onyszkiewicz said.  ''I must say that this is totally untrue, as well as some other statements that may give a false impression that Mr.  Lippman is Mr. Walesa's friend. **********''I would like to strongly deny that Solidarity runs a network of secret safe houses to help people unpopular with the police. Our union is strong enough to protect, if necessary, our members, activists or guests using legal means, as we have shown in the past.'' **********Mr. Onyszkiewicz's repudiation came in a letter to The Times of London, made public here today. On May 11, the London paper printed an article by Mr. Lippman headlined: ''On the Run in Poland With My Friends in Solidarity.'' **********The Onyszkiewicz letter termed that article ''a great distortion of the real situation in Poland.'' Distributed From New York **********The Times of London received the article from the Special Features division of The New York Times Syndication Sales Corporation, which sometimes distributes work by freelance journalists. It erroneously bore a New York Times copyright. But Mr. Lippman is not employed by The New York Times nor did his article appear in The Times. In a note to editors, it was marked ''Not from The New York Times.'' **********Jesse Levine, executive vice president of the Syndication Sales Corporation, said the special features division withdrew Mr.  Lippman's work, a two-part series of 1,800 words each, from circulation several weeks ago after questions about its veracity had been raised by The Boston Globe. **********Mr. Lippman also wrote an article for The Chicago Sun-Times that appeared March 15.  The current issue of Life magazine contains a series of photographs taken during 1970 labor disturbances, along with a photograph of Mr.  Walesa and Mr. Lippman seated at a table. The text says Mr. Walesa gave the ''previously unpublished pictures'' to Mr. Lippman. **********The photographs have circulated widely throughout Poland since December and have been reproduced in numerous Polish publications and exhibits. 'Bad Faith for All Americans' **********Officials in the Press Department of the Foreign Ministry have been in touch with resident Western journalists to express concern over the articles. **********''They are clearly untrue,'' an official said today. ''Journalists like Mr. Lippman create bad faith for all American journalists. Many journalists who live here and know the situation write accurately.'' **********Mr. Lippman visited Poland from Jan. 22 until Feb. 19 on a tourist visa. He wrote that he was stopped at the airport upon entering the country and interrogated by an officer of ''the Ministry of Internal Security,'' an apparent reference to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, while Solidarity friends were ''waiting apprehensively'' in the terminal lobby. **********Three days later, he asserted, the police called for him at the apartment where he had been staying and he then went into ''hiding underground'' with Solidarity activists who smuggled him ''through a bewildering network of safe houses and secret rendezvous points.'' A Meeting With Paratroopers **********On one occasion, he wrote, he was blindfolded and taken to a barn outside Warsaw where he met a platoon of smiling Polish paratroopers who told him they would fight the Russians ''no matter what the odds.'' His description of the paratrooper uniform is inaccurate. On another occasion, he asserted, he had a clandestine meeting with a nationalist Polish general in a forest outside Lodz. **********Mr. Lippman wrote that he had numerous narrow escapes from the police. One time, he wrote, he avoided arrest on a train when his escort shouted out, ''Help us, we have an American friend!'' and ''the aisle suddenly filled up with people'' who blocked the police. **********Another time, he said, he eluded pursuers by slipping into a farmhouse where a young boy took his hand and took him to safety in the back of a horse-cart, driven by an old man whose last words were: ''Be safe. Remember us. Do not forget us.'' **********''Mr. Lippman described Solidarity as if it were an undergound organization in Poland during World War II,'' said Mr. Onyszkiewicz in his letter. ''This is not at all the reality of presentday Poland. During the time in which he was allegedly ''underground,'' Mr.  Lippman was seen in public by many Western journalists. **********He appeared at a seminar for Polish journalists in Warsaw and spoke there, presenting himself as a correspondent for The Washington Post. He also interviewed Marian Dobrosielski, a Deputy Foreign Minister, presenting a letter from Senator Edward M. Kennedy that asked for routine assistance to Mr. Lippman as a ''constituent.'' Mr. Lippman lives in Boston. **********During his stay in Poland, Mr. Lippman variously purported to be representing half a dozen American newspapers.  Solidarity members and American Embassy officials said that Mr.  Lippman also said he had an association with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., but the American labor organization has denied any present connection with him. **********Stephen M. Dubrow, press officer at the American Embassy, said that Mr. Lippman got in touch with the embassy after his arrival and was advised not to work as a journalist without a press visa because to do so would jeopardize other journalists. ''He wouldn't listen,'' Mr. Dubrow said. 'An Incredible Story' **********''Then he came back with an incredible story of having visited an arms cache in the woods,'' Mr. Dubrow added. ''We tried to point out to him how serious these stories were.'' Mr. Dubrow said that Mr.  Lippman was known to the embassy from his student days in 1976, when he claimed to have been taken by students into a forest to view arms allegedly for use against Soviet soldiers. **********Mr. Lippman used mostly first names in his articles, many of them misspelled, except for that of Mr. Walesa. Mr. Lippman had an interview with Mr. Walesa scheduled for Feb. 4, but it was canceled because of a crisis in southern Poland, according to the union. **********Mr. Lippman has shown editors in the United States photographs of himself with Mr. Walesa taken in different places. Solidarity's national spokesman said that such photographs were easy to come by, since Mr. Walesa customarily poses with scores of visitors who drop in on him at his office and home. A Haven in Walesa's Home **********Mr. Lippman suggested that he avoided arrest during the week he allegedly slept in the room of Mr. Walesa's son only because the police feared to serve a deportation notice on him there. **********Many aspects in his accounts do not ring true. The Solidarity union operates above board, and Polish Army officers do not easily grant interviews to Westerners. Parts of the articles are potentially damaging to Polish-Soviet relations, including Mr. Lippman's assertion that at a gathering of intellectuals he heard a discussion on the need to spread the workers' movement throughout Eastern Europe. **********Mr. Lippman also said that Solidarity smuggled tapes and photographs for him by ship to the Netherlands and from there to the United States. Solidarity denies this. The American Embassy said that Mr. Lippman had sought to send materials by the diplomatic pouch and that the request was rebuffed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/17/business/reagan-moving-on-us-export-bars.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1981-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 828, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN MOVING ON U.S. EXPORT BARS", "print_headline": "REAGAN MOVING ON U.S. EXPORT BARS", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration, having organized a team of officials to deal with international trade issues, is now moving to speed up a drive to eliminate Government hindrances to exports. **********At a White House meeting last Thursday of the Trade Policy Committee, which is headed by Bill Brock, the United States Trade Representative, decisions were made to press for relaxation of the following trade disincentives: **********- A kind of double taxation of Americans working abroad, who are hit by both the host country's tax collectors and the Internal Revenue Service. **********- Antitrust and banking laws that prevent American companies and financial institutions from banding together in foreign sales activities. **********- The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which puts American companies at a disadvantage with rigorous controls over commissions paid to foreign representatives and stiff penalties for violations. **********Baldrige to Take Lead **********The Commerce Secretary, Malcom Baldrige, will take the lead in the legislative campaign to open the door to the foreign sales groupings of American enterprises, the Trade Policy Committee decided. **********This division of authority worked out in the early strategy session illustrates the way efforts are being undertaken now to reduce the almost inevitable interagency frictions over oversight. **********When the same legislative proposals came up last year, the former trade representative, Reubin O. Askew, and the former Commerce Secretary, Philip M. Klutznick, both sought leading roles and failed to synchronize. **********''Mr. Brock is re-establishing the trade office as a central clearing house for trade issues,'' said Howard Weisberg, director of international trade poiicy at the United States Chamber of Commerce.  ''Rather than act as an advocate, he is the coordinator.'' **********Friction between the Commerce Department and the trade office arose from a reorganization last year, which gave the Commerce Department much greater clout in the trade field. **********The Commerce Department, which had already managed exort promotion and controls, got enforcement authority over imports from the Treasury Department and took responsibility for commercial attaches away from the State Department. A Matter of Chemistry **********Much of the way the trade team functions will depend on the chemistry between Mr. Brock and Mr. Baldrige. From reports so far, the chemistry is good. Both are from the same moderate wing of the Republican party. Mr. Brock, a former Senator from Tennessee, had been chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr. Baldrige, a former business executive from Connecticut, had been a supporter of Vice President Bush. **********Significantly, Mr. Baldrige has appointed Mr. Brock's former executive assistant, William H. Morris Jr., to be the new Assistant Secretary of Commerce for trade development. **********''I think the team is shaping up very well,'' said Alan W. Wolff, a former Deputy United States Trade Representative now practicing law in Washington. ''Strauss (Robert S., the former trade representative and former chairman of the Democratic Party) proved how highly political the job was. **********''You have to understand domestic forces and work with the Congress. Brock qualifies on both counts.'' A key Congressional staffer who follows trade issues added: ''Brock has grasped the immediate issues. I think he'll be much clearer in the signals he gives to other countries. There will be more of an America-first approach. But I don't think there will be any change in basic liberal trade philosophy.'' Beefed-Up State Department **********While Mr. Brock is trying to cement a close relationship with the Commerce Department, he also faces a large repository of trade expertise at a beefed-up State Department. **********The Secretary of State, Alexander M. Haig Jr., in efforts to make the State Department more influential in the international economic area, brought in Myer Rashish, an economist with long experience in trade matters, and Robert D. Hormats, the former Deputy Trade Representative. Mr. Rashish is the new Under Secretary for economic affairs, and Mr. Hormats the new Assistant Secretary for economic affairs. **********Another key person will be Lionel H. Olmer, an international economic problem-solver for the Motorola Inc. who was brought over to the Commerce Department by Mr. Baldrige as Under Secretary for international trade. **********The hottest issue before the new trade team is what, if anything, to do about imports of small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars, which have been embraced by American consumers but which the domestic industry now wants to check. **********The Administration has taken no position yet on legislation proposed by Senators John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, and Lloyd M. Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, placing quotas for three years on the Japanese imports. **********But Mr. Brock said in a recent interview that he was opposed to any kind of legislatively mandated quotas.

It lost money. It was vilified by liberals. It never made much of an impact. **********Today, however, the man in the White House reads Human Events.  Fifteen fresh-off-the-press copies are delivered there by messenger every Friday. A long list of Congressional sources talk to its writers regularly now because they know who is reading the magazine.  And it it even gets written about in other, far better-known publications. **********As yet, however, Human Events has found more success in its influence than in its revenues. According to Alan H. Ryskind, Capitol Hill Editor and co-owner, the magazine is merely breaking even - but that is much better than it has done. A few years ago, facing bankruptcy, it was bailed out by wealthy subscribers. It also cut back drastically its discount subscription offers, reducing its circulation from 150,000 to 60,000. And the magazine's new blueribbon audience has done little to attract Madison Avenue sales.  ''We have had more interest from advertisers lately,'' said Thomas S. Winter, editor and co-owner, ''but most agencies just will not pay attention because the numbers aren't there.'' **********Human Events is still a target of liberal attack. ''They're just numb,'' says Jeffrey Stein, Washington editor for the Progressive, of Mr. Ryskind and Mr. Winter. ''They're the old right: anti-gun registration, pro-gold standard. They see a conspiracy in every corner and think the major newspapers are all dupes for the Communists.'' **********But it pulls no punches. Whether questioning the affiliation of America's college political science teachers (''Do you know who's teaching your kids?'') or haranguing Congress on behalf of the Reagan budget, Human Events is never subtle. **********''Frankly, we have been somewhat surprised that so many Republican lawmakers have begun to crawfish on Reaganomics,'' reads one recent issue, ''As soon as things weren't working perfectly, they began to run from the field of battle. Dagwood Bumstead has displayed truer grit.'' **********At the White House, press aides could not confirm that Human Events is Reagan's favorite magazine. According to one, Human Events and the National Review are either No. 1 and 2, or 2 and 1. ''I've seen Human Events at the top of the list,'' the aide said, ''but I personally don't think you can rank them.'' Last year, Mr. Reagan was more explicit. ''Not a week goes by during the campaign,'' he said, ''that I don't take time to read Human Events from cover to cover.'' **********What has that kind of exposure done for Mr. Ryskind and Mr. Winter?  ''Well, for one thing, we're certainly accorded more respect than we used to be,'' Mr. Ryskind said. ''I, personally, am given more respect at press conferences and things - I've certainly felt that.'' **********On the other hand, both men say they feel that fewer people may be listening. ''When you're out of power, when you're on the outside criticizing, people tend to think they need your information because they're not getting it,'' Mr. Winter said.

Mobil, by contrast, generally declines to deal with independents. **********''The nonbranded independent station is at the cutting edge of price competition,'' Jack A. Blum of the Independent Gasoline Marketers Council said at a joint hearing of the Senate and House Commerce Committees. ''Because low prices attract customers and build volume, nonbranded independents constantly test the pricevolume relationship by selling at the lowest price at which they can operate profitably.'' Downward Price Pressure **********The competition of these stations also forces down the prices charged by the brand-name stations, he said.  Mr. Blum predicted that, if Mobil succeeded in the takeover, ''there will be a wave of other mergers in the industry.'' The Federal Trade Commission is investigating antitrust aspects of Mobil's tender offer to acquire Marathon for $5.1 billion. Marathon management strongly opposes the move but has welcomed a bid by the United States Steel Corporation to acquire the company for $6.3 billion. **********The head of the F.T.C.'s bureau of competition did not testify because of President Reagan's veto of an emergency budget appropriations bill to provide money for the F.T.C. and other Government agencies to continue operations. In addition, Mobil officials declined to appear, a move criticized by Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, chairman of the Senate committee and a foe of the takeover.

''Mobil's hostile offer drove us up the wall,'' he said of the Marathon board meeting that considered it. **********Ohio's Attorney General, William J.

They had originally promised to pay off the $500 million by Thursday. **********Extension Called Possible **********The bankers said that, if the partial payments continued, they probably would be willing to extend the year-end deadline into early next year. **********The Dec. 31 deadline for payment of the $500 million has been a crucial issue. Failure to meet it has carried the possibility that one of the 460 Western banks holding Polish debt might insist on declaring Warsaw in default. The entire bank consortium would be required to consider Poland in default if one of its members insisted on such a move. **********The bankers interviewed today -West Germans in Frankfurt as well as Americans in both Frankfurt and Vienna - requested anonymity because they are involved in the negotiations over rescheduling payments of Poland's $16 billion debt to the Western banks. In telephone interviews, they described the amounts transferred to Western banks as ''small,'' although they would not divulge the actual figures. 'Trickles All Along' **********''It would be wrong to overdramatize the fact,'' one German banker said. ''There have been trickles all along.'' He added that the first transfer by the Polish state bank, Handlowy, since the military takeover on Dec. 13 came in the middle of last week, and there had been several transfers since then. In addition, several payments were made to the banks earlier this month, before the military takeover. **********The most recent payments were made by transferring small amounts of funds held on deposit in Frankfurt and in New York banks to agent banks for the syndicated loans, the bankers said. **********The 460 Western creditor banks had reached an agreement on Dec. 4 to postpone for several years the payment of $2.4 billion in debt principal that was scheduled to have been paid this year. But the postponement carried the condition that the Poles pay the $500 million in interest by year's end. The interest had originally been due in the first three quarters of 1981. **********The rescheduling agreement, after weeks of negotiations, was the first involving the $16 billion bank debt. Because of Poland's deteriorating economy, both the Western banks and Polish officials had agreed that Warsaw would need a grace period of several years before resuming payment of the principal. Bid for New Loan Was Denied **********Last week, a committee of eight creditor banks, representing the total group, met in Zurich and agreed to deny a request from the new military government for a $350 million loan to help pay the $500 million in back interest. Banking sources said that the loan was denied partly on the theory that the Soviet Union would come to Poland's assistance rather than let an Eastern-bloc country go into default. **********Today's report that some payments had been made was the first public indication that Poland was trying to comply with the Dec. 4 rescheduling agreement, if not by the year's end then by early next year. **********The bankers interviewed today said a meeting would be held in London on Jan. 8 to complete the final wording of the agreement to reschedule the $2.4 billion in principal.In setting the meeting, the bank consortium indicated that it would go along with final payment of the $500 million in interest early next year. **********The bankers said that they did not know where the Poles could obtain funds to meet their debt payments, given the sharp decline in export income resulting from the nation's prolonged crisis. But they noted that the price of gold had fallen on European markets in recent days. Some gold dealers have attributed the drop to heavy sales of gold by the Soviet Union, possibly to obtain hard currency with which to help Poland make the interest payments. Germans Hold Biggest Part **********Poland owes an estimated $10 billion to Western governments in addition to the $16 billion bank debt. Payment of some of the government debt was rescheduled earlier this year. Among the creditor banks, the West Germans hold the biggest portion of the debt, a total of about $4.5 billion, with $2.7 billion not covered by Government guarantees. American banks hold $1.3 billion of the Polish debt. **********(Leland S. Prussia, the chairman of the Bank of America Corporation, said in San Francisco in a telephone interview that he had not yet heard any reports of resumed interest payments from Poland. Several other bankers in the United States, all of whom refused to comment for the record, also said that they had not received any direct confirmation from Poland that interest payments had been resumed.) **********The news of the bank transfers came as it was announced in Bonn that Poland's Deputy Prime Minister in the last civilian Government, Mieczeslaw Rakowski, would come to West Germany on Wednesday to discuss with Bonn's Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the Polish events.

Exceeds 13 Percent **********While Treasury bill rates are still well below their highest level of the year, the yield for long-term Treasury bonds exceeds 13 percent - a level reached only briefly last December and again in mid-February. The Treasury's 12 3/4 percent bonds due 2010 closed at about 96 3/4 to yield 13.18 percent. **********''The traders did not like the increase in the Federal funds rate, and investors are just not buying,'' explained one Treasury securities dealer. **********Prices also moved lower for other recently issued Treasury securities, with the new 13 7/8 percent notes due in two years offered at 99 1/4 to yield 14.32 percent while the 13 3/4 percent notes due in 1986 closed at 99 1/4 to yield 13.99 percent. **********In the Federal funds market, where banks and others arrange overnight loans, the rate climbed above 16 percent late in the day - a sharp contrast from the 14.96 percent average in the week ended Feb. 25. Sign of Expansion **********Besides the higher rate for Federal funds, dealers said news of a 5.4 percent rise in construction spending for January also encouraged lower prices during the day. They reasoned that the construction spending was a sign that the economy was continuing to expand, signaling greater credit demands and higher interest rates in the future. **********Some analysts also cited the recent growth in the nation's money supply as a reason for the weaker prices yesterday. Although money supply growth for the latest quarter is still a slow 1.1 percent, economists at Merrill Lynch said in yesterday's money market newsletter that the $2 billion increase in the basic money supply for the week ended Feb. 18 helped ''dash any hopes that the Fed would allow the funds rate to ease any further over the near term.'' Without further declines in the funds rate, traders say that yields are unlikely to drop for other securities. **********In general, most analysts say that the Fed's internal target for the credit it wants to supply to the banking system should result in a funds rate of 15 to 16 percent. **********The Chrysler Corporation's latest issue of Government-guaranteed notes increased in price yesterday even though other note and bond prices have declined since the issue was offered last week.  Originally priced at 98 to yield 15.31 percent to maturity in 1991, the issue was offered late yesterday at 98 5/8. Underwriters said that demand from yield-conscious individual investors grew after the issue was brought to market. New Jersey Issue Due **********The tax-exempt market was beset with the same lack of buying interest as the government securities market, dealers said. In advance of today's $150 million of Aaa-rated New Jersey general obligation bonds, traders said that prices of other high-grade state issues were reduced enough to raise yields about 10 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********Trading in the Aaa-rated Illinois bonds sold last week was not heavy yesterday, but one trader estimated that current prices for the bonds would result in yields about 10 basis points higher than the original scale. Last week the Illinois bonds were offered to yield from 7 percent in 1982 to 8.45 percent in 1991, 9.7 percent in 2001 and 9.85 percent in 2004-06. **********Among negotitated tax-exempt issues planned for sale this week, underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation said that a $150 million sale of A-rated Kentucky Turnpike Authority bonds was postponed because of market conditions. Sebring Bonds Priced **********Negotiated issues still planned this week include $91 million of A/BBB-rated Sebring, Fla., utility revenue bonds that a Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb group has tentatively priced to yield from 7.75 percent in 1981 to 11 percent for term bonds due 2001 and 11 3/8 percent for discount priced term bonds due 2011. An issue of 10 3/4 percent term bonds due 2010 priced at par has a lower yield than the other term bonds, underwriters explained, because it is insured by the American Bond Assurance Corporation and is thus AAA-rated. **********Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb also plans to sell a $36.4 million issue of A-rated pollution-control revenue bonds guaranteed by the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation. The 9 percent bonds due 1984 are tentatively priced at par. **********Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills:"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/03/business/court-takes-japanese-job-suit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 842, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Court Takes Japanese Job Suit", "print_headline": "Court Takes Japanese Job Suit", "body_text": " **********The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether American subsidiaries of foreign corporations are required to abide by the Federal law that forbids discrimination in employment, despite trade treaties that appear to give the companies discretion in hiring. **********The case involves a New York company, Sumitomo Shoji America, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of a Japanese import-export company. The New York company hired only male Japanese nationals for management positions, and was sued by a group of women secretarial employees on the ground that the policy violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. **********The company argued that it was exempt from Title VII on the basis of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Japan. This 1953 treaty, similar to other trade treaties, allows companies of one country doing business in the other country to hire ''technical experts, executive personnel and other specialists of their choice.'' **********Referred to Appeals Court **********The Federal District Court in New York referred the legal question, without ruling on it, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The appeals court ruled that Title VII covered the company's employment practices regardless of the trade treaty, but that, at a trial, the company could try to prove that it had a special need to hire Japanese nationals. **********In agreeing to hear the company's appeal, Sumitomo Shoji v. Avigliano, No. 80-2070, the Court asked the Justice Department today to file a brief ''expressing the views of the United States.'' **********The Justices also agreed to hear the women's appeal from the aspect of the Second Circuit's ruling that gave the company the opportunity to defend its Japanese-only policy. **********Other business-related action at the Court today included the following: Antitrust Suit **********The Court agreed to decide whether a subscriber to a prepaid health care plan could bring an antitrust suit to challenge the plan's refusal to cover specific types of health care. **********The case, Blue Shield of Virginia v. Mccready, No. 81-225, is an appeal by both a state Blue Shield plan and a statewide organization of psychiatrists. The two were accused of conspiring against clinical psychologists by refusing to provide coverage for their services. **********The United States District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that the plaintiff, an individual subscriber who sought reimbursement for care by a psychologist, lacked standing to bring the suit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that the Clayton Act, which provides triple damages for plaintiffs injured by antitrust violations, entitled the subscriber to bring the case. **********The appeal argues that the Fourth Circuit opened the door too widely to consumer antitrust suits by not following the precedents of other appeals courts that restrict Clayton Act suits to plaintiffs who are themselves the victims of the alleged antitrust conspiracy.  In this case, the alleged boycott was aimed not at subscribers but at the psychologists. Diesel Emissions **********The Justices refused to hear a challenge by the General Motors Corporation to the Environmental Protection Agency's limit on exhaust emissions from diesel-powered cars and light trucks. The company argued that the regulations, which were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals here and are scheduled to take effect with the 1985 model year, are so infeasible that production ''will cease'' in 1985 if the standards are not modified. **********The Justice Department urged the Court not to hear the General Motors appeal, G.M. v. Gorsuch, No. 81-201, both because the appeals court decision upholding the standards was ''a proper application of relevant law'' and because the environmental agency has recently begun a review of the standards. ''Petitioner may well obtain administratively all the relief it requests from this Court,'' the department said. Oil Cleanup **********The Court refused to hear an appeal by the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, operator of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline, from a ruling that it was not entitled to Federal reimbursement for the costs of cleaning up a 1978 oil spill that was due to sabotage. The company spent $1.2 million cleaning up the 14,000-barrel spill after an unknown vandal blew a hole in the pipeline. **********A Federal law provides reimbursement for oil spills that are the fault of ''third parties'' rather than the fault of the pipeline operator. But another Federal law, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, explicitly eliminates the reimbursement provision for the Alaska pipeline. On that basis, the United States Court of Claims dismissed the pipeline's suit for reimbursement. **********The Justice Department urged the Court to deny the appeal, Alyeska Pipeline v. U.S., No. 81-231. The department argued that, in enacting the no-reimbursement provision, ''Congress recognized the extraordinary environmental risks associated with the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System venture and concluded that those who undertook that venture in search of profit, not the taxpayers, should also bear the burden of those risks.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/22/business/gm-j-car-models-displayed-by-dealers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.M.

But the car's price tag will be much higher than was at first planned and, according to industry analysts, the design has been substantially modified. **********The sleek, stainless-steel autos, now rolling off an assembly line here at the gentle rate of 18 a day, are to go on sale in the United States, for about $25,000 each, some time next month. **********''Every phase of successful enterprise has now been completed,'' says John Z. DeLorean, the former General Motors Corporation executive who conceived the car and persuaded the British Government to finance it. ''What remains now is the all-important test in the marketplace.'' **********Concern About Market **********Mr. DeLorean concedes that the marketplace for his car - almost exclusively the United States, at least at the beginning - is not in ideal economic shape at the moment for the introduction of a very expensive two-seat auto, one that has almost doubled in price since it was first conceived. **********But he maintains that the kind of buyers he is appealing to are not feeling too much of a pinch.  ''The market for these cars is far more quality-sensitive than it is price-sensitive,'' says Mr. DeLorean, a tall, elegantly groomed entrepreneur who exudes the breezy self-confidence with which he talked the Government into a financing deal that his critics find far too generous. Initial Sales Goal **********Mr. DeLorean readily concedes that a car that costs $25,000 has to be ''perfect,'' but he thinks this one is. He hopes to sell 11,000 of them this year, 20,000 next year and perhaps 30,000 a year thereafter. He also talks hopefully of introducing a DeLorean sedan, with four or five seats, later in the 1980's. Such a project, the company said, may be financed by a general public stock offering in the United States. **********The last new sports car to reach the market amid great publicity was the $10,000 Bricklin, developed by Malcolm Bricklin, a millionaire promotor from Philadelphia. The car was assembled in Canada but production was halted soon after it began in 1975 because of manufacturing and financial problems. Only about 3,000 were built. **********But the DeLorean Motor Company says it has lined up more than 300 American dealers, each of whom has a $25,000 equity interest in the company, and they are said to have 7,000 to 10,000 firm orders for the car. **********Mr. DeLorean, who said his relations with General Motors had become increasingly strained since he left the company, says he sees signs that G.M. may be putting pressure on its dealers not to handle the new car. **********Mr. DeLorean left General Motors in 1972, when he was vice president and group executive in charge of all car and truck divisions in North America. He said he left because the company had been unenthusiastic about his determination to build smaller and sportier cars. G.M. seemed to feel that the executive's exuberance contrasted too much to the company's conservative management style. Conflicts With G.M. **********General Motors, in fact, has told Cadillac dealers who handle small-car imports and who plan to sell the DeLorean that they will not receive initial shipments of the Cimarron, a small ''J'' car scheduled to be introduced in early May. **********The DeLorean car has undergone rather extensive modification at the hands of Lotus Cars Ltd., which did much of the preproduction engineering, added a frame, changed the body molding processes and altered the car's character. **********Mr. DeLorean's auto is low (45 inches) and fast (maximum speed, 125 miles an hour) and is available only in silver, the color of its unpainted stainless steel body. But its most distinctive feature is its gull-wing doors, which are hinged at the top, rather than on the side. Critics say that the doors are just an attention-getting gimmick. But they do make it easier to settle down in the car than it would have been if it had had conventional doors. Steel, Glass and Plastic **********The stainless-steel panels, which the company says are completely corrosion-proof, are fastened to a glass-reinforced plastic underbody, molded here into two halves and set onto a conventional metal chassis. Much of the work is done by hand, in a cavernous new factory that DeLorean built over the past two years. **********The reason for building the plant in Belfast was that the British Government was willing to offer such generous terms here. And the reason for that, of course, is that this province, scarred by more than a decade of constant sectarian violence, is by many economic standards the most depressed corner of Britain. **********But since DeLorean will depend almost entirely on sales in the United States, at least at the beginning, the project has suffered from the sharp appreciation of the British pound, which has helped to drive up the retail price of the car. Company officials say that about 54 percent of its supplier costs are in pounds, 31 percent in French francs, 7 percent in German marks and 6 percent in dollars. Critics of Government Aid **********The plant, on a 70-acre site that was a bog three years ago, employs 1,200 people and expects to employ 2,000 by the end of the year. **********Since the Government has paid out more than $160 million in grants, loans and equity for the company, critics in Parliament have complained that this is very expensive job creation. **********But Mr. DeLorean, who likes to remind critics that he put $4 million of his own money into the company too, says that not many investors would even consider coming to Belfast. **********''Northern Ireland is the most serious single problem that Britain has,'' he said in an interview. ''We are in the most hostile area of it. The M.P.'s who are screaming about giving us a few more bucks would be afraid even to come visit the plant.'' Tories Less Enthusiastic **********The company has also suffered from a change of government. The deal it negotiated in 1978 was with the Labor Party of Prime Minister James Callaghan. But soon afterward Margaret Thatcher and the Conservatives came to power, with a promise of rigid controls on public spending. Although the contracts are being honored, the mood of some of the company's dealings with the Government has changed, officials report. **********Even so, at the age of 56, Mr. DeLorean has finally achieved the dream he had been talking about for years: the neat rows of silvery sports cars bearing his name parked in the factory yard here on their way to the Belfast port. **********But his critics are as vociferous as ever.  ''They used to say that we'd go broke before ever making a car,'' he said good-naturedly. ''Now that we have actually begun making cars, they are saying that we'll go broke in a year or two. I guess as long as they keep on predicting my demise two years in the future, rather than tomorrow, I'll be O.K.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/30/business/piedmont-orders-11-boeing-737-s.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Piedmont Orders 11 Boeing 737's", "print_headline": "Piedmont Orders 11 Boeing 737's", "body_text": " **********Piedmont Airlines has ordered 11 Boeing Twinjet 737-200 airliners valued at $155 million, the Boeing Commercial Airplane Company said. **********The Piedmont contract brings to more than 100 the number of orders for Boeing 737's, Boeing officials said.

They are Iturup and Kunashir in the southern part of the main Kuril chain, as well as a parallel, subsidiary chain, the Lesser Kuriles, from Shikotan through the Habomai Islands to a seaweed-strewn rock called Kaigara, only 2.2 miles from Hokkaido. **********But the Japanese are not giving up. Today Mr. Suzuki became the first postwar Japanese leader to view the area, flying by helicopter to Cape Nosappu to peer through a telescope at the Soviet-held territories where naval vessels rode in the water barely a mile away. **********''The Russians do not gain by this, but they do not lose either,'' said a Foreign Ministry spokesman. ''It is a question of endurance.''  Sonoda to Confer With Gromyko **********Although Foreign Minister Sunao Sonoda hopes to meet his Soviet counterpart, Andrei A. Gromyko, at the United Nations in New York next week, the dispute is not likely to be resolved soon. **********In 1855, a treaty between Japan and Czarist Russia assigned the northern Kuriles to Russia and recognized that the southern, now disputed, islands had always been Japanese. Under a second treaty, in 1875, the Russians gave up the northern Kuriles in exchange for the southern half of Sakhalin, whose northern part was already in Russian hands. The Russians were forced to return southern Sakhalin after their defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. **********This was the situation until Japan's defeat at the end of World War II, when Soviet forces seized both southern Sak@halin and all of the Kuriles. **********The issue was revived in 1956 when the two countries re-established diplomatic relations and the Russians seemed to indicate flexibility, at least with regard to the Lesser Kuriles. In a communique, they promised to hand back Shikotan and the Habomais, ''whose actual accession to Japan will be subject to the conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union.'' Dispute Lon g in Abeyanc e **********For years the dispute was in abeyance. Japan was not strong enough to fight for return of the islands by diplomatic and economic arguments alone. Once the United States returned Okinawa in 1972, Japan's only territorial dispute was with the Soviet Union. **********Talks began in earnest in 1973 between Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader. The outcome was that Moscow conceded the existence of ''yet unresolved problems,'' a formula for the island dispute. **********Attempts to negotiate a peace treaty, with the Japanese demanding the return of the islands as a precondition, failed.  In 1976, the Russians refused to allow visits by Japanese to the graves of relatives on the Kuriles unless they came with Japanese passports. But the Japanese Government declined to issue passports for such trips on the ground that this would be admitting that the islands were no longer Japanese territory. Soviet Announces 200-Mile Zone **********Later the Soviet Union announced a 200-mile economic fishing zone off shore. The move was disputed by Japan, a major fishing nation.  Eventually Mr. Suzuki, then Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, went to Moscow in 1977 for 30 days of talks that ended in a compromise. It allowed Japanese ships to fish inside the 200-mile zone, provided that they stayed out of the Soviet Union's 12-mile territorial waters. **********Other grievances abound. The police at Nemuro, a Japanese port near Cape Nosappu, say that the Russians, in return for promising access to rich fishing grounds, seek to induce Japanese fishermen to spy on the movements of armed forces on Hokkaido, which is home to four of Japan's 13 infantry divisions. **********More recently the Soviet Union increased the size of its forces in the Kurils to close to a full division or 10,000 men, according to Japanese officials. Militarization of Islands Noted **********These were first confined to Iturup, known in Japanese as Etorofu, a long, scenic island dotted with dead volcanoes and picturesque, mostly deserted coves, with some forces on Kunashir. A new airstrip on Iturup is said to be adequate for the latest jet fighters and transports. Even tanks, which would not be of much use on the islands, were reported there. **********By late 1979, army reinforcements were also reported on the Habomai Island. The militarization of the islands was thought to be a reaction to the peace treaty Japan signed with China in 1978 while rejecting a simultaneous treaty with the Soviet Union. **********A map appearing in newspapers today showed the course of Mr.  Suzuki's helicopter as it approached Cape Nosappu. The chopper kept close to the shore, hugging the land most of the way, well back from the line between Hokkaido and the Soviet-held islands. **********''A couple of years ago I was up there taking pictures,'' a Japanese reporter said. ''We went as close as we dared and then we got a message from the ground that Soviet fighters had scrambled.

Its civil aircraft production has not been large enough to increase profits, and its military output - Fokker makes F-16 fighters under license - is scheduled to taper off in the mid-1980's. **********To complicate matters, a 12-year-old merger with Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke, a small West German aircraft company, broke up earlier this year because of conflicting German and Dutch aviation policies. **********But Fokker, trying to put its house in order, has embarked on a strategy that some industry analysts consider risky. In an effort to increase output and compensate for the maturing F-16 program, the company has joined forces with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation to build a 150-seat aircraft. **********''We think we can make it go,'' Francois Swarttouw, Fokker's 48-year-old chairman, said. Before joining Fokker in 1978, he helped transform the Rotterdam harbor into Europe's busiest port. Airline Stagnation Noted **********Other people are not so sure about Fokker's outlook. A securities analyst at a major Amsterdam bank cited the airline industry's general stagnation. Many major carriers are suffering from high interest rates, soaring fuel costs and a recent slump in the passenger-mile growth rate. Fokker and McDonnell Douglas, the analyst added, are sure to face tough competition from American aircraft makers, such as the Boeing Company, and European manufacturers, such as the Airbus consortium, which has had surprising success with its wide-body A-300 and smaller A-310 planes. **********The aircraft Fokker plans to make, the MDF 100, is a modified version of a model called the F-29 that Fokker spent nearly $79 million developing. Essentially the MDF 100 is intended to replace the present generation of Boeing 727's and McDonnell Douglas DC-9's.  Major airlines in the United States, including United and Delta, plan to purchase hundreds of such planes, worth billions of dollars, beginning in the late 1980's. **********An advanced airframe and a new wing designed by the Dutch national aerospace laboratory are expected to reduce fuel consumption and noise levels. Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd., the Pratt & Whitney group of the United Technologies Corporation and CFM-International (a joint venture of America's General Electric Company and France's Snecma) are submitting designs for engines. Fokker says the aircraft will be ready by 1986 and will cost $20 million to $25 million. Heavy Development Costs **********Amsterdam bankers note that the new plane's design details are less of a problem than its financing. Development costs are estimated at $2 billion. The Dutch Government, troubled by the recession and soaring unemployment, is eager to see the 2,000 to 4,000 jobs that production of the MDF 100 is expected to generate in the Netherlands. So the Government has assured Fokker of $711 million in development credits and guaranteed commercial bank loans if Fokker can find partners, demonstrate the project's feasibility and get enough orders. **********Even with aid from the Government, the MDF 100 project is beyond Fokker's financial range, the company's executives acknowledge. That is why it has linked up with McDonnell Douglas in a joint venture to build the plane in the Netherlands and at Long Beach, Calif. After 275 persons died in the 1979 crash of a DC-10 at Chicago, McDonnell Douglas's airliner sales slumped, and the company is hoping for a rebound. **********Mr. Swarttouw said Fokker needed at least 50 pre-production orders, some from major airlines. He estimated the market over the next 25 to 30 years at about 3,000 units and said Fokker hoped to get one-third of that market. Japanese Aid Also Sought **********Fokker is also talking with a Japanese industrial group representing Mitsubishi, Kawasaki and Fuji to see if it is interested in a 20 percent stake in the project. If so, Fokker executives envision 40 percent for Fokker and 40 percent for McDonnell Douglas.  Any participation by the Japanese, Mr. Swarttouw said, depends partly on Japan's willingness to purchase the aircraft after it is built. **********''KLM and Martinair, a charter airline owned by Dutch shipping interests, are interested,'' a banker in Amsterdam said, ''but there is no indication how large the interest is. Fokker needs the market in the States, and if Japan said yes they would likely have a market in Japan.'' **********Fokker's best-selling aircraft is the F-27 Friendship, a twinengine turboprop that carries as many as 60 passengers or seven tons of cargo and costs $6 million to $7 million. Fokker has sold more than 750 of these planes since it began making them in 1958. **********The F-28 Fellowship, a jet version of the F-27 that seats up to 85 and costs $9 million to $10 million, has had less success, perhaps because of greater competition in its class. The F-28 was designed 13 years ago, and 185 units have been sold. Most Sales in Civil Sector **********Military aircraft account for roughly 25 percent of Fokker's sales, and civil aircraft account for 70 percent. The rest comes from space activities, such as satellite construction. **********Fokker's net income nearly doubled last year, to $3.9 million, from 1979's $1.9 million. Revenues rose to $446.2 million from $381.4 million. **********The company sold only 19 planes in the first half of this year, but the six-month earnings were $2.3 million, up from $1.9 million a year before. **********Mr. Swarttouw remains sanguine. ''Our sales target is 50 aircraft for the year and improved earnings,'' he said. ''If you look at the shape of the aircraft industry, that's ambitious.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/06/business/talking-business-with-moore-of-lang-fisher-stashower-for-tv-ads-a-new-era.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Pace", "pub_date": "1981-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 661, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Interview", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Talking Business with Moore of Lang, Fisher & Stashower; For TV Ads, A New Era", "print_headline": "Talking Business with Moore of Lang, Fisher & Stashower; For TV Ads, A New Era", "body_text": " **********As vice president and account supervisor at Lang, Fisher & Stashower, a Cleveland advertising agency, Thomas A. Moore handles advertising for a wide variety of products, ranging from soap to hardware to baby bottles, among the 49-year-old agency's $22 million a year in billings. **********In addition, Mr. Moore, a graduate of Northwestern University and its Medill School of Journalism, has written articles in the business press about the image of advertising men and women in society as a whole and was co-author of an article in the Harvard Business Review about the new video technology. In a recent interview, he discussed what today's rapid technological change might mean for television advertising. **********Q. What does the future hold for the television commercial? **********A. The notion of a consumer sitting back and watching the same laundry detergent commercial for the 10th time will become an anachronism.  The basic notion of television advertising, as it is practiced at present, is that you can position an advertisement adjacent to programming and therefore get exposure to the message. Tha t will be changed, I fe el, because it will become a lot easier to avoid commercials.  That doesn't mean that marketers will find it impossibleto get their messages in front of consumers. But it does mean that the methods w ill have to change dramatically. The challenge to advertisers will be to get the messages in front of the appropriate consumers and to make the messages such that the consumers will be less inclined to change the channel. **********Q. How will advertisers go about this? **********A. It's possible that, within the next 20 years, if a consumer is interested in learning about the latest stereo equipment, he will order a video cassette which has advertisements from the top five stereo marketers, each maybe five minutes in length, about their equipment. **********Q. What about toothpastes? Will consumers bother to make that kind of comparison study about them? **********A. What we call low-involvement products -such as toothpaste, soap and household cleaners, which are less likely to be of great interest to consumers - will face a tougher environment in terms of building awareness and brand preference. **********A. What could a manufacturer of a low-involvement product do under those circumstances? A. Your best advertising would become in-store placement - in other words, being on the shelf. And the things a manufacturer does, other than consumer advertising, to get the product on the shelf, will become far more important. **********Q. What can advertisers do with their commercials to try to keep viewers from tuning them out? **********A. More messages and different kinds of messages will probably be in order. The technique of repeating a commercial over and over again, which has been very successful in the past, will be less so, since the consumers are more likely to change channels the moment they recognize a familiar commercial. And I think commercials are going to have to be both more entertaining and more informative. **********Q. Given the prospects for change, what else will advertisers and advertising agencies need to do? **********A. I think that as video technologies change, we are going to have to pay very close attentionto consumer viewing and buying habits - and to be quick to change, too. **********In the past, we have felt that we could throw our message out there and that people would get the message, whether they intended to or not. I think that is going to change, and we are going to have to start with the assumption that the consumer is going to pay attention to what he wants to. We can only get his attention if and when he is interested. And we had better be there when he is ready to hear about us, as opposed to when we are ready to talk to him."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/11/business/volume-merchandise-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-aug-1.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VOLUME MERCHANDISE INC reports earnings for Qtr to Aug 1", "print_headline": "VOLUME MERCHANDISE INC reports earnings for Qtr to Aug 1", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/08/world/around-the-world-iranian-prime-minister-asks-foes-to-yield-arms.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iranian Prime Minister Asks Foes to Yield Arms", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Iranian Prime Minister Asks Foes to Yield Arms", "body_text": " **********Iran's new Prime Minister appealed today to opposition groups to lay down their arms as guerrillas struck in two major cities and killed two supporters of the Government. **********Teheran newspapers also said 23 people were executed last night. **********The Prime Minister, Ayatollah M ohammed Riza Mahdavi-Kani, said in aspeech broadcast by Teheran radio: ''We want the opposition groups tolay down their weapons.

That news comes from both New York and Chicago, where most of the half-dozen full-service companies operate. **********What appears to have happened is that there has been a shakeout in the past among both advertisers and agencies. The advertisers who are still directing specific advertising to the black market are those who believe in it and see the economic benefits from it. **********''They think the black market is very important to them,'' said Keith E. Lockhart, president of Lockhart & Pettus. ''It's gotten down to marketing versus social dollars. My experience is that, once the advertiser makes a commitment, they only cut in relation to their total budget.'' **********''Those that are still advertising to the market,'' said Byron Lewis, president of the UniWorld Group, which works in both the black and Hispanic markets, ''are in it for business reasons.

Similarly, Mingo-Jones, New York, handles Omni cigars for Liggett & Myers, and Proctor & Gardner, Chicago, handles the professional division of Alberto-Culver worldwide, a nonethnic assignment. **********Although the recent program for the fourth annual Communications Excellence to Black Audiences awards presentation lists 21 companies under ''advertising agencies,'' Barbara Proctor, president of Proctor & Gardner, said that only about seven are full-service, that is, equipped to do the whole job of planning, creating and placing advertising. Others in the business - on the media side - confirm the number. **********The three others are Vince Cullers Advertising, the oldest of them all, and Burrell Advertising, both in Chicago, and the recently formed Vanguard Advertising in Minneapolis. **********For the most part, these are the second-generation black agencies, most of the first generation having disappeared, victims sometimes of their own ineptitude, although there are those in the black community that have charged that the big white agencies helped destroy them. **********Some black agencies in the 1960's were started by people, who, Mr.  Lewis said, had earlier been hired by general agencies under pressure to seek more racial diversity, but who were never really thoroughly trained and were rarely trained on the creative side or in media. **********Another problem, as Miss Proctor noted, was that each time one of the specialty ad agencies was invited by a major advertiser to seek a black marketing assignment, it would cost the agency about $3,500 to prepare, even through it was fighting for only the 15 percent commission a $500,000 piece of business. **********''We couldn't play the presentation game,'' she said. ''We killed ourselves.'' **********A former copywriter at Post-Keyes-Gardner, a major Chicago agency now part of Cunningham & Walsh, she says that the problems of the first-generation agencies included a lack of sophisticated management, fiancial controls, management controls and sophisticated marketing concepts. **********''And,'' she said, ''you have to understand research and market segmentation. Too many of us were relying on what we knew about black people, gut feelings. **********''And the industry doesn't give a damn about gut feelings.'' Meanwhile, a big interest of the entire black advertising agency community is the search under way by Coca-Cola USA that will end with one of their number getting the assignment of a brand for advertising to the general market, not an ethnic account. **********According to Carlton Curtis, Atlanta-based director of media relations, this account could grow in size to around $8 million in billings. **********The assignment will come as the result of a minority participation plan agreement reached last August with the Rev.

The hijackers also asked to be flown to Libya, and this demand was accepted as well. **********A Pakistani diplomat at the airport told reporters early this evening that 49 prisoners who had been held in four different provinces in Pakistan were being gathered in Karachi and would be leaving Pakistani airspace ''in the direction of Libya.'' (A plane carrying the prisoners left Karachi for Syria Saturday, Reuters reported from Karachi.) **********No Record of 6 of 55 Prisoners **********The diplomat repeated earlier statements that the Pakistani Government had no record of 6 of the 55 prisoners whose names the hijackers had submitted in a list of people to be freed. The hijackers contend that all 55 are political prisoners. **********The issue of the six prisoners could still lead to a collapse of the agreement.  One of the hijackers was heard telling the Syrian and Pakistani negotiators in the control tower by radio that he wanted to know whether the six prisoners were alive. He added that all 55 on the list had to be released and that members of the prisoners' families had to be flown to Libya as well. Stopover in Syrian City **********Tonight the Syrian Government announced through its press agency, Sana, that the plane taking the released prisoners from Pakistan to Libya would make a stopover at the northern Syrian city of Aleppo. **********Although the statement did not say so, Syrian officials in Aleppo were expected to check the identities of the people aboard the plane and advise the hijackers, who were then to release the hostages in Damascus. **********At one point this afternoon the hijackers seemed to be making new demands. They said that the agreement between them and the Pakistani Government had to be underwritten by Syria, the United Nations and Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group. Safe Passage for Families **********The hijackers also demanded that members of their own families be allowed to leave Pakistan unharmed and that one member of each family be permitted to stay behind to liquidate their possessions. **********There was a report from Pakistani sources that the hijackers had demanded that the Pakistani Government give $40,000 to each of the three families. But this report could not be confirmed. **********Another report said that the hijackers did not ask for payment but for Government permission for each family to take the proceeds from the sale of its possessions out of Pakistan in hard currency. **********Shahrayat Khan, the Pakistani Ambassador to Jordan, one of the two Pakistani diplomats who have been negotiating with the hijackers through Syrian intermediaries, told reporters that he did not think these demands constituted a major problem. Other diplomats said that they understood that the hijackers continued to bargain today but had not raised any ''real new conditions.'' **********The diplomats pointed out that Syria came close yesterday to underwriting the agreement between the Pakistani Government and the hijackers. The statement by the Pakistani President, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, that his Government was ready to release the prisoners was not made to the hijackers but to President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, who had it transmitted to the hijackers along with a message of his own urging them to accept the Pakistani moves and to refrain from violence. Pakistan to Afghanistan to Syria **********The procedure chosen by President Assad amounted to a Syrian guarantee to the hijackers that the Pakistani message was genuine, diplomats here said. **********The Pakistan International Airlines Boeing 720 was hijacked on a domestic flight in Pakistan on March 2 and flown to Kabul, Afghanistan. The hijackers released most of the women aboard but on Friday they killed a Pakistani diplomat, Tariq Rahim, one of the passengers. While in Kabul the hijackers also acquired explosives, pistols and at least one automatic weapon. The plane arrived in Damascus early Monday morning. **********Hygienic conditions on the plane are known to have become appalling.

Early this morning Syrian cleaning women were allowed aboard the plane for the first time. The hijackers agreed to let them in after Islamabad's decision to free the Pakistani prisoners was announced yesterday. **********Western diplomats here said today they had the impression that the turning point in the drama came with the hijackers' threat yesterday to kill the three American citizens aboard the plane. Less than 20 minutes before the hijackers' deadline expired, President Zia notified Syria of his decision to accept the hijackers' demands.Until then the Pakistanis had said that they would free only about a dozen prisoners."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/06/world/joint-patrols-seek-to-end-fighting-in-beirut.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 718, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JOINT PATROLS SEEK TO END FIGHTING IN BEIRUT", "print_headline": "JOINT PATROLS SEEK TO END FIGHTING IN BEIRUT", "body_text": " **********Clashes between Syrian troops and Christian militia forces gave way today to sporadic shooting here and in Zahle, but all efforts so far to maintain an effective cease-fire have failed. **********Brig.

Near the end, Mr. Mubarak discussed foreign policy, affirming his support for the Camp David peace treaty with Israel. **********'Neither East Nor West' **********But the new President deviated from Mr. Sadat's position somewhat when he said that Egypt was ''fully committed to nonalignment and positive neutrality.'' **********''Egypt is an African state,'' Mr. Mubarak said. ''It is neither East nor West.

Peace 'A Strategic Commitment' **********''Peace, as far as we're concerned, is a strategic commitment and not a tactical position,'' Mr. Mubarak said.  ''We should not listen to those voices that are trying to impede the withdrawal by raising doubts,'' he said, adding that the return of Sinai was ''a foregone conclusion.'' **********He said: ''The peace for which Egypt strives is not partial or limited, but a just and comprehensive peace for the whole of the Middle East.

There was discussion of Canada's energy policy but with officials here showing no sign of backing down, the talks on that point were inconclusive. **********Eager to establish a friendly atmosphere, the Canadians avoided any confrontation over El Salvador despite the clamor raised in the streets, and both Mr. Haig and Mr. Trudeau indicated later that the two nations' differences on El Salvador are small. **********''There was complete agreement,'' Mr. Haig told reporters tonight, ''in the sense of what we're there to do and the need to keep foreign intervention out and to work for a pluralistic and moderate society.'' **********Asked whether Mr. Trudeau approved of the United States decision to send military aid to El Salvador, Mr. Haig said, ''Well, I will leave that for him to speak to, but we didn't have any disagreements on that subject.'' **********Later, during a dinner for Mr. Reagan at the home of Governor General Edward R. Schreyer, Mr. Trudeau stopped short of endorsing the aid to El Salvador but said the Canadian press ''just got it wrong'' in reporting his criticism of the American action. **********''We support the middle in El Salvador,'' Mr. Trudeau said. ''We don't want either the fascists or the Marxists to triumph and we believe that's the aim of the United States Government.'' **********Pressed on whether there were @disagreements in today's talks, Mr.  Trudeau said: ''Believe it or not, I can't think of any. The Administration has really made a great effort to solve the problems of concern to the environmentalists about acid rain. It depends on what they do, but insofar as projects and intentions, we're in agreement right down the line. It depends on how much they can do.'' **********Asked whether he and Mr. Reagan had gotten along personally, Mr.  Trudeau said, ''I think we're both a bit of a ham. He's a good actor and I'm a bad one.'' Landing at Military Airport **********The visit got off to a staid and well-regulated start shortly after Air Force One, with the President, his wife, Nancy, and Cabinet officials aboard, touched down at Ottawa's heavily guarded military airport shortly before 9:30 this morning. Governor General Schreyer greeted the Reagans, and after a short ceremony they drove to the Governor General's residence. The Reagans were to spend the night there. **********Things became unruly when the President was greeted at the Parliament building by Mr. Trudeau. Hundreds of sign-carrying and shouting demonstrators were allowed to cross the broad lawn to within 50 feet of the microphones where the President and Prime Minister greeted each other. They were easily heard above the speeches. **********''Canadians like Americans,'' Mr. Trudeau started to say, and the crowd chanted, ''Acid rain, go home!'' Some demonstrators suggested that Mr. Reagan could go home as well, while others told him to get out of El Salvador. **********Mr. Trudeau continued to express his confidence that the two countries would find answers to their problems ''because we have faith in the people of the United States.'' **********Mr. Reagan then noted the ''warm words of welcome'' while the heckling continued. ''The people of the United States do not merely value your friendship, we cherish it,'' the President said over the shouts. **********Schoolchildren clutching American and Canadian flags cheered. But apparently annoyed by the continued heckling from the rest of the audience, Mr. Trudeau returned to the microphone and shouted: **********''Hey guys, when I go to the United States, I am not met with these kinds of signs. You know, the Americans have some beefs against us too, but we receive them politely, so how about a great cheer for President Reagan?'' The schoolchildren cheered. Reagan Takes Jeers in Stride **********As the two leaders went into the building to start their talks, Mr. Reagan was heard to say of the heckling, ''It made me feel right at home.'' **********By the time the morning meetings ended, about 20 minutes behind schedule, the crowd on the lawn had grown to several thousand. It booed as the Presidential motorcade passed, and later an American flag was burned. Two arrests were reported. **********At Mr. Trudeau's official residence, the leaders lunched on lobster and quail while talking mainly about economic policy. Outside other demonstrators tore up an American flag. Although Mr. Reagan's economic philosophy of minimum government intervention is not shared by Mr. Trudeau, there was agreement on the importance of controlling inflation. **********Canadian-American issues occupied the rest of the afternoon.  Tomorrow morning Mr. Reagan will address a joint session of Parliament before returning to Washington."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/14/business/shapell-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 65, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SHAPELL INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "SHAPELL INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/28/business/business-people-pennzoil-economist-wins-as-forecaster.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1981-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 333, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PENNZOIL ECONOMIST WINS AS FORECASTER", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; PENNZOIL ECONOMIST WINS AS FORECASTER", "body_text": " **********James L.

By stressing the theological aspect of work as humanity's ''specific dignity,'' he gives a spiritual dimension to labor at a time when economic and technological developments tend to downgrade the worker, making him merely a unit of production or operator of machinery. **********In the introduction to the 30,000-word encyclical, Pope John Paul refers to the first social encyclical of the modern papacy, issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891, and an early chapter in the new encyclical analyzes in detail the biblical and theological foundations for work. By the time the encyclical has closed with a chapter titled, ''Elements for a Spirituality of Work,'' the Pope has surrounded his social critique with a theology explaining that work contributes not only to earthly progress and welfare but to the development of the kingdom of God. Work Not a Penalty Religious thinkers have sometimes concluded that work is a penalty laid upon the human race as punishment for di sobeying God, but the encyclical stresses the more common Christian view that God ordered the man and woman he had created to ''be frui tful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it.'' **********''Even though these words do not refer directly and explicitly to work, beyond any doubt they indirectly indicate it as an activity for man to carry out in the world,'' the encyclical says. Several tim es the Pope warns against regarding humanity as tools for industria lization or profit. Sometimes ''heavy toil'' is requiredof workers, s ays the Pope, who worked in a factory as a young man.  But he warned that in economic systems where productivity and profit ''gain in nob ility,'' the worker should not lose human dignity. **********Because work is a biblical mandate, the use of the world's resources placed at the disposal of humanity is a theological issue, the encyclical states. About 40 percent of the encyclical is devoted to questions of work and ownership of the means of production, rights of workers to earn just wages, pensions and vacations, their right to form unions and the responsibility of governments to maintain just labor policies. Deplores Adversary Relationship **********Roman Catholic theology, the papal letter states, champions the rights of the worker above all else, and it will take issue with any aspect of a social system - capitalist or Marxist - that depersonalizes human beings. But the Pope deplores the adversary relationship between labor and capital. **********When it speaks of these issues, the encyclical breaks no new ground for Roman Catholic social policy but reaffirms earlier statements and re-emphasizes concerns Pope John Paul II has expressed in the past. There is no direct reference to Poland, where a labor union campaign has rocked the country in the last year. The encyclical acknowledges that the struggle for worker's rights will touch the political arena, but it says that ''unions do not have the character of political parties struggling for power.'' **********On this point, the Pope's description of the role of labor unions parallels his concerns about political activism in the church. He warns that when unions are too closely linked with political parties ''they easily lose contact with their specific role, which is to secure the just rights of workers within the framework of the common good.'' **********For the same reason, he has often asked that the church and its clergy stay clear of partisan politics.  In a section on ''social benefits,'' the Pope says wages should be high enough so a man can support a family and so a mother will not have to work to help the family survive. On Role of the Mother **********''It will redound to the credit of society to make it possible for a mother -without inhibiting her freedom - without penalizing her as compared with other women - to devote herself to taking care of her children,'' the encyclical states. ''Having to abandon these tasks in order to take up paid work outside the home is wrong from the point of view of the good of society.'' **********While that small section is likely to anger some Catholic feminists because it regards the primary role of woman as that of wife and mother, the Pope says in another section, ''Women, sometimes without proper recognition on the part of society and even of their own families, bear the daily burden and responsibility for their homes and the upbringing of their children. **********''The true advancement of women requires that labor should be structured in such a way that women do not have to pay for their advancement by abandoning what is specific to them and at the expense of the family,'' the encyclical says. **********Catholics are likely to read the encyclical according to their own social situation, said the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, S.J., editor of America, a Catholic weekly magazine. Poles, he said, are sure to notice that the word ''solidarity'' - the name for the Polish union - appears prominently in the encyclical. American Catholic women, he added, will say that the encyclical is critical of a situation that requires a woman to leave home to support her family but leaves open the possibility that she might choose to do so."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/22/business/briefs-203430.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 291, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Computer Store Inc. said it had bought four computer outlets from Carrols Development Corp. on undisclosed terms. *********** Du Pont Co. said it would build an $85 million research complex in Wilmington, Del. *********** Georgia Pacific Corp. acquired the Acquachem Co. of Coral Gables, Fla., for an undisclosed aum. *********** Genrad Inc. and Tokyo Electron Ltd. signed an agreement to form a joint venture manufacturing unit, to be known as Tel-Genrad Ltd., to make in-circuit board test systemsin Japan. *********** Jefferson Smurfit Group Ltd. of Dublin proposed to acquire all the shares of Alton Packaging that it does not now own for $27.50 a share. *********** Lifeshares of Nebraska Inc. offered to buy up to 62 percent of Chesapeake Life Insurance Co.'s voting common shares and 21 percent of its nonvoting shares, in a transaction valued at $6 million. *********** Oiltech Inc. of Denver, said it had entered into an agreement valued at approximately $4.1 million with a Netherlands Antilles investment concern to drill for oil in Holmes County, Ohio. *********** Pulte Home Corp. entered into a new eight-year, $60 million revolving credit agreement with Citibank N.A. *********** Textron Inc. sold its Polaris Snowmobile operation to a group of investors inculding Polaris management, for an undisclosed sum. *********** Tosco indefinitely postponed a special shareholders' meeting scheduled for Aug. 6. *********** Victoria Bankshares of Victoria, Tex., said it had agreed to acquire the First National Bank of Gonzales, Tex., in a share exchange valued at about $8.3 million. *********** Worldwide Energy Corp. arranged a three-year, $40 million revolving credit agreement with the United Bank of Denver and the Republic Bank of Dallas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/14/business/chrysler-said-to-get-140-million-in-canadian-loan-guarantees.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 275, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHRYSLER SAID TO GET $140 MILLION IN CANADIAN LOAN GUARANTEES", "print_headline": "CHRYSLER SAID TO GET $140 MILLION IN CANADIAN LOAN GUARANTEES", "body_text": " **********A Canadian cabinet committee has given approval in principle for about $140 million (Canadian) in loan guarantees for Chrysler Canada Ltd., Government sources confirmed today. **********Final cabinet approval, however, is not expected until Tuesday. **********The settlement, after weeks of talks between Chrysler Canada, the Government and the union involved, may clear the way for Chrysler to receive $400 million in loan guarantees from the United States Government.

UP AT 5% RATE IN QUARTER", "body_text": " **********The Commerce Department reported today that the nation's economy grew at a 5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. The report demonstrated once again that the economy was stronger than economists had expected. **********The fourth-quarter results bring to a close an extraordinarily turbulent year for the economy, which posted a record drop in the second quarter but still managed to end 1980 with a gross national product almost exactly the size it was 12 months earlier, after adjustment for inflation. **********For the future, economists said that today's news made a decline in the first quarter of 1981 unlikely, a prospect that had been widely forecast in the wake of record interest rates. **********Beyond the first quarter, economists said that the outlook was uncertain, but they took today's figures as a reminder of the danger of underestimating the strength of the economy. Doubt on Contraction **********''There is not a clear picture of weakening emerging that some observers were thinking we might see,'' Courtenay M. Slater, chief economist at the Commerce Department, said at a briefing. Although Mrs. Slater, who expects to be leaving the department shortly, said she still expected the growth rate to slow, she added that she was a ''little doubtful'' that the economy would contract. **********The growth in the gross national product, the total value of goods and services produced, in the fourth quarter promised to intensify the debate over when a tax cut should be made effective. President Reagan's advisers are currently debating between his original plan for cutting individual taxes as of Jan. 1 and the possibility of delaying it until summer or fall. **********''This calls into question the necessity of a tax cut now,'' said Robert Gough, an economist with Data Resources, a consulting firm. In his final days in office, President Carter proposed delaying his tax cut for individuals until 1982 in part because of the apparent economic strength. **********However, Alan Greenspan, a Reagan economic adviser, said that today's figures would not affect the thinking in the White House because the Republicans had already been assuming that the economy would grow at a rate of 4 percent or faster in the quarter. Inflationary Expectations **********Mr. Greenspan and other economists said that, although the pace of expansion in the fourth quarter was not large by historic standards for a post-recession period, it was large compared with what was expected in a period of peak interest rates. **********''The economy has basically been stronger at these levels of interest rates than we would have assumed,'' Mr. Greenspan said.  ''The level of interest rates required to cut off expansion is higher than it was six months ago.'' **********To Mr. Greenspan, this phenomenon suggested that ''underlying inflationary expectations are higher,'' meaning that consumers have continued to spend in the face of the high rates on the theory that the goods will only become more expensive. **********As part of its report today, the Commerce Department said that a G.N.P. price measure, a broadly based index known as the deflator, increased at an 11.2 percent rate in the quarter, up from increases of less than 10 percent in the previous three quarters. **********Mrs. Slater and Mr. Greenspan both said that the number reflected a Federal pay rise and not an acceleration of inflation. Over 1980, prices as measured by the deflator rose 9.9 percent. **********According to today's figures, the growth in the fourth quarter was due principally to continuing high spending by consumers. The housing industry also showed strong improvement, and Government purchases were up modestly. Business investment and net exports declined. **********The increase in the fourth quarter followed a growth at a 2.4 percent rate in the third quarter. The decline in the second quarter was at a 9.9 percent annual rate. In the fourth quarter, the G.N.P., after adjustment for inflation, totaled $1,490.1 billion, compared with $1,490.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 1979. Sales to Consumers Cited **********''In the fourth quarter, real G.N.P. was still about eight-tenths of 1 percent below its first-quarter peak,'' Mrs. Slater noted.  ''Growth during the second half was entirely in final sales to consumers and private businesses.'' **********Although economists have predicted that the economy would weaken under the strain of higher interest rates, the only major indication of broad weakness has been retail sales, which declined 1.3 percent in December. **********Meanwhile, industrial production rose by 1 percent in December, housing starts were virtually unchanged rather than declining as expected, and new claims for unemployment insurance have not been growing. **********Most forecasters were expecting G.N.P. to grow slightly faster than a 4 percent rate. But those recent predictions represented a substantially more optimistic view than was prevalent a few weeks earier. And economists who until today had been expecting a decline in the first quarter indicated they would probably revise their forecasts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/09/world/iran-getting-advice-from-us-lawyers.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Taylor", "pub_date": "1981-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 799, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IRAN GETTING ADVICE FROM U.S. LAWYERS", "print_headline": "IRAN GETTING ADVICE FROM U.S. LAWYERS", "body_text": " **********Iran's American lawyers have quietly been helping Iranian leaders evaluate the apparent legal obstacles to compliance with some of Teheran's demands for the release of the hostages. **********These lawyers have not always agreed with one another or with Carter Administration lawyers on the extent of the President's legal authority to meet Iran's demands. But the concern of Government officials close to the hostage negotiations about the legal advice that Iran was receiving has apparently ebbed after a secret meeting a few weeks ago. **********Some significant legal disagreements persist, however. As a result, the Iranian leaders' skepticism about the legal obstacles may have been reinforced by differences between what President Carter has offered to do to obtain release of the hostages and what some lawyers say he has the power to do. **********Some Say Demands Can Be Met **********Leonard B. Boudin, a New York lawyer who represents Iran's central bank, and his partner, Eric Lieberman, have said in interviews over the last two months that most of Iran's conditions ''can easily be met'' under ''clear-cut precedents'' and laws if President Carter wants to meet them. **********They have recently qualified those statements by acknowleding that court challenges could delay the carrying out of any Presidential orders transferring frozen Iranian assets or the property of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi out of the United States. They have continued to assert, however, that the President has broader powers to do what Iran has asked than the Administration has been willing to concede. **********On the other hand, Thomas G. Shack Jr., the principal Washington lawyer representing the Iranian Government, has said that some of the Iranian demands might be ''legally and politically impossible'' for any President to satisfy. But he has also said the President could do much of what Iran has demanded. Moral and Ethical Issues **********In interviews, lawyers who represent Iran, and other sources close to the hostage negotiations, expressed the moral and ethical questions they have had in providing advice to a regime that is using 52 American hostages as its bargaining point. **********Mr. Boudin, Mr. Shack and other lawyers emphasized that they had not advised Iran about what conditions to set for release of the hostages or acted as intermediaries between Iran and the United States. **********But Mr. Boudin and Mr. Shack acknowledged that in advising their respective Iranian clients they had dealt with issues that are central to the hostage negotiations. Among those issues are President Carter's legal powers to free frozen Iranian assets and cancel the claims of American companies. Lawsuits have tied up as much as $14 billion in frozen Iranian assets. **********Advice given for one purpose could possibly be used for another, and the Iranians might find the litigation advice equally relevant in framing their conditions for release of the hostages. **********''We cannot refrain from giving advice on the litigation out of fear of that happening,'' Mr. Shack said. ''It is our ethical obligation to advise our client as to what is legally and technically feasible in this area.'' A Secret Meeting **********Administration lawyers, apparently concerned that lawyers representing various Iranian leaders might be giving their clients the false impression that their demands could easily be satisfied, held a secret meeting with Mr. Boudin and Mr. Lieberman in November or December. Those who attended the meeting, including Lloyd Cutler, President Carter's counsel, and Roberts Owen, the State Department's top lawyer, have refused to discuss it. **********Since the meeting, Administration officials have discounted reports that Iran's lawyers have been a significant problem in the hostage negotiations, and Mr. Boudin and Mr. Lieberman have said that they agreed with the Administration's position that international arbitration would be the best way of resolving the claims against Iran. **********One potentially important disagreement, however, was suggested by Mr. Boudin's assertion that the President is authorized by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to order all the frozen Iranian assets, as well as the Shah's wealth, transferred to Iran or Algeria even if no agreement had been reached to protect companies with claims against those assets. **********The United States has told Iran that only the courts can lawfully transfer the property of the Shah. And American officials have said that the President could order transfer of the frozen assets only after Iran had agreed to ''some fair substitute mechanism'' for settling the claims against those assets. **********Although Iran and the United States have agreed in principle to international arbitration of claims by American companies, they have apparently not resolved such issues as what guarantees the two Governments would provide each to insure performance of their promises."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/21/business/xoil-energy-resources-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-feb-28.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "XOIL ENERGY RESOURCES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 28", "print_headline": "XOIL ENERGY RESOURCES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 28", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/14/business/ailing-car-industry-called-peril-to-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 719, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AILING CAR INDUSTRY CALLED PERIL TO U.S.", "print_headline": "AILING CAR INDUSTRY CALLED PERIL TO U.S.", "body_text": " **********The Transportation Department warned today that the current difficulties of the automobile industry posed a threat to national security, and it urged the Government to negotiate an agreement with Japan setting ceilings on shipments of Japanese vehicles to this country. **********Such an agreement would be a key part of a combined effort by industry, labor and government to fight foreign competition, which in the past two years has nearly doubled its share of the American auto market. **********Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary G. William Miller said the Chrysler Corporation's survival plan must include a greater financial cushion before the Government could approve more loan guarantees for the company. (Page D1.) **********The Transportation Department's grim assessment came in a report on the domestic automobile industry that Congress ordered last year when it authorized a rescue of the Chrysler Corporation. Essentially the department's plan is intended to buy time for the American car industry while it retools over the next few years to make smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. **********In its report, the department said that the ''alarming'' trends and developments it had identified had been long in the making and that blame should be apportioned widely. **********Management, it said, neglected production efficiencies, quality control and development of new products. Labor, it said, grew accustomed to annual improvements in wages and fringe benefits without regard to productivity or business conditions. And the Government, it said, ''has loaded the cost of social and environmental regulation onto auto makers without a careful examination'' of costs. **********All this, the department said, combined with surging fuel prices and recession to cripple an industry that accounts for 8 1/2 percent of America's gross national product and, directly and indirectly, for one-sixth of its jobs. **********Transportation Secretary Neil E. Goldschmidt said the decline, if allowed to continue, could spread with disastrous consequences. ''If this report says one thing,'' he said at a news conference, ''it is that Chrysler is just the tip of the iceberg if we don't move on this problem.'' **********Moreover, he contended, the nation's security could be placed in jeopardy by an erosion of the industrial base accompanying the decline of automotive business. **********''In the past this industry's production capacity has been a vital mobilizing force in our defense capability,'' he told President Carter in sending the report to the White House. ''Just as important is the role our industrial might plays in defining our position in the world. Our strategic position could be gravely undermined were we to depend on others for our basic manufactured goods.'' **********The idea of limiting imports of Japanese cars - of which 1.8 million were sold in the United States last year -has been raised before.

Father's Day, that early summer homage to the gods of retailing, has by and large caught up with Mother's Day, despite the latter's long headstart. (Mother's Day was authorized by law in 1914, a status Father's Day only acquired in 1971.) **********''Nearly $3 billion in total retail sales are expected from this Father's Day, virtually the same amount as for Mother's Day,'' said Ted Kaufman, executive director of both the Father's Day and Mother's Day Councils, which are non-profit groups whose members include such top corporate names as Sears Roebuck and J.C. Penney. **********''Until about 1940, Mother's Day was the more dominant holiday for retailers, but since then the gap has closed steadily. Now if anything, the median amount spent for a Father's Day gift is a bit higher,'' Mr. Kaufman said. That median cost of a gift for either holiday is now $65, he said, and Dad gets an average of 2.5 gifts. **********Three out of four Father's Day gifts are clothes, from the predictable necktie to outfits with more flair. ''A wife tries to upgrade the clothing that her husband wears,'' Mr. Kaufman said. ''If he usually wears Arrow, she'll buy him Van Huesen or a designer shirt.'' **********Major New York stores, while declining to break out figures because graduations and weddings also contribute to volume this time of year, declare the current holiday a success. **********''There are double-digit increases over last year,'' said Paul Leblang, senior vice-president for marketing at Saks Fifth Avenue.  ''All of our active sportswear is selling exceptionally well.'' **********''Business is fabulous, almost equally, for Father's and Mother's Day,'' a spokesman for Bloomingdales said, noting strong growth in men's accessories - small leather goods and cufflinks. **********''As Father's Day becomes more of a tradition, people try to outdo what they did the year before,'' added Arthur H. Grodd, general merchandising manager at Paul Stuart, a Madison Avenue men's shop at which cotton sweaters and knit shirts are hot items. **********Liquor is the second most frequently given gift for Dad. Citing a Harvard Business School research report, done for the Father's Day Council, Mr. Kaufman said ''26 percent of those surveyed admit to giving liquor. I say 'admit,' because people tend to understate purchases of liquor. It might be 50 percent.'' More liquor is sold for this weekend than at any other time except the Christmas season. **********The Harvard study found that people between the ages of 18 and 25, and wives, are the most likely gift-buyers. Twice as many women as men gave gifts for Father's Day, while women matched men in giving on Mother's Day. **********Separate holidays for parents stress the old sex roles. Mother's Day typically liberates Mom from the kitchen. (Restaurants are more crowded than on any other day except Thanksgiving.) Father's Day is for cooking out. The Beef Industry Council reports that 70 million to 80 million pounds of beef are sold for the Father's Day weekend, 10 million more than usual. **********Telephone volume is also up, but Father's Day is a loser in that catagory. Today, 18 million phones are expected to ring with interstate callers as opposed to the 21 million which sound on Mother's Day, according to A.T.& T. (Ordinary Sunday volume averages 15.3 million interstate calls.) This year, MCI communications, one of A.T.& T.'s competitors, is offering a freebie that Ma Bell doesn't concede on any holiday - 10 minutes of free calling over Father's Day weekend, similar to its past promotions for Christmas and Mother's Day. **********On Madison Avenue, the June holiday has already moved ahead, generating $17 million worth of advertising, against Mother's Day's $12 million. Both are growing, however, and at whose expense?  Easter's, retailers say. **********The trend to less formal dress and the hop-about date of Easter, which frequently means it falls too early for light clothes, have cut into sales. Mother's and Father's Day arrive dependably in the warm months when shoppers need to shed their winter wool. ''We are heading towards the development of a parents' season which will run from the end of April through July,'' Mr. Kaufman said. Now, what about the in-laws?

To transfer the benefits, the previously purchased equipment must be ''sold'' to a company willing to pay cash for the tax benefits and then lease the equipment back to the original owner using the equipment. In fact, the sale is for tax purposes only. The company using the equipment retains title and possession. After tomorrow, such deals can be entered into only for newly purchased equipment. **********Estimate of Total Involved **********Tax experts expect that by the deadline, the tax benefits on equipment valued at $10 billion to $20 billion will have been sold, resulting in a loss to the Treasury of at least 10 percent of the total. **********''There's a great deal of frantic activity,'' said William P.  Casey, of the investment firm bearing his name. ''There's never been anything like this before.'' **********Peter K. Nevitt, president of the BankAmeriLease Group, the Bank of America's leasing subsidiary, added, ''A tremendous amount of deals are getting done or are in the late stages.'' But he noted that some deals had ''fallen out of bed'' because of last-minute complications. **********One of the biggest buyers of tax benefits has been the International Business Machines Corporation, which purchased tax credits and depreciation deductions from the Ford Motor Company, the B.F. Goodrich Company and the CSX Corporation for more than $300 million. I.B.M. is expected to announce still another deal tomorrow. **********In the past couple of days, the Marsh & McLennan Companies announced the purchase of tax benefits from the Occidental Petroleum Corporation for an undisclosed sum, and Ideal Basic Industries sold tax benefits to an unnamed buyer for $77 million. **********Other sellers of benefits have included United Airlines, Conrail, Burlington Northern, Bethlehem Steel and Inland Steel. Bankers say that buyers are more reluctant to disclose their identity since many of them fear they will be criticized for tax avoidance. **********''It's very unlikely, unless you have both parties lined up, that you could still get a deal done,'' said Donald R. Kendall Jr., a vice president at Morgan Stanley & Company, which estimates it will negotiate leases for some $2 billion in equipment. ''One of the biggest constraints is finding a good law firm that isn't busy with these.'' **********''We have been working 16- and 17-hour days on these deals,'' said Richard J. Bronstein, a lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. ''We are trying to close everything now. No one wants to leave this for the last minutes.'' How Tax Benefit Works **********Participants in the transactions are closely guarding their exact terms in order to maintain bargaining room for future deals. Here is an example used by some experts to describe how a typical deal is structured: **********Equipment valued at $1 billion that is owned by a financially troubled company is ''sold'' for tax purposes to a profitable company for $200 million in cash and an $800 million note. The seller retains title to the equipment and possession of it, but for tax purposes the profitable company is declared its owner. This allows the buyer of the benefits to depreciate the equipment over its life and to get a one-time investment tax credit of 10 percent of the value of the equipment. **********The right to possession is gained by a lease, which is for $800 million, the amount the buyer happens to owe on the note. Except for the $200 million cash payment, the deal is a ''wash.'' **********As a result, the buyer of the benefits gets a tax benefit it would not otherwise have and the seller gets cash. Payment Is Postponed **********The 10 percent tax credit is subtracted from the buyer's tax bill and is permanently lost to the Treasury. The depreciation allowances are deducted from current tax bills but must be paid in later years.  Their value is that they free capital to be employed sooner rather than later and that, in inflationary times, they are eventually paid in less valuable dollars. **********Another tax effect of the deal is that the purchaser of the tax benefits must report the $800 million in lease payments as income over the life of the lease and is taxed on them, even though the payments are not actually received from the equipment user because they are offsetting what the benefit purchaser owes the user on the purchase note. **********''There's a number of companies that are interested in becoming buyers of benefits,'' said C. Daniel Tyree, a vice president at Saloman Brothers. ''But they just haven't been able to react aggressively before Nov. 13. They may be in the market in the future.'' Chrysler's Situation **********One open question is whether the Chrysler Corporation, which has some $200 million worth of equipment it purchased during 1981, will be able to find a buyer of its tax benefits before the deadline. **********Yesterday the Treasury Department issued new regulations that, in effect, allow a tax benefit purchaser to keep the benefits if the seller goes bankrupt - provided that creditors with a secured interest in the equipment have agreed in advance of the bankruptcy.  Otherwise, the creditors can claim the equipment and the benefits. **********Some experts doubt that such agreements could be obtained from Chrysler's secured creditors by the deadline.  Chrysler's controller, Christopher J. Steffen, has noted that the cash that could be obtained from such a sale -perhaps $50 million - would be ''very important to the cash flow'' of Chrysler and that the troubled auto company planned to sell other tax benefits after tomorrow's deadline."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/06/business/company-news-crude-spot-prices-off-sharply-81-drop-more-than-5-a-barrel.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Martin", "pub_date": "1981-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 800, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company News; CRUDE SPOT PRICES OFF SHARPLY; '81 DROP MORE THAN $5 A BARREL", "print_headline": "Company News; CRUDE SPOT PRICES OFF SHARPLY; '81 DROP MORE THAN $5 A BARREL", "body_text": " **********The price of the basic grade of crude oil from the Middle East has slipped more than $1 on the spot market in the past week, a direct result of an oversupply of oil worldwide, traders report. **********Since early April, the price of this oil on the spot market, where oil not under contract is traded, has dropped more than $3.50 a barrel, for a total decline of more than $5 a barrel this year - an unusually steep decline. **********The price for this medium-quality oil is now $34 a barrel, but even at the lower prices buyers are refraining from large purchases in the belief that prices will fall still lower. **********Spot prices of the light, low-sulfur, high-quality African crudes have fallen even more sharply than for the Middle East ones.  According to a cable received by one major oil company, the African spot price has now fallen as low as $35.50 a barrel, almost $5 below official prices. **********Profit Margins Seen Disappearing **********The new lower prices ''are the kind of prices at which people are failing to sell oil,'' said Marshall Thomas, markets and pricing editor of Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an influential trade publication. **********The spot market, which usually accounts for only about a tenth of oil in world trade, has become even thinner as a result of the lack of sellers. Indeed, Mr. Thomas estimates that even with the decline in crude prices, companies are having trouble breaking even on refining oil because of the growing oversupply. **********Further, companies are refusing to accept oil that they are guaranteed under previous contracts, an action that was unthinkable in the much tighter markets that existed just several months ago.  Industry sources say that the Ashland Oil Company recently refused some heavy crude from Mexico, while the Atlantic Richfield Company earlier acknowledged that it had rejected contract deliveries from Nigeria. **********Numerous other companies are said to be taking the less drastic step of telling producing countries they have logistical problems, such as refinery difficulties, that force them to delay purchases. Forcing Gasoline Prices Down **********The falling spot prices have already helped reduce gasoline prices about 2 cents a gallon in recent weeks, have facilitated the United States Government's accelerating spot crude purchases for its Strategic Petroleum Reserve and have damped the prospect that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will raise prices at its planned meeting in Geneva May 25. **********Energy analysts note that the major force behind the current glut and the steep drop in spot prices is Saudi Arabia, which is flooding the world with less expensive oil to force OPEC to reduce prices. **********This strategy appears to be based on growing fears in the kingdom that the price of oil is rising so fast that it will force Western countries to develop alternative energy sources and improved conservation well before the Saudis run out of oil. Other oil producers, with far less oil, have a greater interest in seeing prices rise as much as possible. Now at Saudi Arabia's Level **********Oil industry officials note that a spot price of $34 a barrel coincides with the $34 for which the Saudis recently decided to sell so-called war-relief crude. This oil, believed to total about 550,000 barrels daily, is being supplied to customers who had been purchasing crude from Iraq before the onset of its war with Iran. Analysts have suggested this is about the level the Saudis consider appropriate. **********As such, the $34 price would represent a compromise between the basic $32 that Saudi Arabia charges for most of the 10.3 million barrels it produces daily and the $36 base used by the rest of OPEC.  The significance of the $34 price, for which the Saudis seem clearly to have been responsible, is that the 13-nation group often uses spot prices as a basis for official prices. **********Perhaps the biggest beneficiary of the decline in spot prices has been the United States Government, which has increased its strategic oil purchases from 100,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter to 300,000 barrels currently. The stated basis for the speedup has been national security. **********Recently, industry sources say, the Government has turned down 19 offers from sellers of crude oil. ''Effectively, what they are doing is gambling that the price will be lower later on,'' said a pricing expert with a major international oil company. U.S. Purchases Important **********If it were not for the United States Government purchases, spot prices would be even lower. That program has been almost the only factor working to keep prices up in the thin spot market, oil analysts say."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/03/business/stanley-home-products-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STANLEY HOME PRODUCTS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "STANLEY HOME PRODUCTS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/24/world/even-in-mexico-reagan-turns-his-attention-to-awacs-issue.html": {"writer_name": "Howell Raines", "pub_date": "1981-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 745, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EVEN IN MEXICO, REAGAN TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO AWACS ISSUE", "print_headline": "EVEN IN MEXICO, REAGAN TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO AWACS ISSUE", "body_text": " **********President Reagan met with Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia here today, but by prior agreement both men reportedly refrained from mentioning the sale of Awacs aircraft to the Saudis. **********Representatives of the two nations have already discussed the Awacs issue ''to the limits of tolerance,'' a White House spokesman said.

Habib, the President's special envoy, would return to the Middle East in the second week of November.

Mr. Reagan pledged to continue United States economic assistance to Algeria, Mr. Gergen said. **********Since arriving here Wednesday, Mr. Reagan has had private meetings with leaders of 12 nations, and three more such meetings are scheduled before he leaves for Washington tomorrow morning. He has also participated in the four full sessions of the conference, which is seeking ways to narrow the economic gap between rich and poor nations. **********White House aides, faced with predictions from key senators that Mr. Reagan is losing the Awacs fight, worked hard today to protect the privacy of the President's meeting with Prince Fahd. **********Initially, Mr. Reagan's advisers planned to bar photographers from the President's sixth-floor suite while the Prince was there. Then it attempted to impose a ground rule that reporters at the photo session could not ask questions of the two leaders. **********A White House official said before today's meeting that Secretary of State Alexander M.

Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, challenged Thomas J. Campbell, director of the commission's Bureau of Competition, to show that the commission had ever offered such an alternative in past antitrust suits. **********Mr. Campbell, appearing before a joint meeting of the House and Senate Commerce committees, said there had been similar cases involving other industries but that he knew of none in the oil industry. **********Giving 'Green Light' Charged **********Representative Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, charged that the commission and the Justice Department had given industry a ''green light; you have played a role in the extraordinary wave of merger activity.'' **********Mr. Gore said the provisions outlined by the commission in its suit against Mobil would be the key to a Mobil takeover.  ''The public should be aware the blueprint was written at the F.T.C.,'' he said. Mr. Gore said the alternative outlined by the commission ''says to the middle-tier oil company it's O.K. to buy up reserves as long as you sell off other assets.'' (In New York, Herbert Schmertz, Mobil's vice president for public affairs, said, ''We fail to understand why Congressmen Dingell and Gore would be critical of a Government agency which encourages compliance with the law.'') **********Mr. Campbell said the commission had determined that the only aspects of the merger that would be considered an antitrust violation were in the areas cited for divestiture. Overlaps in 18 Areas **********In marketing of wholesale gasoline, Mr. Campbell said the commission found significant ''overlaps'' between Mobil and Marathon in 18 metropolitan areas, mainly in the Middle West. **********He said the commission would insist that any company taking over Marathon's marketing, transportation and storage assets be capable of continuing those operations. **********Mobil, which faces other court obstacles in its pursuit of Marathon, has announced an greement to sell these Marathon assets to the Amerada Hess Corporation in the event Mobil wins the takeover battle against the U.S. Steel Corporation, the rival bidder for Marathon. U.S. Steel's bid, endorsed by Marathon, is valued at $6.3 billion, and Mobil's at $6.5 billion. **********Witnesses at a House subcommittee hearing last week questioned whether Amerada Hess, a New York-based oil company, had the crude oil sources to supply the Marathon network. Yates Field Key Target **********Mobil's primary target in its proposed takeover is Marathon's nearly 50 percent stake in the Yates oilfield in west Texas, whose oil and gas reserves are Marathon's most valuable asset. **********Last week, stymied in its takeover attempt by U.S. Steel's apparently more successful bid, Mobil announced plans to buy up to 25 percent of U.S. Steel stock, a move that industry analysts viewed as a way for Mobil to gain bargaining power in a bid to acquire Marathon indirectly. **********In answer to a question from Mr. Dingell, Mr. Campbell said that, if Mobil tried to get control of U.S. Steel, the commission ''would be faced with all the overlaps we already face in the Marathon takeover as well as possible overlaps between Mobil and U.S. Steel.'' **********William F. Baxter, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said such a move would touch off another investigation by his department, but he declined to say whether such an investigation had already begun. Reconsideration Sought **********In Cleveland, attorneys for Mobil today asked Judge John M. Manos of the United States District Court there to reconsider his decision that Marathon's takeover by Mobil would violate antitrust laws, particularly in the sale of gasoline in the Middle West. Mobil is also appealing Judge Manos's ruling to the United States Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, with hearings scheduled before the appeals court on Thursday. **********Marathon, meanwhile, said that it had asked the appeals court to dissolve a temporary restraining order imposed last Friday against U.S. Steel's purchase of Marathon stock. The appeals court granted the order while it considered another appeal sought by Mobil, this one objecting to a ruling by Judge Joseph P. Kinneary in United States District Court in Columbus. **********Judge Kinneary had upheld the legality of two options that Marathon had given to U.S. Steel to encourage it to bid for Marathon. Marathon said that it asked the appeals court to dissolve the restraining order on the completion of a hearing this Thursday of Mobil's arguments in the case. **********Terms of the appeals court decision provide that Marathon's stockholders have the right to take back their shares of either U.S.  Steel or Mobil for five business days after the appeals court rules.  U.S. Steel, which already has received 90 percent of Marathon's shares in response to its offer to pay $125 a share for 51 percent of Marathon, might therefore be unable to buy the shares at least until Dec. 24, if the court rules the day of the hearing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/16/world/2-us-awacs-immediately-begin-patrols-in-egypt.html": {"writer_name": "William Farrell", "pub_date": "1981-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 786, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 U.S. AWACS IMMEDIATELY BEGIN PATROLS IN EGYPT", "print_headline": "2 U.S. AWACS IMMEDIATELY BEGIN PATROLS IN EGYPT", "body_text": " **********Two United States airborne surveillance planes arrived over Egyptian airspace today and immediately began patrolling Egypt's vast western desert, which borders on Libya. **********A scheduled reception for the arrival of the two Awacs, or Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft, did not take place because the planes were immediately put into service. **********Officials of the Ministry of Information had invited the press to attend the reception, and the American Embassy here also sent a delegation for an arrival ceremony that included a small Egyptian honor guard. **********There was no immediate explanation of why the ceremony was canceled.

He laid a wreath at Mr. Sadat's grave. **********A report from Israel said Mr. Weizman had been barred from the official Israeli delegation that attended Mr. Sadat's funeral on Saturday because of a strong dislike between him and Prime Minister Menachem Begin. **********Mr. Mubarak has reappointed all the members of Mr. Sadat's Cabinet and has retained the governors of Egypt's 26 governorates as part of his attempt to insure continuity. For the time being the post of Vice President, which Mr. Mubarak held, is vacant. Questions Still Unanswered **********A Government investigation into Mr. Sadat's assassination during a military parade is continuing, and there are several major questions still unanswered. One is whether the security around Mr. Sadat was lax in responding to the sudden departure from the parade of men dressed as soldiers who began firing and throwing hand grenades at the reviewing stand. Another is whether the attack was the work of a small group of Moslem fundamentalists or whether the attackers were part of a broader consipiracy to bring down the Sadat regime. **********A ranking Egyptian official said that for the time being Mr.  Mubarak would concentrate on insuring continuity in the Government but that in time he would assert his own style. **********Mr. Mubarak has said several times that he will continue Egypt's strong links with the United States and will pursue a comprehensive Middle East peace as outlined in the Camp David accord with Israel.

The riots in Liverpool this week, stemming partly from the worst unemployment Britain has experienced since the Depression of the 1930's, are grim evidence of the failure of what was once regarded as a brilliant innovation in economic policy. **********When Mrs. Thatcher became Prime Minister in May 1979, she was the darling of conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic. Today, she faces a revolt in her own party and has been disowned by the Reaganites in Washington, who say she departed from and made a mess of what initially was a correct solution to the twin problems of inflation and industrial stagnation. **********But was her fault one of execution or were there inherent inconsistencies and contradictions in the Thatcher program that the Reagan Administration is on the way to repeating? **********The Thatcher plan certainly began with close parallels to the Reagan program: **********- A commitment to ''monetarism,'' the doctrine that holds that the way to stop inflation is to reduce the growth of the money supply to a rate equal to the potential growth of the economy. Mrs. Thatcher elected to do this gradually: The Bank of England, under the domination of her Government, would reduce the rate of growth of the chosen monetary aggregate called ''sterling M-3,'' currency in circulation plus sterling-denominated demand and time deposits in British commercial banks, to an annual rate of 9 percent in 1980-81 and to 6 percent in 1983-84. **********- The real value of Government spending - total outlays corrected for inflation - was to be cut. The money the Government needed to borrow from the public to cover its debts and those of local authorities and public corporations would be scaled down to 7 billion in 1980-81 for openers. **********- Marginal income tax rates would be cut sharply to spur savings and productivity growth, with the biggest cuts both absolutely and proportionately going to those in the higher income brackets. **********How faithfully did Mrs. Thatcher carry out her plan? On monetary policy she has striven to tighten up the money supply. It is true that sterling M-3 overshot its target but this resulted largely from removing the so-called corset from the commercial banks, the special deposit regulations that had limited the extent to which the banks could increase their interest-bearing deposits. However, the money supply narrowly defined, M-1, consisting of currency and demand deposits, was held to a mere 3 percent rate of growth during the first 12 months after Mrs. Thatcher took office and an 8 percent rate thereafter. **********The clearest indication of tight money was the sharp rise in interest rates. The outflow of funds from London to New York, attracted by still higher interest rates, helped tighten money further, despite Government plans to make more funds available by bringing down public-sector borrowing. **********In this Mrs. Thatcher failed. She quickly put through cuts in marginal income tax rates, bringing down the top rate on compensation income to 60 percent from 83 percent and the bottom rate to 30 percent from 33. And she cut the top rate on investment income to 75 percent from 98 percent. At the same time, to promote the shift from consumption to savings, the Government nearly doubled the value added tax, a kind of sales tax, to 15 percent from 8 percent. **********Sharply rising interest rates pushed the economy into a deep slump, and the budget fell deeper into deficit. To curb the growing public borrowing requirement, the Government raised excise taxes on tobacco, alcohol, gasoline, diesel fuel, road vehicles and other items. **********Government spending kept climbing, despite Mrs. Thatcher's efforts at belt-tightening. She imposed her steepest cuts on public-sector investment items, thereby aggravating the problem of inflation. But instead of realizing her initial plan to bring down public borrowing to 7 billion in 1980-81, the Thatcher Government ran its borrowing requirement up to 13.5 billion, or 6 percent of the gross national product, one of the highest in the world. **********Thus, Mrs. Thatcher's fundamental mistake has been to try to cure stagflation by combining a tight monetary policy with a loose fiscal policy. She has incurred big deficits that forced the Government to be a heavy competitor for scarce private savings, forcing up both nominal and real interest rates. **********This has produced an extraordinary slump in production and employment. The jobless rate has doubled, to more than 11 percent, from 5.4 percent when Mrs. Thatcher took office two years ago. **********With the slump, inflation has fallen to low double-digit numbers, but the high interest rates on both Government and private bonds reflect the pessimism of the financial markets about the prospects for solving the problem of British inflation. . **********The recent behavior of interest rates and the securities markets in New York reflect similar apprehension that the Reagan monetary and fiscal policies have more in common with those of the Thatcher Government than the Administration here is willing to acknowledge.  Whether the Administration can still benefit from the mistakes of the Thatcher Government will be examined in a second column."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/27/business/western-air-lines-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WESTERN AIR LINES reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "WESTERN AIR LINES reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/20/business/advertising-new-talent-is-hired-at-muller-jordan-weiss.html": {"writer_name": "Philip DOUGHERTY", "pub_date": "1981-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 525, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Talent Is Hired At Muller Jordan Weiss", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; New Talent Is Hired At Muller Jordan Weiss", "body_text": " **********A lot has been going on at Muller Jordan Weiss that could affect the future of the agency.

On the bountiful side, for the last three decades global food production has steadily increased, slightly outstripping population growth and enabling more people to eat better than at any time in history. **********This year, world grain production is expected to set historic records, permitting some rebuilding of world food stockpiles. India, once written off as a hopeless case, has almost tripled its food production in the last 30 years. Laborers in the Soviet Union expect a regular portion of meat, and Chinese peasants no longer fear the killing famines that in the past have swept over the land. 500 Million Suffer Malnutrition **********Despite the real progress, however, there are still more hungry people in the world than ever before - both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of total world population. The rising cost of food has contributed to this situation. **********By most estimates, more than 500 million people - roughly one out of every nine - suffer from serious malnutrition today, compared with 100 million to 200 million - one out of every 14 to 25 people - in the 1950's. Mismanagement Adds to Woes **********Refugee camps are still filled with wide-eyed children with swollen bellies. Millions of malnourished adults in Asia and Africa are still doomed to live and work far below their normal capabilities. And even in relatively prosperous countries such as Poland, economic mismanagement has produced shortages of food so severe that the population has taken to the streets. **********The coexistence of bounty and want is, in short, as stark as it ever was. The reason is that food production has not kept up with rising incomes around the world and those income gains are not being equitably distributed. **********As more countries - particularly the rapidly developing middleincome countries - and wealthier people in those countries gain in purchasing power, they consume more food. This in turn puts pressure on food prices, and means that poorer people everywhere have a harder time buying enough to eat. **********''There has been significant progress in a few developing countries,'' John Mellor, head of the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, said in a recent interview. ''But the gains do mean that the poorest people will be worse off. It's a good development, but it is increasing inequalities.'' 'Ghost of Malthus Not Buried' **********''The ghost of Malthus,'' as Shahid J. Burki of the World Bank recently put it, ''is not buried yet.'' But the fact remains that the doomsday theorists who warned only a few years ago that a ''human tidal wave'' would swamp the world's capacity to produce food have so far been proved wrong. Between 1960 and 1980, thanks to the Green Revolution's new seeds and fertilizers, global corn and wheat yields have jumped by 50 percent, and rice yields by 30 percent. **********As a result, by the late 1970's global per-capita food consumption had increased to 108 percent of the minimum essential for good health, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, compared with slightly below 100 percent in the early 1950's. Many Uncertainties Remain **********What are the chances of extending these gains, and more important, of translating them into food for the millions with empty stomachs?  Will the 1980's bring a more secure world food system and more equal distribution of food, or a recurrence of the periodic shortages, price instabilities and inequities of the 1970's? **********The answers to these questions are as uncertain as the weather.  But most international food experts agree that in the next decade the world will be entering a new era, characterized more by food shortages than food surpluses, by widely fluctuating prices, and by a steadily widening gap between those who have plenty and those who go hungry. At worst, a disaster to dwarf the food crisis of 1973-74 is seen as a possibility. **********A number of new stresses on the world food system are responsible for the insecurities that lie ahead. The most important structural changes are these: **********- Agricultural productivity in the United States seems to be leveling off, and idle cropland in this country has virtually disappeared. Because the United States now supplies more than half of the grain in world trade, this could mean less food available in the future for deficit countries. **********- The United States may also be forced to curtail its food exports because of accelerating soil erosion and the pressure of foreign demand on domestic food prices. Some experts, such as Walter P.  Falcon, director of Stanford University's Food Research Center, believe that ''the 1980's will almost surely see a reduction in the rate of growth of export supplies from the United States.'' **********- Even if exports of food from North America could continue expanding indefinitely, many believe that the very dependence of the rest of the world on a single region is a danger. According to the World Bank's Mr. Burki, if a drop of more than 10 percent in the North American grain crop coincided with a shortfall somewhere else, the result would be ''disaster.'' **********- World food prices now rise much faster in times of scarcity, because of the spreading tendency of food-importing countries, notably Japan, the European Economic Community and the Soviet Union, to keep their domestic grain prices fixed. This means that, even when global food supplies shrink, consumers in these countries can continue to purchase the same amount of food and producers have no incentives to hold stocks or increase production. As a result, supplies do not adjust, international prices go higher than they would otherwise and the poorest food importers suffer. **********- The improvement in living standards and the growing demand for food around the world have put pressure on food prices, making it harder for the poorest countries to import their food needs. Many Eating More Meat **********Rapidly developing, middle-income countries such as Mexico, South Korea and Thailand are eating more meat than ever before. The Eastern European bloc - with the exception of hard-pressed Poland - has decided to maintain levels of food consumption through good years and bad. And the Middle East oil producers have adopted Western diets with abandon, increasing their food imports from 3.1 million metric tons, valued at $350 million, in 1970 to 15 million tons, valued at $3 billion, in 1980. **********Behind these new consumers looms the enormous shadow of China. Its food imports tripled in the period from 1961 to 1977 and are still growing. In all, these purchasers are putting great pressures on the international grain markets and, consequently, on prices. **********As a result of these trends, world grain prices are increasingly unstable. In the 1970's, world wheat price fluctuations were more than seven times greater than in the 1960's, and swings in rice prices were more than twice as extreme. Virtually all the authorities expect prices in the 1980's to be even more unpredictable, adding to the insecurity of the poor importing countries and of food producers and consumers in the United States, one of the few countries that allows international grain prices to be fully reflected in its domestic market. **********Since the World Food Conference in 1974, a major goal of the antihunger movement has been the establishment of an international wheat reserve system to stabilize prices, so that poor countries could be assured of affording food imports in cases of emergency. But negotiations on a global grain reserve were adjourned without success in 1979, and the prospects for such a system being established now appear to be nil. A Modest Wheat Reserve **********In late 1980, the United States did act to guarantee that a modest Government-held wheat reserve of 4 million metric tons would be established to backstop shipments of food aid in cases of severe food shortages. The United States is also committed to a minimum annual level of 4.47 million tons of food aid under the Food Aid Convention of 1980, which guarantees that at least 7.6 million tons of food aid a year will be available from exporting countries as aid. **********Current food aid levels are about 9 million tons a year, of which about 6 million tons are from the United States. That amount is negligible compared with the needs of the food-deficit areas, however. According to the F.A.O., 72 low-income, developing countries received some 8.1 million tons of food aid in 1980, compared with import requirements of some 17.7 million tons of wheat, 4.6 million tons of coarse grain, and 4.8 million tons of rice over the 1980-81 crop year. **********The poorest countries will obviously have to go into the commercial markets to cover their food deficits. To enable them to afford emergency purchases, the International Monetary Fund recently established a criterion for lending that would enable poorer countries to receive additional financing from the fund when their food imports rose above a base level. This could make an additional $500 million to $700 million available to food-short countries. **********To keep such an influx of funds from pushing prices even higher, and to guarantee that the poorest countries would have access to grain purchases in tight periods, several international food groups, including the F.A.O., the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food Council, have proposed an international food security reserve. A 9- to 18-Million-Ton Reserve **********The reserve, which could be from 9 to 18 million tons in size, would assure developing countries that they would not be squeezed out of the world food market if prices skyrocket during a shortage.  Grain exporters would promise to make available to the poorest countries in times of scarcity an amount of wheat based on their normal commercial import purchases. The sales would be at roughly commercial rates, although a ceiling on the price, based on long-term market trends, would be set. **********Over the longer run, however, the only real world food security is an increase in food production in the deficit countries. The World Food Council, a United Nations policy group set up in 1974 to monitor international food security, is working with some 50 developing countries to establish national food plans. **********Food experts agree that greatly increased investment in technical assistance, irrigation networks and agricultural research will be necessary in the coming decades if the world is ever to achieve freedom from hunger. The World Bank, the chief international lending agency for such projects, is now putting 30 percent of its resources into agriculture, 80 percent of which is going directly into food production. The $1 billion International Fund for Agricultural Development, based in Rome and heavily financed by the Arab oil producers, is also devoting all of its resources to agricultural development. **********These investments are only a drop in the bucket compared with the world's need, however. World Bank calculations indicate that an investment of $600 billion in developing countries, largely in expensive irrigation systems, will be required over the next 10 years just to maintain food supplies at present levels of hunger. **********No one is sure where that vast sum will be coming from, or whether the agricultural development that is necessary will be accomplished before the next poor harvest years. **********''Say the economic policies in the United States don't work, and we get heavy inflation here, and then a bad crop year or two,'' Mr.  Mellor of the International Food Policy Research Institute speculated recently. ''Food prices here soar, and the Government decides to slap on an export embargo, sending global food prices through the roof.  What would a Tanzania or a Bangladesh - which already spends 80 percent of its export earnings on food imports - do then? That's the disaster scenario, and it's a perfectly possible eventuality.'' **********Next: The human cost of worldwide malnutrition."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/04/business/centran-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CENTRAN CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "CENTRAN CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/16/business/rca-has-agreed-to-sell-raco-inc.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RCA Has Agreed To Sell Raco Inc.", "print_headline": "RCA Has Agreed To Sell Raco Inc.", "body_text": " **********The RCA Corporation said it had agreed in principle to sell Raco Inc. to Harvey Hubbell Inc. for $40 million less a credit for liabilities that could amount to between $2 and $2.5 million. **********Raco, which manufactures boxes and fittings for electrical outlets and switches, is a subsidiary of the C.I.T.

Michael Foot, the party leader, who would become Prime Minister if Labor won, is a longtime supporte r of unilateral disarmament and restated his conviction in ri nging terms here yesterday. **********The Labor decision came at a time of mounting resistance to nuclear weapons in a number of other countries of Western Europe, including Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and West Germany. U.S. Role Questioned **********As in other European countries, opposition to nuclear weapons in Britain stems in part from the view that the United States wants this continent to take all the risks. Alex Kitson, the party chairman, said in a speech to the conference on Sunday, ''When they talk of a limited nucle ar war, they mean limited to us.'' **********In addition, many members of the Labor Party fear that a nuclear conflict could be started in Europe through a miscalculation or a technical malfunction 3,000 miles away. A delegate from southwestern England, who lives near two military bases, said she could not bear to tell her children that ''a nuclear attack is likely to be only a few miles away.'' The only sane course, she added, was for a future Labor government ''to tell President Reagan to pack up his bases and leave our shores.'' **********What the party's activists are demanding is that the Conservative Government's plan to acquire Trident missiles to replace the aging Polaris missiles be canceled, that American cruise missiles be banned, that military spending be cut sharply and that this country work for the creation of a European nuclear-free zone - all regardless of what other nations do. **********However, the conference rejected a second resolution calling for the withdrawal of Britain from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, after first seeming to approve that as well. On a show of hands, the measure passed, but on a ''card vote,'' in which the big trade unions were able to make their weight felt, it was defeated easily, 5.2 million votes to 1.6 million. 'This Is Mass Suicide' **********Advocates of withdrawal from NATO said it made no sense to ban nuclear weapons and remain within the Atlantic alliance. One, Stephen Ratcliffe, a delegate from the Midlands, said NATO's policy was to use conventional weapons until it was losing, then to try tactical nuclear weapons ''and then to blow up the world.'' **********''This is mass suicide,'' he told the 1,300 delegates. ''We must get out of the game before it kills all of us.'' Joan Lestor, speaking against withdrawal for the party's National Executive Committee, said it was perfectly consistent for a partly disarmed Britain to remain in NATO. She argued that this country could play a role like those of Canada, Norway and Denmark, all members of the alliance that have forbidden the deployment of nuclear weapons on their soil. **********It was a rowdy and confusing day of voting in the Brighton Conference Center. The chairman, Mr. Kitson, failed to call on Brynmor John, the party's parliamentary spokesman on defense, to state the case for multilateral disarmament, and Mr. John stalked out of the hall without waiting for Miss Lestor's summing up.

But many of the imposing six-story English Tudor apartment buildings of the community have a look of faded glory. **********The population of 230,000 is mainly moderate-income and middleincome blacks, largely from Caribbean islands, and Orthodox Jews. Many of the blacks are from households that earn $15,000 to $25,000 a year. New tenants are often ''moving up'' from poorer housing in Bedford-Stuyvesant or other neighboring communities. **********The buildings need money. In recent years they have gotten a good bit, $14.5 million of it lent or committed by the New York City Community Preservation Corporation, a private company financed by a consortium of commercial and savings banks. It has financed the rehabilitation of 2,200 housing units, mainly apartments. **********The city has contributed to many rehabilitations through the federally funded participation loan program. The Settlement Housing Fund has also done rehabilitation work. **********From time to time rehabilitation work attracts new entrepreneurs. A case in point in Crown Heights is Norwood Campbell.  Mr. Campbell is a 42-year-old black who graduated from the City University of New York, worked in the real estate finance department of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and went into real estate development on his own in the early 1970's. **********In 1977 Mr. Campbell joined Alex Shapiro, owner of a plumbing business in the Bronx, to form the NCAS Realty Management Corporation and the NCAS Construction Company, based in Mount Vernon, N.Y. They began with a building with 110 apartments on Garden Street near the Bronx Zoo. **********Now the Campbell-Shapiro partnership is far advanced in the subsidized rehabilitation of a 178-apartment building at 769 St.  Marks Avenue, close to the Brooklyn Children's Museum in the Brower Park neighborhood. It is a street lined with apartment buildings that have gotten or are soon to get moderate rehabilitation financing, the level of funding usually depending on the state of decay. **********No. 769 was far gone, as developers would say, when Mr. Campbell entered the picture. It had paid no taxes since 1975. Fifty apartments were occupied by squatters paying no rent. ''There were some concerned tenants,'' Mr. Campbell said, ''but conditions were so bad that they could not remain.'' **********So the building was emptied and boarded. When rehabilitation finally came a year and a half later, vacancy had taken its toll. The water-damaged roof needed replacement, as did all the walls and flooring. **********Since the rent-paying capacity of the incoming tenants in that area would be only about $60 a room per month, rehabilitation required a so-called deep subsidy, only possible under the Federal Section 8 program for totally rehabilitated or new housing. The project finally approved by the the Department of Housing and Urban Development called for construction outlays of $37,000 an apartment, or $6.6 million. **********''We intend to see this work over the long haul,'' said Mr.  Campbell, who will continue to manage the project.  But what of the other buildings in the neighborhood? For other owners, management is a struggle. One owner of a nearby 35-family building conceded, ''The future doesn't look good.'' His building would need an overall 30 percent rent increase just to keep up with fuel and repair bills, he said. **********The future accordingly appears to depend on the extent of moderate rehabilitation. Withdrawal or reduction of Federal subsidies could be devastating. The city itself, at the same time, may have the power to smooth the road to more rehabilitation. **********Housing officials are trying to work out a faster route to rent restructuring, typically stalled for eight months to a year and a half when approval is needed for new rents in rent-stabilized apartments from the Conciliation and Appeals Board, the appeals arm of the rent-stabilization system. **********But as matters stand, rigidity in the rent-stabilization system works against rehabilitation efforts. Rent restructuring is a critical component of renewal of older multifamily housing and neighborhoods. Ironically, the problem for the city has not been rent-controlled apartments but rather rent-stabilized apartments, where rent restructuring is not under the direct control of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. **********What rehabilitation of occupied buildings also accomplishes is to take moderate-income housing accommodations off the tax rolls through the J-51 incentive. Tenants could not afford the new rents that rehabilitation requires if taxes were built into the rent structure. **********Would vacancy decontrol have helped if it had not been repealed by the State Legislature in 1973? ''You would have had a higher income mix of tenants in rent-controlled buildings,'' in Mr. Campbell's view. ''The institutions would have had a different attitude about lending.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/24/business/superior-oil-votes-5-for-1-stock-split.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Superior Oil Votes; 5-for-1 Stock Split", "print_headline": "Superior Oil Votes; 5-for-1 Stock Split", "body_text": " **********The Superior Oil Company said its board had approved a proposed 5-for-1 stock split and that the company planned to raise its quarterly dividend to 80 cents a share pre-split from 18 cents. **********Superior said that the stock split, if approved by shareholders at the annual meeting May 20, would be effective June 19 with distribution to be made around July 10.

That's what makes it so interesting.'' **********Mr. Waggaman, who has worked for the Whitney Museum of American Art, among other institutions, recently became a part-time real estate developer. He went into partnership with three other people to form Agadaz Inc., the sponsoring group for the conversion of an imposing eight-story building at 288 West Street, built as a warehouse in 1885, into 14 cooperative apartments designed to sell for more than $175,000 apiece. **********''After living in San Diego for nearly 30 years, I had just moved back to the city and was only looking for a loft to live in,'' Mr.  Waggaman said. ''I saw this rugged old black brick structure and I knew it was just what I wanted.'' **********He was impressed with the location, he added, and the quality of structural sturdiness in the building. It has massive maple wood columns as big as 10 inches square, with as many as 23 per floor, or eight or nine in each apartment. The apartments will range in size from 1,200 to 1,900 square feet. The building itself is 46 feet wide by 100 feet deep. **********It was in the spring of 1979 that Mr. Waggaman returned to the city and began his search for real estate. He scoured Tribeca, the trapezoidal wedge of a commercial district just below Canal Street, once best known as a commodity center. Nowadays it is closer to a New Bohemia - a phenomenon best observed on weekends and evenings when its resident painters, actors, musicians and writers fill the streets and cafes. Meryl Streep and Robert De Niro, the actors, are Tribeca residents, and so is Bette Midler, the singer **********Through a friend, Mr. Waggaman met John Enck, who two years earlier had bought 288 West Street with Linda Patton, his business associate, from Abner Levine for about $100,000. Previously the building had been used as an office furniture warehouse by Umberto Bros. **********The photographer joined the ownership group and with an investment of about $145,000 the mortgage was paid off. **********Mr. Enck had come to Manhattan in 1971 to study architecture, though he gave that up to try a career as a writer. To support himself he worked on loft renovations, specializing in plumbing work. Miss Patton ran a business importing rugs from North Africa. **********For herself, she said, the prospect of living in an apartment that offered sweeping views of the Hudson River was the primary attraction of the building. ''A big city feels different if you are near the river,'' she added. **********To take advantage of the river views, the old windows were enlarged and some new ones punched out of walls that are some places as thick as two feet. Relying chiefly on the designs of a fourth partner, Max Scott, a British-born artist, the partners started the renovation themselves. They cleared space to install new wiring and copper plumbing and put in three new gas furnace heating units, housed in a special area on the roof, near a fenced-in patio. **********There were more extensive changes: a new elevator shaft was built near the front of the building and an automatic self-service cab provided. Flooring has been constructed through the old shaft, adding to the usable floor space of the building. There is a new steel staircase, a sprinkler system and smoke alarms for fire safety, and new kitchens and baths. Other features include thermal windows and more-than-usual insulation in the floors for soundproofing. **********''We learned from our earlier renovations of other people's places that tenants like making some changes themselves,'' said Mr. Scott, who has been a contractor for various loft owners. **********The building's 14 units will be sold for prices ranging from $175,000 to $195,000, according to Mr. Enck, who said an offering plan had recently been accepted by the New York State Attorney General's office. **********As a cooperative, the building will have a $500,000 25-year permanent mortgage at 14 1/2 percent interest. A $10,000 emergency reserve fund has also been set aside. To enhance the offer, Mr.  Waggaman said, cooperative buyers will be given at least $18,000 a year in earnings from the leasing of commercial space to which the property is entitled because of appropriate zoning. A restaurant or an architectural concern are considered possible lessees."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/27/business/nationalization-targets-rally-on-paris-bourse.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1981-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 574, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NATIONALIZATION TARGETS RALLY ON PARIS BOURSE", "print_headline": "NATIONALIZATION TARGETS RALLY ON PARIS BOURSE", "body_text": " **********Shares of companies and banks that France's new Socialist-Communist coalition Government plans to nationalize rallied on the Paris stock exchange today, following yesterday's announcement that the Government would pay a record interest rate of 16.75 percent on its first state borrowing. **********Investors conclude that the bonds the Government is expected to offer shareholders as compensation for taking over their property will carry similarly generous yields. **********Rhone Poulenc, the troubled French synthetic fiber and chemical group, led the rise on the Bourse, as the exchange is known, gaining 14.3 percent. Compagnie Financiere de Suez, the bank and industrial holding company, was up roughly 8.5 percent, as was St.  Gobain-Ponta-Mousson, the diversified industrial company. **********Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas, Pechiney and other companies to be taken over also moved sharply ahead, wiping out some of the big losses they have suffered since the Socialists gained power earlier this year. 'Fair' Compensation **********So far the Government has said only that it plans to start nationalizing privately owned French banks and 12 large industrial companies later this fall, beginning with the banks and the Frenchowned companies on the list. It has said only that the compensation will be ''fair.'' **********If, as is widely expected, the bonds the Government offers shareholders as compensation have a life of 15 years, the interest rate could be as high as 17.50 percent, according to one broker's calculation. The state borrowing announced yesterday has a six-year term. **********The Government could offer a bond with a floating interest rate tied to the general level of interest rates to protect itself if the cost of money falls. But many French brokers believe it will choose a fixed-rate issue to preserve public confidence in its bonds at a time when it faces a heavy borrowing requirement to finance the big budget deficits that will result from its plans to stimulate the economy. **********Another argument, frequently made by brokers, is that the nationalized French insurance companies are already big investors in many of the companies to be nationalized. ''The Government has no interest in ruining their portfolios,'' one broker says. **********Meanwhile, France's private banks are maneuvering to limit the impact of their impending nationalization. The Rothschild interests are trying to save their bank's $75 million portfolio of industrial shares, which is heavily concentrated in mining, metals and tourism, by separating it from their relatively small banking business.

They also point out that the Government has said it does not want to keep the industrial holdings of banks it nationalizes and plans to sell them back to private investors. However, it is still unclear whether the Government, which has already put representatives into all the banks it plans to take over, will approve the Rothschilds' plan. **********If the Rothschilds suceeds in their plan, other big banks on the nationalization list with extensive industrial holdings may well try a similar maneuver, bankers believe.

The Federal agency has been forced 14 times in its 45-year history to make such payments. **********Robert Hughes, deputy director of the Federal agency, attributed Economy's problems to the high interest rates it has to pay for funds and to the low yield on its outstanding mortgage portfolio. **********Insured depositors will receive their funds by mail, a process that has already begun and will continue through the week. Access to the bank is being given only to customers with safe deposit boxes, pending a Federal inventory of Economy's accounts. **********Generally, the Fedeal loan insurance agency attempts to seek merger partners for ailing thrift units. These partners generally take over the deposits and assets of the weak institutions. But, in the case of Economy, no partner could be found. According to Federal officials, Economy is in a neighborhood economically unattractive to other thrifts. **********A spokesman at the Federal agency explained that it was required to apply a ''cost test'' to determine the fate of ailing thrift units, before recommending merger or liquidation. The alternative with the least cost is to prevail. **********Since the start of 1981, the Federal agency has assisted in the mergers of five ailing thrift units, according to the spokesman.  The $60 million to pay off Economy's depositors will come from a $6.5 billion fund set up by the Federaal agency for this purpose. The agency said that it expects to recover nearly all of the $60 million by liquidating Economy's loan portfolio, a process that should take about a year. **********Uninsured funds will receive a pro rata share from the liquidation proceedings, according to H.

Bhikhu, an Indian immigrant who owns the store and now worries about it constantly. ''Without the plywood, I am sure that the glass would have been broken. I do not know when I will take it down.'' **********As Britain celebrates the royal wedding, Mr. Bhikhu's sheets of plywood are a reminder of what will still be a troubling reality long after all the red, white and blue bunting has been taken down - the urban disorders that so shocked a nation long proud of its lawfulness and civility. **********''The Government can make whatever fuss it wants to about Charles and Diana,'' said a 22-year-old unemployed man who said he had taken part in the rioting here but had not been caught. ''But sooner or later, it's going to have to think about us.'' **********He and a group of friends who were whiling away a sunny morning in a littered playground outside a public housing project said they had not heard about the emergency youth-employment program that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced yesterday, partly in response to the rioting. But when told about it, they were skeptical. **********''What future will it bring to Leicester?'' one of them asked.  ''I'll believe it when I see it.'' A textile center that was once prosperous, Leicester began declining even before the current recession, largely because of competition from cheap imports. Then the general economic downturn, in which Britain's manufacturing output has fallen by 17 percent in the past year and a half, added to its miseries. **********But despite the obvious contrast between the splendor of the royal wedding and the plight of the city's unemployed, there were few overt signs of resentment toward Charles and Diana. **********''I expect that even in the riot areas you'd find everybody watching the wedding on television tomorrow,'' said Peter Lowman, an official of the National Union of Hosiery and Knitwear Workers.  ''Remember, we in Britain don't have an antiroyalist or republican tradition.'' **********Downstairs in the union headquarters, the receptionist shyly disagreed. Although the office, like most offices in Britain, will be given a holiday tomorrow, she will not watch the wedding, she said, ''because it doesn't seem right, such an elaborate occasion with so many people out of jobs.'' **********The cities are now peaceful except for Liverpool, where gangs of youths have again clashed with the police this week.

''These are very bad times, and very bad things are happening. I don't know when things will ever be right again.'' ---- Liverpool Riots Continue **********LIVERPOOL, England, Wednesday, July 29 (AP) - Two hundred young rioters hurled gasoline bombs and rocks at the police in this port city's third straight night of violence.

He knows precisely, in dollars and cents, what is - in Sasson, Oscar de la Renta, Gloria Vanderbilt and a handful of other illustrious designer names. **********His own name does not exactly come trippingly off the public tongue, but, in the fast-growing business of designer licensing, Mr. Gore is a Very Important Person. He is one of the biggest and most successful of the licensing agents, the middlemen who make the vital connection between the designer and the manufacturer who wants to put that designer's name on his line of dresses, panty hose, sunglasses, wallets, bedsheets or what-have-you. **********''We've been responsible for putting together licenses worth $1 billion in retail sales,'' said Mr. Gore, a quiet-spoken man probably in his late 50's (he declines to give his age) who is himself discreetly branded with other people's marks - a YSL tie, a Sasson tie clip. (No Sasson briefs, however. As he conceded, ''they're not designed for a 36-inch waist.'') **********In an industry that thrives on trendiness, flash and hype, Mr.  Gore is almost startlingly low-key. Even now, the name-dropping that he likes best involves his children: Lesley Gore, the singer and songwriter, and Michael Gore, the composer who won two Academy Awards this year for the score and song of the movie, ''Fame.'' **********While agents are often unloved, people speak suspiciously fondly of Mr. Gore. ''I love him,'' said Paul Guez, founder and president of Sasson, the jeans company.''We have a beautiful relationship.'' **********''He's a soft man, a nice man,'' said John Pomerantz, president of Leslie Fay, a large apparel company that was licensed a year ago to manufacture suits, dresses, jackets and raincoats under the Sasson name. **********He is also a deal-maker par excellence. In an industry that exists on contacts, ''we pretty much know everyone in the apparel and accessories business,'' Mr. Gore said. That range reflects a career devoted to apparel. **********Until a decade ago, Mr. Gore was running Peter Pan Swimwear, a small, New York-based manufacturer of bras and girdles as well as swim suits, founded by his brother-in-law in 1942. When the company was sold to U.S. Industries in 1968, Mr. Gore went along, then quit shortly before the conglomerate shut it down in 1973. **********Having peddled the Peter Pan name in 27 nations, Mr. Gore amassed a stock of information about licensing and apparel manufacturing. In 1975, he founded Leo Gore Associates in an office on the Avenue of the Americas and began putting his experience to work. Now, with offices in Paris, Tokyo and Mexico, his network is again worldwide. **********In New York, behind a desk piled high with telephone messages, Mr.  Gore is continually on the line to his 10 sales representatives, his licensees and some would-be licensees around the world. **********A caller proposes introducing a hosiery line under a designer's name. ''It could be strong enough,'' Mr. Gore muses. ''Are we talking underwear?'' he queries another caller. ''Are we talking swimwear?'' **********In a pause between telephone calls, Mr. Gore explained that designer initials and logos are popular with consumers because ''they give credibility to products. These are today's trade names, like Maidenform years ago.'' Social historians offer more profound explanations. According to Daniel J. Boorstin, who is now Librarian of Congress, as traditional ties to church and region fade, Americans define themselves, and find a sense of community, in the material items they share. Winston smokers and Mustang drivers ''share their illusions, hopes, and disappointments.'' Of late, this has become the more explicit, with Lord & Taylor shopping bags, Sony hats and someone else's initials on your shirt. **********But whatever psychic or practical needs it fills, designer merchandise has unquestionably proliferated in recent years, despite prices that are often two or three times those of nondesigner wares of equivalent quality. While there is no accurate statistical measure of this sales catagory, Mr. Gore estimated that designer licenses generate $7 billion to $8 billion in store sales each year. **********In return for the design and the right to his or her name or insignia, the designer collects a royalty - ranging from 5 percent to 7 percent, depending on the item - on the manufacturer's sales to the stores. Mr. Gore, in turn, collects 10 percent of that royalty as his commission. **********Many of the top designers, such as Calvin Klein or Bill Blass, as well as some of the top trademarks, such as Jordache, sell their licenses directly to manufacturers. In fact, some tend to be a touch condescending toward the independent agent. **********''I don't need a broker,'' said Joseph Nakash, president of Jordache Enterprises, the fast-growing jeans company that now has 35 licensees in the United States and 20 abroad. ''Good manufacturers come to me.'' **********In the view of Nicholas De Marco, a former agent who is now the full-time coordinator of Pierre Cardin's licenses in the United States, licensing agents primarily benefit less-established names.  Noting that most of the designer names have their own lacensing staff, Mr. De Marco asserted that ''independent agents don't give you the best arrangement. The agent is a compromiser. He gets paid only when a deal is made.'' Too often, an agent is mainly interested in closing a deal and moving on to the next one. **********Indeed, for all his admiration for Mr. Gore, Mr. Guez did say that the licencer has sometimes been ready to settle for a $50,000 royalty guarantee while his client, Sasson, insisted on holding out for $150,000. **********(The way Mr. Gore works, the manufacturer must guarantee of a minimum of $1 million in sales, meaning at least $50,000 in royalties for the designer and $5,000 for Mr. Gore. Typically, Mr. Gore said, ''We'll negotiate a two- or three-year contract with a $1 million guarantee and the option to renew at $1.5 million.'') **********On the other hand, Oscar de la Renta, for one, has concluded that it can pursue licensing opportunities more aggressively through an agent. ''It would be hard for me to go out and flaunt Oscar de la Renta,'' Gerald Shaw, the company's president, said. ''We're not that kind of company.'' **********And Mr. Gore is much more than a broker for his clients, he says.  ''We could sign hundreds of contracts, but our job is to search out the best potential licensees, with the best manufacturing, marketing and financing ability,'' he said. ''We get involved in coordinating the different licensees, in approvals, advertising, product development and quality control. We don't just make the deal and walk away.'' **********Since he signed a contract four years ago with Sasson, for example, he has helped transform the jeans-and-T-shirt manufacturer into an industry. Under Mr. Gore's guidance, the company has added dresses, suits, scarves, fake furs, leather goods, swimwear, men's sports underwear, bras and panties, children's sportswear, belts, hosiery and dolls. **********One Gore inspiration was Sasson maternity jeans. ''Young women are good Sasson customers, and when they become pregnant, they'll still want to wear Sasson jeans,'' he said. Today, $250 million worth of merchandise annually sells under the Sasson label, of which only $80 million - in jeans and some sportswear - is actually manufactured by the company. By 1985, Mr. Guez said, he expects a three-fold increase in total Sasson sales. **********Admittedly, Mr. Gore's loftiest designer names retain him for only part of their business. One of his first clients was designer Oscar de la Renta, for whom Mr. Gore arranged a deal with Cannon Mills for bedding and put together a highly successful perfume line. He also licenses the designer in furs, scarves, eyeglass frames, jewelry and swimsuits. **********BUT Oscar de la Renta men's wear is handled by Kayser-Roth, while the designer's own company sells licenses to manufacture women's jeans, some sportswear, coats and small leather goods under his name. **********For Gloria Vanderbilt, Mr. Gore handles home furnishings only. When she embarked on her career, Mr. Gore said, he made the initial connection with a Hong Kong-based company called Murjani International, which started manufacturing blouses under her name.  Now, through its Gloria Vanderbilt division, Murjani manufactures Vanderbilt sportswear and licenses shoes and leather products. **********''Gloria's a natural for other products - flatware, tableware, paper goods, small leather goods,'' Mr. Gore said. As the designerhome furnishing business grows, he predicted, ''She will become very strong in furniture, lamps, rugs.'' **********The choice of licensee and of products to license can be critical elements in this business.  Mr. De Marco of Pierre Cardin, for example, recalled the time that the designer lent his name to a wine. When the wine promptly sold out, ''the bottler, because he was greedy, put out inferior wine under the same label,'' he said. Mr. Cardin withdrew the license.  ''He didn't really belong in that realm anyway,'' Mr. De Marco said.  ''He designs for the living environment.'' **********Mr. Gore, to protect his designers' names, rejects manufacturers who might sell the wares to discount outlets. ''We want to build a name,'' he observed. Also rejected are licensees who come in with inappropriate products. He cited one manufacturer who approached him recently about putting one of his best designer names on a new line of chewing gum in champagne and sangria flavors. Mr. Gore unhesitatingly vetoed the offer. **********Where will it stop? Mr. Gore conceded that it would be a mistake to attach the trendy Sasson logo to some products, such as housewares. But for some licensers, the model - in volume, at least - is Pierre Cardin. According to one source, the French designer collects $50 million annually in licensing royalties by putting his name on a vast range of products, including cars, jet airplanes, computers, clocks and backgammon sets as well as apparel and accessories. Mr. Cardin ''just goes on, like Old Man River,'' said Mr. Gore. **********Although he confessed that he wearies of some of the more ubiquitous initials, such as Vuitton, Mr. Gore said that he believed the designer syndrome has not yet run its course. ''We don't think it's reached the saturation point, even in clothing,'' he said. As initials proliferate in the future, ''it will just shake out the weak.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/22/world/dutch-officials-to-meet-reagan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dutch Officials to Meet Reagan", "print_headline": "Dutch Officials to Meet Reagan", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Andreas A.M. van Agt and Foreign Minister Christoph A. van der Klaauw will visit Washington on April 1 for talks with President Reagan, Mr. van Agt said last night."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/31/world/conflicts-emerging-in-nigeria-s-21-month-civil-regime.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1981-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1057, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONFLICTS EMERGING IN NIGERIA'S 21-MONTH CIVIL REGIME", "print_headline": "CONFLICTS EMERGING IN NIGERIA'S 21-MONTH CIVIL REGIME", "body_text": " **********A crowd went on a rampage here two weeks ago, burning down the state radio station, the assembly building and other institutions and setting fire to half the state's files. At least two people were killed, and the damage was estimated at $300 million. **********Since then, five local polititians have reportedly gone into hiding, fearing assassination, and the Governor of Kano State, Mohammed Abubakar Rimi, the target of much of the violence, has reported receiving death threats. Many of the official buildings are now smoke-blackened hulks amid the palm trees of Kano, where other riots took place last December. **********The disturbances on July 10, according to Nigerian officials, resulted from strains that have emerged in the 21 months since the end of military rule in Nigeria, which is Africa's economic giant and America's second largest foreign supplier of oil. **********They coincided, too, with realignments and fissures in Nigerian politics, which seem to underscore a mounting, formal opposition to President Shehu Shagari among the country's political parties and growing divisions within those parties. What the Rioters Left Alone **********For anyone who seeks omens, those that emerged from the Kano rampage lay as much in what the rioters left alone as in the targets of their wrath. **********While the institutions of Kano State came under attack, the riot left unscathed the outposts of the federal Government in Lagos, 700 miles to the south. The mob called for the blood of Governor Rimi, but did not direct its attack at the political party in which he leads a maverick faction. ''It was a controlled rampage,'' one official said. **********Ostensibly, the cause of the unrest was a peremptory note that Governor Rimi delivered to the emir of Kano, the traditional ruler.  The emir's powers, on paper, have been greatly diluted over the years, but his influence among the Moslem majority is still great. **********The Governor's note asked the emir to show cause why he should not be removed from office for supposedly displaying disrespect to the state government. Political Motive Suspected **********''The official explanation was that the rampage was caused because the crowd wanted to protect the emir,'' a high state official said.  ''Others feel the riot was politically inspired.'' Kano State is one of 19 such administrative regions in Nigeria and has a reputation for volatility. **********Governor Rimi belongs to the Eagle Faction, a group within the People's Redemption Party, a minority, socialist-leaning group that is regarded by Nigerian and Western analysts as the most ideological of Nigeria's five main parties. In general, these analysts say, ethnic affiliation and personalities play a major role across the political spectrum. **********The Eagle Faction, the analysts say, favors confrontation with symbols of traditional rule, like the emir, whom it accuses of ''oppressing the masses.'' **********But the masses, the high state official said, tend to like their emir. ''Most of the masses are uneducated - they are illiterate,'' he went on. ''They need education. They do not understand the Governor's policies.'' Faction Seen as a Target **********The Eagle Faction has sought unsuccessfully to wrest the leadership of the People's Redemption Party from its chairman, Aminu Kano. The state official and other authoritative sources said the riot on July 10 seemed to have been inspired, in part at least, by members of the party mainstream intent on crushing the Eagle Faction and using the slight against the emir as a pretext. Other groups, these sources said, may also have been involved or have had foreknowledge of the event. **********Nigeria returned to civilian rule in October 1979 after 13 years of military administration. It did so on the basis of a Constitution, modeled on that of the United States, permitting presidential rule and abandoning the parliamentary system bequeathed by Britain, the colonial power that ruled here until independence in 1960. **********Five parties contested the presidency. President Shagari's National Party of Nigeria won enough votes to obtain the leadership, but not an absolute majority. So it entered into a loose and often fractious alliance with the Nigerian People's Party. **********Earlier this month, the People's Party announced that it was withdrawing from the alliance, called The Accord, and the withdrawal caused divisions within the party. Six of its 77 deputies announced that they would continue supporting President Shagari. Two of the party's ministerial appointees are still in President Shagari's Cabinet. A Sense of Vulnerability **********The withdrawal reflected a sense of vulnerability among minority groups, analysts said. A Nigerian official said that the People's Party, like other parties, feared that the President's men were using the coalition to make inroads into its power base and thus strengthen Mr. Shagari's position before the next election in 1983. **********The party also felt, a Western diplomat said, that The Accord was not yielding enough of the ''patronage and largesse'' on which much of Nigerian politics operates. A senior official in President Shagari's party, rubbing his thumb and forefinger together in a universal financial gesture, said, ''They said they wanted more lolly. We said: 'No more lollipop.' '' **********The withdrawal of the People's Party nonetheless meant that formal opposition to President Shagari had solidified, with four parties now ranged against him. Nigerian and foreign analysts expect, however, that he will be able to muster enough votes from the divided opposition to prevent a parliamentary stalemate. As the senior official put it: ''You patronize them rather than align them with others, and they play ball.'' **********Dr. Chuba Okadigbu, President Shagari's senior political adviser, said the apparent disarray was part of a process in which Nigeria was coming to terms with the new presidential system. **********''The presidential system normally operates within a two-party system, with other groups as spoilers,'' he said, adding that such an alignment now seems to be taking shape in Nigeria. **********Opponents of the President, however, see events as part of a sustained campaign by his party to use the power, influence and wealth of office to foment division in - and win supporters from - other parties, thereby enhancing its prospects in the 1983 election and diverting attention from the uncertainties within its own ranks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/02/business/united-mcgill-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-may-2.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNITED MCGILL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to May 2", "print_headline": "UNITED MCGILL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to May 2", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/business/clausen-s-world-bank-warning.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1981-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1726, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CLAUSEN'S WORLD BANK WARNING", "print_headline": "CLAUSEN'S WORLD BANK WARNING", "body_text": " **********Alden Winship Clausen, who will take over Wednesday as president of the World Bank, stresses that it is in the ''vested interest'' of the United States to support the institution, which lends to the third world, and warns that the reluctance of Congressional conservatives to provide adequate financing threatens its survival. **********''If we can help the third world countries expand their economies, ours will also expand, and there will be more jobs in the United States,'' said Mr. Clausen, who is leaving his job as the chairman of the Bank of America to succeed Robert S. McNamara as the World Bank's sixth chief executive. **********He stressed that one-third of American exports were bought by developing countries. ''That's the vested interest I'm talking about,'' he said in a recent 90-minute interview at the Bank of America office in Washington. 'Makes So Much Common Sense' **********He added that the World Bank ''makes so much common sense that it seems that other reasonable people with like common sense will see what we're trying to do.'' **********He said he was concerned not about Reagan Administration support for the World Bank, but about the reluctance of conservatives in the House of Representatives to back Administration financing proposals. **********Without United States support, he added, the institution, which is more formally known as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and is owned by 139 nations, was in danger of unraveling.  Talks With Officials Cited **********He said that, contrary to popular belief, the Reagan Administration was ''very supportive'' of the bank, a conclusion he has drawn from talks with high Administration officials including the President, with whom, Mr. Clausen observed, ''my relations, I believe, are good.'' **********The 58-year-old banker, who as chief executive of the 36-year-old multilateral lending body will receive about one-third of his present $600,000-a-year salary, described the new job as a ''step up on challenge'' and himself as acutely sensitive to the ''voracious'' needs of the third world for development assistance. **********He left little doubt, however, that he would proceed on a course somewhat different from that laid out by his predecessor - for example, by trying to marshal more of the resources of the private sector into the business of development. ''I'm a private sector person,'' he said. ''I'm biased to maximizing. I'm biased to help starting at home. I'm biased to bailing in. I don't want to bail out anything.'' **********He conceded that the job of running the bank, just as he was about to put his ''foot in the stirrup,'' looked a lot bigger than it did last October when he was appointed under a pre-election agreement between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. ''The horse is bucking a bit harder than I had anticipated, but my job is to get on it and try to ride it.'' Lent $12 Billion Last Year **********It was a reference to the troubles the bank faces as it seeks support of the United States, its largest stockholder, for a mission that is to make loans, some at practically no interest, to nearly 100 developing countries. The bank lent some $12 billion last year on transportation, power, agricultural and other development projects in the poorer countries. **********In taking over from Mr. McNamara, in whose 13-year reign the bank's lending expanded twelvefold, Mr. Clausen said that he saw ''both consolidation and further growth'' but added that continued growth of the dimensions of the last 12 years would be ''unsustainable.'' **********''If it is true that there is growing reluctance of supporter nations to support multilateral aid, then that aid may have to slow down,'' he added. ''But the need is not diminishing in any way; the appetite is voracious.'' **********One way to address that need, he said, might be to attract more private sector capital to World Bank-supported projects. He noted that, for every $1 the bank put into a project, it now attracted $3 to $4 from outside. ''Can we make that $5 and $6?'' he asked, adding, ''I think that clearly I want to explore that.'' Salesmanship Stressed **********Mr. Clausen made it clear that he considered his main job to be salesmanship. ''I think that the people of the United States don't know anything about the World Bank,'' he said. ''Even the large commercial bankers of the United States don't know much about the World Bank, and they should. We have to get people to understand what the World Bank can do, and what it means to them in their own communities. Then this will translate itself to Congress. And Congress needs to know.'' **********The Bank of America's chief executive said that ''the President was for a number of years my Governor in California, and a good one; I know the media has said that the Reagan Administration is anti-World Bank.'' Mr. Clausen declared, ''I don't believe that.'' **********But the Administration has so far had trouble getting its recommended financing for the bank's soft-loan affiliate, known as the International Development Association, accepted by the House. The association makes loans to the world's poorest countries that are repayable over 50 years at no interest and only a small service fee.  The Administration is seeking a $3.24 billion appropriation to cover an American commitment, made during the Carter Administration, for a $12 billion I.D.A. lending program over this year, 1982 and 1983. **********The Senate has approved the recommendation, but the House has stretched appropriations out over the next five years. 'The Very Minimum' **********''The Administration recommendation is the very minimum that Congress can do,'' Mr. Clausen said, adding that ''if it goes below that, we are in danger of going back to square one. I know from my travels around the world over the last 90 days that, if the United States does not support the World Bank, then other countries will not support it.'' **********In addition to I.D.A. soft loans, the World Bank makes about $8 billion a year of more conventional loans at close to market rates to support a variety of development projects. **********''In a way I'm a United Way freak,'' Mr. Clausen said. ''I believe that those that have ought to help those that don't have because those that have will be stronger and better off in the longer run.'' **********''I don't believe in transferring wealth,'' he continued, ''but I believe in helping those that want to help themselves.'' Citing recent economic successes of Argentina, Chile, Peru, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong, he said that ''getting the econonic momentum going for the private sector is a good way to achieve economic development.'' Matches Reagan Priorities **********The stress on the private sector coincides with what are understood to be the priorities in the still evolving Reagan Administration policy toward the third world. **********Some conservatives have charged that the World Bank has supported socialist causes. ''The World Bank is not perfect,'' Mr. Clausen said. ''I know those charges. My job will be to try to do a better job. The World Bank has done a tremendous amount of good, far more good than bad, and hopefully we'll continue the good and avoid the inefficiencies and errors.'' **********He continued: ''You can write that Clausen is going to make mistakes. But I'm not a socialist. I'm for the private sector. I want to develop people. I want to develop economies of nations. I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.'' **********Although he has yet to develop a policy for the bank, Mr. Clausen said the next two or three years would be ''absolutely critical'' because of projected slower world economic growth and high inflation. **********Noting the huge drain on the resources of developing countries because of energy imports, he said that energy credits must continue to be a ''very strong'' focus of the bank, and added that he believed that Mr. McNamara's idea for an energy subsidiary of the bank had a good deal of merit. The Reagan Administration has been cool to the idea on the ground that the World Bank would enter into competition with private industry. In a Complementary Way **********Mr. Clausen said that, instead of working competitively against private industry, such an affiliate would be using the private sector in a complementary way to ''help explore where there are opportunities.'' **********But he added that, if the Administration was adamantly opposed to the idea of a separate affiliate, he would continue, nevertheless, to press for an energy thrust in other ways. ''I may lose a battle here and there, but I'm not going to lose the war,'' he stressed. **********He said that agriculture would be another priority area to help developing countries become more self-sufficient in food production. Open Mind on Decentralization **********Asked about reports that he would decentralize the World Bank as he has the Bank of America, he said he still had an open mind on that question. ''I'm not in love with decentralization just for the sake of decentralizing,'' he added. **********He said he believed in the ''squeeze box or accordian theory'' in which, if an institution has been compressed over a long period, ''you decentralize to make beautiful music.'' **********He noted that, from the outside, the World Bank appeared to be a very centralized oganization. Decentralization, which has been pressed by many in the third world, would mean that some operations would shift from Washington to points of major lending activity. ''I don't know yet what I will do,'' Mr. Clausen said. ''I don't want to prejudge.'' **********He said that, in his 11 years as the Bank of America's chief executive, he had tried to make that bank ''more socially responsible.'' In terms of assets, the Bank of America is the biggest bank in the United States. Its parent holding company, however, the BankAmerica Corporation, slipped into the No.2 place at the end of 1980, having been edged out by Citicorp, the parent of Citibank.  Citicorp's total assets, including those of its banking and nonbanking activities, are greater than those of the BankAmerica Corporation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/10/business/change-is-a-du-pont-tradition.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1981-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1638, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHANGE IS A DU PONT TRADITION", "print_headline": "CHANGE IS A DU PONT TRADITION", "body_text": " **********First, there was Du Pont. And then Du Pont begat gunpowder, and the gunpowder business begat chemicals.  Chemicals begat nylon, and the nylon business begat fibers. Fibers begat diversification, and the diversification begat Conoco. Conoco? **********''I have heard people use the term mishmash,'' said Edward G.  Jefferson, chairman of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, commenting on his corporation's takeover of Conoco Inc. ''Well, you know, that is all good sport for the morning paper, but it really doesn't describe this at all.'' **********Whether mishmash or synergism, the marriage of the venerable lord of Delaware to a giant wildcatting oil company out of Ponca City, Okla., has left more than a few people wondering about the future of Du Pont. **********The Questions to Be Faced **********What becomes of this 179-year-old institution that got its start selling black powder to the Government during the War of 1812, and for decades grew by the motto, ''Better things for better living through chemistry''? **********Can it be that the people who brought you nylon, Teflon and Lucite are now running the corner gas station?  To all of his doubters on Wall Street and elsewhere, Mr. Jefferson has a simple answer: If you can't see where we're going, it's because you don't know where we've been. **********''Du Pont has changed all through its history,'' said Mr. Jefferson in his baritone British accent. ''It started out as an explosives business, it matured into a chemicals business and got into plastics, paints and fibers. If you look back a little more than a decade, it set its sights on diversification, into electronics and pharmaceuticals. Now we are adding energy. Just 'Another Diversification' **********''What we can do,'' the 60-year-old executive continued during an interview, ''is to bring some of the talents of our engineering department and our research laboratories to the problems and opportunities that exist in the energy field. So although this is a large diversification, it is but another diversification in a company that has been doing this for a long time.'' **********Glancing over his shoulder at a portrait of three of his predecessors, Pierre, Irenee and Lammot duPont, who stare down on his polished table-desk, Mr. Jefferson says confidently: ''The current management have got to run what they've got well, and they've got to do something for the future management. That is our tradition. **********''I suspect,'' he adds, ''that my successors in the 1990's will be very glad that we acquired Conoco.'' The excitement with which Mr. Jefferson discusses the Conoco merger has infected the entire Du Pont company, and the city of Wilmington as well. With the baseball players on strike, following the contest between Du Pont, Joseph E. Seagram & Sons and the Mobil Corporation for control of Conoco became the most talked about sport in this company town. And when it was clear that the home team had won, people amused themselves thinking up new names. How about Du Ponococo? Or Cu Donopo? Or maybe Du Ponocont? Wide Personal Involvement **********''This is the first time I remember something as complex and distant as a corporate merger - which is not your man-in-the-street kind of issue -being the topic of conversation everywhere in the city,'' said Pierre S. du Pont 4th, Delaware's governor and the great-great-great-great-grandson of the founder of Du Pont. ''The community feeling was, we're really going somewhere. People here have so much confidence in the Du Pont management, that if this is what it decides to do, then it must be right. **********''I think it fits in with the same kind of business judgments that my great-great-great-great-grandfather was making in 1802,'' added Governor du Pont during an interview in his mahogany-paneled office. **********''He took a big risk in starting up a brand new gunpowder business. Now they are going into another area they have not been into before.  If they are right, they will be rewarded; if they are wrong, they will pay the price. But it's a risk in the spirit in which it all began.'' Explaining the Logic **********Edward Jefferson would not quibble with that assessment.  When you examine the way the chemical business is evolving, he argues, Du Pont's paying $7.57 billion for Conoco's cornucopia of coal, oil and natural gas reserves seems perfectly in character with its basic business of applying engineering and research to upgrade raw materials into specialty products. **********''If you don't get a very high percentage of oil out of the ground with the present methods of recovery, then there are opportunities for new approaches,'' said Mr. Jefferson, ''particularly at today's prices of hydrocarbons.'' **********Du Pont will soon apply its engineering talent to the problem of recovering the billions of barrels of crude underground that cannot be pumped using current conventional techniques. **********With Conoco's enormous oil reserves of 1.5 billion barrels, Du Pont can be assured of a secure supply of this crucial raw material, even as supplies tighten and the nature of competition in the world petrochemical business changes. Gaining a Competitive Edge **********''The thing that is going to happen in the next decade,'' said Mr.  Jefferson, ''and already is happening, is that more and more chemicals and plastics will be made by the resource-producing countries. You'll find polyethylene, for example, is already made by Middle Eastern oil producers. Conoco gives us a position to compete against the producing countries.'' **********What Conoco's oil does for Du Pont today, its 15 billion tons of coal reserves will do for Du Pont in the future, Mr. Jefferson believes. **********''We have no plans to sell the coal,'' said Mr. Jefferson, scotching speculation that it would be swapped to Seagram for the big block of Conoco stock that Seagram was left with after the takeover battle ended. **********''You know, back in the time when nylon was being presented to the world, it was described as coming from coal, air and water. It wasn't until the mid-1950's that cheap natural gas appeared to replace coal. There is a great deal of coal-based chemistry, and its time will come again. We have a competence to reign in that field.'' **********Conoco describes its total energy reserves in the United States, of oil, coal and natural gas, as the largest of any American company. Du Pont depends on such raw materials to make 70 percent of its products. 'A Confusing Company' **********But while it all seems to fit together on paper, many analysts wonder how the merger will work in real life. **********''It's become a much more confusing company,'' remarked Emily Plishner, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company. ''To them it looks like they have added a new division, but to Wall street it looks like they have become something different.'' **********Analysts question how Du Pont will be able to continue its new commitment to the life sciences, or maintain its traditionally generous dividend payout, when so much capital and talent will have to be devoted to running an oil company. **********Mr. Jefferson said the basic plan was for Conoco to operate as a separate, wholly owned subsidiary. Its chairman, Ralph E. Bailey, will join the Du Pont board, along with three other Conoco executives. Beyond that, Du Pont is still studying the question of integration, and has consulted with the Exxon Corporation and other major companies about how they have digested large acquisitions. **********''I think they'll fit rather well,'' said Mr. Jefferson, ''into a framework which is used to the idea of delegated operating resposibility and a corporate management that mainly concerns itself with the adequacy of planning, people development and overall financial management.'' Self-Financing by Conoco **********As for the potential diversion of capital to the cash-hungry energy field, he said that Conoco was capable of satisfying its own needs.  True, he acknowleged, top management would be stretched. But Du Pont has a long tradition of going in a lot of different directions at once. People forget that it was between 1917 and 1960, when Du Pont held a major stake in the General Motors Corporation, that it made its greatest innovations, the chairman noted. **********One irony of the battle for Conoco is that Du Pont will not only be digesting a new company but a new stockholder as well - the Bronfmans of Canada. They control Seagram, which has acquired at least 25 million Conoco shares. **********On Aug.17 Du Pont, according to its own tender offer, will exchange each of those shares for 1.7 Du Pont shares. That will give Seagram at least 18 percent of Du Pont. The large duPont family, which has eight representatives on a board of 25, will own about 22 percent.  But their holdings are fragmented among 2,500 persons, who, incidentally, spell the family name in various ways. **********How does the family view the Seagram prospect?  ''I almost stopped drinking V.O. for a couple of weeks,'' Governor du Pont said with a smile, in reference to a popular Seagram whisky.  ''It does of course reduce the proportion of the company shares held by the family. But I think the family crossed that bridge a long time ago. It really ceased to be a family company 15 or 20 years ago. **********''This is all part of the trend of the company becoming a large corporation, with professional managers and a wide range of investors,'' the Governor said. **********''I have other large institutional shareholders,'' said Mr.  Jefferson diplomatically. ''We try to serve them all.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/24/business/iu-international-earnings-up-13.7.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IU International Earnings Up 13.7%", "print_headline": "IU International Earnings Up 13.7%", "body_text": " **********The IU International Corporation, parent of two of the nation's leading motor carriers, reported yesterday that earnings in the fourth quarter of last year increased 13.7 percent on a sales gain of 6.5 percent. **********The Wilmington, Del., concern said that net income in the latest three months rose to $15.8 million, or 71 cents a share, from $13.9 million, or 38 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1979. **********Revenues climbed to $590.1 million from $554.2 million. **********IU, with operations that include Ryder Truck Lines and Pacific Intermountain Express, said that, for the full year, earnings more than doubled to $144.7 million, or $5.25 a share, from $67 million, or $1.88 a share, in 1979.

Concern over the shooting of the Egyptian President drove up the price of gold, the dollar and domestic oil stocks. **********''Clearly this tragic event does create additional uncertainty in an area fraught with uncertainty,'' said Edward G. Jefferson, chairman of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. ''While Sadat played a constructive role toward peace, events of this kind can be unsettling and destabilizing, although I'm ho ping that this won't.'' **********Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the American Stock Exchange, called the assassination ''clearly a destabilizing force.'' But he added that a lot depends on what happens in the next 30 days, especially regarding the succession to Mr. Sadat. Several executives commented that the presence of a large professional class in Egypt should help assure the nation of security. Sense of Loss Expressed **********Above all, businessmen felt the void left by Mr. Sadat's death.  ''He was one of the great leaders who has emerged in the 20th century,'' said David Rockefeller, retired chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank. ''His visit to Jerusalem will go down as one of the dramatic moments in history. One cannot exaggerate the importance of our loss. It raises the question of what will happen to the whole Camp David process.'' **********In the stock market, reports of the assassination sent up prices of oil companies with holdings outside the Middle East but did not drastically affect other issues. Edward Yardeni, chief economist at E.F. Hutton & Company, said the market took the news ''quite calmly.'' The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 856.26, down 3.61. At 2 P.M., when Mr. Sadat's death was confirmed, the average was up 4.29 points. **********The dollar opened weak in Europe's currency centers, partly in response to lower United States interest rates. Then came word of the shooting. The dollar responded to conflicting reports on Mr. Sadat's condition by rising. After drifting throughout the day, the dollar stabilized at a level higher than Monday's close, in part because of purchases by investors seeking a stable currency. Gold's Trading Pattern **********Gold, which has traditionally been seen as an international haven at times of crises, rose $16.40, to $451.70 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Earlier it had risen in London and Zurich before retreating amid profit-taking. Prices of other metals, including silver, also rose. **********But the uncertainty over what the death of Mr. Sadat would mean to the already shaky political situation in the Middle East was foremost in the minds of businessmen. **********A. Nicholas Filippello, chief economist of the Monsanto Company, said that in the Middle East ''political instability can lead to economic instability.'' He added that business would have to wait and see whether Mr. Sadat's successor follows his path of peace with Israel. **********''The direction of Egypt without him will be uncertain, and uncertainty is a negative factor given the delicate balance in the Middle East,'' Mr. Filippello said. ''The potential for economic disruption is there.'' **********Frank P. Popoff, president of Dow Chemical Europe, a subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company, said Egypt's well-educated professional people, who work in other Middle Eastern nations as well as their own, would help maintain stability in the region in the days ahead. Economic Momentum Seen **********''I don't think everything in Egypt will be paralyzed as it would be in other countries where the loss of a leader would create dissension.'' Mr. Popoff said. ''I don't think Sadat's death will derail the economy. There is a tremendous amount of positive Egyptian influence in the Middle East that will help bridge this period until Egypt can readdress itself to the issue of leadership.'' **********The stability implied by the presence of an educated cadre of Egyptian businessmen was also cited by Alfred Brittain 3d, chairman of the Bankers Trust Company. ''We are encouraged,'' he said, ''that the country's economic affairs are in the hands of people whom we know to be hi ghly professional, thoroughly experienced and unusually competent.'' **********Many businessmen expressed sadness and shock at the sudden death of a political leader who had tried to bring peace to his troubled region. Sanford I, Weill, chairman and chief executive officer of Shearson/American Express, said he hoped that what Mr. Sadat ''was trying to do would be magnified by his untimely death.'' **********James E. Burke, chairman and chief executive officer of Johnson & Johnson, said Mr. Sadat was ''one of those rare individuals whose humanity had a positive impact on the world.'' **********And Edson W. Spencer, chairman of Honeywell Inc., described Mr.  Sadat's death as ''a great loss for the cause of peace in the Middle East.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/06/world/brandt-cautions-third-world.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1981-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 393, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRANDT CAUTIONS THIRD WORLD", "print_headline": "BRANDT CAUTIONS THIRD WORLD", "body_text": " **********Former Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany urged developing countries yesterday not to reject out of hand the insistence of the Reagan Administration that future international aid to them be linked with their own economic reforms and austerity. **********At a news conference in New York, the former West German leader also expressed hope that when 22 leaders from developed and developing countries, including President Reagan, meet in Cancun, Mexico, this month, they would ''come closer'' to recommendations on encouraging increased agricultural production and stimulating the exploitation of energy resources in developing countries. **********The Cancun gathering, formally called the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development, grew out of a report last year by a commission on international development issues headed by Mr. Brandt.

Chairman Cites Approvals **********In his defense, Mr. Taylor introduced statistics that he said showed that, since he took over this summer, from 91 percent to 95 percent of the trucking applications in various categories have been granted. **********However, Dr. Alexis said that his information indicated that many of the ''approvals'' provided operating authority that was in many instances less than was sought. **********As evidence of pent-up demand for operating licenses in recent months, Mr. Moore, an economist with the Hoover Institution at Stanford, said that truck operating licenses were once again obtaining a market value. Late last year, as the previous Administration threw open the entry gates, the once valuable licenses fell to zero, he said. **********''In other words, the I.C.C. has again created monopoly profits in the industry,'' he stated.  Representative Henry S. Reuss, Democrat of Wisconsin, chairman of the committee, chided Mr. Taylor, saying that his policy seemed to be at odds with the deregulatory attitude of the Reagan Administration. **********In reply, the commission chairman said that, contrary to various reports, he had received no guidance or criticism of his policies from the White House, even though he had tried to get advice from Martin Anderson, the White House economic adviser. **********With regard to the commission's restrictions on entry, Mr. Taylor said that an adverse ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans, upholding a complaint by the American Trucking Associations, seemed to underline the requirement to scrutinize new applicants closely. He said that the commission had not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/04/world/talks-resume-on-law-of-sea.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 351, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TALKS RESUME ON LAW OF SEA", "print_headline": "TALKS RESUME ON LAW OF SEA", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union accused the United States today of seeking to ''torpedo'' the United Nations conference that has been working since 1973 on a treaty setting global rules on use of the oceans and their resources. **********Semyon P.

The action would come after a 3-for-2 Hecla stock split planned for Tuesday. **********''The proposed combination of the two companies' operations, employees and land holdings would create a larger, stronger and more efficient entity, which would be the premier silver mining company in the United States,'' said W.A. Griffith, the president of Hecla, after the merger proposal was made Saturday. Sunshine's Bid for Hecla **********Hecla's move comes about a month after the Sunshine Mining Company announced that it had purchased 370,206 common shares, or about 5.3 percent, of Hecla's outstanding stock. Sunshine, one of the largest silver producers in the country, had also said that it might seek to gain control of the silver, zinc and lead producer. **********In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sunshine reported that in 1979 it had proposed to Hecla that the two merge, but that Hecla did not respond. No further discussions were held, Sunshine said. **********Responding to the Hecla bid, Bob Mullen, a spokesman for Day Mines, said: ''We have just received the proposal. Of course, we take all proposals of this nature very seriously. We are analysing it and when we finish that, we will issue our own news release.'' Premium Offered on Day Shares **********The Hecla proposal offers Day shareholders a 46 percent premium for their shares, based on Thursday's closing price, and an 85 percent premium based on the closing price on Feb. 26, the day before Hecla filed notice that it had purchased 5.7 percent of Day's outstanding common stock.

Hecla's Past Problems **********However, things were not always so bright for Hecla. Three years ago, battered by a long copper slump, low silver prices and a hefty bank debt, the company faced bankruptcy. A further complication was caused by a copper project that did not prove successful; Hecla took a $101 million write-off on this in 1978. But a subseqent rise in silver prices helped strengthen the companyand its stock, which has since risen from $5 to reach $35.875 last Friday, a gain of $1.375 on the day. **********Day, with 4,357,268 shares outstanding, had 1980 earnings of $10.3 million on revenues of $36.4 million.

Through the bank, Valley National of Salinas, the finance company could establish a deposit-taking banking operation throughout the state. **********The only restriction would be that the bank could not grant business loans. By not making commercial loans, the bank no longer would be considered to be a ''bank'' by the Federal Reserve, and, therefore, Household would be allowed to acquire it. But, through its other subsidiaries, Household could continue to extend loans to businesses. **********Eighteen percent of Household's consumer loans are made in California, where the company has 250 branches, more than twice the number it has in any other state. A Household spokesman said last Friday that some of these branches might be turned into branches of the bank. Wider Application Feared **********Following the announcement, some bankers expressed fears that many other companies might also use the loophole to establish banking operations not only in California, or in a single state, but throughout the country. Earlier this year, by using the same loophole, a subsidiary of the Gulf and Western Corporation acquired the Fidelity National Bank of Concord, Calif. **********Banks, however, are prohibited from accepting deposits outside their own states and from engaging in businesses that the Federal Reserve considers not ''closely related'' to banking. **********The Bank Holding Company Act prohibits corporations that are not banks from acquiring banks. But, according to a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board, the law defines a bank as an institution that accepts demand deposits and that makes commercial loans. Sidestepping Definition **********To avoid coming under the Bank Holding Company Act, Household Finance plans to have Valley National divest itself of its commercial loan portfolio. As a result, it would no longer be a bank, as defined by the Bank Holding Company Act. **********Household is offering to pay $20.3 million for all 310,000 outstanding shares of Valley National, which has $100 million in assets. The offer is equivalent to $65.15 a share, more than three times the bank's year-end book value of $20.65 a share. **********''This is our entry into the banking market in California,'' said the Household spokesman. To Household, he said, the $20 million is almost an insignificant figure compared with the opportunity the acquisition would provide. ''The key thing is having the entry vehicle,'' he said. Deposits Possible **********Household already has about $600 million of consumer loans in California. A bank would make it possible for the finance company to accept consumer deposits in the state, an activity in which only banks and thrift institutions may engage. **********''We've been the dominant independent bank in this area,'' said Edward L. Evans, president of Valley National. The bank's management welcomed the bid by Household, he said, because the finance company planned to retain the bank's management and because the 18-year-old bank would retain its identity. **********D. Vernon Horton, 40 years old, is executive vice president and chief executive officer of the bank, and Dennis Foss, 34, is senior vice president and chief administrative officer. **********At present, Valley National, which is in an agricultural area, has about $20 million in commercial loans. It also has about $22 million in consumer loans, $16.5 million in mortgages, $2.5 million in loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, and about $2 million in credit-card loans, Mr. Evans said. **********In 1980, the bank earned $927,000 on an equity base of $6.34 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/02/world/texts-of-justice-department-statement-on-allen-and-summary-of-findings.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3200, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TEXTS OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT STATEMENT ON ALLEN AND SUMMARY OF FINDINGS", "print_headline": "TEXTS OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT STATEMENT ON ALLEN AND SUMMARY OF FINDINGS", "body_text": " **********Following are the texts of the statement issued by the Justice Department today on the investigation of Richard V. Allen, President Reagan's national security adviser, and the summary of the findings of the department's Criminal Division on the matter: The Statement **********The Attorney General has decided to close the Department of Justice inquiry centering on the discovery of an envelope containing ten $100 bills in a safe in an office previously occupied by Richard V. Allen, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. **********The Federal Bureau of Investigation has interviewed all those who observed this envelope and its contents before its discovery as well as others possessing relevant information. Thirty-six people were interviewed in the United States and Japan. The Department's Criminal Division has carefully reviewed the F.B.I. report on this matter and concluded that it does not present any evidence that Mr. Allen violated Federal criminal law. **********The Attorney General has further concluded that the special prosecutor provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 are not triggered because as to this matter the Department has not ''received'' or discovered any ''specific information'' that Mr.  Allen violated Federal criminal law. The Criminal Division recommended that this matter be closed without appointment of a special prosecutor or report to the Special Prosecutor Court. The Deputy Attorney General and the Associate Attorney General concurred in this recommendation. **********Because of the public interest in this matter and in order to answer some of the inquiries that the department has been unable to comment upon while this matter was still under review, the Attorney General authorized release of a report summarizing the Criminal Division's findings and conclusions. **********During the course of this inquiry two additional matters regarding Mr. Allen came to the department's attention: that Mr. Allen received watches from certain Japanese persons and that Mr. Allen's financial disclosure form incorrectly stated the date he sold his interest in Potomac International Corporation. Both of these matters came to the department's attention within the past 10 days. The applicability of the special prosecutor provisions to those matters has not yet been determined. At this time it would be premature and inappropriate to comment further. The Findings **********On Sept. 21, 1981, Edwin Meese 3d, counselor to the President, after having been told of this matter by White House employees, turned over copies of documents to the Attorney General that were found in a safe in an office used by Allen in the Old Executive Office Building. The documents consisted of a large outer envelope bearing Oriental characters; a smaller inner envelope with $10,000 written on it containing ten $100 bills; a piece of paper resembling a receipt with Oriental writing, including the figure $10,000; a business card of a Japanese Chamber of Commerce official and a faxgram dated Jan. 14, 1981, from the offical to Allen. No explanation or criminal allegation was furnished with the documents. Summary of Investigation **********Through interviews of 36 individuals in the United States and Japan1 and analysis of documentary evidence and forensic examinations, the investigation has yielded a complete, coherent and materially uncontradicted account of how the cash came to be found in the safe. On Jan. 21, 1981, an envelope containing ten $100 bills was intercepted by Allen when Japanese journalists attempted to hand it to Mrs. Reagan as an honorarium for a brief interview Mrs. Reagan had given to the journalists. Allen gave the envelope to his secretary with instructions to turn it over to the appropriate officials. The secretary placed the envelope in a safe and, through oversight, the cash was never officially reported or turned over to the appropriate officials. The envelope was discovered on Sept. 15, 1981, in a safe in an office used by Allen in the Old Executive Office Building by individuals moving into the office. Arranging the Interview **********Sometime in December 1980, Kamisaka Fuyoko, a writer for a Japanese women's magazine called Shufu-no-Tomo (translated: Friends of the Housewife or The Housewife's Friend, hereinafter referred to as the Magazine) discussed with Mrs. Takase Chizuko in Japan the possibility of interviewing Nancy Reagan for the Magazine. Mrs.  Takase knew Allen through her husband's business and personal relationship with him and she undertook to arrange such an interview. Mrs. Takase telephoned Allen and sought his help in arranging the interview. Allen, in a memorandum dated Dec. 8, 1980, wrote to Charles Tyson, then a scheduling official for the transition team, passing on Mrs. Takase's request and stating that he supported the request if time for a short interview could be arranged. Allen recalls referring the request for an interview to Peter Hannaford, who at that time was in the process of taking over Allen's private consulting business, Potomac International Corporation. Mrs. Takase states that she called Allen on Jan. 15, 1981, prior to departing Japan and that Allen told her there was almost no possibility of obtaining an interview because of the Reagans' busy schedule. **********Mrs. Takase, Mrs. Kamisaka and Kimoto Yoshiko, an editor of the Magazine, departed Tokyo for Washington, D.C., on Jan. 15, 1981, in hopes of obtaining an interview with Mrs. Reagan. Prior to departing, they discussed the subject of an honorarium for Mrs.  Reagan and decided on $1,000, which was withdrawn from the Magazine's accounting section in Japan. Mrs. Kimoto placed the $1,000 in a ''ceremonial pouch'' (the envelope) in Washington, D.C., prior to the interview. None of the women knew who wrote $10,000 on the envelope or the receipt form, but each stated that only $1,000 was put in the envelope.2 Accounting records obtained from the Magazine indicate that $1,000 was vouchered and dispensed for the honorarium.  The records also indicate that a total of $10,000 in cash was disbursed by the accounting office to the women to cover their expenses for the trip. **********Upon arriving in Washington on Jan. 16, 1981, the three women went to Hannaford's office where they told Hannaford that they were still seeking a response to their interview request. Shortly thereafter, Hannaford called Mrs. Reagan's chief of staff to request an interview of Mrs. Reagan for the three women. Hannaford did not contact Allen regarding the request. Neither Hannaford nor Potomac International Corporation received any compensation from the Magazine for the assistance provided. Mrs. Reagan's chief of staff had only a faint recollection regarding the request but believes that he passed on Hannaford's request to Mrs. Reagan. Both Mr. and Mrs. Takase contacted Allen regarding the interview during the three-day period before the Inauguration. There is no indication that Allen provided any assistance during that time period. **********On Jan. 20, Mrs. Takase received a phone call from the transition office informing her that an interview might be possible and she should stand ready. The following day, on Jan. 21, the women received a message from the transition office to come to the White House at 5:45 P.M. The Interview **********White House records and interviews indicate that Mrs. Reagan met with the three Japanese women for between 5 and 10 minutes at around 6 P.M. in the living quarters of the White House. In addition to Mrs. Reagan and Allen, at least five others were present. In the course of the session, Mrs. Kamisaka presented Mrs. Reagan with a lacquer box that she had purchased in Japan. The box was immediately turned over by Mrs. Reagan to the Government through appropriate White House channels. **********Allen states that one of the women also attempted to present Mrs.  Reagan with an envelope and some news clippings. Allen stepped in and took possession of the envelope and the clippings before they could be passed to Mrs. Reagan. One of the women asked Allen to sign a receipt but he refused ''since he had not accepted it for himself.'' Allen stated that he did not return the envelope to the women because he thought it would offend them. Allen did not recall from which of the women he took the envelope; Mrs. Kamisaka believes it was Mrs.  Takase, Mrs. Kimoto recalls that she gave the envelope to Mrs. Takase at the end of the interview but did not see what Mrs. Takase did with it, and Mrs. Takase cannot recall who had the envelope. get first add ALLEN TEXT Storage of the Envelope **********Allen states that after the interview he returned to his office where he opened the envelope while sitting at his desk. He recalled that it contained ten $100 bills. In his first interview, Allen said he recalled seeing the receipt, but in a later interview he said that he had not seen the receipt or a notation showing $10,000. In any event, he immediately turned the envelope over to his secretary, advising her that the money should be turned over to the appropriate officials. His secretary placed the envelope in a four-drawer safe in her office located next to Allen's former office in the Old Executive Office Building. Allen did not thereafter see the envelope. Peter Hannaford, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, and Allen's wife have all told the F.B.I. that they recall Allen telling them sometime shortly after Jan. 21 about the incident, including the fact that he had intercepted an envelope contaning cash that one of the women had attempted to hand to Mrs. Reagan. **********Allen told the F.B.I. that he should have made sure the envelope was turned over in the proper manner; however, due to the confusion of moving into the White House, his secretary did not get around to cataloguing the money and properly disposing of it. Allen's secretary corroborated these facts and has told the F.B.I. that she wanted to accept full responsibility for the money since it was her responsibility to dispose of it properly. **********In February, Allen's secretary moved to new office space in the West Wing of the White House. At about the same time, another National Security Council secretary also moved out of the Old Executive Office Building office previously occupied by Allen's secretary. In the process of moving, she checked the safe in the office to make sure it was empty. In one of the drawers she discovered a gift package and an envelope with Oriental writing. She opened the envelope and observed ten $100 bills. She immediately summoned yet another National Security Council secretary to the office and showed her the envelope. The second secretary remembers seeing ten or eleven $100 bills. **********The second secretary then notified Allen's secretary that they had found an envelope with $1,000 in the safe. She was instructed by Allen's secretary to notify an assistant to Allen, who was occupying Allen's former office. She gave the envelope and package to the assistant who says he received the envelope from her, opened it and counted ten $100 bills. On his own initiative the assistant put the envelope and packages in the two-drawer safe in Allen's former office ''for safekeeping.'' He left the National Security Council in March 1981 with the envelope still in the safe and without notifying Allen of what he had done with the envelope. The envelope was next discovered in the two-drawer safe on Sept. 15. Discovery of the Envelope **********On Sept. 15, 1981, three military officers on special detail to the White House were moving into Allen's former office in the Old Executive Office Building when they opened a two-drawer safe they had presumed was empty. In the safe were several gift-wrapped packages, the receipt form and the envelope containing $1,000. The $1,000 was observed by two of the officers and a secretary. The secretary turned the envelope and packages over to Barbara Diering, the head of the Administrative Office of the National Security Council. While in Diering's office, the items were inspected by Jerry Jennings, the chief of security for the National Security Council staff. A business card of a Japanese Chamber of Commerce official was taped to one of the packages. In an effort to locate any related documents which might bear on the envelope, Jennings found in another office a faxgram from the Japanese Chamber of Commerce official to Allen requesting assistance in obtaining an audience with Ronald Reagan.  Jennings mistakenly believed that this faxgram was related to the envelope because of the proximity of the envelope containing the ten $100 bills to the gift box which had the business card attached.3 On Sept. 21, Jennings turned over to Meese the envelope, the faxgram and the business card. Later the same day, Meese turned over copies of the documents to the Attorney General. Analysis Facts **********The facts uncovered in the investigation of this matter involving the envelope containing $1,000 are consistent on all material points. These points are: **********1. The $1,000 received by Allen was intended as an honorarium for Mrs. Reagan. Each of the three Japanese women and the Magazine records are consistent on that point. There is no evidence that the cash was intended for Allen. **********2. Allen did not intend to keep the money for his personal use.  Both Allen and his secretary agree on Allen's expressed intent to turn the money over through proper channels. The fact that Allen wholly parted with dominion and control over the money, left the envelope in a safe accessible to others, and told several people, including the present Secretary of the Navy, about the cash, is inconsistent with an intent to keep the money for personal use. There is no evidence to indicate Allen intended to keep the money for himself. **********3. There was only $1,000 in the envelope turned over to Allen.  Although the receipt and envelope contain the figure $10,000, all the evidence indicates that only $1,000 was given to Allen. The three women and the Magazine's records indicate $1,000 was given and everyone who saw the envelope and money, a total of eight people, observed only $1,000 with one exception and that person recalled observing ten or eleven $100 bills. Relevant Criminal Statutes **********The bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. 201(c), requires that Allen receive something of value in return for being influenced in the performance of an official act. In this matter, the money was not given to Allen for anything he had done; rather, it was intended as an honorarium for Mrs. Reagan and simply intercepted by Allen. It was neither given nor received to benefit Allen or to influence him in any way. Indeed, he was not even aware of the contents of the envelope until after the meeting was completed. **********For the same reason, the gratuity statute, 18 U.S.C. 201(g), is inapplicable. That statute proscribes the receipt of something of value by a public official ''for himself for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by him.'' In this instance, Allen was not given the $1,000 for himself and it was not intended by Allen or the women to thank Allen for anything. **********18 U.S.C. 209 proscribes receipt of compensation by an official for his services as an official from sources other than the Government.  Again, there is no evidence that the money was either given to or received by Allen with an intent to compensate him. Similarly, 18 U.S.C. 203, proscribing compensation to a Government official for services in relation to a Government proceeding, is inapplicable because the money was not intended to compensate Allen for anything. **********In sum, when the uncontradicted facts are analyzed in the context of possibly applicable criminal laws, it is clear there was no criminal violation by Allen regarding the $1,000. Applicability of the Special Prosecutor Provisions of the Ethics in Government Act **********The special prosecutor provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 28 U.S.C. 591, et seq., are triggered by the receipt of ''specific information'' that a person covered by the act committed a Federal criminal offense. As an employee of the Executive Office of the President with a salary above Executive Level IV, Allen is a person covered by the act. With regard to the $1,000 matter, the act would thus be triggered if the department had received, at any point, specific information that Allen committed a Federal crime. **********Neither the initial documents nor subsequent investigation has provided specific information regarding a criminal violation and, thus, the statute has not been triggered. The initial referral, insofar as it involved a sum of cash found in a White House safe, was sufficiently suspicious in nature to warrant an inquiry into the surrounding circumstances. At the beginning of the inquiry there was no allegation or information that Allen committed any crime. Thus, strictly speaking, this was not a preliminary investigation under the act which commences only after the department receives specific information of a crime. Rather, this was an inquiry to determine whether the ''suspicious circumstances'' amounted to specific information. Instead of uncovering specific information regarding a crime, the subsequent investigation has, without contradiction, yielded a detailed and innocent explanation of how the money arrived in the safe. There is no evidence that the money was intended for Allen or was kept by Allen for a corrupt purpose. **********In brief, the Attorney General has never received nor has the investigation revealed specific information of a Federal crime by Allen regarding the $1,000 and, thus, the Ethics in Government Act is inapplicable. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to appoint a special prosecutor or to file a report with the Special Prosecutor Court. ----1. The F.B.I. is not permitted to conduct interviews in Japan.  Thus all interviews in Japan had to be conducted by the Japanese National Police Agency. ----2. Forensic examination of the documents revealed that there were no differences in the ink used to write the figure ($10,000) and the ink used for the rest of the Japanese handwriting on the envelope and the receipt form. ----3. Jennings believed that the business card was somehow related to the envelope because it was attached to a box proximate to the envelope when he inspected the items in Diering's office. The individuals who opened the safe, however, stated that the envelope fell out from among the packages when they removed them from the safe. They did not know where the envelope had been placed among the boxes and when the envelope and boxes were given to Diering, no effort was made to duplicate the original position of the envelope.  Jennings' assumption that the envelope's position among the boxes had some significance when he later inspected them was thus incorrect.  The faxgram and business card are wholly irrelevant to the envelope.  The gift boxes were opened and inspected by the F.B.I. with Allen's permission. They contained gifts of nominal value. Allen does not remember precisely when he received the various gifts, but he says they will all be properly catalogued. None of the gifts has any relationship to the envelope or the Magazine interview."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/25/business/business-people-top-posts-to-engineer-at-hatzel-buehler.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1981-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 253, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TOP POSTS TO ENGINEER AT HATZEL & BUEHLER", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; TOP POSTS TO ENGINEER AT HATZEL & BUEHLER", "body_text": " **********Hatzel & Buehler Inc., one of the nation's oldest and largest electrical construction concerns, has elected Bernard Finkelstein, 55, as president and chief executive officer.

It was concerns such as his that led to Congressional consideration of ''fast-track'' legislation and President Carter's proposal for an energy mobilization board. **********During the debate over the mobilization board one example of delay and frustration stood out: the PACTEX pipeline proposed by Standard Oil of Ohio. Professor Orloff also uses PACTEX as his sole example supporting regulatory change. While such changes may be desirable, the pipeline is not a solid basis for support of that argument; indeed, one could make the claim that the pipeline's history argues the necessity for careful consideration of energy development projects. **********The pipeline example suffers from two problems.  First, there was testimony developed during Congressional hearings on the board proposal that Sohio was somewhat less than responsive to regulatory requests. Some of the delay, therefore, appears to be attributable to Sohio's inaction. **********Second, there is the history of the Alaskan pipeline.  Environmentalists wanted the pipeline to be built through Canada to the United States Middle West. By building the pipeline to Valdez and then shipping the oil to California, as was decided, excess crude was available on the West Coast. PACTEX's purpose, then, was to move the excess crude to Midwest refineries. Had the pipeline been built to the Midwest in the first place, PACTEX would not have been necessary. Had Congress not cut off debate, the other route might have been chosen. **********Changes in environmental laws and regulations may be necessary, as Professor Orloff states, but PACTEX does not support that case.

Instead of employing secretaries to retype drafts, complete footnotes and number pages, authors are accomplishing these chores by touching a few keys. **********Where there was one word processor for every 10 clerical workers last year, by mid-decade the figure will be one for every three.  However, the machines, experts believe, are not likely to lessen the demand for clerical workers in the 1980's. The use of the processors by small as well as large employers is expected to give secretaries more time and opportunity to perform duties now completed by managers. If this happens, experts believe, the serious shortage of secretaries may subside and the gap in wages between executives and secretaries may narrow. **********''Secretaries are an executive perk and no businessman or professional wants to be without one,'' said Bruce Richardson, a market analyst with the Yankee Group, a Boston consulting firm.  ''They are in no danger of being replaced by word-processing machines, as some people had feared when the machines were introduced in the early 1970's,'' said Larry Drake, an economist in the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. **********But experts do predict a radical restructuring of work, including a devaluation of current work skills and the creation of new ones.  ''Filing skills will be far less important, because these machines can store vast amounts of information that can be retrieved at the touch of a key,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''Many word processors come with spelling verification so that secretaries won't have to spend their time verifying the boss's spelling.'' **********''The emphasis on typing speed also will decline because these machines make it possible for secretaries to handle more work in less time,'' said John J. Connell, executive dire ctor of the Office Technology Research Group, a Pasadena, Calif. , organization of managers from 44 foreign and domestic compani es concerned with managing change in the office. ''Instead of s pending 20 percent of her day typing, the typical secretary will sp end only 10 percent in the years ahead. Secretaries will have more t ime to devote to intellectual tasks that are now don e by their bosses and o ther managers.'' **********Mr. Connell cited the example of a secretary who was given responsibility for preparing a proposed budget, a task that had previously been assigned to a manager. She queried the department heads about their requirements for the coming fiscal year, fed the information into the word processor, and came up with a proposed budget that was critiqued by her boss and other top managers. **********''If more secretaries were given duties like that, their morale would improve and more women might be attracted to the field,'' Mr.  Connell said. ''Secretarial salaries also might rise. The typical manager now makes three to four times what the typical secretary earns, but if she starts assuming some managerial duties this gap may lessen.'' **********The salaries of secretaries with word-processing skills are already higher than those who lack such expertise, according to Mr.Richardson. ''The typical secretary earns from $250 to $300 a week while the secretary who has skills in word-processing earns at least $50 more,'' he said. **********Acquiring skills in word processing will be easier in the decade ahead because more high schools and colleges are offering instruction. Several temporary-help agencies also have adopted shortterm training programs because more than a million word-processing units have been installed in offices and another 1.5 million are expected to be installed by 1985. Some of the 50 manufacturers of word-processing equipment also have developed disks and other selfteaching aids. **********One of the biggest problems to be overcome is worker resistance.  ''The use of word processors has meant a slight improvement in the working lives of some clerical workers because it has removed the drudgery of repetitive typing,'' said Karen Nussbaum, director of Working Women, a group representing female office workers. ''But for millions of others, it has meant that they are assigned to centers where they do nothing but baby-sit machines for eight hours. **********Bernard Schwartz, director of communication of the International Information/Processing Association, Willow Grove, Pa., believes that this atmosphere will be changed because the lower price of machines will allow companies to disperse them throughout their organizations, rather than restricting them to a single center. **********''Word processing is a good field for career-minded people,'' Mr.  Schwartz said. ''Many of our 14,000 members started out as secretaries, and today some of them are earning as much as $50,000 a year, because word processing was a career path to management. In the 1980's, more secretaries will have such opportunities.''  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Sharon Johnson is a freelance writer - who still uses a typewriter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/04/world/pope-sees-greek-orthodox-cleric.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 48, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pope Sees Greek Orthodox Cleric", "print_headline": "Pope Sees Greek Orthodox Cleric", "body_text": " **********Pope John Paul II received Metropolitian Georges Khodr of the Greek Orthodox Church today at a private audience, the Vatican reported.

One is an easing of the marriage penalty. Another is a provision that could greatly aid many two-income households with children, but is still virtually unknown outside a tight coterie of tax experts. **********That provision would permit companies to set up tax-favored ''dependent-care assistance programs'' to help pay for employee child-care expenses, a much sought-after fringe benefit now that more and more mothers are working. Effective Jan. 1, 1982, companies can set up and pay for the costs of on-site day-care centers, directly pay the outside providers of such services, or reimburse employees for the costs of home day care provided by housekeepers and babysitters. **********Within certain limits, employees will not have to report the reimbursement as taxable income, just as they now do not have to report medical reimbursements. In addition, companies will be able to claim a tax deduction for their share of the bill, so long as the program is a formal written plan and is not limited to highly paid workers. **********''It may be one of the most signifi cant items in the entire tax act,'' said R ichard W. Hutson, a partner in Hewitt Associates, an employee bene fits consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill. **********The program offers generous savings to families that have to spe nd up to $6,000 a year and more for their childr en's day-care arrangements. ''If you could get that same su m on a tax-free basis, you'd be ecstatic,'' Mr. Hutson said. ''It wo uld mean a $1,200 tax savings for someone in a 20 percent tax brack et and a $3,000 tax savings for someone in a 50 percent bracket.' ' **********But Mr. Hutson and other consultants are most interested in the impact that the provision may ultimately have on a new kind of compensation arrangement, called salary reduction, that is still in the drawing-board stage. **********Under such an arrangement, a company would reduce a worker's salary by the amount of tax-free fringe benefits received. Despite the pay cut, the Hewitt consultants say that in the short run, the worker is better off because he or she wrings more after-tax use out of the total compensation package. The employer also benefits because its total employee compensation package is more tax-effective and the wage base on which it must pay Social Security taxes is reduced. **********There are long-term drawbacks, however. An employee may suffer because his wage base for retirement benefits is reduced. Clearly, workers are best off if companies add a day-care assistance program to their existing fringe benefits without a salary reduction plan. **********So far, there has been little movement by managements to embrace the idea, according to Mr. Hutson. ''It's a sleeper, and the typical reaction has been one of surprise,'' he said. ''Most people say, 'Gee, I don't believe that. I want to read it for myself.' '' **********In any case, there are still many sticky questions about day-care assistance plans. It is unclear, for instance, how companies will be able to monitor a reimbursement program for home day care to insure that those providing the service do not inflate their fees and kick back some of the excess to the parents. And some consultants are concerned that day-care assistance may favor employees with children over those without. For this reason, they say, such a plan may be best suited to companies with ''flexible'' benefit plans. **********Such plans have a core group of common benefits, such as basic medical insurance, and then permit workers to choose among a laundry list of supplementary benefits that best suit their lifestyles. Some people may opt for extra vacation days, while others choose dental insurance. **********The other provisions of the tax bill that deal with family tax matters are more straightforward. For example, the easing of the marriage penalty, which taxes a two-earner couple more heavily than if both parties were single, will be gradually phased out starting next year. Effective in 1982, such couples will be able to claim a deduction of $1,500, or 5 percent of the lower-paid spouse's earnings up to $30,000, whichever is less. In 1983, the deduction doubles to $3,000, or 10 percent of the lower-paid spouse's earnings up to $30,000, whichever is less. **********Sidney Kess, national tax partner with the accounting firm of Main Hurdman, notes that only a spouse's earned wages and salary qualify for this tax break. The deduction is not applicable to interest income, dividends, distributions from Individual Retirement Accounts, pension or annuity payments, deferred compensation or salary paid by a taxpayer to his or her employee-spouse. **********Mr. Kess also suggests some marital tax planning to take maximum advantage of the provision. A unmarried couple currently living together would be well advised to postpone marriage until 1982. ''In some cases, they could save enough in taxes to pay for their honeymoon.'' Conversely, he said, two-career couples in the middle of a divorce proceeding might be better off to complete their break before the end of the year. **********However, David A. Berenson, a partner at Ernst & Whinney, said the provision, enacted to provide relief to one taxpayer group that felt disadvantaged, will now penalize women who drop out of the labor force to raise their children. He gave the example of a wife who earns $40,000 and a husband $30,000. If the husband's salary rises to $70,000 and the woman quits to raise their child, ''they will lose out on a $3,000 deduction.'' **********The new law also offers a retroactive tax break to parents who adopt children, but it has limited applicability. People who adopt starting this year can claim a deduction of up to $1,500 for such expenses as adoption fees, court costs and legal fees. But to qualify for the deduction, they must adopt a child who is handicapped or a member of a minority group. **********Finally, the law liberalizes the credit that working parents can claim for child-care expenses. Currently, the maximum credit is $400, or 20 percent of the first $2,000 in expenses for one child, and $800, or 20 percent of the first $4,000 in expenses for two or more children. Effective f or 1982, the credit will be increased and changed to a sliding scale , depending on a family's income. For couples with adjusted gros s incomes of $10,000 or less, the credit for one child will be a max imum of $720, or 30 percent of the first $2,400 in expenses. For two or more, it will be $1,440, or 30 percent of the fir st $4,800. The credit decreases by one percentage point for each additional $2,000 in income. Thus, for families earning mo re than $28,000, it is only $480 for one child and $960 for two or more. **********Despite its advantages, the provision has come under criticism. Its impact is miniscule compared with relief the bill has granted to high-income taxpayers by retroactively reducing the capital gains rate and by cutting the maximum tax rate next year to 50 percent from 70 percent. **********''Sure a credit of $1,440 looks good, but how many people who make $10,000 a year can afford to spend $4,800 on child care,'' said Mr.  Kess. ''For the typical middle class couple, the increase is peanuts.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/24/business/a-rosy-outlook-for-oil-but-cross-your-fingers.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Martin", "pub_date": "1981-05-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1899, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A ROSY OUTLOOK FOR OIL, BUT CROSS YOUR FINGERS", "print_headline": "A ROSY OUTLOOK FOR OIL, BUT CROSS YOUR FINGERS", "body_text": " **********A S the oil ministers' customized jets swoop toward Geneva for the mid-year meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that begins tomorrow, a consensus has taken shape among Western economists, oil analysts and government policymakers that the cartel has never been in shakier shape. **********Maybe. But lurking in the shadows is a nagging suspicion, founded on hard experience, that the world oil situation could turn nasty overnight. The industrialized nations' dependence on OPEC oil, while somewhat diminished, is by no means a bygone worry. Nor is the pricing history of this commodity, even pre-OPEC, a cause for much celebration. **********But the optimists do have some strong arguments: Demand for petroleum products in the industrialized world is plummeting, the world oil market is soggy with excess supplies, and the most significant OPEC member, Saudi Arabia, is running its wells at unusually high levels, aiming at freezing prices or even forcing them lower. **********''Consuming nations, for the first time in years, are gaining the upper hand,'' Business Week pronounced this week. ''Never before on the eve of an OPEC meeting has the cartel's hold on consuming nations been so tenuous.'' **********''The chances of an oil price increase for the remainder of the year are very, very slim,'' said John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. Moreover, he predicts the inflation-adjusted price of foreign petroleum will remain stable through 1985. **********The reasons for this more cheerful outlook are rooted in some familiar sour news - the 20-fold increase in the price of oil over the past decade, and particularly, the doubling of prices in the last two years. **********As a result of the painful price hikes, the Western world's demand for petroleum plunged by 2.5 million barrels a day last year, and by another 2 million to 2.3 million barrels in the first quarter of 1981. Moreover, some optimistic forecasts, such as that of the Mellon Institute of Energy Productivity, have suggested that more efficient use of energy could totally eliminate the need for oil imports to the United States by 2000. **********The higher prices are also encouraging oil exploration in non-OPEC nations. Over the past two years such output, chiefly from Mexico and the North Sea, has increased by nearly 2 million barrels daily and further increases seem certain. Additionally, the current level of oil prices is finally beginning to make synthetic fuels look economically attractive, if soaring interest rates come down, Mr.  Lichtblau suggests. **********Unquestionably, all these developments have weakened the roar of the OPEC lion, and represent cause for hope. But it would be a serious mistake to consider the oil cartel a meek pussycat. The precarious nature of the West's dependence on OPEC petroleum is evident from the following factors: *********** Since the days of John D. Rockefeller, the oil business has been characterized by periods of price-depressing glut, followed by periods of shortage and sharply higher prices. The market forces that are now limiting OPEC's power could quickly reverse themselves, particularly when Western economies recover from the doldrums and regain momentum. *********** One major producing country, say Libya, could be shut down by internal or external events. The danger of a repeat of the disastrous price leapfrogging that followed the Iranian revolution two-and-a-half years ago would then arise. *********** Saudi Arabia could cut its 10.3 million barrel daily production by 2 million or 3 million barrels. Although current world inventories - some 600 million barrels above normal - are ample, oil analysts suggest a Saudi cutback would inspire enough nervousness to quickly firm up today's weak market. Certain oil analysts insist this is true despite the fact it would take more than six months for a Saudi cutback to 8.5 million barrels to have much of an effect on world stocks. Simply put, Saudi Arabia is that important. **********Essentially, the message behind today's headlines, oil analysts say, is that the happier view of oil should be taken with at least a small grain of salt. ''No matter how the price goes, whenever it stops rising, there is a tremendous sigh of relief and life is beautiful again,'' Morris A. Adelman, an economist at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, said. The Economics **********I N essence, the oil business is just like any other commodity business. Higher prices bring on more supplies - until the market is saturated, and the cycle repeats itself. Because of oil's importance in driving overall economic activity, such cycles tend to be even more dramatic. **********This, of course, has been the impetus behind repeated efforts in the oil business to stabilize prices by setting limits on production. Oil historians point out that it was only a small step from the Texas Railroad Commission and the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which early on regulated production in those states, to OPEC's efforts on a world scale. **********But even with such self-imposed production curbs, market forces often fight their way to the surface and emerge as dominant factors.  After the initial quadrupling of crude oil prices in 1973-74, the industrialized nations plunged into a recession, one that was on the way anyway, many economists think, albeit in less severe fashion.  This had the effect of cutting demand, and thus preventing increases in the real, or inflation-adjusted, price of foreign petroleum until revolution wiped out Iran's production in 1979. **********United States demand in the post-recession recovery responded expectedly. It surged by nearly 7 percent in 1975-76, as large gasguzzling cars were again embraced, and by more than 3 percent in each of the next two years. The net result was that the American public was nicely set up for 1979's big price hikes. **********Could it happen again? ''If economies suddenly revive as oil is getting a little cheaper and taking less of the paycheck, we could see the same thing,'' a top oil analyst said. **********Arguing against a re-occurrence of the old pattern is the view that today's high level of petroleum prices is itself enough to curb demand, even without real increases. Arguing in favor of a demand spurt, with the accompanying temptation on OPEC to jack up prices, would be a quick and dramatic econodic improvement resulting from President Reagan's budget and tax proposals. The Flashpoints **********J AMES SCHLESINGER, who was Secretary of Energy at the time, said in the midst of the Iranian revolution that that crisis ''underscored the fragility'' of the world oil system. That fragility is still woefully apparent. **********As Syria and Israel are taking each other's measure in the lush hills and valleys of Lebanon, top planning officials of the international oil companies are muttering that the Arab nations may again employ the oil weapon against the United States if war breaks out. Moreover, spring has come to Iran, and with the good weather, the threat of a resumption of hostilities. **********''My God, you have a war,'' said Walter McDonald, former top energy analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency. ''You've got Iran and Iraq sitting and waiting to shoot at each other again.'' **********Mr. McDonald contradicts a number of optimistic reports that peace between the two countries is imminent, saying ''chances are the fighting will start up again.'' **********Bolstering this view, in recent days, several Japanese tankers have elected not to take loadings from Iran's Kharg Island terminal, for fear of being attacked, a major oil company official said. **********Oil analysts note that the biggest increases in crude prices have come as a result of supply disruptions that have thrown markets into pandemonium, rather than specific pricing decisions by OPEC. The two biggest have been those following 1973's Yom Kippur War and 1979's Iranian revolution. But smaller incidents, and even fears of disruptions, have also occasionally sent oil markets spinning. **********Experts cite two factors that might make future supply interruptions worse than earlier ones. First, the Iranian cutoff proved it now only takes one country to send prices spiraling upward; in 1973 it had taken 10 Arab countries acting in concert to have any appreciable effect. Iraq's new importance as OPEC's secondbiggest producer in times of peace makes this an especially worrisome point. **********Second, the amount of oil controlled by international oil companies outside North America has shrunk from 19 million barrels a day in 1973 to only 7 million barrels in 1978, and it has shrunk even more since then, according to analysts and company officials. **********As governments have wrested control from the companies, they have also increasingly favored government-to-government sales, often with strict condions attached, such as ones limiting resale. This significantly reduces the flexibility with which the world oil system can respond to crises, analysts point out. The Saudis **********I N times of oil abundance, ''Saudi Arabia is OPEC,'' Mr. Lichtblau said. By its own production decisions, it can almost singlehandedly determine the price of petroleum.  Currently, the desert kingdom produces 10.3 million barrels of oil a day, nearly 2 million barrels a day above its official ceiling of 8.5 million barrels. But Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the Saudi Oil Minister, said in New York last month that production of only 5.2 million barrels would ''give us what we need'' in terms of revenues. And in January, in a speech delivered at the University of Petroleum and Minerals in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, he said Saudi Arabia ''may have to reduce its production to four, or even three, million barrels a day'' to keep the price of oil at a level acceptable to the cartel in the face of tumbling demand. **********Production cuts of this magnitude would come in the face of Sheik Yamani's own pronouncements that the price of oil may be rising too fast, damaging Western economies where the Saudis have invested billions of dollars and forcing more conservation and fuel switching than would occur if price rises were more restrained. Moreover, Saudi Arabia hopes to receive F-15 fighters and AWACs surveillance planes from the United States, as well as expand its trade with the West. **********But powerful minorities in the kingdom are said to be pressing for drastic cuts in oil output, a move that would have the immediate effect of solidifying prices for the entire cartel. **********''If Saudi Arabia wants a strong OPEC, they can have it any time they want,'' said James Tanner, an international oil expert with the Petroleum Information Corporation. Added Mr. Adelman: ''The Saudis could be the cartel enforcer. If you put their backs to the wall, I haven't the slightest doubt what they're going to do.'' The Upshot? **********F OR the present, tumbling demand and the world's enormous inventories of oil are expected to militate against any price increase and keep oil prices relatively stable. If OPEC's goal of unifying prices is achieved, it will lay the way for the cartel's adoption of a long-term plan for gradual price increases, probably of 9 percent to 12 percent a year in real terms. But even that is substantial: Real price increases of only 5 percent annually would push the price of oil above $100 a barrel in 1981 dollars by the year 2000."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/22/world/new-yorker-is-reported-choice-for-envoy-in-italy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Yorker Is Reported Choice for Envoy in Italy", "print_headline": "New Yorker Is Reported Choice for Envoy in Italy", "body_text": " **********White House sources in Washington said last night that President Reagan was expected to nominate Maxwell M.

In all, analysts here believe, there are nearly 10,000 Pakistanis serving on foreign soil in addition to the contentent for Saudi Arabia, which is said to involve up to 20,000 men. The military missions, part of Pakistan's large and well-trained army, are already becoming a factor in the increasingly tense maneuvering around the Persian Gulf. **********Some Western sources say that a Pakistani military group has already been dispatched to Saudi Arabia to prepare cantonments for men and equipment to be assembled later. Others say that relatively small numbers of men will actually move to Saudi Arabia, with the bulk of the force serving as a rapid deployment unit, based at home but on a virtual standby alert. Indian defense specialists report that the commander is Gen. Shams ur-Rahman Kallu, who is said to be in Saudi Arabia. Reports of Troop Assembly Denied **********Pakistani officials continue to deny the reports of their troop assembly for Saudi duty. In an interview last November, President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq said he thought that negotiations then going on with Saudi Arabia would result in the dispatch of no more than 600 or 700 additional Pakistani soldiers, airmen and sailors. Even after that Pakistan's Government-controlled newspapers and its diplomats repeatedly insisted that no Pakistani troops were going to augment the Saudi Army. **********K. Subramaniam, a former Indian defense official who heads the Institute of Strategic Studies, a Government-supported research organization in New Delhi, said he regarded the 20,000-man figure as reasonable and said the formation and deployment were being carried out within the context of a five-year-old technical assistance agreement under which Saudi Arabia had obtained the services of pilots, plane mechanics and tank technicians as well as military instructors. The negotiations last year involved completion of the arrangements. **********Mr. Subramaniam said that according to his understanding the Pakistani forces would not technically be attached to the Saudi Army but to the Saudi National Guard, a military force recruited from loyal tribes that is primarily responsible for protecting the royal family. Bodyguard Duty Not New **********Such essentially bodyguard duty is not new for the Pakistanis.  President Zia ul-Haq commanded a Pakistani brigade in Jordan and played a key role in suppressing the challenge to King Hussein from Palestinian guerrillas in 1970. The brigade, according to Indian military strategists, is still in Jordan and may number 3,000 troops. **********Similarly, Pakistani contingents in Libya and Abu Dhabi have been there for many years.  In Libya, the air force's many Mirage jets are maintained and flown by Pakistanis. Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, who had established close ties with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto when he was President, ordered the Pakistanis to leave after President Zia endorsed the execution of Mr. Bhutto in April 1979. The Libyan order was later rescinded, however, and there are said to be several thousand Pakistani troops still in the country. **********In Abu Dhabi, Pakistanis have for some years flown and serviced many of its 52 combat planes, including 26 Mirages.  Clearly it is the Pakistani military ties to Saudi Arabia that are the most important. The need for efficient and trustworthy troops was brought home to the Saudi leaders by the capture of Islam's holiest shrine by religious fanatics 14 months ago and by the difficulties encountered in subduing the occupiers. From the Saudis' perspective, the Pakistani forces they are getting provide them with professional and disciplined troops that have no interest in the tribal disputes and family jealousies that have imperiled Saudi leaders. Sorely Needed Funds for Pakistan **********What debt-ridden Pakistan gains from the arrangement is, first of all, money. While there is no way of knowing how much it is receiving for supplying manpower, the informed speculation of Asian attaches here in New Delhi is that at the very least Saudi Arabia, in addition to paying for equipping, paying and transporting the two divisions, will underwrite the expenses for raising and equipping two divisions to remain in Pakistan. **********Even before the Pakistani forces were to be sent to Saudi Arabia, it was clear that the Government in Islamabad had sought and received aid of all sorts from the Saudis and that as United States aid withered with the revelations that the Pakistanis were developing atomic weapons, the Saudis were taking up the slack. Some Indian military analysts suggest that the relationship with the Saudis may become an effective means of permitting the Pakistanis to acquire the expensive and sophisticated weapons they seek -either more of the Mirage fighters they have bought from France or the F-15 and F-16 aircraft they want from the United States on a strictly cash deal on which there are no encumbering Congressional riders. **********These Indian sources, supported by a few Western ones, say that whatever the details, the sending of troops serves the interests of the United States as well as those of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.  According to this argument the presence of skilled and disciplined Islamic soldiers and airmen from Pakistan is far less provocative to Saudi society than an American or other Western presence would be.  The net result, furthermore, is the immediate strengthening of the Saudi leadership and the concomitant reassurance of the West about the security of a vital source of oil."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/08/business/pressure-on-small-brewers.html": {"writer_name": "Winston Williams", "pub_date": "1981-08-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1263, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRESSURE ON SMALL BREWERS", "print_headline": "PRESSURE ON SMALL BREWERS", "body_text": " **********Small breweries have been folding almost since anyone can remember. The growing national brands have swallowed them as acquisitions or have made it impossible for them to survive financially. **********Now the country is left with about 40 brewing companies, most of them small. Two rapidly expanding giants, the Miller Brewing Company, owned by Philip Morris Inc., and Anheuser-Busch Inc., control 50 percent of the market. Six smaller companies of national stature - Coors, Heileman, Schlitz, Pabst, Stroh and Olympia -seem bent on trying to get back into the race through mergers. Most of them are now suffering from financial setbacks. **********''The consolidation of the industry seems to be approaching its final stages,'' said Peter Coors, vice president of marketing for the Adolph Coors Company. He refused to confirm or deny reports that his company was looking for a merger candidate. **********Deal Valued at $494 Million **********Last week the G. Heileman Brewing Company of La Crosse, little known outside the Middle West, agreed to buy the Jos. Schlitz Brewing Company in a deal valued at $494 million in cash and stock. This week the Pabst Brewing Company raised the ante by making a $588 million offer for Schlitz in cash and stock. **********The offer drew immediate speculation from Heileman's president that Pabst's bid ''may be significantly less than its stated value'' because of the tax implications to Schlitz shareholders of accepting Pabst debentures. **********Earlier this year the Stroh Brewery Company of Detroit took over the F.& M. Schaefer Corporation. Industry experts expect other brewery mergers to follow if antitrust officials offer no objection. Speculators Attracted **********The prospect of a shakeout in the $27 billion-a-year beer industry has attracted the interest of speculators. Irwin L. Jacobs, Pabst's largest stockholder, made a fortune liquidating W.T. Grant assets, and last week he won a seat on Pabst's board of directors. Industry analysts expect him to raise a strong voice for merging or liquidating the company. **********Pabst seems to attract a lot of interest from outsiders. Since July 2 it has been under the temporary leadership of Thomas N. McGowan, a lawyer and formerly an outside director. Mr. McGowan became president when Frank DeGuire, the chairman, was forced to give up the title of chief executive officer after Pabst suffered a $1.8 million loss in the first quarter. Mr. Jacobs, before his election to the board, had asked to be named chairman and had threatened a proxy fight. **********Miller and Anheuser-Busch have been as effective as yeast in all this fermentation. Both companies have increased beer prices only slightly over the last year and half, preventing sizable increases by other companies and squeezing their profit margins. All of the six smaller companies except Heileman have shown lackluster earnings and weak sales growth over the last several quarters. Expansion of Capacity **********Miller and Anheuser-Busch are adding production capacity at a brisk rate while beer consumption is growing less than 4 percent a year.  Busch, now spending $100 million to convert a former Schlitz brewery near Syracuse, will increase its production capacity by 27 percent, to 70 million barrels a year, by the end of 1982. Miller, with a $413 million plant under construction at Clinton, Ohio, will add more than 20 percent to capacity, making a total of 62 million barrels a year, by early 1983. **********''Somebody has to lose in this game,'' said Russell T. Clary, Heileman's chairman. ''If some capacity doesn't come offstream, there's going to be big overproduction in a few years.'' **********Schlitz recently announced that its old brewery in Milwaukee, capable of producing more than six million barrels of beer annually but at high cost, would close permanently. The plant had been idled by a labor dispute since June 1. **********Just whose capacity will be reduced is now a big question in the industry. The financial performance of the second tier of companies over the next several months will probably determine the new pecking order. Profits for the group have been disappointing despite the fact that beer sales are regarded as recession-resistant. New Marketing Methods **********But that was before Miller's corporate parent, Philip Morris, changed the game in the early 1970's by throwing big advertising dollars into the fray and discounting prices to increase its market share. Over the last year, Miller and Anheuser-Busch have increased prices by 5 to 6 percent although production costs have gone up significantly more than that. **********''You're in real trouble if you're a regional brewer and get caught in a national price squeeze,'' said Heileman's Mr. Cleary.  His company has responded, he said, by belt-tightening and by measures to improve productivity -using double-forklift trucks and increasing the speed of can lines. **********But he added, ''You've got to have good efficient facilities and a broad product line, and advertising has to be effective in its appeal.'' Operating plants near their capacity is extremely important to profitability in the beer industry. And Heileman thinks it can improve Schlitz's operating rate - 60 percent before the closing of the Milwaukee plant - by brewing some of its 24 brands in Schlitz breweries. **********Although the marketing thrust of the industry's giants has put pressure on the also-rans, some of their problems have resulted from their own actions. That Different Formula **********Schlitz, for instance, changed its formula in 1976. Beer drinkers promptly accused the company of marketing ''green beer,'' a product not aged enough. After its market share plummeted, Schlitz went back to the original formula, but many of its old fans continued to stay away. Last fall Schlitz created a stir with its comparative taste tastes. In the second quarter of this year, Schlitz won its first small sales increase in five years. **********Coors is another example. At one time the Coors management flaunted its dedication to conservative causes, and the company became the target of several boycott campaigns. **********''Coors got everybody mad at them,'' said John A. Tauer Jr., an analyst with Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis. ''They alienated women, labor, the Government and environmentalists.'' Coors has since tempered its advocacy. **********For years Coors, with all of its production coming from a single plant in Colorado, has been considering building another plant in the East. Some analysts think Coors may be in the market to acquire another brewery, but Mr. Coors said: ''We would have a difficult way making beer the way we like to make it in someone else's brewery. Our strategy is to survive as a very strong regional brewery.'' A Multitude of Brands **********Coors, like Pabst and Olympia, has been slow to follow the industry's trend toward brand proliferation. These days there are popular-priced and premium-priced brands for light beer, regular beer, malt liquor and imported beer. The fastest-growing items are light beer, imports and expensive brands such as Miller's Lowenbrau or Anheuser-Busch's Michelob. **********Miller and Busch are continually developing and introducing new brands. Heileman has managed to offer a full line by adding brands, such as Colt 45 and Blatz, through acquisitions. All three companies also distribute imported brands. **********Brewing companies that have vast production capability but lack full product lines may find that time is running out for them as independent concerns. ''They are going to have to merge themselves into bigger barrelage to survive,'' said Roger Spencer of Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/25/business/credit-markets-interest-rates-move-higher.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1981-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 777, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Credit Markets; INTEREST RATES MOVE HIGHER", "print_headline": "Credit Markets; INTEREST RATES MOVE HIGHER", "body_text": " **********Short- and long-term interest rates rose yesterday as traders continued to worry about the heavy supply of new corporate and Treasury issues and their financing costs. **********Even though prices have dropped in recent days, salesmen say that there has been modest buying of bonds. Nevertheless, it is continuing as some buyers follow the old dictum of ''buy on weakness.'' Since June 16, the price of 30-year Treasury bonds has dropped about 4 1/2 points, or $45 per $1,000 bond, as the 13 7/8 percent issue due in 2011 closed yesterday at 105 14/32 offered to yield 13.14 percent. **********Over all, however, the debt markets' performance has not been so dismal, since dealers have successfully distributed a heavy volume of securities. More than $2 billion of corporate issues have been sold, including deep-discount securities, while Treasury dealers are distributing $3.25 billion of new 14 percent four-year Treasury notes and $1.75 billion of 20-year bonds to be auctioned today. Lower Yields Expected **********Despite the move to higher yields during the last week, many economists say bond yields will drop again. ''The rally is by no means over,'' said Arnold X. Moskowitz, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds, who estimated that Treasury bond yields could fall to 11 percent, about 3 1/4 percentage points below the peak yields of early May. **********''The fundamentals of inflation, a slower economy, and Federal Reserve control over money supply overwhelmingly favor lower bond yields,'' said Robert Parry, senior economist at the Security Pacific National Bank. By the fourth quarter, he estimated, the prime rate could be 15 percent, Federal funds 13 percent or less, and triple-A bond yields 12 percent or less. **********''There is enough slack in the economy to avoid a resurgence in inflation,'' Mr. Parry said, even if the economic growth resumes after a flat second quarter. **********''My primary doubt concerns the Fed and short-term rates,'' Mr.  Parry said, acknowledging that economic growth could cause a pickup in money supply growth that would require the Fed to tighten policy and cause short-term rates to rise again. ''We might avoid that problem,'' he explained, ''since high interest rates are changing the way the public handles its money.'' Traders Cautious **********Uncertainty about the Federal Reserve continues to make traders cautious. Yesterday the overnight rate on bank loans in the Federal funds market opened at 16 percent, dropped to 15 1/4 percent, and then climbed to 19 percent by late afternoon. Although financing costs were 15 percent or even less, analysts said they were worried that the low rate would not endure. **********In advance of today's auction of $1.75 billion of new 20-year Treasury bonds, analysts estimated the issue might carry more than 30 basis points of additional yield compared with the 13 7/8 percent Treasury bonds. A basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********Additional supply is also coming from the agency sector, where the Federal National Mortgage Association plans to announce the interest rate today for $600 million of debentures due in May 1985. **********Securities dealers said that the lower prices had come recently as they tried not to accumulate large holdings of bonds in the face of a heavy supply of new issues and erratic financing costs. **********Although some proposed new issues, such as International Business Machines' $250 million of 25-year debentures, have not come to market, many other borrowers have grown tired of waiting for rates to fall. For example, Gulf Canada's $200 million of Aa/AAA-rated 30-year debentures were priced by a Merrill Lynch group for sale today at par with a 15 1/2 percent coupon. The company initially announced plans to sell the debentures last October. **********As securities firms successfully sell new issues, they explain that downward pressure on secondary market prices can still develop, since many of the recent issues are sold in swap transactions where a dealer accepts an older, outstanding note or bond as part of the payment for the new issue. The result helps sales of new issues but encourages lower prices in the secondary market as dealers try to attract buyers for the securities they accepted in the swap. **********In the tax-exempt market, notes of Nassau County, L.I., due in December 1981 were offered by Bankers Trust to yield 8.5 percent, while notes due in July 1982 were offered by Chemical Bank to yield 8.6 percent. Elsewhere, a $41.1 million issue of Houston general obligation bonds was offered by the First Boston Corporation to yield from 7.5 percent in 1981 to 9.1 percent in 1991 and 10.4 percent in 2000."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/27/world/around-the-world-atomic-energy-agency-considers-ousting-israel.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Atomic Energy Agency Considers Ousting Israel", "print_headline": "Around the World; Atomic Energy Agency Considers Ousting Israel", "body_text": " **********The International Atomic Energy Agency voted today to consider suspending Israel next year if it does not open its nuclear facilities to inspection.

Many birds are said to have vision far superior to that of human beings. **********A transparent observation chamber in the bottom of a helicopter has several compartments, each containing a cradle to support a bird with its head facing outward and a peck key nearby. The peck keys serve as push buttons to show by light flashes which pigeon is operating them and how many times. **********The equipment may be adjusted to alert an operator when the pecks reach a preset total within a preset time.

According to official reports, his eyes were badly bruised, one lung was full of liquid, his body was covered with hematomas, or swollen areas full of blood, and the soles of his feet had been burned. Such injuries would tend to confirm a recent report by Amnesty International that said torture was still practiced by the police in Spain. **********Even before an autopsy was performed, Interior Minister Juan Jose Roson dismissed the head of the police medical department and the Madrid plainclothes officer who supervised Mr. Arregui's detention.

Last Monday, a similar general strike paralyzed the north after the E.T.A. killed Jose Maria Ryan, a 39-year-old nuclear engineer. **********''We who condemned the death of Ryan,'' declared Xabier Arzallus, president of the Basque Nationalists, ''have the right to condemn, too, this death.'' **********''One cannot justify one death and condemn another,'' he added, speaking of the above-ground political arm of E.T.A.'s military branch, which called Mr. Arregui's death a ''state assassination'' and also called for a general strike Monday. Criticism by Rights Group **********The death focused attention on the Law of the Suspension of Fundamental Rights, which was adopted in December to help the police fight terrorism. The statute permits a terrorist suspect to be held by the police for 10 days before being allowed to see a lawyer. **********Amnesty International, in a report in December, criticized such Spanish legislation and said it contributed to patterns of police mistreatment of prisoners. Torture is specifically banned under the country's two-year-old Constitution. **********An autopsy report this evening mentioned bronchial pneumonia and fluid in the lungs among the causes of death. It also listed the many bruises without saying how they had been caused. **********''The thing is very clear,'' said Enrique Galavis, director general of prisons, who left no doubt that Mr. Arregui had been tortured to death."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/13/business/nichols-s-e-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-apr-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 44, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NICHOLS, S E, INC reports earnings for Qtr to Apr 30", "print_headline": "NICHOLS, S E, INC reports earnings for Qtr to Apr 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/05/world/around-the-world-kuwait-gets-new-cabinet-in-the-wake-of-elections.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Kuwait Gets New Cabinet In the Wake of Elections", "print_headline": "Around the World; Kuwait Gets New Cabinet In the Wake of Elections", "body_text": " **********Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime Minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, formed a new 15-member Cabinet today to guide the desert oil state on its return to parliamentary life. **********The Kuwaiti Emir, or ruler, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, announced his approval of the new Cabinet in a decree issued today.

But he was described by Father Romeo Panciroli, the Vatican spokesman, as ''serene,'' and he was strong enough to recite prayers and impart blessings to his doctors and nurses. **********His doctors were optimistic because of the progress he has made in the 48 hours since the attempted assassination, but they warned that there was still a risk of peritonitis or other infection. Newspapers Charge Conspiracy **********Major Italian newspapers carried large headlines announcing that the head of the Roman Catholic Church had been the victim of a conspiracy. **********The Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera said the shooting of the Pope was an ''international plot.'' The headline on the left-wing Rome newspaper Paese Sera was, ''Plot from abroad.'' But none of the papers cited evidence of a plot or produced any details. **********The suspected assailant, Mehmet Ali Agca, 23, insisted under prolonged official interrogation that he had acted alone. The Italian authorities do not believe him, because they think he must have had help with documents, money and other matters during his travels through Europe in the last year and in Italy in the last five months. Magistrate Quoted on Plot **********Without elaboration, La Stampa of Turin quoted Luciano Infelisi, one of the magistrates in the case, as saying, ''As far as we are concerned, documents prove that Agca did not act alone. He is a killer enlisted by an international group with subversive aims.'' **********But authoritative police and judicial sources said that they had no hard evidence of a plot. They said they were looking into the network of connections between the Mr. Agca and other persons here and abroad, more because they thought he must have had help than because they were confident of proving a conspiracy. **********Magistrate Infelisi, who is not one of the ranking figures in the investigation, could not be reached for comment, and it was impossible to confirm independently that he had made the statement attributed to him by La Stampa. **********The police denied published reports that the 9-millimeter Browning pistol with which the Pope was shot had been purchased by Mr. Agca in Bulgaria. They were working to trace the weapon, which they believe was bought in Western Europe and brought into Italy by train from Switzerland about April 20. Mr. Agca reportedly left it in the checkroom at the main railway station in Rome, reclaiming it just before he went to St. Peter's Square Wednesday. **********A painstaking check of hotel records established that the suspect had been in Italy as early as last Dec. 13, when he spent the night at the Hotel Liguria in Palermo, Sicily. One theory under exploration is that he picked up money in Sicily and on other trips, including his recent two-week holiday in Palma, on the Spanish island of Majorca. **********The police have been unable to break down Mr. Agca's story that he is a ''pro-Palestinian Communist comrade,'' even though they say he has extensive ties to right-wing extremist organizations in Turkey.  Questioned by Italian magistrates and Turkish detectives until 2 o'- clock this morning and then again throughout the day, he maintained ''a cold, very controlled attitude,'' a police official said. Suspect Ends His Fast **********Mr. Agca, who began eating again today after refusing food yesterday, reportedly answered fully all questions requiring responses that could be checked. But he refused to reply to inquiries about his friends or sources of income. **********Tonight, two young Turks who talked briefly to Mr. Agca in April when he registered at the University for Foreigners in Perugia, in central Italy, were brought to Rome for questioning. The two - Osman Tancu Celik, a man, and Endican Aytul, a woman - have said they never saw him before or after the morning of April 9, when he registered. **********The Pope talked this morning in his room at Gemelli Hospital with his chief aide, Agostino Cardinal Casaroli, the Vatican Secretary of State, and with Carlo Cardinal Confalonieri, the Deacon of the College of Cardinals. He also chatted frequently with his doctors and his two secretaries. **********He was awakened during the night by sharp pains, members of the hospital staff said. His dosage of sedatives had been reduced because it was important for his recovery that sources of pain be identified, doctors said, and in those circumstances the reaction was normal. Pain Is Said to Subside **********The pain subsided during the day, according to Dr. Emilio Presalti, the chief physician and a spokesman at the hospital.  A 7 P.M. medical bulletin, read by Dr. Luigi Candia, one of the Pope's surgeons, said John Paul's health had continued to improve.Another of the surgeons, Dr. Gianfranco Finschi, said the Pope would need two more operations - one to close the partial colostomy created during more than five hours of abdominal surgery on Wednesday and another to repair the damage to the index finger on the Pope's left hand. **********John Paul asked to be kept informed about the health of the two women wounded in Mr. Agca's attack during the Pope's weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square. Ann C. Odre, 60, of Buffalo, was reported to be recovering well from a chest wound. Rose Hall, 21, a Jamaican married to an American and living in Wiesbaden, West Germany, suffered only a minor wound in the arm. Turkish Detectives Have Role **********The interrogation of Mr. Agca was in the hands of Achille Galluci of the Rome chief magistrate's office and Domenico Sica, an aide, along with the Turkish detectives. The prisoner was attended by his attorney, Pietro d'Ovidio, one of the best-known and highest-paid criminal lawyers in Rome. He was appointed by the court. **********The lawyer is regarded as a conservative, even a right-winger. He has often represented Arabs, including several Palestinians. But other lawyers said it would be a mistake to deduce Mr. Agca's politics from those of Mr. d'Ovidio. **********Investigators said the key to Mr. Agca's ability to move around Europe freely was the documents he carried.  His false passport, in the name of Farouk Osgun, protected him from the warning bulletins that were circulated by Interpol, the international police organization, at the request of the Turkish Government. For six months his real name was on Italian Interior Ministry's bulletins of dangerous persons, but he was untouched as he crossed and recrossed the Italian border because ''Farouk Osgun'' was not on the list. **********The passport also enabled him to register at the Perugia university. That, in turn, got him a matriculation card, which made it possible for him to pass as a foreign student. Blank Passport Was Stolen **********According to Turkish diplomatic sources, the passport was stolen from the Government printing office in Turkey while still blank and was then filled in with the false name and Mr. Agca's photograph.  That fact was just one suggesting links with Turkish political groups, since there was no indication that Mr. Agca himself stole the document. He escaped from prison near Istanbul in November 1979 after having been convicted of murdering a Turkish journalist. **********Another, more important factor in the suspicion that he had allies was his access to money. When seized, he was carrying 100 Swiss francs and 400,000 Italian lira - more than $600. He had enough money to eat in the costly Biffi Restaurant in Milan on at least one occasion. The Italian police believe it must have cost him at least $100 a day while traveling through Eastern and Western europe. **********But the police were no closer to discovering where the money came from. Mr. Agca told them it was his own. Turkish Students Interviewed **********In an effort to cover every possibility, detectives interviewed all the Turkish students at Perugia, every witness to the shooting they could find and dozens of other persons. They prepared composite photographs of persons seen leaving the square just after the attack. But Alfredo Lazzarini, head of the antiterrorist squad at Rome police headquarters, said there was nothing to indicate the presence of accomplices at the scene of the crime. **********''The pictures were made to be scrupulous,'' he said. ''If more than one killer had been present, they would have shot simultaneously.'' **********One of the witnesses interviewed was Father Martino Siciliani, a Benedictine who directs the seismic observatory at Perugia. He told the police that outside St. Peter's about 30 minutes before the attack Mr. Agca had asked him what route the Pope would follow. The priest pointed it out to him."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/world/uruguay-editor-is-taking-lead-as-army-critic.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 885, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "URUGUAY EDITOR IS TAKING LEAD AS ARMY CRITIC", "print_headline": "URUGUAY EDITOR IS TAKING LEAD AS ARMY CRITIC", "body_text": " **********\"To avoid risk, most newspapers here do not say anything,\" an opposition spokesman remarked. **********\"Well,\" the spokesman, Enrique E. Tarigo, went on, speaking of his weekly newspaper, Opinar, \"we tried to say something, then said a little bit more and a lttle bit more, until...\" **********His voice trailed off.  Mr. Tarigo, who is 53 years old, was recounting his experiences since he emerged as the most popular opposition leader during the constitutional plebiscite of last Nov.  30.  That vote overwhelmingly rejected a proposed charter that would have given the country's armed forces a permanent share of power. **********\"The plebiscite showed,\" he said in an interview, \"that the majority of the people do not agree with the armed forces and their solutions.  You would think they would move faster now.\" **********His weekly began publication just before the plebiscite with an issue that was banned, but it was then allowed to continue until last month, when it was closed for four weeks. Two Articles Are Cited **********The Government cited as the reason two articles by contributors calling for elections and criticizing the armed forces' scheduled designation of a new President in September.  The articles reportedly did not bother the generals, who have the power here, but they wre said to have upset the civilian President, Aparicio Mendez. **********On the same day that the newspaper was closed, its managing editor, Luis Antonio Hierro, was jailed for 18 days under an executive order for publishing a photocopy of an internal document from the National University dealing with payments for 30 people who had helped prepare entrance examinations. **********Mr. Hierro questioned the appropriateness of the payments; the military went further, overruling them, but took action against the managing editor for publishing an internal document.  He said he was treated \"rigorously but correctly\" while in jail. **********Opinar is a tabloid that usually has about 30 pages, almost half of them devoted to cultural news.  Its forte is national and international analysis and opinion articles, written mostly by contributors and Mr. Tarigo. Permanent Staff of Four **********The weekly has a circulation of 25,000, and its newsstand price is the equivalent of one dollar.  It has a permanent staff of four, whose work is mostly a labor of love, as the pay is sporadic.  Advertisers steer clear of the paper. **********Mr. Tarigo divides his time running between the dimly lit apartment where he does most of his writing, the bare law office with peeling linoleum floor where he earns his living, and a small room rented from a pro-Government newpaper where he is engrossed with Opinar. **********A square, broad-shouldered man with gray hair and a direct manner, he was a law professor at the National University when the military moved bloodlessly into power in 1973.  It was during a crisis of urban terrorism and an unraveled economy, and the takeover was widely welcomed. **********Soon, however, Mr. Tarigo began finding the university an uncomfortable place, and he joined El Dia, one of the country's two major dailies, as an editorial writer.  The newspaper partly represents the Colorado Party, one of the country's two major centrist parties. **********He served as an editorial writer and columnist for five years until, he said, the Government began to press the owners to tone down its political views, even though they had been largely muted under the strict self-censorship here. Out of a Job Again **********Voluntarily leaving El Dia, Mr. Tarigo went to work for a popular magazine, writing the same sort of columns.  One year later, he was out of a job.  This time, he decided to start his own weekly. **********\"Everything is magnified outside the country,\" said Mr. Tarigo, who keeps a copy of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights on the wall beside his desk in his law office. **********\"The situation here has improved, one reason being the lack of subversion, strikes and protests.  The number of prisoners is diminishing.\" **********Human rights leaders here say that the Government still has 1,154 political prisoners and that they are subject to such psychological pressures as interruptions in their daily exercise and sleep routines and the imposition of solitary confinement. **********On the question of political rights, generals have been making statements in the last week promising an \"opening\" at some unspecified future time to the country's two dominant political parties, the Colorados and the Blancos.  However, all the country's old civilian political leaders remain banned from political activity. **********These bans allowed a previous unknown like Mr. Tarigo to rise to prominence.  He said he had always considered himself a man more of politics than of journalism.  If a political opportunity should arise, he said, he would be a \"coward\" if he did not take up the challenge after his years of criticism. **********In the meantime, Opinar has resumed publication.  \"I am at peace with my conscience and sleep well at night,\" Mr. Tarigo said of his renewed criticisms.  \"I just worry about finding the ways to lead the country back to democracy.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/20/business/company-news-gulf-canada-block-has-changed-handsz.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 200, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GULF CANADA BLOCK HAS CHANGED HANDSZ", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; GULF CANADA BLOCK HAS CHANGED HANDSZ", "body_text": " **********A 1.2-million-share block of Gulf Canada Ltd.  stock that traded on the American Stock Exchange this morning may represent an attempt to increase Canadian ownership in the company under Ottawa's National Energy Program, market analysts suggested here today. **********The block, representing slighlty less than 1 percent of Gulf Canada's outstanding, was crossed at $21 by Goldman Sachs and Company in New York. **********The stock closed at 20 7/8.

But political sources said foreign affairs would now be under the control of Prime Minister Mohammed Ali Rajai. Counterweight to Islamic Party **********The Defense Council changes were seen as an indication that Ayatollah Khomeini wanted to support the President as a counterweight to the Islamic Republican Party, particularly since his plan permitted the President to decide whether to carry out the Defense Council's decisions. **********After the Ayatollah's action, the state radio announced that a planned televised debate between the President and his rivals in the Islamic Republican Party and the clergy had been called off. **********The leaders were to debate events at a rally held by Mr. Bani-Sadr on March 5, during which 45 people were injured, but the peace formula called on top leaders not to make speeches until the war with Iraq was over.

Coils of monofilament polyester spew from machines looking like miniature Slinkys. The endless coils are sewn onto a continuous tape and a slicing arrangement chops them into appropriate-sized pieces. Bottom stops define the zipper lengths, and sliders, the things that go up and down, are slipped on and zipped up. **********While the technology has stayed the same, the rest of the business has not.  Talon, which used to have a firm grip on the zipper market, now is trying to defend and consolidate its shrinking market share. Ten years ago, chances were seven out of 10 that a zipper's slider would be marked Talon. Today, industry experts say, Talon has little more than 35 percent of the $393 million a year American zipper market, and they give YKK (USA) Inc., a Japanese-based company that entered the American market two decades ago, a slight edge. **********Nucon Holdings, a privately held venture capital company that purchased Talon from Textron Inc. last April, would like to change all that. Nucon paid Textron $66 million for Talon and two other divisions, which make foam manufacturer and hearing aids. According to Textron's annual report, Talon was suffering from intense and increasing foreign competition. A New Strategy **********Sidney Merians, Talon's new president, described the company's new strategy as a retrenchment plan that included cutting excess costs while maintaining market share. **********''We've eliminated millions of dollars of overhead,'' Mr. Merians said in an interview. ''We have closed losing facilities in Seymour, Ind., and Canada, and there are others that will come.'' **********Under its new owners, Talon continued to lose money in May and June. But in July, the company began to show a profit, Mr. Merians said, though he declined to divulge figures. And he predicted that results would improve further as more pruning took place. **********For Mr. Merians, the challenge comes down to becoming more competitive with YKK. For many years the Japanese company has cast its shadow not only over Talon, but over the rest of the American zipper industry as well. Trade Complaint Rejected **********In 1975 the industry trade group, the Slide Fastener Association, sought relief from the foreign imports - most notably YKK - by appealing to the International Trade Commission in Washington. **********But an investigation of the charges concluded that changing fashions and the declining economy were the most important causes of the industry's decline, not imports. In the meantime, many smaller independent zipper companies eventually went bankrupt, while Talon held on but lost money. **********Mr. Merians predicted that Talon's new position as a privately held company would giving the company more freedom to maneuver and make it a stronger competitor to YKK. **********''YKK is a private company,'' Mr. Merians said. ''They only have their own stockholders to answer to. We're in a similar position today. We don't have to worry about our earnings per share for the next two or three quarters.'' Opinion Is Mixed **********Talon's new approach is drawing mixed reviews in the industry.  Ralph Lundquist, counsel to YKK (USA) Inc. and a former director of the company, said that Talon might have a better competitive position now than it did previously. ''Textron had placed impossible burdens on Talon,'' he said. ''They expected the same sort of profits from the Talon division as they did from the helicopter division. It didn't work.'' **********The owner of another zipper company, who asked not to be named, also applauded Talon's new moves.  ''Talon needs a street fighter,'' he said, but a fighter who understood and realized Talon's shortcomings. He contended that Talon had found just that person in Mr. Merians. Where Talon once supplied every segment of the zipper market, this executive said, it could no longer afford to do so, and was acting accordingly. **********But not everyone thinks the new Talon strategy will build a stronger company. Ralph Gut, president of the Ideal Zipper Company, an independent manufacturer based in North Carolina, said he felt that Talon's new investors were merely trying to liquidate their assets and walk off with more money. In his estimation, Talon has lost a tremendous amount of business and ''is no longer a viable source in the marketplace.'' Talon's Defense **********Mr. Merians defended the company's strategy, however. He said there were no plans to sell Talon. Furthermore, he explained, it was necessary to get rid of marginal product lines and to gain the maximum from the company's potential. **********''In this industry, a discontinued zipper is worth exactly that: Zip,'' he said. ''So there are no assets to sell. We knew that when we bought Talon, and we bought this company to run it. '' **********In another move that Talon expected to help profits, the company raised prices. Scoville Inc., another zipper manufacturer, did the same. But, as Mr. Merians noted, ''Everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop as to what YKK will do.'' **********Even with these improvements in place, Mr. Merians conceded, not all of the company's problems had been solved. As he assessed the zipper market, Talon's weakest link was still nonapparel fasteners for luggage, knapsacks, sleeping bags and the like. And while Talon had the predominant market share, he felt, in the fashion area, that area had a somewhat questionable future.

A metric ton (1,000 kilograms) equals about 2,205 pounds. **********''Exports will be at the same level as in the previous year, about 32 million metric tons,'' said Torao Okumura, president of the federation. ''At one time we exported as much as 40 million tons, but we have voluntarily reduced exports, especially to the United States, in order to cooperate with its industry and Government.'' **********Last year Japan replaced the United States for the first time as the non-Communist world's No. 1 steel producer. (Biggest of all is the Soviet Union, which produced 152 million metric tons of steel in 1980.) Japan's steel output totaled 111.4 million metric tons last year, according to the trade federation. This was down three-tenths of 1 percent from the 1979 level, but American production meanwhile fell 18.2 percent, to 108 million metric tons. 'A Statistical Aberration' **********''This was a statistical aberration,'' said Eishiro Saito, president of the Nippon Steel Corporation, in an interview. ''We hope very much the United States will regain its dominant position by fully displaying its latent strength.'' **********The Japanese steel industry is now operating at about 72 percent of its 140-million-ton capacity. It has begun paring expenses to cope with uncertain demand and surging costs. **********Japanese steel mills have spent much of their capital funds on energy-saving measures. Mr. Okumura of the federation estimated that Japanese mills consumed about 99.1 million barrels of oil in 1973, just before oil prices began to soar. Last year the total was down to 37.7 million barrels, and this year it is expected to be only 25.2 million barrels. Coal and coke are being substituted for expensive oil. Demand From Oil Industry **********Sumitomo Metal Industries has 10 blast furnaces and is operating six of them, three without oil, said Shigeto Yamada of the company's business research department. **********Ironically, the global oil industry promises to be one of the few sectors showing brisk demand for Japanese steel. Analysts say 3,200 drilling rigs will be operating in the United States this year, up from 2,850 in 1980. **********The technological level of Japanese steel mills helps their efforts to make steel more cheaply. S.J. Janow, president of a metals consulting firm in Tokyo, recalled that after World War II Japanese steel mills had to use imported equipment. ''Today there's not a single piece of imported equipment,'' he declared. ''It's Japanese, and it's superior.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/22/world/us-presses-japan-on-military-role.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Halloran", "pub_date": "1981-12-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 477, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. PRESSES JAPAN ON MILITARY ROLE", "print_headline": "U.S. PRESSES JAPAN ON MILITARY ROLE", "body_text": " **********Secretary of Defense Caspar W.

She predicted that sales would drop in September when the incentive plans end. **********The General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation reported sales of 194,836 units for the Aug.  11-20 sales period, compared with 161,889 units sold in mid-August of 1980, when sales were at their lowest level in 13 years. **********Highest Since Mid-March **********Based on the results for Aug. 11-20, the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for the Big Three and the two other domestic auto makers, Volkswagen of America and the American Motors Corporation, reached 7.9 million vehicles - the highest since mid-March, the last period of broad rebate campaigns. **********By comparison, the annual selling rate was 6.1 million vehicles in all of July. The rate rose to 7.4 million vehicles in the first 10 days of August as the new incentive programs went into effect. **********Industry analysts said they were pleased, but not surprised, at the results.

'It's the Rebates Coming In' **********Michael Ward, an auto analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, agreed, saying that the sales looked strong. ''It's the rebates coming in,'' he added. **********While Chrysler showed the most improvement on a year-to-year basis, up 42.9 percent, General Motors again increased its share of the domestic market, to 66.6 percent for the middle 10 days of August, on a daily selling rate that was G.M.'s best since mid-March. **********Analysts and company spokesmen attributed the rise to G.M.'s unusual financing program. The company is offering low-interest loans on its cars when financed through the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, its consumer finance subsidiary. **********''Customers in the second 10 days of August continued to show their willingness to buy new cars and trucks when they can get favorable financing,'' said Robert D. Burger, vice president in charge of G.M.'s sales and marketing staff. Other Incentives Offered **********Chrysler offered rebates of $300 to $1,000 on certain models, and Ford had a dealer incentive program in effect that could result in customer savings of up to $1,000 on a car. A.M.C. conducted a summer sale that offered reduced prices on some models. **********Speaking of the industry in general, Mr. Ward said: ''You get the interest rates down and sales will take off. Until then, they're just bumping along.'' **********G.M. dealers reported sales of 134,949 cars in the period, which had nine selling days this year and last; sales were 19.8 perecent higher than sales last year of 112,688 cars. Ford Market Share Slips **********The Ford Motor Company said its dealers sold 37,034 cars this year, up 11.5 percent from sales of 33,212 cars in the comparable 1980 period. The growth in G.M.'s market share seemed to come primarily at the expense of Ford, which held 18.3 percent of the market in the period. **********Chrysler sold 22,853 cars in the period this year, compared with 15,989 cars last year, for its 42.9 percent increase. Chrysler's market share was 11.3 percent. **********In the mid-August period, Volkswagen of America sold 4,842 domestically built cars, down 14.7 percent from 5,676 cars a year earlier.  Including an estimate of 2,900 cars sold by the American Motors Corporation, sales for the five major domestic producers totaled 202,578, up 18.2 percent from sales of 171,381 cars last year. **********Sales for the month to date were also up for the Big Three, by 25.4 percent at G.M., 17.1 percent at Ford and 34.4 percent at Chrysler, largely because the incentive programs began at the first of the month. Volkswagen sales were down in the month-to-date period, by 8.9 percent. While American Motors reports its sales only once a month, estimated sales were down 21.1 percent for the month to date.

Bailey, chairman of Conoco, said that the Mobil bid ''raises substantial antitrust and other public policy issues of national importance, which will require intensive examination and which make the acquisition of Conoco by Mobil subject to serious question.'' He said, however, that he would not respond to the Mobil offer until Conoco directors reviewed it early next week. **********Moreover, less than a week ago, without naming any of the companies interested in Conoco, William Baxter, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, signaled that all big bidders would face a tough fight. **********'In for a Big Surprise' **********''If,'' he said, ''they think we're generally soft on mergers, that they can slip significant horizontal aspects past us, they're going to be in for a big surprise.'' Horizonal mergers are those between companies selling the same products in the same geographical markets. **********In bidding for Conoco, Mobil is competing with Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, the big Canadian liquor company, which has offered $85 a share for 51 percent, and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, the chemical producer, which has offered $95 a share for 40 percent and 1.7 shares of stock for each of the rest. Based on Du Pont's closing price yesterday of $46.25, that would be $78.625 a share for the remaining 60 percent. **********Both Seagram and Du Pont declined comment on the Mobil bid.  Regarding its own bid as higher because of Du Pont's market price, Mobil placed a combined value on the Du Pont offer of $85, and Du Pont did not dispute it. **********Sources friendly to Du Pont noted, however, that the chemical company still had $700 million of its $4 billion loan for the Conoco deal. This, he said, could be interpreted as meaning that Du Pont - if it chose to do so - already had the funds on hand to increase its $95 bid to as high as $115 a share. There was no indication so far that Du Pont had any such plans. 'Extreme Disfavor' From Dubai **********In a separate development, Conoco said in a statement that it had received a letter from Dubai in which the Middle Eastern state expressed ''extreme disfavor'' over the Seagram move and said that Conoco's operations there would be ''in grave jeopardy if Seagram interests gain substantial control of Conoco.'' It did not explain its view, except to say it would be placed in an ''embarrassing'' position. **********Conoco added that it had also received a communication from the Petroleum Ministry of Norway, where Conoco has North Sea oil interests, approving of a Du Pont takeover but noting that one by Seagram ''would require re-examination of Conoco's Norwegian North Sea licenses.'' **********Conoco denied, in answer to a question, that it had sought the views. Seagram said it was ''skeptical'' that the statements reflected the positions of these states. It noted that it had cordial relations with Dubai and that its formerly owned Texas Pacific Oil Company had drilled for oil there, relinquishing rights when it found no oil. **********Mobil, the No.2 oil company, following the Exxon Corporation, asserted in a five-page position paper that ''the fact that Mobil and Conoco are both big oil companies is not, of itself, determinative'' under the Justice Department's ''guidelines or the antitrust laws.'' Far Smaller Than Exxon **********Should Mobil succeed in taking over Conoco, the two would still be far smaller than Exxon. Mobil's $32.7 billion in assets, when added to Conoco's $4 billion, would be nowhere near Exxon's nearly $57 billion. **********Conoco has already signed a $7.4 billion merger agreement with Du Pont. And Mobil's emergence had been widely forecast on Wall Street, although the way in which it came - in an advertisement in the late editions of Friday morning newspapers - took other bidders by surprise. **********The company, as a result, was flooded with phone calls asking for particulars. A Mobil spokesman said the company deliberately waited until yesterday morning to make its official announcement to prevent competing bidders from trying to block Mobil in the courts. **********The advertisement said that Mobil was offering $90 a share for 43.5 million shares of Conoco, which would total $3.92 billion.  Efforts on Thursday evening to obtain further information about the ad were unsuccessful. But Mobil said yesterday, in its formal announcement, that the cash portion of the offer would be followed by a merger. Consequently other Conoco shareholders would be paid in Mobil securities ''intended to have a value substantially equivalent to $90 a share.''

But all around it in a sprawling urban renewal area are empty lots, reflecting a wait-and-see attitude among other builders. **********At the bank, Belgium's second largest, there is a feeling that maybe Bruxelles Lambert should have waited, too.  Like many Belgian businesses, Bruxelles Lambert cut its dividend last year, and the empty lots reflect the investment contraction caused by the country's toughest postwar economic crisis. **********''There's been no orthodox financial policy, nothing like an income policy, and the budget has gotten totally out of hand,'' said a top economist at a major Brussels bank, commenting on the Government's failed attempts to set the economy straight. ''We've had crises in steel, textiles and mechanical engineering. Office building has slowed since 1975, and now it's homes, with building costs up and mortgages at 14 percent.'' Further Economic Shrinkage **********In a recent report, published by Belgian newspapers, the national bank forecast that the economy would shrink this year by 1.7 percent, business investment would drop 3.8 percent and the currentaccount deficit would balloon to $6.8 billion. It also projected that unemployment would swell by 100,000, to 477,000, about 10 percent of the work force, which would push Belgium past Ireland into the dubious distinction of having Europe's highest jobless rate. **********As the economist from the Brussels bank explained, ''To avoid deterioration of the labor market, the Government got into subsidizing industry. That would have been all right had it helped improve the companies, but in many cases it only breached the gap, helped them pay the salaries. Our decision-makers didn't recognize the financial situation. Over the last six years we've borrowed the equivalent of $10 billion.'' **********Finding solutions to these problems is complicated by Belgium's smoldering strife between French-speaking Wallonia and Flemishspeaking Flanders. Wallonia, once the cradle of Belgian heavy industry thanks to coal and iron ore, has lost ground to Flanders, where modern industries such as electronics and machinery settled after World War II. **********Now, Wallonia's aging industries, like the steel mills around Liege and Charleroi in the south and east, are getting heavy portions of Government revival aid, giving the Flemish a sense of satisfaction that the Walloons, long Belgium's overlords, are now the country's poor cousins. Oil Shock Felt Strongly **********Belgium's problems arose, many here say, because the country never really recovered from the energy price shock of 1973-74. Old industries like steel, textile and glass had little cash left after paying their oil bills to develop much-needed new products and plants. To worsen matters, plummeting revenues and expanding social security expenditures spawned a huge public debt. **********The recovery of 1978-79 brought some respite, but when Europe's economies swung down again in mid-1980, it was evident that Belgium's structural problems - aging industries, high labor costs and paper-thin profit margins -remained. Efforts to revive industry by Government spending only widened the state's deficit. **********The language strife between Wallonia and Flanders was pushed into the background, at least temporarily, last August when a six-party coalition Government granted partial autonomy to the Flemish and French-speaking regions. That feat accomplished, Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, a 44-year-old Christian Democrat from Flanders, moved forward to tackle the economy's problems. **********Wage restraint is the keystone of Mr. Martens's revival plan, according to Jacques Van Ypersele, his top economic adviser and one of the architects of Europe's monetary system. The plan's first installment came in January, when labor and employers agreed to a two-year wage freeze. **********The second stage, including spending cuts in the bloated social security area, is expected to be ready by next month. And the final stage - to be initiated by a coalition of Government, industry and labor - involves a rethinking of revival plans for such key sectors as steel and textiles. 'How to Spread the Burden' **********''There is definitely more need for fiscal belt-tightening,'' Mr.  Van Ypersele said. ''We must try to cut down public-sector borrowing, which is driving interest rates up. **********''There is a growing awareness that adjustments must come,'' he added. ''Six months ago a wage agreement such as we passed in January would not have been possible. The question now is how to spread the burden in an acceptable fashion.'' **********One way the Belgian Government has hidden its problems from its citizens is by artificially raising the value of the Belgian franc by maintaining high interest rates, and through central bank intervention in currency markets. Thus, Belgians have not felt the brunt of price increases for such imports as French cheese and Japanese television sets. **********Economists say that, in effect, Belgian industry has been footing the bill, first by paying the difference in currency fluctuations to the oil-producing countries, then by raising wages to meet consumer price increases. **********Some economists recommend devaluating the franc as a means out of the bind, to shift the cost of maintaining the standard of living onto the shoulders of consumers, who would have to pay more for imports as the power of their currency dropped abroad. **********''We are quite against any kind of devaluation,'' Mr. Van Ypersele said. ''We are a small open economy, where exports and imports account for about 50 percent of the gross national product. We are a very indexed economy, so that devaluation would have an immediate effect on domestic prices and wages. In a one-year period, we reckon, we would have lost 80 percent of the supposed advantage.'' **********To foot the bill of currency support, the Government has been borrowing increasingly abroad - in West Germany, Switzerland and other European countries - after virtually drying up the domestic lending market. **********By all accounts, however, Belgium can continue to support the franc almost indefinitely, if at an ever greater cost. Belgium has considerable gold reserves, economists said, and it was the Belgians who wisely pushed for a partial gold backing to the European currency unit, the yardstick within the European Monetary System that Belgium now uses increasingly for collateral."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/05/business/private-industry-on-campus.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1002, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRIVATE INDUSTRY ON CAMPUS", "print_headline": "PRIVATE INDUSTRY ON CAMPUS", "body_text": " **********About a year ago, on the fifth floor of what was then a rundown humanities and science building on the campus of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, two 22-year-old former R.P.I. research associates started a computer graphics company called Raster Technologies. **********Shortly thereafter, on the first floor, four former graduate students went into business building large ''point focusing'' solar collectors, founding a company called Power Kinetics Inc. **********A few classrooms remain in the R.P.I.'s Russell Sage Laboratory Annex - there are, after all, about 5,000 students at this school.  But it is the entrepreneurs on campus, with eight such organizations at present, including Raster and Power Kinetics, that have lately been getting most of the attention. **********''I don't think it's a very traditional role for a university,'' said Michael Wacholder, one of the coordinators of the R.P.I.  Incubator Space Project, which houses private companies in university buildings at very low rents, and also allows them access to the school's teaching staff and facilities. ''Essentially what we are doing is taking fledgling businesses and putting them into tax-exempt schools.'' **********The businesses in or near the annex, according to R.P.I., the country's oldest engineering college, are the heart of the program, which is intended to strengthen the ties between business and education in general, and high technology and R.P.I. in particular. A Broad Redefinition **********R.P.I.'s attempt to fuse business and industry more fully is, to many minds, part of the broad redefinition of the relationship between industry and academics occurring in this country. The transformation of a research park built by Stanford University in the 1950's into northern California's Silicon Valley was an early example of the phenomenon. More recent attempts by several universities to set up genetic engineering firms are more contemporary examples. **********While other universities have built industrial parks, or taken equity positions in companies, R.P.I.'s program is as yet the only venture designed to bring private companies completely onto campus. **********R.P.I's program was established for a number of reasons. To begin with, it draws attention, and potential business, to the university's Capital District Technology Program, instituted under the auspices of George M. Low, president of R.P.I., in an effort to increase upstate New York's ''synergism'' among business, industry and government. (Mr. Low, who is a former acting head of National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the director of the manned moon landings, is also an R.P.I. alumnus.) **********Specifically, according to Mr. Wacholder, the Incubator program will bring business to nearby Troy, N.Y., and also to a 1,200-acre industrial park now being built by R.P.I. ''As companies grow,'' he said, ''it is expected that they will leave the incubator space and remain in the community.'' **********Further, according to R.P.I., the program gives life to ventures that might otherwise never get off the ground, for reasons ranging from the complexities of funding to the lack of a Xerox machine. In addition to low rents, companies in the program are granted access to R.P.I.'s extensive computer facilities, consultation rights with its faculty, and privileges at the school's libraries. They also get venture capital advice from the university management. **********In the case of Raster Technologies, in fact, R.P.I. took an minority equity position in the young company in lieu of charging rent. (Jay Morley, vice president for finance and administration at R.P.I., is on Raster's board of directors.) Benefits to Students Seen **********R.P.I. believes the Incubator project will benefit its students tremendously. Mr. Wacholder, for one, believes that the ''entrepreneurial tinge'' of the program complements an academic environment nicely. ''It gives them a feel for the practical side of the thing,'' he said, adding that students no longer go ''way out of town'' to get job experience in fields that might be related to their studies. **********Both landlord and tenants believe the companies involved in R.P.I.'s new program stand a good chance of profiting.  ''Our plans are to be extremely successful,'' said Lou Doctor, the now 23-year-old president of Raster, which will soon begin marketing a computer graphics terminal that allows its operator to produce color pictures as well as more traditional blueprint-like images.  Although Mr. Doctor notes that Raster ''tries to avoid'' estimating its earnings, an engineering magazine has reported that the company hopes to do $25 million to $30 million in sales within two years. **********Mark Rice, president of Power Kinetics, adds that his company, which did $300,000 in sales last year, has a ''75 percent chance'' of being awarded a Saudi Arabian contract for a desalinization project requiring 31 solar collectors. Companies Are Diverse **********Although the Incubator project is primarily made up of businesses run by people with connections to R.P.I. -former students, researchers, or professors - there are no restrictions of this kind.  Of the concerns now in the program, one is a spinoff from a local high-technology company, and another was formed after an established architectural firm merged with a local consultant. Currently, discussions are under way with a ''Canadian company connected with computers'' that wants to move into the New York State area, Mr.  Wacholder said. **********The companies in the Incubator program have little in common beyond newness and a potentially innovative technology. Besides Raster and Power Kinetics, other participants include QC-3 Associates, which biologically validates the results of private water testing laboratories, and Stenson-Dale, a consulting firm concentrating on chemical process design. **********While everyone connected with R.P.I.'s program appears to be happy with its intentions, there are those who are concerned about some of its possible implications. **********''I think the university knows it is treading a thin line here,'' Mr. Rice of Power Kinetics said, referring to a belief that education and industry are ''two distinct entities that should not be combined.'' Mr. Rice added that the ''outer limits of this kind of thing are not very far from where we are now.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/08/business/talking-business-with-emery-of-emery-air-freight-balancing-act-for-air-cargo.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 751, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Talking Business with Emery of Emery Air Freight; Balancing Act For Air Cargo", "print_headline": "Talking Business with Emery of Emery Air Freight; Balancing Act For Air Cargo", "body_text": " **********The air cargo industry is currently trying to balance a pattern of expansion, on one hand, against an air traffic controllers' strike, a weakening national economy and a changing regulatory atmosphere, on the other. Emery Air Freight is the largest of the major airforwarding companies, as well as a major factor in the international air cargo field. Revenues in 1980 came to $533 million, while net income was $21.6 million. **********John C. Emery Jr., chairman and chief executive officer at Emery, attended Dartmouth College and served as a Navy pilot during World War II. Recently, he discussed the effects of today's complex business conditions on Emery, in particular, and the air cargo industry, in general. **********Q. So far, much of the air cargo industry says it has been unaffected by the flight controllers' strike. Is this the case at Emery? And if the strike is protracted, is there a point at which the air cargo industry will feel it? A. We haven't anticipated any problems, as long as the Federal Aviation Administration continues to provide coverage to the national airways. **********If Emery was still operating as it used to, as an air freight forwarder with 100 percent of its cargo in the bellies of scheduled airlines, today we'd be in very tough shape. Thankfully, however, 80 percent of our cargo is in Emery airplanes now. **********Our big opportunity is really to convince the shipping public that some of the problems that they've seen with the short-haul airlines cutting back on their service is not carrying over on the air cargo side. **********Q. Air cargo is still mostly unexplored territory. How long will it be before the industry ''matures''? A. I don't think we're anywhere near that point. I look upon the air cargo industry as being at aboutthe same poin t the plastics industry was at back in the 19 40's. Rightnow, the state of the art is, you take the equivalent of a Pullman car, whether it's a DC-3 or a 747, and pull the seats out and make itinto a freight car. **********If the CXX is developed for the Air Force, and if the airlines and companies like Emery get behind this, so that there is a commercial derivative of a military-purpose airplane, so that the two forces join together on the future production run of, let's say, 500 rather than the 300 we're talking about -then I think we can see the cost of air cargo substantially decline. **********Q. Emery's real growth declined for the first time last year. How is the generally weakening economy affecting your business? A. Last year it was dull in automotive and retail. So all right, we avoided that. We hit technology in our selling efforts, we hit the graphic arts business, we hit the Government agency business, and we got from those areas a response that offset some of the low points in the automotive and retail thing. **********We are putting a 26 percent increase in our sales force as of the end of last year. We think that by investing more in the sales side today, even with the generally weak market conditions, we can increase our share of the existing market. **********I expect that by 1984 we will be a billion-dollar business. **********Q. If the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 were yours to rewrite, would you change it substantially? We'd make a couple of changes. The public needs to know and have copies of official tariffs from a rules standpoint. People should understand what liabilities companies like Emery do not assume. **********Number two, there's no longer any collecting agency, as the Civil Aeronautics Board used to be. I think that we can do a better job with better information, and therefore I would urge again the Department of Transportation to bring back the good old days in terms of data collection. **********Q. Other than that, is the airline industry deregulated to your liking? A. Very much so. We hope very much to see the Interstate Commerce Commission bending in the same way the C.A.B. did. It may well be that soon we might want to use trucks up to 1,000 miles. We are filing with the I.C.C. for rights to have traffic surface freight forwarding rights, to be used in times of inclement weather, or on the short haul.

Cooperation Is Offered **********The resolution asserted that the party was willing to work with all patriotic forces ''who are not against socialism.'' But at the same time it called for a renegotiation of the agreements signed with striking workers last summer, a resumption of the six-day work week and a ''temporary'' suspension of the right to strike. **********Any one of these proposals, if imposed by the authorities, could provoke a major confrontation with the 9.5-million member Solidarity union. **********The ouster of Mr. Kania, a 54-year-old career party official who replaced Edward Gierek Sept. 6, 1980, followed months of deteriorating economic conditions, with food increasingly scarce, long lines in front of shops and a dwindling supply of gasoline.  Politically, the party appeared divided and unable to move in any direction. **********General Jaruzelski, Western diplomats and Polish observers felt, was an attractive choice to be Mr. Kania's sucessor. He is politically moderate and appears to be acceptable to the Soviet Union, the Solidarity union and most of the Polish people. Career Military Officer **********A 58-year-old career officer with ramrod posture and a chest festooned with medals, the general probably owes his selection today to his military uniform more than anything elese. He became Prime Minister in Februray and has not been an activist head of Government. **********His appointment to be first secretary of the Polish Communist Party means an unusual concentration of power in the hands of a military man. It was not immediately known if he would continue as Minister of Defense. The vote to unseat Mr. Kania was 104 to 79, according to P.A.P., the Polish press agency. **********In an acceptance speech, General Jaruzelski asserted that the first priorities were to overcame the economic crisis and strengthen the state. He stressed the ''priceless importance'' of the alliance with the Soviet Union and maintaing the integrity of the Soviet bloc, according to the news agency. Military Role Growing **********Poland has not had a military leader since the inter-war dictatorship of Marshal Jozef Pilsudski. Nowhere else in Eastern Europe does a military officer serve as a party leader, since Communist parties traditionally keep military commanders to one side in the power structure. In recent months, the military has become highly visible in the political landscape. Soldiers have been interviewed on television denouncing ''counterrevolutionary'' forces. Patrols of helmeted troops in open jeeps have become a common sight in Warsaw. Two days ago it was announced that some 40,000 ground troops would have their tours of duty extended by two months. **********Mr. Kania had come under increasingly strident attack for vacillating and being too conciliatory in dealing with Solidarity.  The day before the Central Committee meeting the powerful Warsaw party organization held its own caucus and passed a resolution condeming the leadership. **********Indicative of the mood of the Central Committee meeting was a speech by Zofia Grzyb, a Politburo member, who said: ''Things are going from bad to worse. Production is falling. The shelves in shops are now almost totally empty. The party is in disarray and many party organizations are stagnant. Our people feel no support from the party governing bodies and they cease to believe that overconing the crisis is possible.'' **********Mr. Kania was reported to have offered his resignation to the 15-member Politburo, but several key figures on the Politburo were said to have opposed his removal. He is then reported to have placed it before the 200-member Central Committee. A majority of the committee voted to accept it, according to Interpress, the Government information service. Jaruzelski Gets Big Margin **********A motion for General Jaruzelski to move up to the top position was approved overwhelmingly, winning 180 votes out of 184 cast, the Polish news agency reported. It was not immediatedly known if the General would also continue to serve as Prime Minister. The appointment of a prime minister usually awaits convocation of Parliament. **********Should General Jaruzelski hold on to both psoitions - as both head of the party and head of Government - he would have accumulated a degree of power unprecedented in postwar Poland. But most observers did not expect this to happen. **********Mr. Kania, a heavyset man with closely cropped hair, was a party insider who sought compromises behind the scenes and the comfort of collective rule. In his very first speech as party leader, which was read to the nation by a television announcer, he served notice that he would not be in the limelight. **********He never managed to capture the esteem or the affection of the general public, but he won a kind of grudging admiration for his tenacity, as he steered a delicate course avoiding both open, violent confrontation with Solidarity and military intervention by the Soviet Union. 'A Great and Growing Need' **********He reluctantly went along with the union's drive for a more open society, often opposing it verbally but stepping aside at the last moment to avoid conflict. He was not an architect, but at least not an opponent, of what came to be called ''socialist renewal.'' His promise of a new order was summed up in a sentence he included in many of his speeches: ''Democracy is not a gesture of the ruling power toward society but a great and growing need of the society.'' **********Mr. Gierek's grip on power was loosened quickly by two months of labor turmoil kicked off by meat price increases. Mr. Kania's grip weakened slowly and progressively, as the economy deteriorated day by day and the hopes that the party would move to meet the aspirations of the working-class revolt against its rule gradually turned cold. **********Mr. Kania's single most attaractive feature, for many Poles, was the simple fact that under his leadership security forces were not called out against strikers. It was a fact that lost much of its appeal as the union and the party drifted farther and farther apart, leading many to conclude that his policies would lead ultimately to catastrophe. **********The Soviet Union gradually became disillusioned with Mr. Kania, whom it regarded as weak, and made no secret of its dislike. Soviet leaders held at least four meetings with Mr. Kania, in which they counseled him to move forcefully to head off what they contended was a growing '' counterrevolutionary'' threat. Soviet Message Backfires **********Finally, in June, the Soviet Central Committee sent a harshly worded warning letter that struck most analysts as a call to Polish party members to overthrow their leader. The move, however, backfired, as Mr. Kania rode out a challenge from hard-liners at a Central Committee meeting. His popularity was boosted by a sense of Polish anger at what was viewed as open interference from next door. **********In July, he was overwhelmingly re-elected against only token opposition at the party's national congress. It was the first time in the history of the Soviet bloc that a Communist Party leader was chosen by a secret ballot from the entire congress, and not simply by acclamation by the central committee alone. **********In view of that victory, Mr. Kania's departure today was further proof of how deep the frustrations run in the party's middle-level leadership. It was presaged by a number of actions - including the explusion from the party of a prominent liberal, Stefan Bratkowski, the firing of a newspaper editor who had printed an interview with a well-known political dissident , and a call for party members who also belong to the union to give up one or the other. **********Meanwhile, the Soviet Union has been signaling its dissatisfaction with Mr. Kania in recent weeks, notably by omitting all mention of him in commentaries. By contrast, Stefan Olszowski, a hard-line member of the Politburo, and General Jaruzelski have been praised in some recent Soviet publications."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/16/business/toyota-and-nissan-set-output-record.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 196, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Toyota and Nissan Set Output Record", "print_headline": "Toyota and Nissan Set Output Record", "body_text": " **********Japan's top two auto makers today reported record output for March but slower exports.

Appeals From Carter Aides **********On the other hand, several former senior officials of the Carter Administration have urged their successors to scrupulously enforce the agreements, which they say are highly favorable to the United States and to Americans with commercial claims against Iran. **********President Reagan, at his first news conference, said yesterday that ''I think that the United States will honor the obligations'' under the accords, but he said Administration lawyers had not yet determined ''whether they are in keeping with international and national or our own laws.'' **********The Reagan Administration has postponed regulations implementing President Jimmy Carter's 11th-hour executive orders under the agreements. The carefully hedged statements by Mr. Reagan and other high officials suggest that they have not ruled out the possibility of declaring all or part of the accords illegal under international law and the United States Constitution. The Background **********As the months passed the fate of the hostages released Jan. 20 had become increasingly interlocked with that of the $11 billion to $12 billion in Iranian assets that President Carter froze on Nov. 14, 1979, 10 days after the seizure of the embassy in Teheran. **********The Algiers accords represent a complex set of compromises on the four conditions for release of the hostages announced last September by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian revolutionary leader: return of the frozen assets to Iran, cancellation of American claims against Iran, return of the late Shah's wealth and a pledge of noninterference in internal Iranian affairs. Three of the five documents that embody the details of the financial agreements are still secret, but the general outlines are clear. **********Iran agreed to release the hostages, to submit to binding international arbitration of commercial claims and to pay all claims found valid by a special arbitration tribunal. In return the United States agreed, among other things, to return the frozen assets (including accrued interest), except for about $5 billion set aside to pay off bank loans to Iran and $1 billion that would go into a special escrow account to insure payment of the projected arbitration panel's awards on claims by companies other than banks. **********Iran received $2.9 billion soon after the hostages were released.  A further $3.7 billion was used to repay syndicated loans by American and European banks and $1.4 billion was set aside to repay individual bank loans after resolution of questions about the amounts owed. **********The central issue posed by the Algiers accords now that the hostages are free is whether President Reagan should or legally can honor those of his predecessor's agreements that have not yet been carried out. These include pledges to return within seven months the $3 billion to $4 billion worth of Iranian assets that are still tied up by court orders in the United States; to nullify the court orders and terminate lawsuits in favor of international arbitration; to guarantee Iranian immunity from liability to the hostages and their families and certain classes of commercial claimants, and to provide largely symbolic but still controversial assistance to Iran's efforts to recover property of the Shah and his close relatives. For Renunciation **********Some advocates of renouncing the agreements in whole or in part maintain that such a step is necessary to erase a dangerous precedent no matter how good a deal the Carter Administration lawyers may have achieved for the banks and other claimants. Kidnappers, terrorists and governments that join with them should be put on notice that the United States has no obligation or intention to submit to extortion or to pay ransom in any form, it is argued. **********Critics of the agreements also say that they would prevent the United States from punishing Iran or exacting compensation for the illegal detention and maltreatment of the hostages and the occupation of and damage to the embassy and its contents. **********Enforcement of the agreements might also lead to a kind of deferred ransom for the hostages, some say, by rendering the United States liable to compensate the former hostages and those commercial claimants who cannot obtain just compensation through arbitration. **********Renunciation of the agreements, on the other hand, would free the United States to punish Iran and compensate both commercial claimants and the former hostages by confiscating the $3 billion to $4 billion in Iranian assets still in the United States. **********''To let Iran off not merely scot-free but actually profiting from its obscene conduct would establish an odious and dangerous precedent,'' George W. Ball, a former Under Secretary of State, wrote in The Washington Post. The New Republic editorialized: ''Helping Khomeini get his hands on the Shah's wealth, however ill-gotten it may have been, is rewarding the Ayatollah for seizing our diplomats.'' A Respectable Basis **********A Harvard law professor, Detlev F. Vagts, and other experts on treaty law say that there is a respectable basis in international law for renouncing the accords or for asking the International Court of Justice to declare them void, although Professor Vagts said he would not necessarily advocate such a course as a matter of policy. He cited Article 52 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which provides that treaties are void if ''procured by thethreat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.'' **********Lawyers representing many companies and individuals with commercial claims against Iran are critical of portions of the agreements that they fear would put their claims at risk or underminethem while insuring the banks full repayment of loans that became bad risks long before the hostage crisis. **********Precedent does not resolve constitutional doubts as to the President's power to nullify court orders and terminate lawsuits in order to remove from the country billions of dollars' worth of foreign assets claimed by American citizens and corporations. Lawyers for companies that would apparently be excluded from access to the arbitration tribunal, such as those suing under contracts that provide for Iranian court jurisdiction over all disputes, say they have a particularly strong constitutional argument for continuing their lawsuits against Iran or for exacting compensation from the United States. **********Even some claimants who would clearly have access to arbitration consider it a risky and inadequate substitute for lawsuits. Against Renunciation **********The former Carter Administration officials and others who have argued that the United States must keep its word insist that this is essential to retain the respect and trust of other nations, especially since the accords were negotiated through the good offices of the Algerian leadership. **********Warren M. Christopher, former Deputy Secretary of State, who spent the last days of the hostage crisis in Algiers, said in a television interview with CBS News: ''The word of the United States is a very important commodity, and I want to keep it pure.'' **********Mr. Christopher and others warn that reneging would further antagonize Iran and insult Algeria and would damage the reputation of the United States in other Islamic countries and around the world.  Renunciation could also undermine the more rational elements in the fragmented Iranian leadership, they maintain, and increase the already grave danger of Soviet influence and penetration in the vital oil-producing region. Full Repayment of Bad Loans **********Supporters of the agreements also argue that they insure full repayment of bank loans that had already become bad risks by the time the Shah fell and would leave most or all other American commercial claimants with better chances of obtaining compensation than they would have had if the hostages had not been seized. **********Many of those claimants would have had difficulty obtaining compensation through lawsuits against Iran, according to Lloyd N.  Cutler, who was President Carter's counsel, because of a variety of rules limiting the liability of foreign governments in United States courts. The international arbitation provisions agreed to by Iran, on the other hand, would be free of many of the technical defenses it could raise in the United States, would at least in theory provide full compensation to all claimants that have access to the arbitration panel and would make awards not paid by Iran enforceable against Iranian assets in other countries. **********The former Carter Administration officials say that they were forced to accept Iranian demands that certain classes of claims be excluded from the arbitration agreements, but that they drafted the exclusions so narrowly that they would apply only to claimants who would have had little chance of obtaining compensation in any event. **********Renunciation of the agreements, they say, could also cost the banks the $1.4 billion in Iranian deposits now held in a special fund pending resolution of disagreements. The Outlook **********The tone of the recent statements by President Reagan and Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. suggests that they are inclined to honor the agreements to the extent that they can under United States law and to the extent that Iran honors its obligations. **********Those are important qualifications. It is not clear whether some aspects of the agreements could survive the expected court tests, and Mr. Haig's stress at his news conference Wednesday on the importance of what he termed ''the Iranian regime's post hostage return attitude'' may presage an effort to challenge Iran's willingness to settle claims and to pay arbitration awards before the remaining assets are moved out and before any lawsuits are terminated. **********It is clear that the Reagan Administration does not plan to do any favors for Iran. Mr. Haig said that ''there will be no military equipment provided to Iran'' even though some was bought and paid for before the hostages were taken. He discouraged American businessmen from traveling to Iran to renew trade even though Mr. Carter lifted formal trade sanctions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/01/business/times-names-2-officers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 222, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TIMES NAMES 2 OFFICERS", "print_headline": "TIMES NAMES 2 OFFICERS", "body_text": " **********APPOINT/ Names 2 Officers Lance Primis, advertising director of The New York Times, and John M.

Mr. Reagan had proposed letting business deduct from taxable income the cost of vehicles in three years, most equipment in five years and buildings in 15 years. **********The Democrats proposed to reduce the corporate tax rate in stages from its present 46 percent to 43 percent in 1984 and then down by three percentage points a year to 34 percent in 1987. The lower rates now paid on profits of less than $100,000 would also be reduced, aides said. **********The combination of general corporate rate reduction and first-year write-offs of investments was intended to appeal to the business community. Although Washington business lobbyists have maintained a solid front in support of the Reagan proposal, which originated with big business several years ago, small business and service companies may find the Democratic alternative even more attractive. 'Scatter-Shot Scheme' **********In a statement tonight, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan denounced the Democratic proposal as ''a last-minute, scatter-shot scheme which falls short of addressing the economic needs of the country.'' He said the Administration proposal had the merit of linking tax relief ''to job-creating investments that help modernize American industry.'' **********Mr. Regan's point was that the Democrats would give tax relief through rate reduction to all corporations, whereas the Administration's approach would deliver tax write-offs only to companies that invest in plant and equipment. **********The votes in the Ways and Means Committee late this afternoon were the first of many that must occur in committees and on the House and Senate floors before a 1981 tax-relief bill becomes law. **********Although Mr. Reagan continues to exhort Congress to pass a tax bill by Aug. 1, there is little belief in Congress that this target date can be achieved. A few days ago, Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said he thought the House could complete floor action by the end of July. **********The Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to start drafting a bill of its own tomorrow. It is expected to be much closer to Mr.  Reagan's proposals, including a 25 percent cut in individual taxes over three years, than the Ways and Means bill. A floor fight in the House between the Democratic leadership and the Administration appears certain. **********Mr. Reagan's approach to business tax relief has been criticized as giving benefits almost exclusively to capital-intensive industries, such as oil refining, steel, chemicals and paper, and offering little to labor-intensive and advanced-technology companies. By definition, capital-intensive industries excludes small business. Strategy a Surprise **********The Democratic strategy, developed in the last few days and a surprise to most of the capital, was to offer tax relief to all corporations, regardless of industry, and to dangle before business the attractive possibility of simple, first-year writeoffs for investments in equipment and machinery. **********Representative Sam Gibbons of Florida, the second-ranking Democrat on the committee, said the Democratic plan was intended to cost the Treasury roughly the same revenue as the Administration's approach.  Estimates prepared by the nonpartisan staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation showed the Democratic plan costing a little less than Mr.  Reagan's until the fiscal year 1990, when it would cost $92.2 billion, or $1.5 billion more. **********The senior Administration representative at the committee's session, John E. Chapoton, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy, was cool to the Democratic proposal, arguing that its phase-in feature would make it less an incentive to near-term business investment than the Administration's plan. He noted that the Administration had dropped its original intention to phase in its own tax depreciation plan on the ground that a phase-in may give a company an incentive to delay a new investment to take advantage of more generous write-off terms later. **********In the Ways and Means Committee vote, three of the 23 Democrats voted with the Republicans. They were Kent Hance of Texas, who is a co-sponsor of the Administration tax bill; James R. Jones of Oklahoma, a principal author in 1979-80 of the depreciation approach adopted by the Reagan Administration, and J. J. Pickle of Texas, one of the more conservative Democrats on the panel. **********Mr. Rostenkowski said at the start of today's two-hour-and-20-minute session that he hoped the committee would finish with business tax relief this week and deal with savings incentives and estate and gift taxes next week. With a Congress recess scheduled for the week of June 29, the committee would reach individual tax relief - the most politically contentious facet of the bill - in the week of July 6. **********Mr. Rostenkowski said that the committee was voting only on ''concepts'' today, not on blueprints, and that there would be an opportunity to revise today's decisions. Nevertheless, it appeared that decisions in principle had been taken in the Democratic caucus that preceded the committee meeting and that revisions would be minor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/04/world/three-london-robbers-take-2-million-in-gems-at-cartier.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 185, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Three London Robbers Take $2 Million in Gems at Cartier", "print_headline": "Three London Robbers Take $2 Million in Gems at Cartier", "body_text": " **********Three robbers broke into Cartier today and fled with nearly $2 million in jewels, just missing a $7.52 million shipment in gems that arrived minutes after they escaped, the police said today. **********Leonard Williams of Scotland Yard said that there was ''no doubt'' that the men were waiting for the larger shipment. **********But the thieves could not wait for the Cartier gems, which were on their way back to the store from a society charity exhibition, the police added. **********One of the store's two guards broke away and raised the alarm during the robbery, but the police would not say if that was why the thieves fled. **********Guards on a security truck returning the gems saw the police and a commotion round the store and sped off to their company's headquarters, where the gems were locked up for the night. **********The police said the robbers, armed with a handgun and a sawed-off shotgun, beat up two security guards on duty inside the Cartier showrooms at New Bond Street in London's Mayfair district."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/25/business/altex-oil-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ALTEX OIL reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "ALTEX OIL reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/30/world/us-hostage-is-shot-on-indonesian-jet-at-bangkok-airport.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 709, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. HOSTAGE IS SHOT ON INDONESIAN JET AT BANGKOK AIRPORT", "print_headline": "U.S. HOSTAGE IS SHOT ON INDONESIAN JET AT BANGKOK AIRPORT", "body_text": " **********The hijackers of an Indonesian jetliner shot and wounded an American hostage today as he tried to flee the sweltering plane hours after a British passenger managed to escape.

It must decide whether or not to accept European participation in a Sinai peacekeeping force under terms it finds abhorrent. It must decide whether or not to accept American notions of ''strategic cooperation'' far more limited than those originally sought. And it must decide whether or not to accept American appeals for continued restraint in the face of a Palestinian arms buildup in southern Lebanon. **********If taken literally, the unequivocal statements by the Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin would guarantee rejection on all three questions. But no available option seems free of disadvantages for Israel, and officials are now weighing the choices in search of those that do the least damage. **********In large measure, the issues have been complicated by ultimatums.  In recent months, Mr. Begin and his key advisers have told the Europeans that they can stay home if they base their Sinai participation on anything outside the Camp David accords. They have told the United States it can do without Israeli cooperation if anything short of a comprehensive, broad-based strategic agreement develops. They have warned of military action against Syrian missiles and P.L.O. bases in Lebanon if American diplomacy fails to get results. **********In each case, in Israel's view, the worst possibility has been realized.  The Europeans, in offering troops for Sinai, divided the Camp David agreement in half, endorsing only part of it, and linked their role to the Common Market's 1980 Venice declaration on Palestinian self-determination and P.L.O. legitimacy, an approach vehemently rejected by israel. Stockpiling of Medical Supplies **********In Washington, Pentagon officials have reportedly limited their interest in military cooperation to the stockpiling of medical supplies in Israel, and a few joint maneuvers, far short of the Israeli hopes for extensive stockpiling of heavy weaponry. **********In Lebanon, American diplomacy has come to naught - Syrian missiles are still there after nearly seven months, and the Palestine Liberation Organization is said to be stronger than ever militarily. **********Some of Mr. Begin's credibility is in jeopardy. After making such categorical threats, he risks seeing his demands become nothing but bluffs, with consequences for his Government's standing at home and abroad. **********More durable interests are also at stake. The Sinai force, for example, has turned out to be a double-edged diplomatic sword for Israel. Because the force is is the creation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, it has been rejected by those countries that oppose the pact. It could not be formed under United Nations auspices, as prescribed by the treaty, because the Soviet Union said it would veto the plan in the Securty Council. U.S. Seeks Broad Participation **********Therefore, the Reagan Administration has argued to Israel, Western European participation would broaden international acceptance and legitimacy of the Camp David process. **********The trouble for Israel is that, in announcing their participation, Britain, France, Italy and the Netherlands diluted the significance of Camp David by stating, ''We regard our support for the arrangements associated with the implementation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty as quite distinct from and independent of the rest of the Camp David process.'' **********This meant that they were dissociating themselves from Camp David's other aspect, the provisions for limited Palestinian selfadministration in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********The 10 European Economic Community countries also reaffirmed the Venice declaration, calling for the ''Palestinian people to exercise fully its right to self-determination,'' meaning the establishment of a Palestinian state. They also declared that the ''P.L.O. must be involved in the process leading to a comprehensive peace.'' Israel Balks at European Role **********These words have made the European role difficult for Israel to accept. The Begin Government does not want to weaken the Camp David accords, which it regards as a buffer against a Palestinian state and the legitimization of the P.L.O. **********Officials here are therefore inclined to reject the Europeans, as Mr. Begin was reported to have indicated today to the United States Ambassador, Samuel W. Lewis. A final decision is expected after the Israeli Cabinet meets next Sunday. **********Israel is also distressed by the narrow scope of military cooperation being proposed by Washington. Defense Minister Ariel Sharon is reportedly considering canceling a trip to the United States scheduled for next week to show his displeasure at American reluctance to enter into a broad-based partnership with Israel. Last month, he told a United States delegation to stay home after it had become clear that the Americans wanted to investigate only medical facilities. **********The disagreements extend into the Lebanon situation, where the United States, according to an American official here, has taken the position that the P.L.O. has not violated the cease-fire by deploying additional heavy weapons within range of Israeli settlements. The Begin Government, which agreed to the cease-fire last July on the explicit condition that the Palestinians not use it to enhance and fortify their positions, are anxious to convey a sense of alarm to Washington."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/26/business/telepictures-corp-reports-earnings-for-yr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TELEPICTURES CORP reports earnings for Yr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "TELEPICTURES CORP reports earnings for Yr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/08/business/best-products-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-march-28.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 51, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BEST PRODUCTS CO reports earnings for Qtr to March 28", "print_headline": "BEST PRODUCTS CO reports earnings for Qtr to March 28", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/07/business/tax-saving-seen-key-to-dome-s-bid.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1981-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 815, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TAX SAVING SEEN KEY TO DOME'S BID", "print_headline": "TAX SAVING SEEN KEY TO DOME'S BID", "body_text": " **********An offer by Dome Petroleum Ltd. of Canada to pay $915 million for a minority stake in Conoco Inc. was made, without prior consultation with Conoco, as a way to avoid payment of capital gains taxes, insiders said yesterday. **********Dome's unusual approach would enable the Canadian oil company to swap the 14 million Conoco shares it wants to buy, at $65 a share, for Conoco's 53 percent block in the Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Company. It was devised to get around a tax problem that would arise for Conoco in the exchange for the shares of Hudson's Bay, headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. **********The Dome proposal grew out of a problem that developed last year after Esmark Inc. sold its Vickers oil properties to the Mobil Oil Corporation. In that case, Mobil first agreed to pay Esmark $715 million for Vickers and then bought $715 million worth of Esmark stock to pay for Vickers. That ostensibly made the transaction taxfree for Esmark. **********Some tax lawyers said privately that the Internal Revenue Service was expected to attack the Esmark-Mobil approach and that, if it did, it would probably win. **********''It might take 10 years to find out who's right, and in the meantime Esmark has the use of the funds that it might otherwise have to pay in taxes,'' one Wall Street insider said. **********The tax that Esmark might have to pay is estimated at roughly $100 million or more, while the tax impact on Conoco in the Hudson's Bay deal could be more than twice that amount. **********As explained by insiders close to the transaction, the I.R.S.  takes the position that a tax-free deal in such a proposal is possible only when the buyer is a stockholder. But Mobil, these sources said, did not become a stockholder of Esmark until after it had reached agreement with Esmark about the price it would pay for Vickers. **********Dome, on the other hand, will take the position that its plan to swap the Conoco block for Hudson's Bay is tax-free because it will be a Conoco stockholder when, and if, it makes the swap. **********Early yesterday, Conoco declined comment on the Dome tender offer, saying it had not seen the documents. By late in the day, a spokesman said Conoco had subsequently obtained a copy of the Dome proposal and that it was arranging a directors' meeting for ''next week sometime'' to prepare a response. **********Although Conoco sources maintained that the Canadian bid had come as a complete surprise, sources close to both companies contended that top executives of the two oil concerns had discussed the possible sale of Hudson's Bay, particularly in light of Canada's growing efforts to bring Canadian oil companies under domestic ownership. May Seek More Conoco Stock **********As proposed by Dome, the Canadian company's tender offer, which began yesterday and runs through June 3, would establish Dome's standing - for tax purposes - as a stockholder of Conoco, with a 13 percent holding. However, in what was described by insiders as ''protection if Conoco says no,'' Dome's offer provides for an eventual purchase of 22 million Conoco shares, or 20 percent, a deal that would cost Dome more than $1.4 million in cash. **********More importantly, it would enable Dome to add 20 percent of Conoco's profits to its own, something it could not do under current accounting procedures with less Conoco stock. **********Wall Street investment bankers, meanwhile, speculated that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the American Stock Exchange, where Hudson's Bay stock is traded, would almost certainly start investigating the heavy trading that took place in that stock in advance of the Dome offer announced Tuesday. **********''The buyers had the wrong facts but the right stock,'' one Wall Street professional said yesterday. Heavy Trading in Hudson's Bay **********Trading in Conoco on Tuesday, prior to the Dome offer, showed no unusual movement, but Hudson's Bay stock jumped $3.325 points in heavy trading on the Amex, to $23. By yesterday's close, Conoco had jumped $6.625, to $56.50, on a volume of about 1.5 million shares.  Hudson's Bay did not trade here yesterday. A Hudson's Bay spokesman had said early Tuesday that it had no explanation for the price rise in its stock. **********The company was formed in 1926 by Conoco and the Hudson's Bay Company, with Conoco getting 75 percent. This stake has fallen to 53 percent, worth about $925 million, through sales to stockholders and acquisitions using stock. Hudson's Bay owns 21 percent; the rest is publicly held. **********Dome's proposal, stressing that it was not to get control of Conoco but ''to enable Dome to negotiate with Conoco'' on the stock swap, was pictured as ''consistent with the aims of'' Canada's energy program."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/22/world/typhoon-nears-hong-kong.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 28, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Typhoon Nears Hong Kong", "print_headline": "Typhoon Nears Hong Kong", "body_text": " **********A typhoon moved toward Hong Kong and the southern Chinese coast today, threatening the region with gale force winds, drenching rains and flooding."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/02/world/for-party-leader-from-siberia-career-is-an-alien-notion.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Austin", "pub_date": "1981-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 861, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOR PARTY LEADER FROM SIBERIA, 'CAREER IS AN ALIEN NOTION", "print_headline": "FOR PARTY LEADER FROM SIBERIA, 'CAREER IS AN ALIEN NOTION", "body_text": " **********Among the delegates to the 26th Communist Party Congress here, a special bustle surrounds the men in their 40's and 50's who have made their way to key positions in industry, agriculture and the party apparatus. It is they who constitute the talent pool from which the next generation of Kremlin leaders will most likely emerge. **********One such man is Pavel S. Fedirko, first secretary of the party committee for Krasnoyarsk Territory in eastern Siberia, 2,500 miles from Moscow. It is a fast-developing industrial and agricultural area sprawling over 928,000 square miles from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the fertile steppes in the south. **********In a political system that concentrates ultimate power in the party and subordinates all economic, social and governmental institutions to the party's will, Mr. Fedirko is in effect the region's boss. He and his committee in Krasnoyarsk, the territory's principal city, are deeply involved in all local decision-making to see to it that Moscow's policies and plans are carried out. Politicking in Corridors **********The other day, between the formal speeches at the party congress and the informal politicking in the corridors and lobbies, Mr.  Fedirko consented to sit down with a Western reporter and talk about himself. **********At 48, he is a powerfully built man -more than six feet tall, beginning to spread around the midriff, and with a puffiness about the face that suggests long working hours, irregular meals and too little exercise. He is soft-spoken. His manner is attentive and responsive; he seems quick to catch the essence of a question and impatient to dispose of it and proceed to the next one. **********''I get up early in the morning to be in the office by half past eight,'' Mr. Fedirko said. ''I try to get away by 9:30 in the evening, but sometimes I can't manage it until 10 or 11. On Saturdays I can usually leave by 8:30 P.M.; Sundays are supposed to be free, but half the time there's work to be done.'' **********Mr. Fedirko appears to have been working these grueling hours most of his life, from the time he graduated from engineering school in Rostov, in European Russia, at the age of 22 and went to work in a metallurgical plant in Norilsk, in Krasnoyarsk Territory above the Arctic Circle. His wife and infant daughter accompanied him to that harsh terrain. Rise Through Party Ranks **********Mr. Fedirko specialized in nonferrous metallurgy, but to the party committee in the plant his leadership qualities must have seemed better fitted for political responsibilities, for three years later, in 1957, he was elected to party membership and his rise began. By 1970 he was first secretary of the city committee of Krasnoyarsk and by 1972 he headed the party organization for the entire territory. **********How, he was asked, is a party career made? Do young men rise through association with a superior who makes it to the top?  ''We don't use the word 'career' or even think it,'' Mr. Fedirko replied. ''That connotes something individual. But if you mean 'How do people advance in their work?' we watch people constantly, and when we see someone who is especially conscientious and talented, we pick him for promotion or a more important assignment. It's a collective decision.'' **********Mr. Fedirko said his first marriage ended in divorce years ago, and the daughter who was taken to Siberia as an infant is now married.  His second wife, Lidiya, teaches at an institute and has a heavy work schedule of her own, ''so it works out all right.'' They have a 12-year-old son, Viktor. Trips 'All Over Soviet Union **********''What we do is take a month's vacation together every year,'' he said. ''I try to put it to good use by going to places where I can learn more about the world. We have been all over the Soviet Union, and also in Italy, Cuba and the German Democratic Republic.'' **********Asked about his special interests, Mr. Fedirko spoke of Krasnoyarsk Territory - its coal, nonferrous metal, lumbering and other industries, its rich mineral deposits, the giant hydroelectric station, and plans for an even more powerful station. **********''We must improve living conditions so we can continue to attract people into our area in sufficient numbers to carry out our industrial development plans,'' he said. **********''The problem is not becoming any easier, because the manpower situation is getting tighter all over the country. We must solve it by creating both social and professional advantages, so people will know that they have wide perspectives, interesting work, a chance to do something new and important. **********''We have not done badly so far. We have learned to build better housing. The region was a backward province, a place of exile, in czarist times. Krasnoyarsk is a beautiful city now.'' **********An aide to Mr. Fedirko came up and said, ''It's time.'' Mr. Fedirko, explaining that he was late for an appointment, said goodbye and added: ''Visit us in Siberia.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/16/world/for-the-caribbean-a-new-approach-to-assistance.html": {"writer_name": "Jo Thomas", "pub_date": "1981-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 848, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOR THE CARIBBEAN, A NEW APPROACH TO ASSISTANCE", "print_headline": "FOR THE CARIBBEAN, A NEW APPROACH TO ASSISTANCE", "body_text": " **********The islands and countries of the Caribbean Sea, from the Bahamas 1,500 miles south to Venezuela and from Belize 2,000 miles east to Barbados, share the memories of empire but now speak only the common language of poverty and desperate, largely unfulfilled longings. **********Last weekend, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. met in the Bahamas with the Foreign Ministers of three other nations that are among the richest in the hemisphere - Mexico, Venezuela, and Canada - and agreed that something had to be done to help the region. **********In a joint press conference afterward, the four said they would set up working groups to consult with governments seeking assistance.  Then Mr. Haig will meet with Foreign Ministers Mark MacGuigan of Canada, Jose Alberto Zambrano of Venezuela and Jorge Castaneda of Mexico before the end of the year. **********There were no other promises, no price tag on the possible cost of this undertaking and no speculation on how it might be financed. The Causes of the Problems **********The problems of the 52 million people in the region have been multiplied by skyrocketing oil prices but are rooted, according to many economic analysts, in unequal terms of trade: the cheap sale of their agricultural products and natural resources and the expensive purchase of food, manufactured products, petroleum and technology. **********Meanwhile, their populations and unemployment soar, their cities attract rings of slums and land is wasted. Education, housing, sanitation and medical care range from inadequate to miserable.  People with talent, skills and ambition often leave. **********''So far from God, so close to the United States,'' they say in the Dominican Republic in an expression of the love-hate feeling of admiration and resentment that one finds in many countries of the region. **********Past United States administrations have analyzed the region's problems and announced their intention to do something, but inevitably their attention has been detoured elsewhere unless a crisis arose. What's Already Being Done **********''Our attention span is too short,'' said a member of the group accompanying Mr. Haig last weekend.  Nonetheless, United States economic involvement in the region is significant: $350 million a year in foreign aid, according to the State Department, and investments of $20 billion to $25 billion, according to the Department of Commerce. Annual exports to the region, including Mexico, are $22.7 billion and imports from it are $25.9 billion. **********The other countries at last Saturday's talks also have been helping the region: Canada has announced it will double its annual foreign aid to $100 million, and Mexico and Venezuela each gave $350 million in aid last year. **********Part of the reason for the failure of past aid programs in the region, as Prime Minister J.M.G. Adams of Barbados said during a visit to the United States last fall, has been been the perception that they are anti-Communist measures and nothing more. **********The United States emphasis on private investment, he said, has also been criticized as a form of economic imperialism and an excuse to ignore the need for development assistance to the less profitable projects. Differences Are Accepted **********The United States, Mexico, Canada and Venezuela still have different opinions about the role of private capital in economic and social development plans. **********A senior State Department official at last weekend's conference said the term mini-Marshall Plan ''is not apt either in its implications of an exclusive emphasis on foreign aid or in its unilateral, made-in-Washington sense'' for what the Reagan Administration now has in mind. **********William E. Brock, the United States trade representative, said he hoped other industrialized nations such as Japan and Germany could be persuaded to join in trying to ''weave together aid, trade and investment.'' **********Foreign Minister Castaneda, on the other hand, said Mexico, with fewer potential private investors, would place less emphasis on the private sector. **********The four nations also have different opinions about aid to Cuba, Grenada and Nicaragua and about military aid to El Salvador. In a communique after their meeting, they agreed that ''there are signifiant advantages to an economic and social development approach without military considerations or political preconditions.'' Mexico's Conditions **********This statement, Mr. Castaneda said, reflected three conditions set out by Mexico before the conference: that there be no military component, that no country be automatically excluded from participation and that the conference not become a political platform for an anti-Communist campaign. **********In this framework, assistance could go to Cuba, although the United States would not be obigated to participate. ''We are giving no red lights,'' Mr. Haig said, ''and we are giving no green lights.'' **********''The fact they would agree to ignore their differences is significant,'' said a high-ranking member of the Canadian delegation.

There are lines for almost everything in Poland. Lines at kiosks for newspapers in the morning become lines for cigarettes later in the day. There are lines for bread, lines for vodka, lines for plane tickets, linoleum and detergents. Lately, lines for gasoline have meant waits of one to two hours. **********But meat in Poland is politics, so the meat lines are the ones that worry the authorities the most. A sudden rise in meat prices last July was one of the things that touched off labor disturbances that culminated in the emergence of the independent union Solidarity. **********According to Solidarity, the Mayor of Lodz, the second largest city in Poland, has been bombarding Warsaw with telegrams demanding more meat supplies. Next week, Solidarity plans to stage ''antihunger'' marches in Lodz, including one by women. **********Another protest march will be conducted in Kutno, a railroad junction town west of Warsaw, where the meat made available is said to have fallen about 30 percent short of the specified ration. Truck's Arrival Produces a Line **********Warsaw is still relatively privileged. But this morning a line developed quickly at Meat and Sausage, a state store on Pulawska Street, soon after the arrival of a meat delivery truck. ''Now we'll see what they're bringing,'' said a women in a checked dress, clutching a shopping bag. **********''I was driving along and I saw the truck so I stopped,'' remarked a tall man, one of the few males in the line. ''All of us Poles have been turned into hunters. I spend my life in lines now - sometimes eight hours a day. You know, today is supposed to be a holiday for me.'' **********The air of expectancy collapsed when a box of chickens was dumped onto the empty display case. Chicken supplied to Poland's state stores, the housewives remarked, is usually of low quality. Buy Whatever Is Available **********Even so, no one quit the line. The rule is to buy whatever is available, even if the shopper doesn't need it. It can always be exchanged for something else. The tall man, who said he was an economist, chatted as the line inched forward. As it was, he said, he could not find enough meat to fill his monthly ration for his pregnant wife, his 11-year-old son and himself. **********''This new ration is going to be impossible,'' he added. ''But the worst thing is not the ration. When you stand in line like this you expect to get something at the end. But. ...'' He made a despairing wave toward the chickens. **********Warming to larger themes, the man explained that since the special Communist Party congress this month, Poles had a new confidence in the Government and hoped the food situation might improve. **********By the time the man neared the head of the line, a half hour had passed. A woman said brightly: ''It's the first time they've brought chicken in a month. Maybe it will be good chicken.'' **********A look of panic suddenly seized the man. He fumbled with his ration tickets, and looked as if he might weep.

Three years later, the Second International proclaimed May Day as International Workers' Day. **********Since then, May Day has become a primary holiday in every Communist-ruled country. In the Soviet Union it has evolved into a national festivity second only to the Nov. 7 celebration of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Flags, Bouquets and Balloons **********And so today on Red Square, in cool weather under a clear sky, thousands of young athletes in flawless ranks cheered and waved red flags in unison. Girls with large bows in their hair trotted up the mausoleum steps to hand bouquets to the Soviet leaders.

The Spontaneity Is Gone **********May Day, like so many official Soviet holidays and public events, has become increasingly standardized and ritualized in postwar years. In a reflection of a society whose rulers firmly adhere to the policy that all power and direction must come from the center, most manifestations of spontaneity have been carefully deleted from mass celebrations. **********Access to Red Square was by printed invitation only, and the center of the city was sealed off to traffic. Cordons of policemen and security officials checked documents on all streets to the center. **********Along the marchers' routes and in Red Square, organizers with walkie-talkies kept the demonstrators moving in brisk and orderly fashion. For anyone lacking proper accreditation, the only recourse was to watch the marchers assemble outside the center or to stay home and watch the parade on television. **********It was not always so. Older Muscovites nostalgically recall May Day 1946, after the German invaders had been repelled and defeated, when Muscovites flooded freely across Red Square for more than seven hours. Shifting Fates of Leaders **********The Red Square parades have also lost most of their excitement for Kremlinologists since the days when Western observers tried to assess the shifting fates of Soviet leaders by their varying positions atop the mausoleum. **********Today, the fact that Mr. Brezhnev, the party's General Secretary, stood between Prime Minister Nikolai A. Tikhonov and Defense Minister Dmitri F. Ustinov was of little consequence. **********Western reporters shifted their attention to the diplomatic stand next to the Lenin Mausoleum to determine which Western ambassadors would adhere to the boycott of Red Square parades started last year after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. Ten heads of embassy stayed away, including the United States charge d'affaires, Jack F.  Matlock Jr. Last year, 16 stayed away. **********There was also the annual attention to placards carried by demonstrators for clues to political emphasis. Among those noted were placards proclaiming ''No to the Aggressive Nuclear Strategy of the United States!'' and ''No to Medium-Range Nuclear Missiles in Europe!'' **********To most of those chosen to march in the parade it all seemed to be great fun.

A frequent sight at the airports and railroad stations here, like elsewhere in Siberia, are the tramps known as bichi. The name derives from ''beachcomber,'' but the popular explanation is that it comes from the Russian initials for ''former intelligent person.'' **********'Nobody Asks Where You're From' **********Valentin Rasputin, the popular Siberian writer, described bichi as heavy drinkers, vagabonds who fled from the law, from grief, from alimony, or in search of freedom. ''People always ran here seeking freedom and escape,'' he said. ''In the taiga, nobody asks where you're from.'' **********The taiga is that great stretch of forest and swamp across the Eurasian continent, that despite the rapid advance of civilization remains a wilderness where only two years ago newspapers reported that geologists stumbled across a tattered family of Old Believers - sectarians persecuted at every stage of Russian history - whose progenitor had fled into the bush during the civil war. The aged patriarch, his two ragged sons and two daughters had subsisted on the fruits of the forest and what they could scratch from the soil for more than 50 years. **********A touch of the past died in Irkutsk on Nov. 29, when the authorities ordered the legendary barakholka, or clothing flea market, shut. ''We closed it because it fired speculative passions,'' the deputy chief of the regional Communist Party organization, Leonid G. Pinko, said. **********On the last day, only about 50 peddlers remained in the acre of outdoor stalls on the outskirts of Irkutsk. But their wares suggested what Mr. Pinko meant: here were precious furs, including sable marked with Government stamps, thick homemade fur boots, imported shoes and sweaters, salves, jewelry and every variety of clothing, homemade or state-supplied, despite a well-worn board warning that only used clothing could be sold. A Lithuanian Woman's Diatribe **********An old Lithuanian woman, asked why the place was being dismantled, broke into a distinctly subversive stream of invective. ''Just ask yourself who benefits from this,'' she said. ''They want only the Government to get all the sales. Back in Lithuania when I was growing up it was all private shops and you could buy anything you want. Now you even have to sell the berries and nuts you gather to the Government.'' **********Rationing, known as the coupon system, went into effect in Irkutsk and some other Siberian cities in May after years of deteriorating supplies. Coupons issued by the housing authorities entitle each resident to 2.2 pounds of meat and two-third of a pound of butter each month. **********The system caused some grumbling at first. But it also simplified life for working people who could never get to the store until late in the day, by which time old women had stripped the stores bare. **********In food shops along Karl Marx Street, the main avenue, the food and butter counters were the only ones without lines, and the products lay repackaged in the authorized amounts. In restaurants and cafes, meat seemed plentiful and unrationed. A Contrast With Moscow **********The scene contrasted with that in shops in Moscow, where the arrival of meat or butter spawns instant lines. The contrast extended to the official approach to the problem - in Moscow, officials rarely acknowledge any shortages, no matter how obvious.  Here, Mr. Pinko met the problem head-on: ''Yes, we're on a coupon system because we don't produce enough meat and milk. Local farms supply only 60 percent of the meat we need, and 80 percent of our milk, and we don't get enough from outside.'' **********Such candor is frequently encountered across Siberia, and Mr. Pinko said it remained an integral component of the Siberian character.  ''European traits are slow in reaching us,'' he said, showing obvious distaste for whatever weaknesses he found in his Western cousins. His own grandfather, Mr. Pinko said, was a political exile under the czars, and a true Sibiryak was a man unafraid of hardships, persistent, taciturn and honest. **********Siberia is a big land, and tales told here are correspondingly tall. There's the hunter who developed appendicitis and operated on himself, using deer gut for sutures. Or the builders of the Bratsk dam whose heads froze to their pillows at night and whose eyes bled from mosquito attacks. Or the year that berries grew badly and bears turned to eating meat, devouring 15 or 20 people in the process. **********The latter tale was told by no ordinary hunter - Nikolai S.  Sveridov has been an instructor in the lore of the hunt for almost 30 years at Irkutsk's Institute of Game Management, combining work with the pleasure of expeditions for deer, moose or bear. Repositories of Legend **********Though properly collectivized and duly assigned five-year plans by the Soviet authorities, hunting and trapping remain staunch repositories of the romance and legend of siberia. It doesn't take much to get the Sibiryak to talk about his dog, his game and the lure of the taiga. **********The serious hunting these days - for sable and other fur-bearing beasts - is left to professionals who spend weeks tracking and trapping the precious predators. But there's hardly a bureaucrat in Irkutsk who in early winter can resist donning his heavy fur boots, collecting his ax, kettle, skis, gun and dog, and heading into the taiga. **********The ax is the main tool, Mr. Sveridov said. Only that and dry matches will get you through a Siberian night in the open. He recalled one time when he spent a week in the bush. The main thing is to leave enough time to build a nodya, a Siberian bonfire made by putting one log atop another in such a way that the crack between smolders all night. The hunter sleeps beside it - ''only if it's cold, like today, you sleep a little less,'' said Mr. Sveridov. It was 25 degrees below zero outside. **********The hunters turn in their pelts at regional collecting depots, and from there they come to the Irkutsk fur center, the biggest of seven such warehouses in the Soviet Union. **********Siberia's premier pelt is, of course, the sable, whose fur ringed the medieval crown of Muscovite grand princes, and whose pelts were carried by early Russian ambassadors to Europe instead of money and gifts.

As Mr. Kamm sees it, that desire has influenced the thinking of industrial robot designers and users alike, with the result that industrialists are investing heavily in unnecessarily complicated and expensive robots. **********''Management has been snowed,'' he said. ''Companies like Unimation and Cincinnati Milacron have mistakenly tried to emulate the human arm,'' he added, referring to the two leading manufacturers in the rapidly expanding industry, which last year topped $100 million in sales. **********Mr. Kamm said that such ''arms,'' which typically are tubespangled, multi-jointed appendages that twist about on a solid base, are not needed to fulfill the tasks robots are assigned, from materials handling to welding and painting. Those jobs can be done more accurately and inexpensively by combining small devices that move in straight or circular motions, and placing them on metal mounts that run over the work station, he said. **********He likened the approach to building an erector set. Mobot describes these amalgamations as ''modular robots.'' In addition to being less expensive to start with, they also are easier for workers to understand and straightforward enough for the user's own engineers to perform most maintenance, he said. **********Although the robot business has been flooded with new entrants in recent months, Fibro Gmbh., a West German firm, is the only competitor that builds a wide variety of units out of standard modules, according to Mr. Kamm. But the Versatran line of Prab Conveyors Inc., the third largest American robot producer, also relies on motion modules to a lesser extent and RCA has reported that a picture tube plant in Finland was built around a modular robot line designed by Rosenlew Tool Works, a Finnish company. **********The key difference between modular robots and the standard robots marketed by the companies currently dominating the industry is that the latter are intended to be multi-functional. A painting robot, for example, is made so that it can be converted into a welder. **********''That's a total waste,'' Mr. Kamm asserted. ''Robot purchasers buy a unit on its ability to economically perform a given task. They never switch it and, in fact, it is complicated and expensive to do so.'' **********Analysts who follow the robot industry regard Mobot's approach politely but skeptically. They say that versatility is important for machines that may someday be integrated into fully-automated, computer-controlled manufacturing. And they point out that Mobot units have yet to prove themselves on complicated tasks. **********''So far, all they have really done is pick-and-place machines,'' said Jean Fine, an analyst at Gruntal & Company, referring to devices that move materials on and off assembly lines or in and out of other machines. **********Pick-and-place machines cannot paint, weld, or otherwise process pieces. Many experts do not think of such devices as robots.''We don't have the capital yet to offer the special electronics needed to control processing jobs,'' Mr. Kamm conceded. But, he said, there is no technical barrier to equipping modular robots with electronic controls that allow them to compete favorably with the''anthropomorphic'' robots that do such work. One Mobot customer has made a Mobot-built skeleton into a robot painter, he said. **********Mobot's desire to develop its own electronic controls for its modular robots is one reason the company is planning a second stock sale this autumn, just a year after it changed its name from Modular Machine Company and first went public. However, the first priority for the $4 million to $5 million Mobot hopes to raise with the sale is expansion of its marketing efforts. **********Marketing, especially sales support, has been crucial to the success of the leading robot companies. ''One big difference between a company like Unimation and someone like Mobot is that Unimation can provide you with all kinds of consulting services and mock-ups,'' said a robotics expert on the technical staff of one of the nation's largest consumer products manufacturers. ''If you wind up investing a lot of your own staff and engineering time, a modular robot might be no bargain.'' **********Robots cost anywhere from $5,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Although Mr. Kamm says that Mobot's machines, which can rest on a tabletop or be more than 30 feet long, perform the work of competing robots that cost one-third more, sales have not come easily. **********Sales rose to more than $909,000 for the year ending March 31, 1981, compared to $251,000 for the year earlier. But the growth rate slowed considerably during the first quarter of the current fiscal year, when sales totaled $255,000, compared to $206,000 in the yearearlier quarter. **********The company's efforts to rapidly expand its production capability and marketing efforts have also hurt the bottom line. Neither Mobot or its predecessor, founded by Mr. Kamm in 1973, has ever recorded a profit for the year. Losses in the last fiscal year were almost $168,000. And losses in the recently completed quarter were $169,000. **********Robotics experts at such consulting firms as Booz-Allen & Hamilton, Inc., and stock analysts doubt that modular robots will supplant the more sophisticated models marketed by the leading companies. They also dismiss Mr. Kamm's assertion that experienced machine tool makers like Cincinnati Milacron are suffering from a Pygmalion complex. But that does not mean they are discounting Mobot's prospects of finding a profitable niche in the materials handling end of the robot business. **********''The Japanese have proven that there is a market for less sophisticated robots,'' said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins, referring to widespread use in Japan of pick-and-place devices. 'In an industry that's evolving, there's room for a variety of concepts and several levels of sophistication.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/29/world/west-germany-implicates-2-in-attack-on-us-commander.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "West Germany Implicates 2 In Attack on U.S. Commander", "print_headline": "West Germany Implicates 2 In Attack on U.S. Commander", "body_text": " **********The police have found fingerprints of two of West Germany's most wanted terrorist suspects during investigations into a grenade and gun attack on the commander of the United States Army in Europe, the federal prosecutor's office said today. **********A spokesman said forensic tests also showed that a submachine gun fired in the attack was one of the weapons used to kill the driver and three bodyguards of Hanns-Martin Schleyer, a leading industrialist abducted four years ago and later murdered. **********The two suspects were identified as Christian Klar, 29 years old, and Brigitte Mohnhaupt, 32, both of whom are thought to be among the approximately 20 hard-core members of the extremist Red Army Faction who are at large. **********The left-wing group claimed responsibility for the Sept. 15 attempt on the life of Gen.

Its indictment contains the following elements: managers are obsessed with short-term profits, ignoring long-range investments; the entrepreneurial spirit seems scarce among executives; top positions are often filled with financial types, who have little hands-on experience with the businesses they oversee; managers have not focused enough on overseas markets, and business schools are a seedbed for these deficiencies. **********The General Electric Company is often held up as an example of a corporation that has avoided these shortcomings. Its chairman, Reginald H. Jones, 63 years old, will retire on April 1, in keeping with the tradition at G.E. of making way for the next generation.  Recently Mr. Jones was questioned about the state of the art of management in America. **********Q. Is the indictment against American management justified? A. I think that in many cases it is. It is something that should be taken very seriously. **********Q. People say corporations are less entrepreneurial than in the past. Do you agree? A. There's an element of truth in that. But the ability to take risk is partly a function of expected returns.  Today, the real return on investment for industry is about 3 percent, which makes it very difficult to take the risks of our forebears. **********Q. Aren't corporate managers largely responsible for the poor performance - paying now for their failure to make longer-term investments? A. Unquestionably there's some of that. But you've got to bear in mind that during the 1960's and 1970's, the corporation had much wider responsibilites forced upon it. Beyond economic requirements, costly social and environmental demands have been placed on corporations. At the same time international competition has increased tremendously. **********Q. What evidence is there that managers are overly concerned with short-term profitability? A. I think that the most damning thing is that nearly two-thirds of the inventory of U.S. industry is still accounted for on a FIFO (first-in, first out) basis, which increases both reported earnings and tax payments. The reason for that is the unwillingness of management to face up to the lower reported earnings that would result under LIFO (last-in, first-out) - perhaps because most top executive contracts are tied to reported earnings.  For G.E., the net effect of LIFO is roughly $1 billion that is not taxed and can be used for internal investment. **********Q. American management has been called too parochial. Does that appears to be changing? A. Yes. And Washington seems to have finally recognized the need for more international trade. There hasn't been a piece of legislation in the past 20 months that has been a disincentive to exports. That certainly was not the case in the previous 17 years. **********Q. Doesn't the increasingly global nature of business force managements to take a longer-term perspective? It seems the consensus that we've entered an era of protracted battles for survival in global markets. Strategic planning was supposed to provide the blueprint for that competition. Yet many companies give it lipservice for a few days and then forget it in the heat of day-to-day problems. A. More and more, strategic planning is no longer just a buzz phrase or paperwork exercise. At G.E., we entered the 1970's getting 80 percent of our earnings from electrical equipment. By 1979, that was down to 47 percent. If you take this longer-term strategic approach, it will get you more capital investment, increased productivity and take you out of dying industries and into ones that are growing. **********Q. Business schools have been the target of a good deal of criticism lately. Is it warranted? A. I think the top business schools do a good job. But they could do better at teaching communication skills. And if the schools could concentrate on a little instruction in humility it would be helpful. You just don't come fresh out of business school ready to run a large corporation.

That operation involved missiles fired from Vandenburg Air Force Base in California, some 5,000 miles to the east, which are then shot down by other missiles fired from a billion-dollar installation on Kwajalein, the main island in the atoll. **********Earlier Arrangement Superseded **********The 1979 agreement superseded a 1964 arrangement under which the Marshallese received from the United States Government a one-time payment of $750,000, or $1,000 an acre, for rights to use the land for 100 years dating from 1944. In that year, American forces seized Kwajalein from the Japanese in an amphibious attack. **********The 1979 agreement expires at the end of next month. The Kwajalein Atoll Corporation notified the Marshallese authorities in June that its members would refuse to permit use of their land by the United States after Sept. 30 unless they received satisfactory assurances of ''full and fair compensation'' for such use between 1944 and 1979. **********In principle, Mr. Kabua said, the landowners want to extend the terms of the 1979 agreement backward to 1944, a formula that would cost the United States $177 million if accepted by Congress, which would have to appropriate the money. However, there are indications that the islanders might scale down their demands sharply in actual negotiations. **********Meanwhile, American attorneys for the Kwajalein landowners, who number about 5,500, have a suit pending in the High Court of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, which includes the Marshalls, seeking to nullify all agreements made between the United States and the Kwajalein people before the 1979 arrangement to pay $6 million annually. Islands Self-Governing Since '79 **********The Marshall Islands and several other groups in the trust territory became self-governing in internal affairs in 1979. The islands, known collectively as Micronesia, were taken from Japan by United States forces as a result of World War II. They were made a United Nations trusteeship, with the United States as the administering power, in 1947. **********The Reagan Administration is reviewing a series of tentative agreements with the Marshalls, the Palau group and a new entity called the Federated States of Micronesia, comprising Yap, Truk, Ponape and Kosrae, that would make these entities independent states upon termination of the trusteeship, with the proviso that the United States retain military rights in the area. A fourth chain, the Northern Mariana Islands, has voted to become a commonwealth of the United States. **********The reoccupation of the Kwajalein islands that had been surrendered for the missile project was prompted, Mr. Kabua said, by the needs of numerous families that plan to send younger members to Hawaii to resume their schooling in coming weeks. **********Prompt payment of the $2.4 million now due to the displaced islanders would no doubt end the present protest campaign, Mr. Kabua said, but not the campaign for compensation for the use of the lands from 1944 to 1979."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/07/business/fiat-plans-major-layoffs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fiat Plans Major Layoffs", "print_headline": "Fiat Plans Major Layoffs", "body_text": " **********Fiat, Italy's largest private employer, announced it would lay off 70,000 workers for one to two weeks in October because of declining auto exports. **********The decision, announced Friday, had been expected.

That problem, all but ignored for several decades, is how to build a blimp. **********The goal of the meeting was to make sure that all potential prime contractors for the Coast Guard program, which is to design a blimp with wide-ranging patrol, surveillance and rescue capabilities and then build and test a scaled-down model by 1985, have the information they need to get their bids in by Nov. 17. **********Already the blimps have bureaucratic abbreviations comprehensible only to the initiated - MPA (Maritime Patrol Airship for the fullscale system) and PAD (Patrol Airship Demonstrator for the scaleddown version, which will be almost the size of the blimps Goodyear uses for publicity). **********The Coast Guard's project is one of the most tangible indications yet that descendants of the huge, energy-efficient airships of yesteryear may indeed take to the skies by 1990. This year the service is spending only $1 million on the notion, but that amount will rise dramatically as the project progresses. Earlier reports have estimated that the service will have to pay $25 million to $46 million a blimp. **********The Navy, which is administering the Coast Guard project, is also spending millions, along with the Department of Transportation and the United States Forest Service, on another project that will study the feasibility of joining helicopters to a blimp so that timber, and presumably other heavy loads, can be transported to and from wilderness areas. **********The Piasecki Aircraft Corporation, a Philadelphia-based specialty helicopter firm, has a $10.7 million contract to deliver by next May a demonstrator model built largely with Navy-furnished materials. **********And in Britain, Airship Industries is reported to have tentative orders for a new blimp, the first model of which flew briefly last year before being destroyed on the ground during an unexpected storm. **********''The people who attend the technical conferences are not the 'flakes' any more,'' said Dale Williams, chairman of the technical committee on lighter-than-air craft of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. **********An airship renaissance has been predicted by a devout band of lighter-than-air vessel supporters ever since the Navy phased out its last airships in 1962. At least pa rt of the reason for the airship's exile wa s a series of spectacular accidents during the 1930's in which famous dirigiblessuch as the Hindenburg and the Akron were lost. These airs hips had rigid metal skeletons and were many times larger than toda y's blimps,but their demise left a lasting - and experts say unfair - impressionon the public that airships were unusually hazardous. Toda y, Goodyear's fleet of four blimps and a similar ship in West Germany make up the world's airship population. **********Mindful of this, comments here about the significance of the Coast Guard's program were cautious. ''This is a good sign,'' said one of the four Goodyear executives attending the meeting, ''but it is still too soon to announce the rebirth. It is not clear anyone can make money producing them.'' Privately, officials at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and other companies that have maintained an interest in blimps are more confident that the forces pointing toward a comeback are strengthening. Need for Wider Surveillance **********In the Coast Guard's case, vastly expanded surveillance and rescue requirements have resulted from the expansion of the nation's fishing boundary to 200 miles, increased concern with problems such as drug smuggling and offshore oil development from Alaska to the Atlantic. **********Airships can cruise for days on end, move at low speeds, hover near the water and in general operate in a wide range of weather with small crews and low energy consumption. **********In assessing the market for coastal patrol airships, executives that the Navy used 150 of them during World War II and that nations around the world are claiming expanded coastal jurisdictions. An even larger market may exist for the airships linked to helicopters, known as hybrid vertical lift systems.

The Heli-Stat, as the craft has been dubbed, is over five stories tall and more than six times as long. **********A study for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1976 forsaw a long-range market of 1,000 vertical lift airships in logging alone. **********Foreign interest extends well beyond Canada.

Driving his own car - it was, he kept saying, a private trip - he studiously ignored the shattered passenger terminal where, the day before, separatists had exploded a 12-pound time bomb in a baggage locker. **********The bombing was the 15th case of violence in Guadeloupe, an overseas department, or state, of France, in nine months, all claimed by a group calling itself the Guadeloupe Liberation Army.

The separatist group claimed responsibility and said it was opening a ''campaign of harassment'' against ''French colonialism'' and warned all French living on the seven islands in the Caribbean to ''pack their bags and leave before Dec. 31, 1980.''

The Vietnamese killed French colonialism, the Algerians dug its grave and the Guadeloupians will bury it.'' **********The unrest on Guadeloupe is particularly annoying to the French because they have long prided themselves on the attention they have paid to their three Caribbean departments, Guadeloupe, Martinique and French Guiana. The French say that these possessions, along with Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, are not colonies but departments, which means they are as much a part of France as Normandy or the Cote d'Azur. To the French, the relationship is the same as that between Hawaii or Alaska and the rest of the United States. **********As such, they are eligible for all French social services: medical and unemployment benefits and pensions.

Local elections on Guadeloupe have indicated that the majority of voters oppose independence. **********The political unrest that swept through the Caribbean in the 1960's and 70's came late to the French islands, mostly because of their higher standard of living and because, according to French officials, free access to the French mainland siphoned off social and poltical pressures. As many as 50,000 young people from Guadeloupe and Martinique went to France each year and found jobs. No longer. Like the equally angry Corsicans, who used to find jobs in the army and civil service, young people in the French Antilles see little future at home or in France. Unemployment on Guadeloupe among working-age people is about 40 percent. **********Despite the problems of Guadeloupe's black population and the fears of the whites, the French Government is continuing an ambitious development program that is to include an irrigation program, a program to develop hydroelectric and solar energy and the modernization of the island's sugar industry.

The election process ended Monday night at a local party conference in Warsaw. Although the majority of the delegates are new and their political leanings are not totally clear, a number of known conservatives and more radical reformers were eliminated. **********The middle ground - Mr. Kania's political area - seems to have emerged triumphant. This is the message read by both Polish and Western analysts as they pore over the results of scores of party conferences in the provinces and thousands of earlier elections in the basic cells. **********Significantly, despite the pressures for change from the party's rank and file, most of the party's top leadership was elected as delegates to the congress, which begins July 14. This, too, was seen as something of a victory for Mr. Kania, since he had appealed to party members to allow the leadership to attend the congress intact so its members could be judged by the full party assembly. 'Passive Election Right' **********For the leaders to be elected, they had to employ what is called the ''passive election right'' - entering their candidacies at the provincial party conference level in ''safe'' constituencies instead of undergoing elimination elections in smaller party organizations. **********This device, used liberally in the past to insure control over congresses, touched off opposition in some regions this year.  Three cities - Torun, Slupsk and Lublin - refused to accept the ''central'' delegates as candidates. In other cities - such as Katowice, Poznan and Byd-goszcz - the ''central'' candidates were allowed to run but some of them were defeated. In all, about 55 such delegates were approved, in contrast with several hundred in earlier elections. **********Among those attending the congress will be three leading hardliners on the 11-member Politburo, Stefan Olszowski, chosen at the Warsaw conference; Tadeusz Grabski, representing Konin, and Andrzej Zabinski, from Katowice. Mr. Olszowski narrowly squeezed through, getting 246 votes out of the 429 cast. **********But a number of other party officials went down to defeat, under new and more liberal election rules that provide for secret ballots and more candidates than positions. **********Two Politburo members who were not elected were Gerard Gabrys, a former coal miner, and Zygmunt Wronski, a former worker at the Ursus Tractor Plant in Warsaw. Both were elevated to the Politburo in April, in what the leadership depicted as a move to bring real workers into the leadership. **********But both were disowned by their former workmates. At Ursus, Mr.  Wronski was called a party hack who had not been an the assembly line in years. Mr. Gabrys was initially involved with the Katowice Forum, a hard-line group that won praise from Moscow but little support at home, although he later disassociated himself from the group. **********All the other Politburo members were chosen as delegates, although two candidate members, Jerzy Waszczuk and Jozef Masny, were not.  There were other casualties among the Central Committee and the Government, including Leslaw Tokarski, the committee's new head of press, radio and television; Mieczyslaw Wojtczak, head of the committee's cultural section; Mieczyslaw Glanowski, Minister of Mines, and Adam Krzysztoporski, Deputy Interior Minister. The rejection of these candidates is considered a victory for the reformers. **********Past congresses were so dominated by the party's central apparatus that they were conclaves of the faithful. This year, there will be only three ministers and three heads of sections in the Central Committee. The inablity of the others to gain admittance cast doubts on their political future. **********The business before the congress includes a revision of its statutes, approval of an overall ''program'' to deal with the country's economic and political crisis and the election of a new Central Committee, Politburo and first secretary. **********It has not yet been decided whether the first secretary will be chosen by the congress as a whole, which the reformers would like, or by the Central Committee that emerges from the congress. That decision will be made by the delegates. **********The surge in support for Mr. Kania can be traced to a letter sent on June 5 by the Soviet Communist Party that was intended to undercut him. He rode out a subsequent challenge from hard-liners at a Central Committee meeting and seemed to gain strength as a comfortable and known quantity, acceptable to all factions. **********''The psychological effect of the last Central Committee meeting was that Kania became the defender of national dignity,'' remarked a professor at the Higher School of Social Sciences run by the Central Committee. **********Mr. Kania's strength was readily seen in the provincial conferences in which he participated. He untangled a bitter procedural wrangle in Poznan, arranging a compromise by telephone, and he personally presided over the conference in Warsaw and put his prestige on the line to insure the re-election of Stanslaw Kociolek as Warsaw first secretary. **********Mr. Kociolek, whose reputation was tarnished by his suppression of workers' demonstrations in Baltic cities 11 years ago, retained office. **********As a result of all this, predictions that Mr. Kania will be swept aside as party leader at the congress are no longer being heard. It is even possible, some Polish and Western analysts theorize, that a few hard-liners will be left in place, as window dressing to assuage Moscow's fears that Poland is treading the path of revisionism. Major Changes in Committee **********Most analysts believe that the major changes will be in the Central Committee, which is still largely unchanged from precrisis time. Most predictions are that less than 25 percent of the 140 committee members will be re-elected. Such a turnover would bring an unalterable shift toward liberalism in the basic decision-making body. **********Over the next few weeks, analysts, including those in the Soviet Embassy, will undoubtedly be examining the roster of delegates to try to fathom their political inclinations. **********According to preliminary statistics from the Central Committee's Department of Organization, among the 1,873 delegates chosen up until the Warsaw conference, 20 percent are workers and 10 percent are farmers. Only 5 percent are women. The average age is 30 to 40. **********About 1,521 of the delegates belong to trade unions. Of those, a vast majority - 59 percent - are in party-dominated ''branch unions.'' Only 21 percent are members of Solidarity, the independent labor movement that emerged from disorders last year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/13/business/dayton-malleable-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-may-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DAYTON MALLEABLE INC reports earnings for Qtr to May 31", "print_headline": "DAYTON MALLEABLE INC reports earnings for Qtr to May 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/20/business/phibro-net-off-28.1.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 244, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PHIBRO NET OFF 28.1%", "print_headline": "PHIBRO NET OFF 28.1%", "body_text": " **********The Phibro Corporation, a leading international commodity trading concern, said yesterday that its earnings in the third quarter fell 28.1 percent, to $78.8 million, or $1.15 a share, from $109.6 million, or $1.61 a share, in the third quarter of 1980.

Today, South Africa freed 39 of those men without charges. The other five, including Mr. Hoare, were charged with kidnapping and released on bail. (Page A9.) **********Paraded Before the Press **********Mr. Brooks, a bearded man with a pocked and battered face, and Mr.  England, a sandy-haired man whose cheeks are badly cut, were not so lucky. They stayed behind to act as a rear guard and were captured with three others. **********While their comrades tasted freedom in South Africa today, the two were brought from green-doored cells, with manacles biting their wrists, and paraded before reporters at the central police station here to confess in the dazzling humidity of a small Indian Ocean island a long way from home. **********Reporters, the first to arrive on the island since the coup attempt, were allowed to ask two questions, which the authorities insisted on approving in ad-ju vance: Who paid and hired you? What was your mission? **********The two men, dressed in sports shirts and shorts, spoke in a small courtyard of green grass outside the cells, surrounded by a 12-foot wall topped with barbed wire. Seychelles soldiers kept assault rifles trained on them. **********''I received $1,000 down payment,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''I never met the person who paid us, but I believe it was done on behalf of the ex-President.'' Here, he faltered and turned for assistance to his captors, who gave none. ''Was it Montgom? I think it was Montgom,'' he said. **********Former President James R.M. Mancham, a flamboyant right-winger and former disk jockey was overthrown four years ago and replaced by the Seychelles' present leader, President France Albert Rene. **********''I'm not sure of his name,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''My answer is the same,'' Mr. England said, shuffling slightly.  Mr. Brooks and Mr. England, according to the Seychelles authorities, were part of an advance unit of mercenaries who arrived before the other 44 touched down here in a Royal Swazi Airlines Fokker F-28 plane a week ago. **********Five of the advance men, the authorities say, have been captured, but three, including a man named Charles Dukes, who is identified as an American, are still on the run in the jungles of Mahe, the principal island among the 92 in the Seychelles archipelago. **********Mahe is 17 miles long and 5 miles wide. Its hills are steep and craggy beneath the dense jungle, and girded by narrow, serpentine roads. It lies a thousand miles from the nearest mainland. ''Those on the run have nowhere to go; they will be caught,'' a Seychelles Information Ministry official said. **********Mr. Brooks said his mission was ''to put on two tapes at the radio station once the so-called bloodless coup was over.'' He continued: ''One was to tell the people what to do. The other was to announce that the ex-President ... Montgom, I think it was Montgom ... had now taken power again.'' **********Mr. England, a Briton, said: ''It was a coup attempt. We would supposedly take power bloodlessly, and once we had taken power we would disappear and the local Government would come and run the place.'' **********Mr. Brooks, who had been wounded in the leg, volunteered the information that he was married, had two children, one 17 years old, the other 4 1/2, and was a Rhodesian who had lived in South Africa for two and a half years. Mercenaries to Be Tried **********Reporters were not allowed to ask further questions, so Mr. Brooks was not given an opportunity to say why he had risked all for $1,000 up front and the promise of altering a bit of history. An unidentified police official prevented the two mercenaries from talking to one another. Then they were led away to separate cells, their moment of celebrity fading, along with the myth, that mercenaries cultivate, of invincibility. **********At a news conference earlier, President Rene said the captive mercenaries would be tried on charges including murder because one Seychellois officer was killed in the fighting. One mercenary died, too, and his body was taken to South Africa aboard the hijacked plane. **********President Rene, a short man in a cream-colored, open-neck tropical suit, said South Africa's action in freeing the mercenaries who escaped had convinced him ''that the South African Government was involved in this attempt.'' The statement was the most forthright that Mr. Rene has made on South Africa in connection with the attempted coup. **********''We all know that South Africa is one of the countries that has been destabilizing foreign governments,'' he continued. ''We are not surprised that they have done so here.'' He acknowledged that ''one or two'' Tanzanian troops, who have been training the 1,000-m@ember Seychelles military force, were ''attached to our men at the time of the fighting.'' **********He accused former President Mancham of having ''surreptitiously'' approached both the mercenaries and the South African authorities to set up the coup attempt. Mr. Mancham said in New York on Tuesday that he recorded the message that Mr. Brooks planned to play on the Seychelles radio but said he did not know for whom he had recorded the tape and when it would be used. **********''What is obvious,'' President Rene said of the 44 mercenaries, including Mr. Hoare, ''is that this was mainly an advance party. They came to act from inside with a follow-up at some time or other. We suspect that a yacht would arrive in early December to be part of this operation.'' The coup attempt, he said, would have then coincided with a visit to France that he had planned. **********The mercenaries arrived in the guise of rugby players, attending a drinking fest in the Seychelles called the ''Ancient Order of Foam Blowers 1981 Congress.'' They carried bags with false bottoms hiding Bulgarian-made assault rifles of Soviet design, walkie-talkies and other weapons. On top of the false bottoms, they piled toy cars, toy boats, Christmas candy, badminton sets, all adorned with tags from a Johannesburg toy shop called Clicks. **********At the airport, the Seychelles authorities said, one gun muzzle poked through the toys, which were marked as gifts for disabled children, and a customs officer spotted it. In the 20 hours of firing that followed, the 44 escaped, leaving others as a rear guard, who held Seychellois hostage as a shield. **********The fighting left the airport, seven miles from Victoria, the capital, scarred. The Seychelles military force, a Government official said, put two rocket-propelled grenades through the Royal Swazi Airlines plane to prevent the mercenaries from escaping on it.  The tactic has left the twin-engine passenger jet eviscerated, its electronics dangling messily in the flight deck, and oxygen masks hanging down in the cabin. The plane represents the entire Swazi fleet. **********According to a list released by the authorities today, the 44 who arrived Nov. 25 included 23 South Africans, 9 Britons, 5 Zimbabweans, 2 Germans, one Australian, one Austrian, one Irishman and an American identified as Barry Gribein. The eight who had come earlier comprised three South Africans, one American, two Zimbabweans and two Britons, the authorities said. Government Displays Booty **********The Government also displayed its booty: at least 14 stockless rifles recovered from false-bottomed bags, tracer ammunition, a ''Foam Blowers'' T-shirt with bloodstains and American-made walkietalkies. **********The Seychelles radio broadcast an appeal today to an American and three South Africans who have been reported missing from hotels to come forward. By nightfall, none of them had surrendured, and a dusk-to-dawn curfew settled on the island. **********Two Soviet warships, which arrived three days after the coup attempt in a show of support for Mr. Rene, and a day after a French destroyer arrived on a similar mission, lay at anchor just offshore. **********To the sighing of turquoise waves, night eased down on beaches that by daylight are as palm-fringed and coral-white as the brochures say."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/18/business/bomaine-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BOMAINE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "BOMAINE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/business/comment-new-yorks-job-lag.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-31", "snippet": "T HE limited nature of the city's economic revival is mirrored in the labor markets.

The Cornelia Street venture marks their entry into the residential market. **********''In commercial development, we began to feel we were at the beck and call of banks who usually are looking for some form of equity participation,'' Roger Fisher said. **********''We wanted to do something more creative than commercial projects allow.'' In its residential reincarnation, according to the plan by the Stephen B. Jacobs architectural concern, the building has maintained its many windows and high-ceilinged rooms, which the builders hope will enhance a perception of spaciousness. **********''When you develop an office building you create space, but the tenant makes the final decisions about how the space is going to be used,'' Roger Fisher said. In an apartment building, he continued, ''whether it's renovation or new construction, the developer creates the interior space and the whole environment, even down to considerations such as layout and decor and hardware for the doors.'' **********The Fisher brothers chose white circular staircases with oak treads to connect the upper and lower levels of the duplex units; brasscolored fixtures - instead of chrome - and sliding thermal-glass windows that are fitted with screens even though the windows have sleeves for air-conditioners. **********Despite some objections from the architects, they decided the fully equipped and ventilated kitchens would be left without partitions while other units were demarcated by the cabinet arrangement. **********Looking north, residents of the second floor and above have unobstructed views of the Empire State Building and the Manhattan skyline. Though views beneath the sixth floor on the Cornelia Street side are obstructed by residential buildings, tenants on the sixth floor south and above have access to sweeping scenes of Lower Manhattan, the towers of the World Trade Center and the Hudson River. Some apartments have roof terraces. **********By offering their units as condominiums, perhaps the first in Lower Manhattan, the developers hope to lure buyers seeking fewer restrictions on resale and lower monthly charges -features they believe are not as attractive in cooperative offerings, which are more common in New York City. **********Cooperative owners buy shares in a corporation owning the property, while condominium owners buy their units and lease space in common areas shared with other residents such as the lobby and hallways. **********Though a condominium board made up of owners may decline to sell to a prospective apartment buyer for any reason, in that case the board must at least match the offer of the prospective buyer. There is no such legal stipulation in the case of cooperative apartments. **********At 2 Cornelia, the largest unit, a three-bedroom duplex penthouse with three baths and a combined area of 2,052 square feet, including a roof terrace, will sell for $400,000 and offer an estimated monthly common charge of $343. **********The smallest and least expensive"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/16/world/former-premier-deplores-political-feuding-in-iran.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 184, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Former Premier Deplores Political Feuding in Iran", "print_headline": "Former Premier Deplores Political Feuding in Iran", "body_text": " **********Former Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan today sharply criticized Iran's President, Prime Minister and Chief Justice, saying that a struggle for power had grown into a dangerous feud. **********Mr. Bazargan, who headed a provisional government in 1979 and is now a member of Parliament, said that President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr paid ''too much attention to his post'' and Prime Minister Mohammed Ali Rajai ''uses his efforts to block the way of the President.'' **********He accused the head of the Supreme Court, Ayatollah Mohammed Beheshti, of misusing his post to spread propaganda and of exceeding his jurisdiction.

Election of Assembly Set for 1984 **********This provision, as well as Mr. Marcos's retention of standby power to issue decrees, is viewed by opponents of the regime as greatly reducing the real significance of the lifting of martial law. Mr.  Marcos has issued more than 1,000 decrees. **********Nonetheless, opponents and diplomats concede that the gestures represent an opening for change toward liberalization. A new National Assembly, replacing the present interim legislature, is to be elected in 1984. **********So far, the organized opposition, led largely by elected officials from the days before martial law was declared, has made no move to test the new climate. They are deliberating on whether to hold political meetings and publish anti-Marcos newspapers. **********Mr. Marcos affirmed, in an addition to the prepared text of his speech today, that he had not lifted martial law in response to pressure from the United States. The change of American administrations, with the new one believed likely to be more favorable to Mr. Marcos than that of President Carter, is frequently mentioned here as a factor dictating the timing of the President's action. Pope John Paul II's visit next month to this predominantly Roman Catholic country also is mentioned as a factor. He Says U.S. Did Not Know Plan **********Mr. Marcos also said that the United States had not been informed of his decision to impose martial law in 1972. Many opponents have asserted that the United States connived in the martial-law regime in return for assurances by Mr. Marcos that American military and economic interests would be unaffected. **********Mr. Marcos's formal cession of legislative powers to the assembly is not viewed here as creating a threat to his authority. Of its 184 members, 169 belong to the President's New Society Party; many of the others generally support it. A maximum of five deputies are firm opponents. **********After the proclamation of martial law, the assembly was moved from the old Congress Building in the center of the city, and it was transformed into the national museum. The assembly was moved to a new structure in a remote suburb, and its deliberations are held before sparsely filled public galleries.

The Dow transportation average plunged 10.29 points, to 420.63, producing a percentage decline more than twice that of the industrials. The utility average, which is sensitive to interest rate developments, also lost considerable ground. **********Faced with conflicting signals, many investors and traders apparently chose to pare their portfolios. On the one hand, additional banks cut their prime lending rate by half a point, to 20 percent. But short-term rates gyrated wildly in the money market before finishing slightly higher. **********Continued weakness in energy stocks - Wall Street favorites in 1979 and 1980 - proved unsettling, according to analysts.  The Mobil Corporation, for example, fell 1 5/8, to 54 3/4, and sold at its lowest price within the last 12 months. Last year, Mobil traded at a record price of 89 1/2. Some issues, such as Wainoco Oil, an aggressive exploration company, sold yesterday at less than onehalf of their 1980 highs. Drilling Stocks Hit Hard **********Oil-service and drilling stocks also were hit hard. Such former favorites as Schlumberger, Halliburton and Parker Drilling displayed losses exceeding 2 points. **********Just as energy stocks rose in the two previous years in tandem with climbing petroleum prices, so have an abundant supply of crude oil and the recently invoked price freeze by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries applied pressure to this sector. **********Also reflecting the price pullback in natural-resource issues, the American Stock Exchange's market value index dropped 7.04 points, to 363.40, registering its largest decline since an 11-point loss on Feb. 2. Retreating more than 3 points each were Dome Petroleum, Felmont Oil and Delhi International Oil. **********In citing price erosion in the technology group, Mr. Trott of Becker mentioned Texas Instruments, which plunged 11 5/8 points in the previous two sessions. On Friday, the company announced a permanent layoff of 2,800 workers because of weakness in its semiconductor business. Yesterday, Texas Instruments eased 3/4, to 107 3/4. **********Elsewhere, Prime Computer, Hewlett-Packard and Teledyne dropped more than 3 points each.  Despite yesterday's pronounced setback in the market, some Wall Street analysts continued to express optimism for a recovery. Mr.  Trott, for example, said he believes the Dow industrials this summer will surpass their record closing of 1,051.70 on Jan. 11, 1973. **********The Big Board's most active stock, Kennecott, moved against the general trend, advancing 1 7/8, to 61 3/4, on a turnover exceeding 1 million shares. This followed the report that the Federal Trade Commission had voted in a closed session against opposing the proposed acquisition of Kennecott by the Standard Oil Company (Ohio). Sohio dropped 1 7/8, to 43 3/8. Its high last year was 91 1/2. **********Walt Disney Productions, reaching its loftiest price in eight years, climbed 1 1/8, to 64. David J. Londoner of Wertheim & Company attributed this gain primarily to recently improved attendance at Walt Disney World near Orlando, Fla. **********The Mead Corporation fell 3 1/4 points, to 28. On Monday, the Supreme Court refused to block a proceeding that potentially could force Mead to pay up to $1 billion for fixing prices on corrugated containers. **********Prices also fell sharply in the over-the-counter market. The Nasdaq composite index declined 3.43, to 219.59. MCI Communications, the volume leader, dropped 2 3/8, to 21 3/8 bid.

The expectation of a decline in prices fosters the decline of oil company stocks, the oil companies not wanting to be stuck with high-priced inventory. These stocks were at unusually low levels at the time of the Iranian shutdown, and the ensuing scramble to rebuild them was in part responsible for the devastating price increase which took place over the following six months. In contrast, at the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war, inventories were at record levels as a result of the previous build-up. Their release served to moderate upward pressure on prices. **********Oil prices have shown themselves extremely sensitive to loss of supply, and sharp price increases can wreak havoc in the economy, causing more inflation and lost output.

The debate in Congress over proposed tax cuts also has served to confuse or disappoint some investors. **********Other negative factors, as Rudolf Hauser of Oppenheimer & Company has pointed out, include the large number of common stock offerings recently and the high level of margin debt. **********But interest rates, it is generally agreed, hold the key to future movements in both the stock and bond markets.

Since last September the country's currency has lost half its value, feeding inflation, which is expected to exceed 40 percent this year, and forcing the Government to hold down both imports and public spending. **********Although the Carazo administration has been criticized for reacting slowly to the crisis, the rise in the country's current accountpayment deficit to $661 million last year was largely attributable to the 28 percent increase in its oil import bills, to $206 million, and the 22 percent decrease in its coffee earnings, to $244 million. **********''In 1970, one bag of coffee bought 100 barrels of oil,'' said Jose Miguel Alfaro, the Minister of Economy. ''Today, one bag of coffee buys just three barrels of oil.'' **********To find a way out of the crisis, Costa Rica has now turned to the International Monetary Fund, which is demanding a severe austerity program, including a $225 million cut in the budget deficit. In exchange, Costa Rica is hoping for a so-called Extended Fund Facility of $330 million over three years, which should enable it to continue investments in energy and agricultural programs aimed at strengthening the economy's resistence to the vagaries of world prices. Plan for Alternative Energy **********''The deterioration of the terms of trade is totally beyond our control,'' explained Hernan Saenz, the Finance Minister. ''If we don't carry on our structural investments and reforms, we'll be in exactly the same position of vulnerability when the monetary crisis is overcome.'' **********In a country with no hydrocarbons of its own, the major problem involves alternative energy, with plans to phase out oil-fired thermoelectric plants by developing Costa Rica's huge hydroelectric potential, and to substitute alcohol for all the gasoline used by automobiles by 1989. **********Nontraditional exports - anything but coffee, bananas and meat - are to be stimulated. In the short to medium term, the slump - the economy is expected to grow by only 1 percent this year, compared with a recent annual average of 6 percent - could spark labor unrest and increased dissatisfaction with the Carazo administration. **********With general elections due next February, however, local politicians hope that political dissent will be channeled into the campaign. Mr. Carazo cannot seek re-election, and the candidate of the opposition Social Democratic National Liberation Party, Luis Alberto Monge, is the strong favorite to become the next president. Bombings Introduce Uncertainty **********But the unpredictable political variable here, introduced abruptly by the terrorist bombs, is a cause for concern for all political parties. **********Officials believe that the bombings were the work of foreign leftists linked to Salvadoran guerrilla groups. But local leftist sources insist that young Costa Rican radicals, inspired by the revolutionary fever in the region, were responsible. **********A communique signed by the ''Commander Carlos Aguero Echeverria Command'' said the bombings were in reprisal for United States and Honduran support for El Salvador's junta, and it called for the formation in Costa Rica of a ''political-military organization,'' the leftist euphemism for a guerrilla group. **********The Costa Rican Army was dismantled in 1949, and the shock caused by the bombings was soon followed here by the nervous recognition that the country's poorly equipped 7,000-member Civil Guard was ill prepared to deal with terrorism. Because the guard is considered a police force, United States law prevents Washington from providing it with assistance. Carazo Rejects 'Militarization' **********President Carazo was among the first to insist that the bombings would not lead to ''militarization'' of the society. ''That is out of the question,'' he said. ''Terrorism is repudiated by everyone, and the best ally of the Government in fighting it is the people.  When the country has an army, it expects the army to defend it.  Because we have no army, the people are ready to defend the country.'' **********Although Costa Ricans were always ready to volunteer as reservists during the frequent border crises with Nicaragua under the Somoza regime, some security analysts here recognize that terrorism is more difficult to combat. ''The extreme left's objective is to polarize society by provoking the extreme right to resort to the same tactics and by forcing the police to become more repressive,'' one police expert said. ''That is, of course, a greater danger than the terrorism itself.'' **********Conscious of the risk that this country might be sucked into the Central American vortex of violence, President Carazo is indirectly trying to protect Costa Rica by actively promoting a political solution to the Salvadoran conflict and by warning that ''excessive'' military aid to El Salvador could weaken President Jose Napoleon Duarte and other civilians in the Government. **********Having assisted Nicaragua's Sandinist guerrillas in ousting the Somoza regime, President Carazo is also alarmed by the Reagan Administration's hostility toward the left-wing Managua Government. **********''The intelligent thing would be to adopt a friendly and constructive policy toward Nicaragua,'' he said. ''We have to help Nicaragua a great deal and keep it on the side of democracy. We must not repeat Cuba and force Nicaragua to be a friend of Moscow. In this polarized world, a country expelled from one side goes automatically to the other.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/14/world/communist-parley-cautioned-on-poles.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 540, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMMUNIST PARLEY CAUTIONED ON POLES", "print_headline": "COMMUNIST PARLEY CAUTIONED ON POLES", "body_text": " **********Italian and French Communists at the East German party congress here warned today against any outside intervention in Poland and said they were convinced that Warsaw could settle its own affairs. **********Addressing the conference as the representatives of the two largest Communist parties in Western Europe, Gaston Plissonnier of France and Giovanni Cervetti of Italy spoke of widespread concern in the West at the events in and around Poland. **********''For the past six months the media in France have reported that a military intervention is imminent,'' said Mr. Plissonnier, who is a member of the French politburo. ''Naturally this has led to violent attacks against the Communist Party.'' **********He said his party was ''deeply convinced it is the affair of the Polish party, the Government and the Polish people to solve their problems through realization of economic, social and democratic reforms that will enable them to go forward on the road to socialism.'' Affair for Poles Themselves **********Mr. Cervetti, a member of the Italian party's national leadership, used even stronger language, saying his party firmly believed ''that the respect for independence and sovereignty of every country and every nation is an unrenounceable principle for every socialist force, for every progressive force, and is also a basic condition for the continuation of detente.'' **********The Poles themselves, he said, should ''solve and overcome the crisis and the tensions by political means, with their own strength and without outside interference.'' **********Mr. Cervetti said that the Polish events had caused ''fear and concern'' in Europe.

Mr. Plissonnier's statement was seen to reflect worry lest the events influence the French presidential elections next month. **********In light of widespread fears in Europe of military interference in Poland, France's Communists evidently fear their prospects at the elections may be hurt unless they speak up. Both the French and Italian parties condemned the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968. Concept of 'Renewal' Attacked **********The East German leader, Erich Honecker, signaled official restraint at the opening session of the congress Saturday when he pledged ''brotherly solidarity'' with Polish Communists striving to defend and strengthen socialism. But other East German delegates were given leeway to express discontent and suspicion at the pace and the manner in which the Poles were handling the situation. **********At this morning's session a high-level official attacked the concept of ''renewal,'' the term used by the Poles to describe their party's reform movement. Egon Krenz, the head of the East German Communist youth organization, said ''anti-Communists, revisionists and so-called renewers'' must all be grouped together and fought as enemies of socialism. **********East German youths, he said, know the difference between revolution and counterrevolution and had ''long accepted leadership of the party as an inviolable principle of socialism.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/05/business/home-loan-rates-climb.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 218, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Home Loan Rates Climb", "print_headline": "Home Loan Rates Climb", "body_text": " **********Interest rates on home loans for new single-family houses soared to an average of 16.1 percent last month, the highest since the all-time record of 16.59 percent in April of last year, the Government reported today. **********The Federal Home Loan Bank Board report seemed to be in line with recent complaints by numerous housing industry spokesmen that rates have risen so high that few Americans can afford loans for new houses. **********The average rate fell to 12.52 percent last August, but has been rising since then along with interest rates in other parts of the economy. **********The bank board's average is based on a survey of loan commitments of large savings institutions offering 25-year mortgages covering 75 percent of the purchase price. **********The average for early May was more than one-half percentage point higher than the 15.53 percent average recorded one month earlier, the board report said. **********''The sharp advance in rates reflected both substantial withdrawals of funds from thrift institutions, which are typically large mortgage lenders, and the general rise in long-term interest rates,'' the report said. **********The bank board had reported earlier that the nation's federally chartered savings and loan associations suffered a record $4.63 million ''outflow'' of new savings deposits in May."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/26/business/technology-the-portable-computer.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1981-03-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 870, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Technology; The Portable Computer", "print_headline": "Technology; The Portable Computer", "body_text": " **********NO sooner has the world been treated to the personal desktop computer than along comes the portable computer. Now everyone can have a computer - not only in the home or office but also in the briefcase or pocket. **********The new portable machines range from the hand-held computer, which looks like an overgrown calculator, to the briefcase-sized computer, which looks like a miniature version of a desktop machine. **********Several such devices are already on the market and more are coming. Two days ago, Japan's Casio Computer Company announced plans to introduce this summer a $250 computer small enough to fit in a coat pocket. **********In function and price, the portable computers fill the gap between programmable calculators and desktop computers. Indeed, there is now a continuum in computing devices from the $10 wallet-sized calculator to the multimillion-dollar, room-sized mainframe. **********The portable devices achieve their size by a combination of technical advances, compact packaging and omission of some of the features of the larger computers, such as television-screen displays and full-sized keyboards. **********The first hand-held computer to reach the market was the $250 Radio Shack model introduced last summer and manufactured by Japan's Sharp Corporation. Sharp intends to market a similar device under its own name. **********The computer is similar to a programmable calculator except that it can be programmed using a conventional programming language rather than by punching function keys as on a calculator. It has a one-line display, allowing the user to read the program one line at a time.  The computer can also prompt the user through written messages to punch in certain data. But without a typewriter-like keyboard and a television display screen, the device is somewhat inconvenient to use. **********''I have a real question as to the acceptability of hand-held computers in the market,'' said Ed Faber, president of Computerland, a chain of more than 150 computer retail stores. Nevertheless, Computerland will soon offer the Sharp computer. **********A more powerful device will be offered by Panasonic and Quasar later this year. Developed by the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company and Friends Amis Inc. of San Francisco, the device is the successor to the ill-fated electronic translator, which was more limited in function and lasted two years on the market. **********The computer uses the same powerful microprocessor as in some of the desktop computers that require household current. To allow the hand-held computer to run on batteries, a sophisticated internal program constantly turns off the microprocessor when it is not in use. The computer also uses several methods to cram more data onto less memory than in many other computers. **********The computer comes with special attachments that give it the capabilities of a desktop computer. It can connect over the telephone, for instance, to access data banks that provide everything from stock quotations to airline schedules to newspaper articles.  That information can be read one line at a time on the computer's display, which is rather cumbersome. Or the computer can be hooked to a television screen, providing a bigger display. The hand-held computer can also be hooked to a tiny printer, additional memory blocks or a larger keyboard. **********Of course, with all those attachments, the computer is no longer a hand-held device but a briefcase-sized one. And its price, which will be $600 for the basic computer, will jump to $2,000. **********That brings it up against other competition. Britain's Sinclair Research Ltd. has developed a book-sized computer weighing 12 ounces and selling for $200. The device has a keyboard that is almost the size of a typewriter keyboard. The user must provide his own television set for display. **********Perhaps the ultimate in packaged portable computers is the one that will be brought out by the Osborne Computer Corporation of Hayward, Calif., next month. It contains a typewriter-like keyboard, a five-inch diagonal display screen and two disk drives for additional memory, and can connect to larger screens or telephones.  All will fit in a briefcase small enough to put under an airplane seat. It will sell for $1,800. **********Industry officials and analysts think it is only a matter of time before several other companies jump in with hand-held or portable computers. **********Frequently mentioned as candidates are Texas Instruments and Hewlett-Packard, whose programmable calculators are likely to feel increased competition. Hewlett-Packard already seems to be moving in that direction with its HP-41C, the first programmable calculator that can display letters as well as numbers. It can also be attached to printers and plotters. **********''I think the portable computers will take off like gangbusters,'' said Portia Isaacson of Future Computing, a Dallas-area consulting firm. **********Dr. Isaacson predicts businessmen will soon be carrying entire electronic offices with them, consisting of microcassette recorders, tiny printers, tiny televisions and small keyboards all attachable to a small computer. **********Businessmen will be able to dictate letters, type and edit reports, have access to company files and send data to the main company computer while on the road.

South-West Africa is administered by South Africa under a mandate given by the League of Nations after World War I. **********''We denounce the recent American diplomatic missions to Namibia because this is tantamount to recognizing the puppet regime created by South Africa there,'' Mr. Nujoma said at a news conference. He was referring to a visit to the territory recently by Deputy Secretary of State William P. Clark, who also traveled to South Africa and Zimbabwe. **********Mr. Nujoma called for new sanctions by the West against South Africa. ''We urgently call on the West to support comprehensive sanctions against the racist regime of South Africa,'' he said. **********Foreign ministers from the 50 member nations of the Organization of African Unity, which is meeting here, have supported the idea of asking the West, and particularly the United States, to institute new sanctions against South Africa. **********Mr. Nujoma said that if the West, in particular the United States, failed to heed this call, his organization would ask the O.A.U. to call for economic sanctions against major Western powers like the United States. In response to a question, he said that one possibility would be to ask Nigeria, which is the second-largest supplier of crude oil to the United States after Saudi Arabia, to stop its oil shipments to the United States. **********He said that his organization, known as Swapo, along with the Organization of African Unity, held that the ''only basis'' for a fair settlement in Namibia was Security Council Resolution 435, which calls for United Nations-supervised elections. **********In a related development today, Randall Robinson, head of TransAfrica, a Washington-based lobbying group, disclosed to the African foreign ministers what he said were details of an American proposal for a constitution for Namibia. **********According to the outline disclosed by Mr. Robinson, the Reagan Administration's plan calls for a federal system with state boundaries that would be based on the territories inhabited by the ethnic groups of Namibia. ---- Zimbabwe Rules Out Embargo **********SALISBURY, Zimbabwe, June 22 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe said today that his country could not participate in trade sanctions against South Africa. **********Zimbabwe's economic dependence on its white-ruled neighbor was such that it would be senseless for it to pretend it could join in an embargo, Mr. Mugabe said in an interview."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/24/business/market-place-lexicon-gets-second-wind.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Metz", "pub_date": "1981-06-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 848, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Lexicon Gets Second Wind", "print_headline": "Market Place; Lexicon Gets Second Wind", "body_text": " **********IN the beginning the Lexicon Corporation manufactured a hand-held language translator. Although this product was the first in the field when it was introduced in November 1978, the company lacked the financial strength to compete after the translator market grew hot. **********The $500,000 that Lexicon raised in early 1978 dwindled to nothing, and the Miami-based company avoided bankruptcy only by selling its one important asset - the rights to its translator - for $1.5 million. **********The good news is that, unlike so many faltering start-up companies, Lexicon survived. The proceeds from the translator sale reduced the corporate debt to $1 million and paid for research and development on an advanced 5-pound portable computer terminal with a thermal-process paper tape. Lexicon believes that this terminal, which can send and receive, has even more promise than the translator did. **********The diminutive machine - two could fit inside a standard briefcase - can be hooked into any or all of the many data banks now available through the nearest telephone. For example, a subscriber could draw information from The New York Times Information Bank, Reader's Digest Source, the United Press International wire, the Dow Jones broad tape and Microquote, which provides current prices and their histories for over-the-counter and listed stocks, among other financial data. **********Lexicon's machine, called Lex 21, can reach the corporate data bank by telephone so that field people ''can get computerized information from wherever they happen to be,'' as Michael Levy, president of the company, explained in New York this week. For example, salespeople could ask the home office computer for updates on orders in process. **********Moreover, assuming Lexicon makes a deal with one of the half-dozen real estate multiple-listing data bases, the would-be seller of a private home would be able to obtain from his broker all current listings in the neighborhood, including features of houses on the market along with details and prices obtained in recent sales. Thus the householder reading a Lexicon printout could price his house with a sharp eye on the real estate market. **********To get this new terminal into production, Lexicon tapped the public capital market a second time, offering (through Blair & Company) 3,000 units priced at $1,000 each. A unit consisted of 100 convertible preferred shares, 400 common shares and warrants to purchase an additional 100 common shares. **********The offering, made in February, was a success. After the underwriting costs, the company kept $2.6 million of the $3 million proceeds. Now, Mr. Levy insists, Lexicon is ready to market its terminal and take its place among high-technology companies that have succeeded despite formidable odds. **********Does this mean that Lexicon is a shoo-in to participate in the growing market for portable computer terminals and become another glamour stock? **********Perhaps. But it is by no means certain. The company must still demonstrate that it is capable of marketing a promising product against some of the toughest competition in the world. **********As the prospectus issued for the recent offering notes, the venture involves ''significant risks.'' The company has experienced sizable losses in every year of its existence, and it had a working capital deficit before the offering. Mr. Levy said the company had about $1.5 million in working capital now. **********''Our fiscal year ends Aug. 31, and we should do about $1 million to $1.2 million in sales, and we should break even,'' he said. **********Among other risk factors, the company will depend on a Hong Kong manufacturer to build certain component parts for the terminals.  The company describes its major competitors as Texas Instruments Inc. and the Computer Devices Corporation, but Mr. Levy says, ''Their units are much heavier than ours. **********Wall Street speculators have heard about Lexicon and evidently are impressed with it. The over-the-counter shares began trading on March 3 this year. They were quoted at 1 1/4 bid that day and have since moved up. They reached 3 3/4 bid on May 7, when the trading volume was 135,500 shares. On Monday of this week the shares were 2 3/4 bid, and 14,600 shares were traded. The units that were issued at $1,000 rose to $3,500 in May and are now trading at about $3,000. **********In all, there are 3.3 million shares outstanding, of which insiders own about a third. So here is a high-technology company of promise. High among its attributes is a demonstrated ability to hold its important technical people, most of whom were originally at Racal-Milgo Inc. Mr. Levy takes pride in the fact that virtually no one has left his research and development department over the years despite the company's hard times. **********Will the Lex 21 terminal be a success and will Lexicon itself thrive? Only time will tell. If it does, it will join a tiny group of companies - such as the Intel Corporation, Tandem Computers Inc. and Prime Computer Inc. - that have survived and grown after near-fatal adversity in their early years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/17/world/reagan-meets-with-8-senators-in-push-for-support-on-awacs.html": {"writer_name": "Charles Mohr", "pub_date": "1981-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 549, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN MEETS WITH 8 SENATORS IN PUSH FOR SUPPORT ON AWACS", "print_headline": "REAGAN MEETS WITH 8 SENATORS IN PUSH FOR SUPPORT ON AWACS", "body_text": " **********President Reagan met with eight Senators today to urge them to support his proposal to sell Saudi Arabia five Awacs radar surveillance planes. **********Senator J.

Many analysts had expected the drop to encourage declines for other interest rates as well. **********In the money markets, dealers said that the downward pressure on rates came from the Federal Reserve's willingness to let the Federal funds rate drop to about 17 3/4 percent. But upward pressure on rates came from the increased issuing by banks of negotiable certificates of deposit, they added. **********Some dealers and investors were concerned that yesterday's bank borrowing in the C.D. market could be the harbinger of even greater borrowing in the future. ''Everybody wants to stand back and see how the banks handle the loan demands that could emerge from all the merger financing,'' one investment banker commented. Return to Markets Seen **********Other analysts contended that the bank borrowing to finance corporate mergers might not put as much upward pressure on rates as some market participants seemed to think. ''It is a zero sum game,'' one analyst said, since the money borrowed from one bank would quickly return to the financial markets as shareholders of the acquired company deposited their checks. **********Donald Miller, vice chairman at the Continental Illinois National Bank, said that ''market participants might have got a little overexercised'' about the volume of credit facilities being arranged. He added that not all the companies arranging credit lines would need to use them since several were trying to buy the same company, Conoco Inc. He said that, when the loan demands were spread over the banking system at some unknown date in the future, ''the amount needed by any one bank need not be disruptive.'' **********Yesterday, specialists said that about half of the 10 largest banks in the country were actively raising money in the domestic C.D.  market, and were paying rates as high as 17.9 percent for one-month certificates and 16.875 percent for six-month C.D.'s. As recently as last week, some banks were paying more than 18 percent for one-month certificates. As Low as 16 3/4 Percent **********Yesterday, the Federal funds rate averaged about 17 3/4 percent after being as low as 16 3/4 percent. The Federal Reserve supplied reserves to the banking system for the fifth consecutive day when it arranged temporary two-day purchases of securities. The Fed also bought $150 million of seven-year securities for its customer account. **********Investors continued to be reluctant buyers of long-term bonds yesterday, even though overnight and other short-term interest rates fell modestly. **********In the corporate bond market, investment bankers found that record yields for new triple-A rated issues of American Telephone and Telegraph subsidiaries were enough of an inducement to attract buyers for all of New York Telephone's 40-year debentures or 10-year notes.  Underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation said the 15 5/8 percent debentures due in 2021 were about three-fourths sold with a yield of 15.725 percent, while $150 million of 14 5/8 percent notes due in 1991 were about two-thirds sold at a yield of 14.749 percent to maturity. **********Among bond issues outstanding, prices were lower all day, for taxable and tax-exempt issues. The bellwether 13 7/8 percent Treasury bonds due in 2011 traded as low as 102 7/8 before closing at an offered price of 103 1/8 to yield 13.43 percent, down about seveneighths of a point on the day. Record Electric Utility Yield **********A record yield for new Baa-rated 10-year electric utility debt was established yesterday when underwriters led by Morgan Stanley said they would be selling Ohio Edison's $75 million of 16 7/8 percent bonds at 99.395 to yield 17 percent to maturity. As recently as June 30, a similar issue of Long Island Lighting bonds was sold with a 16.75 percent yield. **********In the tax-exempt market, underwriters said sales were slow for several new issues, with the notable exception of New York City. The city's bonds were priced with a top yield of 12 percent for bonds due from 1998 to 2001, a level that attracted strong demand. **********Among the proposed issues that were selling slowly, underwriters said that the terms of the Michigan State Building Authority's Arated revenue bonds might be revised to attract more buyers. Earlier this week, they proposed a top yield of 12 percent for bonds due in 2001. **********Underwriters led by Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb said the size of a Harris County, Tex., housing revenue bond issue was reduced to $57 million from $100 million. The bonds have a top yield of 11 percent for the 1994 maturity. **********In United States Government agency financing, the Federal Home Loan Banks announced an interest rate of 15.9 percent for $1 billion of new one-year bonds, 15.55 percent for $1 billion of three-year bonds, and 15.35 percent for $500 million of five-year bonds.

General Calvaligi, 61 years old, was also in charge of security in the maximum security prisons where convicted and suspected terrorists are held. **********A woman who telephoned the news agency ANSA indicated that the attack was a reprisal for Monday's storming by the police of a maximum security prison in Trani that had been held by the inmates.  About 70 convicts seized 18 guards as hostages, and 4 prisoners and 23 hostages and policemen were injured in the assault. **********Government sources said General Calvaligi worked closely with the Rome magistrate Giovanni D'Urso, a leading official in the national prison system who was kidnapped Dec. 12 by the Red Brigades. The Red Brigades, a leftist group that kidnapped and killed former Prime Minister Aldo Moro, have not set specific conditions for Mr. D'Urso's release, but have demanded the closing of some of Italy's penitentiaries. Police Account of Shooting **********The police gave this account of the shooting of General Calvaligi: The gunmen, in their late teens, rang the bell to the general's apartment, announcing through an intercom that they were delivering a package. After being told that the general was not home, they opened the outside gate of the apartment building and waited in the passageway leading to the front door. **********Five minutes later General Calvaligi and his wife got out of their car and entered the passageway, where one of the terrorists presented him with a basket containing eight bottles of wine. As the general handed a tip to one of the youths, the other drew a pistol and shot the general three times in the head and chest, killing him instantly. **********The killers fled in a waiting green Fiat 128, which was found abandoned an hour later about two miles north of the scene of the slaying in southern Rome. **********It was not immediately clear where the general's bodyguards were at the time of the attack."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/03/business/congress-set-to-give-administration-tax-bill-final-approval.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1347, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONGRESS SET TO GIVE ADMINISTRATION TAX BILL FINAL APPROVAL", "print_headline": "CONGRESS SET TO GIVE ADMINISTRATION TAX BILL FINAL APPROVAL", "body_text": " **********Congress is expected to give final approval this week to an Administration-sponsored tax bill that is replete with a wide variety of special tax breaks for individuals and business, including three years of cuts in individual income tax rates. **********House and Senate tax writers reconciled differences between their respective bills in a conference that started at 4 P.M. Friday and ended at 8 A.M. Saturday. The White House pronounced President Reagan pleased with the bill and ready to sign it. **********The Senate is expected to give final approval to the conference report tomorrow. Leaders of both parties were prepared to do so in a pro forma session Saturday evening but Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, sent word from his summer home on Cape Cod that he felt the concessions made to oil producers were too generous and he wanted an opportunity to say so before the Senate acted. **********Senator Kennedy is expected to ask the Senate tomorrow to send the bill back to conference and the Senate is expected to turn him down, then vote final passage. The House meets Tuesday and is expected to approve the bill and send it along to Mr. Reagan. **********The Economic Recovery Act of 1981 is notable because for the first time Congress authorizes three rounds of reductions in individual tax rates - 5 percent on Oct. 1, 10 percent on July 1, 1982, and 10 percent on July 1, 1983. These cuts, the core of the Administration's supply-side strategy for stimulating the economy, were adopted by both houses and were not at issue in the conference. **********As passed by the House and Senate, the bill also created a new, more simple system of depreciation for business. It applies to investment made in 1981 and later. It will reduce business taxes by $10 billion in fiscal year 1982, which starts Oct. 1, and by increasing amounts every year thereafter as the pool of covered investment in buildings and equipment grows. **********In a television interview today, the Senate majority leader, Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, gave this capsule assessment of the bill: ''What we are doing is really a riverboat gamble. We are gambling that this new economics will work - and it will, in my judgment.'' Following is a summary of the principal issues resolved by the House-Senate conference: Capital Gains **********The conference dropped a House provision to shorten to six months from 12 months the period an asset must be held for profits to qualify as long-term capital gains. The maximum 20 percent capital gains tax will apply to assets sold after June 9, 1981. Estate Taxes **********Broad relief from estate and gift taxes was adopted. It will affect the estates of people who die after 1981, as well as their gifts and bequests. The present $175,000 exemption for transfers (bequests and gifts) will rise to $225,000 for 1982 and an annual increment thereafter to $600,000 in 1987. The maximum tax rate on estates and gifts was reduced from 70 percent now to 65 percent for 1982, 60 percent for 1983, 55 percent for 1984 and 50 percent for 1985 and later. Tax rates in excess of 50 percent now apply to taxable transfers in excess of $2.5 million. Amounts paid for someone else's school tuition or medical care will not be taxable as gifts.  Both Houses had voted to raise the annual exclusion for gifts to any one person to $10,000 from $3,000. Stock Option **********Both Houses voted to repeal the 1976 law that imposed ordinary income tax on executive stock options if there was a gain when the option was exercised. Both Houses voted to return to prior law under which profits on stock options were taxed only when the stock is sold. For existing options issued after 1975, executives will be allowed to exercise up to $200,000 of such options under the new law but no more than $50,000 worth in one year. For options issued after 1980, executives will be allowed to exercise up to $100,000 worth a year. Of unused amounts, half may be carried over for up to three years. Options may be good for up to 10 years. The option price must equal or exceed the value of the stock at the time the option is issued. Shareholder approval is required. Interest Exclusion **********A new 15 percent exclusion of interest income will go into effect in 1985 with limits of $450 for a single tax payer and $900 for a couple filing a joint return. However, in calculating the exclusion interest, income must first be reduced by interest payments - except for payments on a home mortgage or on business borrowing. Congress adopted this ''net interest'' approach because of the growing conviction that the law should not encourage the use of credit cards and other installment credit. Such interest payments remain deductable. The present exclusion of $200 of interest and dividend income ($400 for a couple) will revert in 1982 to the old exclusion of $100/$200 for dividends only. Commodities Straddles **********The conference adopted the tougher Senate version of a provision to apply new, tighter tax rules to speculation and commodities, including the profits of professional traders. The House bill would have exempted the professionals from the tougher language. Contributions **********The 70 percent of taxpayers who take the standard deduction would be allowed a special deduction for charitable contributions. In 1982-83, they would be allowed to deduct 25 percent of contributions up to $100 each year. In 1984, taxpayers would be allowed 25 percent up to $300. In 1985 they would be allowed to deduct 50 percent of contributions with no upper limit and in 1986 they would be allowed to deduct 100 percent without limit. The authority would lapse after 1986 unless renewed by Congress. Child-Care Credit **********The law now permits a credit for child care of 20 percent of expenses up to $2,000 for each of two or more children. The conference, working from a Senate provision, increased the credit to 30 percent for families with income under $10,000, with a reduction of one percentage point for every $2,000 of income from $10,000 to $30,000. The limits against which the credit may be applied are $2,400 of expenses for one child and $4,800 for two or more. Thus, the maximum credit for a family under $10,000 is $1,440. For a family above $30,000, the maximum credit is $960. Transit Bonds **********Public transit authorities such as the Metropolitan Transit Authority in New York may issue tax-exempt bonds to finance the purchase of buses and subway cars. By leasing the equipment from private companies, the transit authorities - themselves not Federal taxpayers - receive the cost reductions that flow from the 10 percent investment tax credit and the new, more generous depreciations. House Sales **********The conferees lengthened to 24 months from 18 months the period before or after the sale of a house or apartment in which the seller can avoid taxes on any profit by buying another residence of equal or greater value. The conferees also increased to $125,000 from $100,000 now the one-time exemption of profits on the sale of a home by persons aged 55 or older. Retirement Savings **********The maximum amount that may be paid into individual retirement accounts will rise in 1982 to $2,000 from $1,500 now. In addition, workers who are covered by an employer's pension plan will be allowed to make deductible contributions to an I.R.A., or may claim the deduction for money paid into the pension plan. Americans Abroad **********The conferees agreed to let Americans living and working abroad exclude up to $75,000 of wage and salary income in 1982, with the exclusion rising by $5,000 a year, to $95,000 in 1986. Eligibility is confined to persons who spent ll of 12 months outside the United States, or who had established a bona fide residence abroad."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/02/world/peking-stresses-economic-gains-as-party-priority.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterba", "pub_date": "1981-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 835, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PEKING STRESSES ECONOMIC GAINS AS PARTY PRIORITY", "print_headline": "PEKING STRESSES ECONOMIC GAINS AS PARTY PRIORITY", "body_text": " **********The Chinese Communist Party has published a platform of party goals that appeal to almost everyone except people opposed to continued Communist rule of China. **********The platform calls for slow but steady economic development and improvement of living standards, gradual extension of democracy under party control, a loose mix of public and private enterprise, a legal system that guarantees people's rights, a commitment to intellectual achievement, protection of religious freedom, a modernized army as the economy improves and more autonomy for ethnic minorities. **********At a rally in the Great Hall of the People today, the new party chairman, Hu Yaobang, said that China would stress the role of competent managers in a new era of orderly economic development and would no longer tolerate a single all-powerful ruler like Mao Zedong. (Page A12.) **********Problem of 'Degenerate Elements' The party platform calls for ''weeding out degenerate elements who oppress and bully the people.'' But, the platform warns, ''any word or deed which denies or undermines'' the party's leadership and its commitment to Communism ''cannot be tolerated.'' **********The statement of goals and policies is contained in a book-size assessment of the party's successes and mistakes being made public on the 60th anniversary of the party's founding in Shanghai in July 1921. The party assessment acknowledges major errors by party officials, including Mao, and pledges never allow them to happen again. **********Endorsed Saturday by the Central Committee, the platform amounts to an official endorsement of the policies that Deng Xiaoping, the party's senior deputy chairman and China's most powerful leader, set forth in December 1978, declaring political struggle to be subordinate to the goal of upgrading the living standards of China's one billion people. **********Political struggles have continued since then. Mr. Deng has forced supporters of radical Maoism out of power and shunted others aside in a systematic campaign to put supporters of his policies in leadership roles. That struggle reached a watershed of sorts on Monday when Mr.  Hu, a protege of Mr. Deng, was named party chairman replacing Hua Guofeng, a staunch supporter of Maoist policies that are now officially declared to have been wrong. **********The party's platform affirms Mr. Deng's goal of modernizing China ''systematically and in stages'' without resorting to unrealistic campaigns that in the past resulted in ''colossal waste and losses.'' **********It says that anyone who opposes Communism for China ''is wrong,'' but it calls for modifications to suit China's conditions.  Without the Communist Party in control, the platform says, ''our country, for a variety of reasons, both internal and external, would inexorably fall apart.'' Although the party will make mistakes, ''in no case should one use the party's mistakes as a pretext for weakening, breaking away from or even sabotaging its leadership,'' the document says. **********The platform says the biggest mistake the party made in the past was dwelling on class struggles against exploiters when they had long been basically wiped out, and not shifting in the 1950's to the goal of economic development. Private Enterprise Encouraged **********Although state enterprises and planning will predominate in China, the report said, private enterprise and market forces must complement and help government-run efforts to increase production. It urges flexibility, saying, ''There is no rigid pattern for the development of socialist relations of production.'' **********The party's political goals, the report says, include ''gradual establishment of a highly democratic socialist political system'' that will ''gradually realize direct popular participation'' in grassroots democracy.

The kind of chaotic situation that obtained in the Cultural Revolution must never be allowed to happen again in any sphere.'' Appeal to Intellectuals **********In an appeal to intellectuals, who were punished during the Cultural Revolution simply because they were educated, the party platform says: **********''We must firmly eradicate utterly fallacious views that denigrate education, science and culture, and discriminate against intellectuals.'' **********The party, it says, needs people who are both ''red and expert.'' In the past, being red meant being a good Communist and that was thought better than being an expert. **********The platform says that China's ethnic minorities, made up of 60 million people spread over half of the nation's territory, were gravely wronged during the Cultural Revolution by party leaders who attempted to force them to give up customs and traditions and adher to Communist practice. **********''We did not show due respect for their right to autonomy,'' the platform says.

They also said that they would like to be able to buy books on Jewish history and that they would frequent Jewish cafes and dining halls if they existed. **********The survey was privately organized by Jewish dissidents in 1976 to test the feelings about Jewishness among the large majority of Soviet Jews who had not taken steps to emigrate. Anyone who had applied for an exit visa was excluded from the poll. **********Data Analyzed Only Recently **********The data, smuggled out of the Soviet Union in 1977, was not processed until recently, when a private organization that does research on Jewish affairs, known as the Center Jewish Community, ran it through a computer and presented it to Israeli experts for analysis. **********The organization's report concluded that the study's main weakness was its sample, which could be neither random nor scientifically selected because of the Soviet Government's opposition to polling outside official auspices. **********Benjamin Fain, a physicist now at Tel Aviv University who organized the survey when he still lived in Moscow, said a questionnaire had been developed with the help of a Soviet anthropologist, Mikhail Chlenov, and a sociologist, who asked to remain anonymous. About 100 volunteer interviewers collected responses in different parts of the Soviet Union from Jews they knew or happened to meet. **********The polling method may have produced a bias in the sample toward those among the Soviet Union's 1.8 million Jews counted in the last census who felt their Jewishness more keenly than others. Most aspects of Jewish culture are suppressed by Soviet authorities, including Hebrew language instruction, religion, Jewish holiday celebration and the like, and many Jews regard themselves as assimilated into Russian culture. Material Escaped K.G.B. Searches **********Nevertheless, the Israeli report said, the study produced ''the only systematic data on Soviet Jews collected outside of Government sources.'' The K.G.B., the Soviet intelligence agency, confiscated all the response sheets, Mr. Fain said, but duplicate copies of 1,216 of the 1,500 had already been made and escaped the searches. **********The 1,216 responses reflected a spread of ages, economic levels and educational backgrounds approximating the Jewish population as a whole. Most answered affirmatively to questions on their sense of Jewishness: 77.8 percent said they would have an aversion to a close relative marrying a non-Jew, and 85.3 percent wanted their children or grandchildren to learn Yiddish or Hebrew. **********On similar questions, 55.7 percent said they would be willing to choose a Jewish name for a son; 86 percent said they would like their children to go to Jewish schools; 81.6 percent thought it would be desirable to establish a Russian langauge periodical on Jewish subjects; 59.3 percent observed some or all of the Jewish holidays, and 61.3 percent said they felt some connection with Jews abroad. **********The attitudes toward emigration divided along lines of region and age, with the small number opposing departure for Israel - 7.2 percent of the sample - being generally over 60 and from the Crimea and central Byelorussia, near Poland. Fifty-eight percent of the respondents said they believed emigration to Israel was a method of relating to Jewish life, and 34.8 percent saw it as a way to flee discrimination and improve living standards. **********The respondents were split on the desirability of having ''nationality'' listed on Soviet internal passports, which now label citizens as ''Russian,'' ''Jewish,'' ''Ukrainian'' and the like.  Sixty percent wanted the nationality deleted from the passports, 40 percent did not. **********A rule that would allow Jews to list themselves under any nationality would be welcomed by 47.8 percent, but only 17.3 percent said that they would want their children listed as other than Jewish. Even of those who would not list their children as Jewish, 93 percent said they would like to buy books on Jewish history. And 89 percent of those opposing immigration expressed the same inclination. **********''This points to the conclusion,'' the report said, ''that even the many Jews in the Soviet Union who would register their children as non-Jews and who condemn immigration to Israel probably want more opportunities for Jewish culture and association than are now available to them. That finding contradicts some of our earlier notions about Soviet Jews and clearly suggests that we should increase our efforts to prepare appropriate materials and find ways to get them to Jews behind the Iron Curtain.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/21/world/senate-to-move-on-state-dept-nominations.html": {"writer_name": "Juan de Onis", "pub_date": "1981-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 689, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SENATE TO MOVE ON STATE DEPT.

Squadron, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and president of the American Jewish Congress, said ''the ultimate solution is to be found'' when Arab countries accept Israel's right to exist and ''give up on the notion of erasing it.'' **********According to the Lebanese authorities, 300 people were killed and 800 wounded in last Friday's bombing by Israeli jets of sections of Beirut said by the Israelis to contain Palestinian guerrilla headquarters. The bombing was followed by rocket attacks on Israel, and the two sides have continued fighting since. **********In Boston, Leonard Fein, editor of Moment, a Jewish monthly, contended that the Beirut bombing was ''utterly without redeeming social or strategic value and an absolute violation of community standards.'' He asserted that Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel did not seem to acknowledge ''the urgent need for a political solution.'' 'Moral Outrage' at Bombing **********In Los Angeles, Rabbi Leonard I. Beerman of Leo Baeck Temple said that many people felt ''moral outrage'' at the bombing. He said Mr.  Begin's ''policy represents a danger'' to Jewish ideals and ''plays into the hands of Israel's enemies,'' giving them ''sympathy which they desperately need.'' **********The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations has invited Ephraim Evron, the Israeli Ambassador to the United States, to give it a briefing today. Its meeting was originally scheduled to oppose a planned Reagan Administration arms package for Saudi Arabia. **********Rabbi Israel Miller of Orange, N.J., past chairman of the conference, expressed ''sincere sorrow'' over the civilian losses in Beirut, but noted that the Palestine Liberation Organization was ''conducting a war'' that resulted in civilian casualties in Israel. **********''I still don't think we have all of the facts about why Israel did what it did,'' Rabbi Miller said. But he said that talks in the Camp David process begun by Israel and Egypt must continue to ''arrive at an equitable solution to enable peace.''

He saw ''unanimous hope that our country's efforts to obtain a sustained cease-fire in the area meet with success.'' **********In Philadelphia, David Tulin, president of the 3,000-member Americans for Progressive Israel, noted two issues: ''How to stop terrorism and how to protect the Jewish value system.'' Israel, he said, should declare that it would ''negotiate with any Palestinian group that recognizes the right of the Jewish state to exist and that ends all terrorist acts.'' **********Rabbi William Berkowitz, president of the Jewish National Fund, said the P.L.O. was operating out of southern Lebanon with the collusion of Syria and with increasing supplies of Soviet-bloc and Libyan weapons.

Many of the new products were partly or completely made overseas. **********\"The advent of offshore manufacturing has created a whole new threshold of pricing,\" said Edward Jeran, director of computer terminal sales for the Hazeltine Corporation.  His company is one of the largest American terminal makers aside from computer manufacturers such as the International Business Machines Corporation and the Digital Equipment Corporation. **********Behind Mr. Jeran, in the center of Hazeltine's booth at the conference, were streamers proclaiming the introduction of the company's $695 Esprit terminal, which was designed and manufactured in Taiwan. **********There are some discrepancies in the terminal/television parallel. A flood of low-priced television imports from Japan and elsewhere in the Far East in the 1970's led American manufacturers to move assembly operations overseas.  With terminals, the major manufacturers have been South Korean and Taiwanese companies, not Japanese, and rather than export under their own names, the makers are selling components or entire terminals to United States companies to market. **********The fiercest competition is in the low end of the market, the so-called dumb terminals.  These are used to enter data and instructions into a computer and to display the output of a computer, but they have no capabilities to operate when not attached to a computer. Industry officials and analysts say that with few special features, the dumb terminals compete mainly on the basis of price in a crowded marketplace.  There are about 25 independent manufacturers of dumb terminals, and they shipped 250,000 to 300,000 units last year, according to Gnostic Concepts Inc., a Menlo Park, Calif., market research firm. (The company's name comes from the Greek word gnosis, meaning knowledge.) **********\"The dumb terminal is almost a commodity item,\" said Robert H.  Katzive, program manager for computer projects at Gnostic Concepts.  \"The more commodity-like it becomes, the more likely it is for production to move offshore.\" U. S. Concern Started Price Cuts **********The latest round of price reductions was started by an American company, Applied Digital Data Systems Inc., which introduced a $650 terminal in March.  The Hauppauge, L. I., company, was acquired last year by the NCR Corporation, invested heavily to integrate vertically, building a plant in Utah that manufactures and assembles virtually all the components of a terminal. **********The competition was not far behind.  In addition to Hazeltine, Televideo Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., introduced an unsophisticated terminal this week with some components made in Korea. **********Televideo, which is headed by K. Philip Hwang, a Korean-born engineer, was actually the first company to take advantage of low-cost parts made in Korea.  Two years ago the company introduced a low-cost smart terminal--one that allows the user to edit what is on the screen-- and quickly became an industry leader in the sector. **********The Ampex Corporation, which has had Far Eastern manufacturing operations for 20 years, has also started to make terminals in Taiwan. **********Lear Siegler Inc., which in l979 was the largest independent supplier of dumb terminals, according to estimates by Gnostic Concepts, has not responded to the price reductions yet.  Suddenly, however, Lear Siegler finds itself with a product that costs $200 more than many comparable models, and it is debating its next move. But the company feels that its size will help protect its market, at least for a while. Adding Features **********Company officials say Lear Siegler has tried to cut manufacturing costs and has been buying more components overseas in the past two years. The company has also tried to add special features to its terminals, like the ability to recognize voices.  But those steps are not sufficient, the officials believe.  William A. Terry, president of Lear Siegler's data products division, said the company would respond to competition more vigorously in the next few months.  There was speculation that Lear Siegler would buy a complete low-end terminal from a foreign manufacturer and market it in the United States. **********Falling prices have made the terminal market an inhospitable one for some companies.  Just last week, the Perkin-Elmer Corporation announced it was halting sales of terminals for use in its own computer systems. \"It was a profitable operation, but we feel the margins aren't there,\" a company spokesman said. U. S. Retains Some Advantages Those in the industry say American companies will remain competitive in more sophisticated terminals, where much of the value is in software and special features, rather than hardware. **********A big question is whether the Japanese will enter the market in a big way.  Some, like Mr. Terry of Lear Siegler and Richard DuBridge, executive vice president of Televideo, do not expect that, arguing that the market is not big enough to interest the Japanese. **********Others, however, note that Japanese companies already make video display tubes that are used in terminals, including one made by I. B. M.  The Japanese companies also make sophisticated color display tubes, and since more and more terminals are being made with color capability, the Japanes stand to benefit. **********A French company, Alcatel-Electronique, is also gearing up to export terminals selling for a few hundred dollars or less, but companies in the market now say those terminals are aimed primarily at the home information-retrieval market, not the data-processing market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/21/business/edwards-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EDWARDS INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "EDWARDS INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/29/business/energywatch.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Energywatch", "print_headline": "Energywatch", "body_text": " **********MAY 22 Crude oil stocks dipped to 405.7 million barrels.

While no presidential election is scheduled until February 1984, the ''game'' has taken on urgency for Mr. Koivisto's rivals because the Prime Minister's popularity has continued to grow as the attacks on him increase. **********'Rises Above Party Politics' **********One reason was suggested last month by the Helsinki newspaper Uusi Suomi, which said that Mr. Koivisto managed once again during a television appearance to impress his viewers as a ''good-natured conciliator who rises above party politics.'' **********Although leading politicians, including even some Social Democrats, oppose him, the Prime Minister, with a quiet manner and the rugged appearance of an outdoorsman, has attracted wide support from rankand-file members across party lines. **********President Kekkonen, who is 80 and in his 26th year in office, is generally regarded as in his last term. He would apparently like to be succeeded by someone from his agrarian Center Party. However, public opinion polls show Mr. Koivisto outdistancing even President Kekkonen in popularity. The President has told visitors privately that he views Mr. Koivisto as a man who is unable to make a decision. **********The clash between the President and Prime Minister erupted April 2 when Mr. Kekkonen summoned Mr. Koivisto and reportedly accused him of holding up legislation dealing with budget matters. The next day Mr.  Kekkonen was described as wanting a change in Prime Ministers. Dispute Over Social Welfare **********The President's attitude was made known by Aarne Saarinen, the chairman of the Communist Party, upon emerging from the presidential residence, where he had gone to discuss a Cabinet problem. The Communist-dominated Finnish People's Democratic League, a member of the Koivisto-led coalition of Social Democrats, Centrists, Swedish People's Party members and an independent, had been balking at a proposal affecting social welfare. **********The Saarinen statement that Mr. Kekkonen had denounced the Prime Minister caused a storm in Finland but was not disavowed by the President. Finnish newspapers reported for days that the Koivisto coalition's days were numbered. But Mr. Koivisto refused to resign, creating what some experts described as a constitutional crisis unheard of in Finland, where a clash between President and Prime Minister had usually led to the Prime Minister's resignation. A Settlement Worked Out **********As the crisis appeared to be creating anti-Kekkonen feeling while adding to Mr. Koivisto's popularity, a settlement was worked out.  Officially, it was announced that the budgetary dispute would be left to Parliament to decide. It was generally understood, however, that Mr. Koivisto had won a round. **********The attacks on Mr. Koivisto apparently are continuing. Foreign Minister Paavo Vayrynen, who is chairman of the President's Center Party, stressed in a recent speech that it was absolutely necessary for Finland's President to have foreign-policy experience, since the chief of state conducts the nation's foreign policy in accordance with the Constitution. **********This was interpreted as an attack on Mr. Koivisto, who has served as Finance Minister twice and who is now in his second term as Prime Minister.

They emphasized that this figure was subject to re-estimation of revenue and spending. In any case, officials say that there is little the Administration can do now to affect 1982 outlays. Mr. Reagan has ruled out flatly any tax increase before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, 1982. **********As for 1983 and beyond, the Office of Management and Budget said in a memorandum to the President before he left for California last weekend that unless additional revenues are raised the budget deficit will persist in the range of $100 billion to $120 billion each fiscal year through 1986. Campaign for Tax Increases **********The memorandum appeared to be part of a continuing campaign by David A. Stockman, the budget director; James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, and Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, to persuade Mr. Reagan that fiscal prudence and a declining deficit trend require some selective tax increases. **********Federal health and budget officials also said today that the President wants Congress to authorize a modest charge for care given under the Medicaid program and will seek further reductions in the Federal subsidy for school lunch programs. (Page D14.) **********Mr. Reagan is determined to make no change in the three-year tax cut he sponsored and signed earlier this year and has otherwise professed to be deeply opposed to any form of tax rise. Yet, he has several times signaled that his view might be changed. **********For example, in an interview with several reporters on Dec. 23 he left open the possibility of an increase in excise taxes on tobacco, alcoholic beverages and possibly gasoline. **********''I don't think that consumption taxes are in direct opposition to the tax pro-gram we have instituted,'' Mr. Reagan said in the interview. In the past, the Administration has stressed its view of the importance to economic activity of reduced income tax rates. **********Pressed on excise taxes, Mr. Reagan added, ''If necessity could convince me that they had to be put into effect, I'd be more tolerant of those.'' Then he added, as he often does, ''I would not look kindly on any tax increase.'' **********Administration officials said that the White House has delayed submission of the budget for the fiscal year 1983 from Feb. 1 to Feb. 8 to give the budget office more time to prepare material that will explain proposed cuts in ''entitlements,'' which are expected to run to roughly $14 billion. **********Entitlements are benefits that individuals meeting certain criteria receive automatically. Under present law, such spending in the fiscal year 1982, which began Oct. 1, will total $200 billion for programs other than Social Security. **********The entitlement cuts will affect Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, school lunches and the formula for annual cost-of-living increases in civil service pensions, an Administration official said. Rather than a uniform across-the-board slash, each program will be narrowed and trimmed in particular ways. The White House evidently plans to take pains to explain these proposed changes to Congress, interest groups and the news media in hopes of softening opposition. Protected Benefits **********Omitted from the proposed list of cuts will be Social Security, unemployment insurance and black-lung benefits for miners, officials said. Congress tightened up on jobless benefits last summer and has just passed a bill revising black-lung benefits. Social Security payments of old-age, survivor and disability benefits are expected to climb from $158 billion in the fiscal year 1982 to $176.5 billion in the fiscal year 1983. After taking a political battering on his proposed Social Security cuts of last spring, Mr. Reagan has put off any further such effort until after the 1982 elections. The budget office estimated that under present law these outlays would reach $215 billion in 1986. **********Before leaving for his California ranch, Mr. Reagan resolved pending budget appeals, leaving for January decisions on whether to seek additional revenue and, if so, how. His proposed cuts were described by an Administration source as being ''in the low thirties.'' Some experts said this figure could be revised for a variety of reasons before the budget goes to the Government Printing Office. **********The President's decisions would reduce spending in some cases, particularly for entitlements, not from present levels but from the level spending would climb to if the law were unchanged. In such cases, 1983 spending could be ''cut'' and still be higher than in 1982. These proposed reductions would be in addition to the $35 billion of cuts Congress made last summer in the Budget Reconciliation Act. **********A bit more than half the budget cuts were in so-called discretionary programs, where Congress can cut spending without revising basic law. For example, spending for most energy programs would be cut by roughly one-third from 1981 levels to $2.8 billion in 1983. All major energy programs except the strategic oil reserve and nuclear weapons would be hit. **********The deficits projected in the memorandum to the President were based on an economic forecast described by an official as ''reasonable but on the optimistic side'' as well as an assumption that Congress would make all of the proposed entitlement and spending cuts. Because of the upward trend of some benefit programs under present law, the annual savings attributable to the proposed benefit cutbacks would in some cases increase over time. The budget office projected those savings at roughly $50 billion a year for 1984-86. **********Untouched in the budget exercise so far has been military spending. Under a decision by the President in late summer, Defense Department spending for military functions (a category that excludes nuclear weapons, now under the Department of Energy) must not exceed ceilings of $181.8 billion for 1982, $214.9 billion for 1983 and $242.6 billion for 1984. **********Mr. Stockman, it was understood, would be happy to see those levels reduced but has thought it unwise to reopen the campaign for retrenchment he waged publicly last summer with limited effect.  Moreover, there is some feeling in budget-making circles that it is more important to cut back not the 1983-84 spending rates but the spending authority for later years provided in the annual military appropriations. By 1986, according to some experts, military spending will reach $325 billion, a rise of one-third above the 1984 level."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/14/world/french-begin-vote-for-assembly-today.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Eder", "pub_date": "1981-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 850, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FRENCH BEGIN VOTE FOR ASSEMBLY TODAY", "print_headline": "FRENCH BEGIN VOTE FOR ASSEMBLY TODAY", "body_text": " **********Having elected Francois Mitterrand as President a month ago, the French will begin a two-stage vote tomorrow to determine the composition of the National Assembly. **********All indications are that the Socialist Party will take control of the legislature, replacing the present conservative majority. It may not be clear until a week from tomorrow, after the second stage of the vote, whether the Socialists will obtain a majority. Short of this, they are generally expected to win a plurality sufficiently strong to allow passage of Mr. Mitterrand's legislative programs. **********Although the Socialist Government has already used its decree powers to take a number of steps toward economic and social change, it will require parliamentary approval to achieve the kind of national transformation it aims at. **********The National Assembly, the lower but actually the effective house in the bicameral French Parliament, has 491 seats, all of which are at stake in the elections. At present the two conservative parties, the Gaullist Rally for the Republic and the Union for French Democracy, hold 274 seats; the Socialists hold 117, the Communists 86 and assorted independents 14. Polls Show Gain for Socialists **********Recent polls have given the Socialists, who obtained 24 percent of the vote in the 1978 legislative elections, anywhere between 32 and 36 percent. These percentages, if they hold through the two rounds of the voting, would give the Socialist Party and its small centrist ally, the Radical Left Movement, anywhere between 200 and 250 seats. **********The Communists, whose predicted percentage has ranged between 13 and 16 percent, could drop to somewhere between 40 and 60 seats. The two conservative parties, which are for the most part putting up a single candidate in each district but have otherwise failed to heal their deep splits, could get 200 to 230 seats, according to these estimates. **********In the two-stage system here, a candidate must obtain a majority of the votes cast tomorrow to win a seat. If there is no majority, the vote eliminates all but the two top-running candidates. The second vote chooses between the two and decides the seat. Because the right has managed to run a joint list, for the most part, its candidates, if they do not win outright, should make it to the finals in almost every district. The Socialists and the Communists, on the other hand, are running separate lists. **********Because of this, the main significant result of tomorrow's vote, aside from establishing percentages for the left and right, will be to determine the number of districts in which the Socialists displace the Communists as the front-runners on the left, thus qualifying as finalists in the second round on June 21. Plans for Cabinet Unclear **********The Communists seem likely to support most of the Socialist legislation, whether or not Mr. Mitterrand decides to name two or three Communist ministers to his post-election cabinet. His intentions in this question - one of strong interest to Washington and Bonn - are unknown, even to close associates. **********Still, the relative strength of Socialists and Communists is important, since it will affect the degree to which Mr. Mitterrand will be dependent on Communist support. The indications are that he will be able to do without it, if necessary. Even if the Socialist-Radical Left alliance is short of an Assembly majority by 20 or 30 seats, it should be possible to pick up needed votes from some elements among the conservative groups. **********After the intensive and emotional campaigning that preceded the presidential elections, the Assembly campaign has aroused relatively little interest. The Socialists' theme has been that by choosing Mr.  Mitterrand, France has decided for genuine change. Appealing to logic - one of the good appeals to make in a French election - the Socialists argue that the voters should now give Mr. Mitterrand the legislative means to make the changes. Limited Nationalization Planned **********Some areas, such as foreign and defense policy, do not require significant legislation. In any case, major changes are not under consideration in these areas, for the most part. But many of the social and economic changes do require parliamentary approval. Among these are a program of limited nationalization, a change in tax laws aimed at increasing the contributions of the wealthy and of large businesses, government decentralization and regionalization, and increased public supervision over private and religious schools. **********The Communists' theme has been that the voters should choose Communist deputies to keep the Socialists honest and discourage them from sliding to the right. **********The conservatives have had the most trouble in working out a line of attack. Mr. Mitterrand's Government, which has taken a series of modest but generally popular measures, has not yet done anything to cause it to be attacked very hard. There are accusations, some of them fairly plausible, of confusion and unclear purposes, but by and large the French seem inclined to grant a new Government the right to be confused for a month or two."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/17/business/fund-to-sell-am-stake.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1981-11-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 938, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FUND TO SELL AM STAKE", "print_headline": "FUND TO SELL AM STAKE", "body_text": " **********The Madison Fund Inc., acknowledging what appeared to be a major investment miscalculation, said yesterday that it would attempt to sell its 16 percent stake in ailing AM International Inc., the moneylosing maker of engineering graphics and information processing systems. **********Madison, a prosperous Wall Street investment management concern based in New York added, however, that it ''anticipates difficulties'' in finding a buyer. AM International has said it is on the brink of default on $106 million in revolving credit agreements with 19 banks. The company expects to report a loss of $175 million for the fiscal year 1981. **********In a lawsuit filed against five former AM International executives and directors, plus its former investment house and auditing concern, Madison charged that the company's prospects were seriously overstated early this year when Madison agreed to become AM's largest shareholder. Madison invested $28 million. **********In its suit, filed last Thursday in the Federal Court for the Southern District of New York, Madison charged that AM ''has suffered massive losses, is financially incapable of carrying out its business plans'' and that it ''is struggling to maintain its very existence.'' Richard B. Black, chairman and chief executive of AM, said through a company spokesman that he would not comment on the suit. **********Madison is seeking ''not less than $27 million'' in damages from its ill-fated involvement with AM. The defendants in the suit are four former executives, including Roy L. Ash, the company's deposed chairman, and John P. Birkelund, a director who is now president and chief operating officer of Dillon Read & Company. Other defendants include the New Court Securities Corporation, the investment house headed by Mr. Birkelund at the time of Madison's investment; and the company's auditor, Price Waterhouse & Company. Mr. Black, who replaced Mr. Ash last February, was not named in the suit. A $20 Million Loss **********As it now stands, Madison has lost on paper approximately $20 million of the $28 million invested in AM stock, or about 16 percent of its common shares, which it acquired last winter. Its arrival in AM's camp was resisted by Mr. Ash and was the flash point in the dispute that brought about his dismissal. Mr. Ash was director of the Office of Management and Budget from 1972 through 1975, before taking the reins at AM in 1976. **********Most of Madison's stake in AM, 1,475,000 shares, was purchased at an average price of $17.33 a share. It later purchased 161,000 shares at a lower cost of $15 to $16.50 a share in the open market. Last Friday Madison valued the stock at $3 a share, or roughly $5.2 million of Madison's $572 million in total assets. AM shares closed at 3 3/4 yesterday, off 1 1/4, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The Madison Fund, which reported a market value of $24.93 a share on its investments last Friday, also lost ground. It closed at 18 1/4, off 1/4 on the Big Board. **********The AM ''common stock purchased by Madison Fund is now substantially worthless and unsalable,'' the fund charged in its legal brief. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, a prominent Wall Street law firm, is Madison's adviser in the suit. **********The document charged the former AM officers and agents with ''fraud, deception, concealment, suppression and false pretense'' in soliciting the Madison investment. It said ''a very substantial portion'' of the $158 million loss reported by AM in the first six months of 1981 actually was caused by problems in the last two quarters of 1980 (and the first half of AM's fiscal year), prior to Madison's investment. Those recently reported losses were ''concealed by overstatements'' of assets and profits, ''and understatements'' of losses and debts. **********William B. Breed Jr., Madison's executive vice president, said in an interview that the fund was on solid financial footing despite the apparent setback with AM. Indeed, Madison reported $31 million in profits last week on the sale of its 18.5 percent holding in General Portland Inc., which it had acquired for $30 million in the last 18 months. In Default Nov. 4 **********AM International was placed in technical default on Nov. 4 on $106 million in revolving credit agreements with 19 banks. It has received a 45-day reprieve from its lenders. **********Warren Beck, an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc., in Los Angeles, said a survival plan for AM was expected to be presented by Mr. Black, perhaps by the end of this week. An audit by Arthur Andersen & Company must be completed before the new AM plans can be disclosed. **********The Andersen firm, with headquarters in Chicago, was named by AM directors to replace Price Waterhouse as the company's independent auditor after Mr. Black's appointment. Mr. Black, formerly chief executive of the Maremont Corporation, in Chicago, moved AM's headquarters from Los Angeles to Chicago on Sept. 1. **********Mr. Black has already announced his intention to sell or write off $175 million of AM International's business, slashing shareholder investment to about $80 million, from $225 million, in the process. **********''This has to go down as one of the biggest writedowns, on a percentage basis, in the annals of corporate history,'' Mr. Beck said. ''I think you do have a value of roughly $200 million here. But it could be that they have just a fire sale in mind.'' Some analysts have said they believe that Mr. Black's plan will be to sell the remaining AM operations and distribute the equity to shareholders."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/18/world/in-bogota-rebel-daring-vs-the-club.html": {"writer_name": "Warren Hoge", "pub_date": "1981-08-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IN BOGOTA, REBEL DARING VS.

The army is being accused of torturing and killing peasants and dissident politicians who have no connection to the guerrillas. **********Speaking at the inauguration of a rural clinic Saturday, Mr. Turbay called proposals for an unconditional pardon ''diabolical.'' At issue are the fates of leftist militants now serving prison sentences for crimes like arson and murder in a noncombant situation. 'One Can Think as One Wants' **********''In Colombia, one can think as one wants, one can disagree with the Government as much as one wants, but always within the confines of the law,'' he said. ''What one cannot do, especially under my administration, is to violate the Constitution and the law with impunity.'' **********Gen. Luis Carlos Camacho Leyva, the Defense Minister, who is often accused of exercising more authority than a democracy should allow, was even more emphatic. ''Either the rebels submit themselves to the law and the courts or they will be exterminated by the armed forces, who will not give them a moment's rest,'' he said. **********Some Colombians have likened the struggle here to those occurring in Central America, but the comparison is simplistic and only serves to cloud the uniqueness of the Colombian situation. The repression that exists here is far less than in countries like Guatemala and El Salvador, and the tradition of elected government is far stronger here. **********The issue in Colombia is how a democratic nation can deal with armed internal opposition. The specter frequently summoned up by critics is Uruguay, where a representative government faced with guerrilla attack ceded more and more power to the military until the armed forces finally took over the country. Theatrics vs. Predictability **********M-19, the dominant group, has never clearly articulated its prescription for Colombia's 26 million people. But it has attracted support and capitalized on the numbing predictability of Colombian politics through daring theatrics like embassy takeovers and the theft of Simon Bolivar's sword from a museum. **********Two days before the July 22 expiration of the four-month-long amnesty offer, M-19 guerrillas lobbed three 60-millimeter training mortar shells into the grounds of the presidential palace in downtown Bogota and kidnapped the country's leading television star for 20 hours to gain publicity for a counter proposal. Photographs published the next day showed the talk show host, Fernando Gonzalez Pacheco, conversing over a drink with Jaime Bateman Cayon, the M-19 leader and Colombia's most-wanted man. **********By contrast, delegates at regional Liberal Party conventions on Friday were busy promoting the candidacy of former President Alfonso Lopez Michelson for the coming race, in which the Conservative Party candidate will be one of two men who have run for President before and lost or a third who was President immediately before Mr. Lopez. **********In terms of illustrating the clubbishness of Colombian public life, the contest could end up rivaling the 1974 vote, in which the three final candidates were all sons of previous presidents. Colombia's Political Immobility **********''News of political changes occurring in the great democracies seem to come from another planet,'' said Alfredo Vazquez Carrizosa, a former Foreign Minister who is now a newspaper columnist. ''The characteristic phenomenon of Colombian political life is immobility.'' **********The indifference bred by this has angered military leaders, who feel it has cost them the popular support they deserve. At the end of an impassioned four-hour debate in the Senate Wednesday night, General Camacho Leyva eyed a group of critical young legislators who call themselves ''New Liberals'' and said bitingly, ''One of the reasons my men are falling in combat is to protect your right to say the things you're saying here.'' **********In his ''point of no return'' speech, General Fernando Landazabal Reyes, commander of the army said, ''It is necessary that the leading social, political and economic classes understand in its full dimension the threat to the country of the subversion and that they exercise their influence so that the armed forces will be respected in their efforts to bring peace to the country.'' **********Neither of the two political parties has been able to make substantial headway in improving the uneven distribution of income, one of the most uneven in South America. The middle class is being particularly squeezed by inflation, which has been running at 30 percent a year during the Turbay administration. Sympathy for Rebels **********To the extent that the rebel groups draw attention to these conditions, they attract the sympathy, if not the support, of large parts of the population. **********In two open letters, a group of prominent Colombians, including a former President, called on President Turbay to accept talks proposed by Mr. Bateman. The rebel leader has vowed to try to sabotage next spring's elections in the absence of an agreement with the Government to sit down and talk. **********Msgr. Dario Castrillon Hoyos, Bishop of Pereira, said in a magazine article that the Government was portraying such peace talks as ''a meeting between dirty criminals and clean cassocks.'' **********''It isn't only those in arms who are violent, but also those official elements who commit violence against people like peasants who can't defend themselves,'' the church leader said. Resurgence Surprises Generals **********The resurgence of the rebels has surprised military leaders, who thought they eliminated them in a seven-week jungle campaign four months ago. Two columns of guerrillas, trained in Cuba and infiltrated through Panama, were almost wiped out by the army at that time, prompting General Camacho Leyva to say the insurgents were ''virtually annihilated.'' **********In recent weeks, however, rebels have inflicted significant losses on army troops. In addition, they have left behind propaganda messages indicating that individual groups like M-19 and the pro-Soviet Colombian Armed Revolutionary Forces were overcoming ideological differences that had long kept them at odds. **********''This is very disturbing,'' said an officer who requested anonymity. ''The FARC have a well-disciplined underground structure and long experience as fighters, but without much support.

The number of workers for each rice paddy was reduced. The time of harvesting was shortened.  The community structure changed. **********So when a new rice - a sturdy, fast-growing, high-yielding variety called IR-8 - was introduced in 1966, it promised something called a Green Revolution in Asia. With its introduction came the promise of eventual self-sufficiency in rice and a new way of life. This hope was stirred despite some initial controversy. In some of the countries of the Indochinese peninsula, for example, the grains were considered ''American,'' and therefore subversive, and the seed was sometimes planted there surreptitiously. **********Fifteen years later, countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are within reach of the goal of self-sufficiency.  And the Philippines, a rice importer until 1976, is now an exporter, with overseas sales of 250,000 metric tons in 1980. ''It was a victory,'' said a spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture. Developed for Ideal Sites **********But one shortcoming of the Green Revolution has been that IR-8 and other varieties based on that strain were developed for planting under the best circumstances: irrigated paddies where fertilizers could be used. Under those conditions, the new rice strains tripled production. But the conditions exist only for a small percentage of rice farmers. **********''More than three-fourths of the world's farmers still do not grow the new rices,'' said Nyle C. Brady, director general of the International Rice Research Institute, an institution supported by the United Nations, the European Economic Community, the Asian Development Bank, the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and several nations, including the United States. **********''The reason is too little or too much water for the strains we have developed,'' he said, ''or the soil is too salty, acid or sandy. Our research is now focused on helping these farmers who have not had the benefit of the Green Revolution.'' Luzon Output Rises Sharply **********Nevertheless, in the past 10 years under a Government-sponsored program called Masagana 99, rice production in the Philippines' fertile Luzon area has climbed from 2.2 metric tons of rice from a hectare to an average of 3.3 tons, or a rise from just under one ton an acre to one and a half. **********''If there had not been a Green Revolution, most of the countries of Asia would be short, maybe desperately short, of rice,'' said Surajit K. Da Datta, an agronomist at the research institute. ''Now they are keeping up with their population gains, making up the difference that a slightly higher standard of living has on rice demand and in some cases moving from importer to exporter.'' **********It takes five or six years to develop and test a new rice that will produce guaranteed results. Grain by grain, under sterile conditions, the rices are catalogued and indexed for size, color and shape, so farmers can request by number the rice that meets their needs. The most popular rice now being grown in Southeast Asia is IR-36. Resistance to Pests **********IR-36 combines the characteristics of IR-8 with a high resistance to pests. But it does not grow well in deep water or in drought areas. ''In Bangladesh, for example, two million hectares of land are under deep water,'' said Gurdev S. Khush, a breeder at the institute. ''India needs rice that will take long periods of drought. Ideally, what we need is a rice that will tolerate both floods and droughts, since most of the world's farmers rely on monsoons for their water.  If we can solve this problem, we will have a truly miracle rice.'' **********What the new rice promises is a new way of life for rice farmers, greater employment opportunities and development of local subsistence economies. ''There has been a lot of talk about who wins and who loses,'' said Robert W. Herdt, an agricultural economist at the institute. **********''It takes so little to influence the structure of subsistence economies. The introduction of a new rice can do that. With each variation, we create ripples in the local economy,'' he said. **********The impact of the Green Revolution on the Philippines has been the development of rice barter and trade and a general increase in the income of rice farmers. **********Since most of the farmers grew rice primarily for their own families, extra rice crops were cash crops. With ample rice and additional money, farmers became consumers. Health improved. The standard of living increased. **********''Our studies show that hired labor in central Luzon earned 320 kilograms of rice per hectare in 1966 and 543 kilograms per hectare in 1979,'' Mr. Herdt said. ''Much of our work in this phase of rice development is aimed at insuring that more, not less, employment is created by the new technology.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/01/world/soviet-says-us-seeks-military-edge-at-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 174, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Says U.S. Seeks Military Edge at Talks", "print_headline": "Soviet Says U.S. Seeks Military Edge at Talks", "body_text": " **********As Soviet-American talks opened today in Geneva on the reduction of medium-range nuclear arms in Europe, Soviet leaders issued a statement accusing the United States and its NATO allies of entering the negotiations with a plan to obtain ''military advantages.'' **********The statement dismissed President Reagan's proposal two weeks ago that both sides renounce land-based nuclear missiles in Europe, calling it an attempt to obtain ''the Soviet Union's unilateral disarmament.'' **********It added, ''The Soviet Union will not agree to this.'' **********The statement, made by the Communist Party's Politburo, appeared to be aimed at public opinion in Western Europe.

The $6.75 billion financing package and the size of the note offerings were slightly less than traders had expected. How Similar Maturities Did **********Among actively traded Treasury issues with maturities similar to the new issues, the 13 1/4 percent notes due in August 1984 closed at 97 2/32 to yield 14.38 percent, the 13 percent notes due in November 1980 were at 95 to yield 13.96 percent and the 12 3/4 percent bonds due in 2010 were at 94 3/4 to yield 13.47 percent. **********Besides a lack of investor demand, securities dealers said, prices drifted lower because of uncertainty about how high short-term interest rates might go as the Federal Reserve seeks slower growth of the money supply. **********''We are fairly certain that the Fed is trying to make reserves scarcer, but nobody knows just how scarce,'' one dealer explained.  Securities dealers are sensitive to bank reserve positions because overnight financing costs will tend to rise if bank reserves are less available and as the rate on Federal funds rises. **********Bank reserves were exceptionally scarce yesterday, despite a variety of moves by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to inject credit into the banking system temporarily. Overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market were as high as 24 percent and averaged 19 percent, but analysts said the Fed and Treasury actions were a signal that reserves were scarcer than authorities wanted. They pointed out that reserve availability is often abnormal on Wednesday, the last day of the banking system's statement week. Temporary Transactions **********To supply reserves, the Fed arranged one-day purchases of securities and then told dealers it would consider more such transactions. The Fed was unable to supply as much credit to the banking system as it wanted, dealers said, because firms did not have enough securities to sell to the Fed temporarily. **********The Fed also bought $375 million of Treasury bills for a customer account, which analysts said showed that the Fed did not want to drain credit from the banking system. It also helped reduce Treasury bill rates, while other money market rates moved higher. **********The Treasury, in another move to ease the squeeze on bank reserves, arranged large transfers of money into special tax and loan accounts it has with banks. **********Amid extreme uncertainty about interest rates, traders in the money markets said, most investors were not willing to buy paper due in more than 30 days. At 15 1/2 percent, top-quality 30-day commercial paper attracted a good flow of funds, while the 10 largest banks were said to be issuing 30 day certificates of deposit with a yield of about 15 3/4 percent. The commercial paper rate has increased about a percentage point since Monday. High Yield but Weak Demand **********In the corporate bond market, a record yield of 15.93 percent for triple-A Bell System debentures was not enough to attract strong investor demand. Michigan Bell's $250 million issue of 15 3/4 percent issue due in 2020 was allowed to trade freely, and by late in the day the issue was offered at about 97 to yield 16 1/4 percent. **********Among new issues, the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission's $100 million of A-1 15 percent debentures, being offered through a First Boston Corporation group, were priced for sale today at 97 3/4 to yield 15.45 percent. **********Elsewhere in the corporate bond market, the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation postponed a proposed issue of mortgage revenue bonds that would have made it the first housing authority to issue taxable bonds. In the past, state and local authorities have issued taxexempt bonds, but their volume has declined this year since the Federal Government set limits on the amount and structure of such bond issues."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/24/world/restoration-scandal-anne-hyde-and-james.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 327, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RESTORATION SCANDAL: ANNE HYDE AND JAMES", "print_headline": "RESTORATION SCANDAL: ANNE HYDE AND JAMES", "body_text": " **********Not for 321 years has an heir to the British throne married an Englishwoman.

The Duke, who had just had an unhappy affair with a married aristocrat, decided it was best to fullfill his promise. They were secretly married in September, preparing a backdated contract. **********In October, the child was born, only to die in infancy. James was King from 1685 to 1688.

But the law has failed to stop a boom in the trading of gold and silver objects, colonial-era paintings and centuries-old pottery. **********''In the past 10 years, the illegal trade has flourished, especially toward the United States and Europe,'' a senior official of the National Institute of Culture said recently. **********''Most of our best pieces are already abroad and if it continues, Peru will be left with only a mediocre collection of its own antiques,'' he said. **********Clients are wealthy, cultured and demanding. ''They want only the best,'' he said, ''which is why the finest pieces disappear.'' Furious at the appearance of Peruvian treasures in foreign auctioneers' catalogues, the Government decided earlier this year to take action to halt the trade. **********It achieved an immediate success when the New York branch of Sotheby Parke Bernet, the art auctioneers, withdrew from a sale of seven colonial paintings that the Peruvian Government charged had been stolen from Peruvian churches and museums. **********Six were returned to Peru after the Government presented documentary evidence to back its claim. It is now seeking to recover 46 more earmarked for auction. **********Cultural officials said the recovery marked an important precedent and had apparently already discouraged some collectors from buying Peruvian works. **********A longer-term achievement was the signing of the agreement with the United States Government to speed up repatriation of stolen antiques.  The agreement, similar to one signed between the United States and Mexico in 1970, will allow the Peruvian Government to bypass the courts and obtain quick recovery of treasures if they can prove they have been stolen. **********''Legal proceedings are lengthy and costly,'' one cultural official said. ''While they go on, the antiques deteriorate because they are not properly stored.'' **********The Institute of Culture said more than 5,000 works of art were stolen last year, and the main targets were churches in the region of Cuzco, the ancient capital of the Incas 365 miles east southeast of Lima. The Incas dominated the region at the time of the Spanish conquest in 1532, and the area is filled with Incan and colonial relics, which have made it one of the most famed archeological regions of the continent. **********Most of the region's 305 chapels and churches have been pillaged of their finest treasures and archeological sites have been cleared by clandestine digging. **********The local authorities are installing burglar alarms in 18 of the most important churches.  Mayor Willy Monzon said the budget of less than $25,000 was not enough to provide adequate security in the cathedral, which overlooks Cuzco's central square and was built in 1564. **********''The only protection our churches has is the good faith of the local people,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, that is no longer sufficient.'' **********Mr. Monzon charged that local people carried out the robberies on the orders of outside dealers. ''They are as well organized as the drug traffickers,'' he said. **********Government officials agree. ''The financing and organization comes from abroad and the locals are used for the dirty work,'' one official said. **********The Government is also taking action at home.

The question, of course, assumes that Congress will adopt the program pretty much as the President has proposed it. But even if the President gets nearly all he wants from Congress, he has warned the public not to expect a swift cure for the economy's ills. **********His economists are forecasting a slow recovery this year, with the real gross national product advancing only 1.1 percent, consumer prices climbing 11.1 percent and unemployment averaging 7.8 percent (compared with 7.4 percent in January). **********Those figures are roughly in line with the consensus forecast of private economists for 1981. The ''Blue Chip'' consensus of 42 private economic forecasting units, regularly assembled by Eggert Econometric Enterprises of Sedonia, Ariz., shows a gain of ninetenths of 1 percent in real G.N.P. for this year, an inflation rate of 11.4 percent in the Consumer Price Index and an unemployment rate of 7.8 percent in the year's final quarter. **********Among the forecasters included in the Eggert survey are such financial institutions as Citibank, Bank of America and Chase Manhattan, and such econometric services as Data Resources, Wharton and Chase Econometrics. **********Despite much public disparagement of economic forecasting, the consensus forecasts have been remarkably close to the mark in recent years. Last year, the consensus forecast a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in real G.N.P.; the actual result was a decline of two-tenths of 1 percent. For the years 1977 through 1980, the consensus underestimated actual growth by an average of only one-half of a percentage point a year and was consistently right in the direction of change. **********However, the consensus forecast regularly underestimated inflation. In the 1977-through-1980 period, the average error was a shortfall of eight-tenths of 1 percent. But on unemployment, the consensus erred on the high side, overshooting by an annual average of four-tenths of 1 percent. **********Though the Reagan Administration has stuck close to the consensus forecast for 1981, its model is more optimistic on 1982. Five major econometric concerns are forecasting real G.N.P. to rise by 3.6 percent in 1982, while the Reagan economists predict a rise of 4.2 percent. The econometric services foresee consumer prices rising by 9.7 percent in 1982, but the Reagan economists say they will go up by only 8.3 percent. **********Thereafter, the Reagan economists part further with private economists using standard econometric models. For instance, the Reagan forecast, set forth in ''America's New Beginning: A Program for Economic Recovery,'' projects a 5 percent increase in real G.N.P. for 1983, while Data Resources is projecting a 2.9 percent gain. **********The Reagan scenario gradually grows rosier and rosier. As a result of five years of steady growth in real G.N.P., averaging 4.4 percent a year, the Reagan economists say that the Consumer Price Index will be rising by 4.2 percent in 1986, with unemployment averaging 5.6 percent that year. **********Is this script credible? The Reagan forecasters were constrained by reality in 1981 and held close to the consensus forecast of private economists. But the big test of whether Reaganomics will follow the script laid out by the Reagan plan for economic recovery will come late in 1982, when the White House says it intends to reduce inflation to close to 6 percent. **********Meanwhile the financial markets remain highly skeptical, as do most private economists, both conservative and liberal, monetarist and Keynesian. For the Reagan economists have projected nominal economic growth - real increases in national output plus inflation - averaging 11.3 percent for the years 1981 through 1986. That would mean an 87 percent rise in current-dollar G.N.P., to the Reagan projection of $4,918 billion in 1986 from $2,629 billion in 1980. **********Yet, to slow down inflation, the Reagan plan calls for the annual rate of growth of the money supply to be cut in half, averaging about 4.5 percent, in line with the anticipated growth of real G.N.P. At the end of 1980, the most commonly used measure of the money supply, M-1B, which includes currency, demand deposits and other checkable deposits at banks and thrift institutions, totaled $412 billion. If that measure grew at a compound annual rate of 4.5 percent, the money supply would total $536 billion by the end of 1986, an increase of only 30 percent over its level at the end of 1980. **********Can so little growth in money support so huge a growth in currentdollar G.N.P.? From 1980 to 1986, the Reagan plan foresees a growth of $2,289 billion in nominal G.N.P. and an increase of $124 billion in the money supply (M-1B.) **********If the Federal Reserve holds to those money-supply guidelines, that would imply continuous pressure on interest rates, and slower real growth than the Administration is projecting. But if the Fed goes above the money-supply guidelines, that would imply higher inflation than the Administration is predicting. The way the Administration has laid out its plan, something has got to give."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/business/godfrey-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-may-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 51, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GODFREY CO reports earnings for Qtr to May 30", "print_headline": "GODFREY CO reports earnings for Qtr to May 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/07/world/us-academic-experts-predict-power-struggle.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1981-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 959, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. ACADEMIC EXPERTS PREDICT POWER STRUGGLE", "print_headline": "U.S. ACADEMIC EXPERTS PREDICT POWER STRUGGLE", "body_text": " **********The death of President Anwar el-Sadat, at a time of internal unrest, is expected to ignite a power struggle, according to interviews with American analysts of Egyptian affairs. **********Nadav Safran, professor of government at Harvard University. said: ''With the death of Sadat, power and the direction of Egypt's foreign and domestic policies are up for grabs among the generals, cabinet ministers and aides who worked closely with him.'' **********In addition to the impact on Egyptian politics, Professor Safran said, the assassination will have ramifications for Arab-Israel relations. **********''Sadat looked as though he was going to get away with it,'' said Mr. Safran, ''He had made his separate peace with Israel, survived the Arab boycott and his regional isolation. Other Arab leaders were beginning to draw the lesson that maybe peace with Israel was politically possible. The peace plan proposed last summer by Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia was an indication of that trend. Now Sadat is dead, and that lesson is not going to be lost on other Arab leaders. You can look for Fahd to take more of a hard line the next time he makes a speech.'' **********Speaker to be Titular Leader **********There is no indication who President's Sadat's successor will be.  For the next 60 days, until an election can be organized, a temporary president, Sufi Abu Taleb, the Speaker of Parliament, will be the titular leader. **********Vice President Hosni Mubarak, Mr. Sadat's longtime protege, will exercise effective authority through his control of the armed forces and key government posts and he is the apparent frontrunner in any race for the presidency, according to the analysts.. **********But even if Mr. Mubarak is chosen, the analysts said, it will take him several months at least to consolidate his grip on the sprawling bureaucracy, the army and the public at large. **********In the meantime, rivals for power are likely to challenge his authority in the political back alleys, as they did when Mr. Sadat succeeded Gam el Abdel Nasser in 1970, and when Mr. Nasser toppled King Farouk i n 1952. **********Mr. Mubarak's tenuous position will not only limit his room for maneuver in domestic and foreign affairs, but could force him, or his rivals, to appeal for support to internal political groups or outside powers that have not previously been a factor in Egyptian politics. Sadat's Policies May Be Reviewed **********''By their very nature,'' Raymond Baker of Williams College said, ''power struggles in Arab politics reopen issues about foreign affairs and domestic politics that once appeared settled.'' **********To a great degree, Professor Baker said, many of those issues were reopened in recent months. The Egyptian unrest was sparked by sectarian clashes between Moslems and Coptic Christians, but it developed into a more broadly based opposition movement. Left-wing intellectuals and right-wing Moslem extremists found common cause in decrying Mr. Sadat's rule and staged the most violent demonstrations since he came to power 11 years ago. **********The severity of the demonstrations was reflected in Mr. Sadat's decision early last month to arrest 1,500 of his opponents, mostly Moslem extremists. But they also included some of the nation's best known political personalities, notably Mohammed Hassanein Heikal, a confidant of Mr. Nasser. Results of Camp David Talks **********''Sadat promised that Camp David would provide real peace and real prosperity,'' said Mr. Baker, referring to the accords signed with Israel in 1978. **********''But the average Egyptian was beginning to realize that it brought neither. This increasing awareness was at the root of the latest disturbances. All of these issues - relations with the West, with Israel, with the surrounding Arab states, the direction of the economy -are still lying in the street, ready to be picked up by any contender for power. **********''Sadat's death opens the possibility of realignment in these areas. It will be easy for Mr. Mubarak's rivals to seek popularity by pandering to these issues.'' Malcolm Kerr, a political scientist of the University of California at Los Angeles, said that, even if Vice President Mubarak were able to obtain power, it was not immedia tely certain that he would continue Mr. Sadat's policies. **********''A lot will depend on who is found to be responsible for Sadat's assassination and how Mubarak interprets the opposition that has built up in recent months,'' Professor Kerr said. ''He may seek to make a quick accommodation with the domestic opposition to consolidate his own hold on power.'' Accords May Become Unraveled **********This could lead to some degree of cooling in Egypt's relations with both Israel and the United States, which in turn could set off a chain of events that might unravel the Camp David accords. Relations with the other Arab countries, almost all of whom have severed diplomatic ties with Egypt, are also expected to undergo a major change, the analysts said. **********Rapprochement with Egypt was impossible for any Arab leader as long as Mr. Sadat was in power. Now Saudi Arabia and the other conservative Persian Gulf states are expected to make it easy for Mr. Sadat's successor to return to the Arab fold, both to entice him away from Israel and to bolster the ranks of the conservative states in their competition with the more radical Arab regimes. **********As for Egypt's relations with Syria, Libya or the Palestine Liberation Organization, a rapprochement will depend on how far Mr.  Sadat's successor is ready to move toward their end of the political spectrum. The radical Arab regimes can be expected to use whatever means possible to influence the selection of Egypt's new president."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/30/business/company-briefs-072375.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 309, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** American Motors Corp. said it would suspend vehicle production at two United States plants for one week next week to balance inventories with slow sales, temporarily idling 6,000 workers at its Kenosha, Wis., and Toledo, Ohio plants. *********** Digilog Inc. said it was back in production and shipping against a $6 million backlog following substantial damage to its Horsham, Pa., headquarters by fire. *********** Ensource Inc. said it would purchase up to three million of its common shares from time to time in the open market or in negotiated transactions until late April 1982. *********** Forest Oil Corp. said its estimated net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves rose to $1.02 billion as of Oct. 1, a 25 percent increase from its Dec. 31, 1980, approximation. *********** Fremont General Corp. announced it had entered into a letter of intent to acquire 54 percent of the stock outstanding of Maxicare Health Plans Inc. for an amount estimated at $7.6 million. *********** General Motors Corp. said it planned to close its Willow Run, Mich., assembly plant for three weeks beginning Nov. 9, resulting in 5,000 temporary layoffs. *********** Health-Chem Corp. said it agreed to develop cardiovascular products with Marion Laboratories Inc.

It said it might buy as much as 20 percent so that it could add that much of Conoco's profits to its own. Dome stressed that it did not want control of Conoco; rather it was seeking a way to swap the stock for the Conoco block in Hudson's Bay, without Conoco's having to pay a capital gains tax. Valuing Hudson's Bay Stock **********Although Dome did not say how much it would offer for the Hudson's Bay block, it suggested that 14 million Conoco shares should be sufficient. At $910 million, Dome's opening bid for Hudson's Bay thus totaled about $22.75 a share. **********Conoco then sued Dome, contending, among other things, that the offer was ''grossly inadequate.'' It added on Tuesday that it was negotiating with others to sell the Hudson's Bay shares. By late Wednesday, Husky identified itself as one of the others, but said that ''no understandings or agreements'' had been reached. **********Dome is known to have asked Conoco to supply it with inside information supplied to other bidders, but Conoco is understood to have refused unless Dome withdrew its tender offer. **********Mr. Gallagher had written earlier to Mr. Bailey, asking for a meeting ''to reach an agreement,'' and said that he was prepared to add cash to whatever amount of stock Dome would offer for the Hudson's Bay block. Adding a new element, he said that even if Conoco sold its Hudson's Bay block to someone else, it ''would not necessarily lead to the withdrawal of our tender offer.'' **********Mr. Bailey replied that he might now make the inside information available, if Dome signed a confidentiality pledge. He added that Conoco preferred a cash transaction, but assailed Mr. Gallagher's remark about not necessarily withdrawing its tender as one that ''raises serious questions as the true motivation of your actions.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/21/business/fcc-delay-on-phone-plan-forecast.html": {"writer_name": "Ernest Holsendolph", "pub_date": "1981-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 702, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "F.C.C.

But Joseph R. Fogarty, a commission member who specializes in telephone regulation, said that implementation of the program could slip to December of 1982 or even later. **********Oct. 7 Meeting Planned **********Some definite decisions on what to do about the lagging program, now being held up because staff officials at the commission say they are overburdened, are expected to be made at a meeting of the commissioners on Oct. 7, Mr. Fogarty added. **********Mr. Fogarty is only one of seven members of the commission, but he is deferred to by his fellow commissioners on telephone industry matters because of his expertise. He is expected to be especially influential on telecommunications issues in coming months because three members of the commission, including the chairman, joined the agency only this year. **********''When we delay the date for implementing the plans, I know it is going to be difficult for A.T.&T.,'' said Mr. Fogarty. ''They are busily working on restructuring plans to coincide with March.'' Shift of Equipment an Issue **********At the heart of the commission's problem is the lack of success in deciding how to transfer billions of dollars worth of existing Bell System equipment, such as telephones and switchboards, to the new subsidiary. **********In order to shift the equipment from the regulated side of the company to the unregulated side, it must be depreciated on a steppedup schedule, if not immediately. Quicker depreciation could drive up local phone rates and have other consequences, industry officials say. **********On Thursday, at a joint meeting of the House subcommittee on investigations and the subcommittee on telecommunications, there is scheduled to be a disclosure of the results of a long-awaited examination o f the F.C.C.'s Common Carrier Bureau. The subcommittees are expected to also delve into several recent controversial rulings by the commis sion. ''I think it will be the most important hearing wewill take par t in this year,'' Mr. Fogarty said, but he declined to be more speci fic. **********In particular the members of the commission are expected to be questioned about a closed-door meeting where they decided to grant A.T.&T. an increased rate of return, from 10.5 percent to 12.75 percent, which later resulted in increases in long distance phone rates in excess of 16 percent. Overseas rates declined over the same period. **********The increase was expected to result in an estimated revenue rise of more than $725 million this year. Overcharges and Cellular Radio **********In addition, according to members of the staff of the joint House panel, commission members will be questioned about the disposition of $100 million in overcharges A.T.&T. is said to owe customers, and a decision earlier this year to begin a new form of mobile telephone called cellular radio by guaranteeing A.T.&T. a part of the new service. **********The whole question of how to dispose of telephone equipment and how to provide for the maintenance of the phones and other devices after they are unregulated is a complex question involving phone company accounting departments, local utility boards and the Federal commission, Mr. Fogarty said. **********The manner of disposing of the old equipment could also affect A.T.&T.'s success in financing the new subsidiary, which may cost up to $20 billion to institute, he said. Bell must propose a capitalization plan in November. **********A.T.&T. officials, asked about the consequences of a delay in instituting the new plan, declined immediate comment, saying it would be premature to react before the commission moved."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/15/business/the-week-in-business-big-mergers-and-lower-rates-excite-the-market.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 537, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Week in Business; BIG MERGERS AND LOWER RATES EXCITE THE MARKET", "print_headline": "The Week in Business; BIG MERGERS AND LOWER RATES EXCITE THE MARKET", "body_text": " **********The stock market rose last week on investors' hopes for lower interest rates and on a spurt of merger activity.

They want to see it working somewhere else before they will invest in it.'' These were the words of a waste management expert i nterv iewed for the column that appeared here two weeks ago on treatment systems for organic wastes. **********They were practically identical to comments made by other experts during interviews for earlier columns on subjects as diverse as lubrication, robotics and baseball pitching machines. From the perspective of almost anyone in technology development, it seems, virtually all potential customers are conservatives. **********This suggests that while there is no denying the central role of research and development programs in the world of technology, marketing is also an important part of the story. The same message figured in recent announcements of advances in solar energy applications and coal mining. **********The solar news came from the Luz Engineering Corporation of Birmingham, Ala., which said that it had signed contracts to build and operate the nation's three largest privately financed industrial process heat systems based on solar energy. At about the same time, the Advanced Coal Management Corporation of Lexington, Ky., dedicated the first ''Thin Seam Miner'' to arrive in the United States, a machine said to be the most important advance in the coal industry since the continuous miner. **********Both Luz and Advanced Coal are distributing their products through unusual marketing arrangements that they say have been crucial to the successes they have achieved to date - and to their prospects. **********Luz's contracts call for it to install and operate solar collector systems at plants owned by three textile companies - the Bibb Company, Cone Mills and the J. P. Stevens Company. Luz will make its money on the systems, which cost between $2 million and $4 million each, by selling the companies steam at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 years at a discount from what the local power company would charge. **********While Luz claims that its system is unusually efficient, Gaston White, the company's project manager downplays any suggestions that it contains any major changes in solar technology. ''We are marketing it as proven technology,'' he said. **********The efficiency imp rovement comes from a number of minor changes.  For example, computer controls help the parabolic collectors track the sun when it is behind the clouds. Parabolic collectors need to follow the su n in order to focus its rays on the oil-containing tube in which the sun's energy is converted to useful heat. Typical sensing devic es that reorient the collectors when the sun emerges from behind c louds have difficulty if the sun has been blocked for a lengthy perio d. The Luz system keeps the collectors moving so that the sensors n eed only perform a small and speedy adjustment. **********The improvements notwithstanding, Luz recognized that solar systems do not meet the payback requirements of most companies and that industrialists lacked the experience to be confident that they could successfully operate and maintain them. Moreover, according to Solomon Kimerling, the marketing consultant retained by Luz, the whole solar field is regarded by industrialists as ''unreal'' because most industrial solar projects have been Federally subsidized. **********To overcome these barriers, Luz decided to become the owneroperator of its systems. Mr. Kimerling noted that the strategy is akin to that pioneered by Air Products Inc., which built industrial gas plants beside or on the site of steel mills in order to supply them with their output by pipeline. ''What we are saying is that the customer does not have to invest in the technology, just the output,'' Mr. Kimerling said. ''The only way to get it accepted like other industrial equipment is to make it into a high-volume item.  Then we will be able to sell the equipment directly.'' **********Advance Coal's marketing strategy for its new coal mining machines is markedly different in detail, but notably similar in effect. Like the solar systems, the machines represent a huge investment - some $2.5 million each - and the potential users lack experience operating anything comparable. **********''It is too sophisticated a machine to put on this market,'' said James D. Stacy, the former coal mine owner who has cooperated with Rhine-Schelde-Verolme, a Dutch engineering and shipbuilding company, in developing it. He founded Advanced Coal to oversee his exclusive right to market the 200 units that Rhine-Schelde-Verolme will make and send here through 1985. **********The electronically controlled machine mines up to 85 percent of the coal left behind in the walls of strip mines. It recovers the coal in strips that are 89 inches wide, two to five feet thick and up to 220 feet deep, using sensors to detect the size and direction of the seam. No miners go underground and no blasting is required. **********Instead of trying to sell the machines, Mr. Stacy has set up a second company, the Thin Seam Miner Corporation, which, through a contract with Advance Coal, will lease them to mine owners and oversee both operation and maintenance. **********The arrangements will be structured so that Advance Coal is, in effect, either a contract miner for the mine owner at a fixed price, or a joint venture partner entitled to 65 per cent to 75 percent of the gross, Mr. Stacy said. In contrast to Luz , Advance Coal has adopted its strategy on a permanent basis, no t just as a vehicle to overcome initial reluctance to use its techno logy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/27/business/oil-drilling-in-georges-bank.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1981-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1445, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OIL DRILLING IN GEORGES BANK", "print_headline": "OIL DRILLING IN GEORGES BANK", "body_text": " **********At 4:57 P.M., Wes Campbell, a driller working for the Shell Oil Company, lowered a column of steel pipe deep into the Atlantic, 200 miles off the coast of Massachusetts. The drilling column stiffened slightly as it hit bottom and then punched a 17 1/2-inch hole in the sandy face of Georges Bank. **********Fifty miles to the west, the Exxon Corporation sent its drill bit spiraling into the layers of sedimentary rock in search of oil and gas. **********After six years of bitter legal wrangles between fishermen and oil companies, exploration began today on Georges Bank - one of America's richest fisheries.Zapata Saratoga rig were a knot of Shell Oil officials, nine journalists and a group of curious finback whales who poked their heads through the distant waves, sending up fountains of spray. **********''Thank goodness we finally got it started,'' said O.J. Shirley, manager of government and industry affairs for Shell. ''It's only a matter of time before the fishermen get used to having us out here.  We can have a very compatible relationship.'' **********Their relationship thus far has been anything but compatible.  Starting in the mid-1970's, New England fishermen, state governments and environmentalists brought various suits to block oil exploration on Georges Bank, or at least delay it until tighter safeguards were enacted. The Departments of Interior and Commerce and 22 oil companies argued that the need for domestic oil supplies outweighed the ''small'' risk to fishing. The existing environmental safeguards, they said, were sufficient to protect the fish and their habitat from oil pollution. Drilling Finally Approved **********Drilling was finally approved by the courts last year on the condition that the Government and the oil companies take additional environmental precautions. But these fell far short of what the fishermen had been seeking. **********Standing beneath the red, white and blue derrick of the Zapata rig, Mr. Shirley argued that oil exploration posed no serious threat to the marine life of Georges Bank. **********''We recognize Georges Bank is important, but its value as a fishery has been greatly overstated.'' he said. ''There are 20,000 square miles out here and I don't see any kind of event that could wipe out this fishing ground.'' **********The New England fishermen see it otherwise.  Since the 17th century they have made a living off the haddock, cod, halibut, lobster, flounder and scallops of Georges Bank. Its waters provide some 14 percent of America's food fish and serve as the basis of the $1 billion-a-year New England fishing industry. It was to preserve the treasures of Georges Bank from foreign fleets that the United States decided to enforce a 200-mile coastal limit. **********Harry Swain, president of a New Bedford, Mass., boat owners association, has not been out to view the Zapata Saratoga yet, but the 70-year-old fisherman has a sense of foreboding. **********''You know it's ironic,'' he mused from his office in the cobblestoned New Bedford pier district, where Herman Melville set off to write Moby Dick, ''when the oil companies first discovered oil, it put the whalers here out of business, because people didn't need the whale oil anymore. Their drilling in Georges Bank could well put the fishermen out of business again.'' **********''We're not talking about protecting the snail darter out there,'' said Douglas Foy, director of the Conservation Law Foundation of New England, which aided the fishermen in their legal fight. ''We're talking about a whole industry and fish that people eat every day.  Whatever oil they find will last only a few weeks, but the fish will be there for a lifetime - if you take care of them.'' 'The Iron Bottom' **********The fishermen's main fear is what they call ''the Iron Bottom.'' The drill bits, cable, pipe, and other equipment oil companies might lose, or dump overboard, can easily slice or snare fishermen's costly nets and lines. Mr. Swain said Norwegian fisherman claimed their catch dropped by one-third as a result of the debris left on the bottom of the North Sea from oil drilling. The companies are bound by anti-dumping regulations, but the fishermen are pessimistic about their enforcement under the Reagan Administration. **********''Oh, the companies came up here and promised lots of things,'' said Mr. Swain, who fished Georges Bank for nearly 50 years, ''and they showed us movies of colorful fish caught around the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, but in the end they really didn't give us anything.'' **********Mr. Swain had some unflattering things to say about James G. Watt, the Secretary of the Interior, in whose reign ''the oilmen have gotten real cocky.'' **********The fisherman had also asked the companies to alter their shipping routes so they would not pass through key fishing grounds, and to tow away the tons of chemically treated ''mud'' used in the drilling process instead of dumping it into Georges Bank. The muds are deployed to cool the drill bit and equalize pressure in the hole. **********''They argued that it would cost too much money,'' said Jay Lanzillo, a fisherman-activist with the Chatham, Mass., Seafood Coop, ''and the Government backed them up. What can I say? We lost.  All we can do now is hope they don't find any oil.'' An Estimated 123 Million Barrels **********The Government estimates that the area being explored in Georges Bank contains at most 123 million barrels of oil - about two weeks of current United States consumption. Then again, it may contain no crude at all, as was the case in the Baltimore Canyon off the New Jersey coast. Mr. Shirley argues that it is still worth the risk. **********''The total domestic oil supply comes from a large number of small fields all over the country,'' he said. Even if Secretary Watt carries out his pledge to lease one billion offshore acres during the next five years, he added, ''there are only limited areas we would like to drill - sedimentary basins like Georges Bank.'' **********Guiding visitors through the beehive of pipes, tanks and catwalks that make up the six decks of the floating Zapata rig, Mr. Shirley showed off the myriad of safeguards being taken by the oil companies: blowout prevention measures, constant inspection, dillution of drilling muds and environmental impact studies. **********''Shell has drilled 4,000 offshore wells around the world and has never once had a blowout or a spill,'' he said.  Pat Doody, senior vice president for the Zapata Off-Shore Company, which leases the rig to Shell, predicted that after a few months the fishermen would be seeking out the oil platforms, which he said act as artificial reefs and attract fish. This is what fisherman in the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico do, he said. **********Poring over a wall-size contour map of Georges Bank, Dr. Robert Howarth, staff scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Mass., pointed to the spot where the Zapata Saratoa is anchored. An expert on the marine environment of Georges Bank, he knows the contours well. Rich in Nutrients **********It is precisely the uniqueness of Georges Bank as a fishing ground, he argues, that makes it so susceptible to oil pollution. The waters are among the world's richest in the nutrients fish need to survive.  The seas are extremely shallow and turbulent, which means the food is spread throughout as in a blender. **********In addition, the waters above this sandy bank follow a circular current pattern called a ''gyre,'' which keeps helpless fish eggs and larvae trapped inside. There they can live off the nutrients until they are large enough to survive in areas with fewer sea plants and less protection. **********''Georges is like a gigantic fish nursurey, and this is what must be protected from the oil drilling,'' said Dr. Howarth. ''You can't compare it to the Gulf of Mexico, which is not a nursury and produces mostly sport fish, not food fish.''  Shell Drill Is Stuck **********HYANNIS, Mass., July 26 (AP) -The drill bit on Shell Oil's drilling rig Zapata Saratoga became imbedded in rock at 120 feet into the ocean floor today, forcing a temporary halt to drilling in the Georges Bank, a company official said. A Shell spokesman, Norman Altstedter, said the problem was a common one in offshore oil exploration, but he said it could take hours or even several days to free the bit and resume drilling."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/16/business/pubco-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PUBCO CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "PUBCO CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/18/world/us-endorses-proposal-by-france-for-an-arms-parley-after-madrid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 665, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. ENDORSES PROPOSAL BY FRANCE FOR AN ARMS PARLEY AFTER MADRID", "print_headline": "U.S. ENDORSES PROPOSAL BY FRANCE FOR AN ARMS PARLEY AFTER MADRID", "body_text": " **********In an important step toward improving relations with its Western European allies, the Reagan Administration has endorsed a French proposal for monitoring military movements by the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. **********The endorsement, disclosed yesterday at the 35-nation Madrid review conference on East-West cooperation, was hailed by the Western Europeans as a sign that the new Administration was willing to negotiate on security questions and to permit its allies to assume the lead on disarmament. **********''This puts aside the comments of all those who, whether through lack of knowledge or evil intention, attribute to the United States Administration an insufficient willingness to negotiate,'' said Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German Foreign Minister. **********Since President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France introduced his proposal for a European disarmament conference in 1978, the Western Europeans have gradually lent it support, in part to allow France an opportunity to re-enter East-West negotiations that had been boycotted by General de Gaulle. But the Carter Administration viewed the French idea with suspicion, fearing that it might start a disarmament process that would slip from American control. **********French Redraft Their Proposal **********In December, the French delegation to the Madrid conference redrafted the document, giving priority to strengthening so-called confidence-building measures among military blocs and relegating actual disarmament to a second stage. **********In its new form, the plan gained the support of all Atlantic alliance members except the United States. It would make prior notification of maneuvers mandatory from the Atlantic to the Urals, the mountain range deep inside the Soviet Union that is the traditional boundary of Europe. The Helsinki accords of 1975, under review here, called for voluntary notification in a zone reaching only 150 miles into the Soviet Union. **********By backing the French plan for a conference on confidence-building measures, the United States delegation helped preserve a spirit of Western unity that has been a striking feature of the gathering here since it opened in September. **********The American decision, which was announced by Max M. Kampelman, the chief delegate, after talks in Washington with Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., also put the Soviet Union on the spot. Moscow has been pushing its own plan, for a disarmament conference in Warsaw, which the West has dismissed as a forum rendered meaningless by the intervention in Afghanistan. **********With the West presenting a solid front around the French proposal, the Soviet Union will not be able to appear as the sole champion of detente and disarmament at the Madrid talks. The chief Soviet delegate, Leonid F. Ilyichev, has rejected France's plan to expand the zone for confidence-building to the Urals.

In doing so, the Administration implicitly admits that some of the cuts it wants to make will cause genuine hardship. **********Of course, many of the Government activities that Mr. Reagan wants to cut cannot by their very nature be taken over by individuals, businesses or voluntary groups. **********There would be no credibility to a suggestion that the private sector could or would replace Federal efforts to insure clean air and clean water, to eliminate health and safety problems in the workplace, or to nudge employers toward getting rid of employment and promotion practices that exclude women and minorities. **********These Federal activities were undertaken because of the widespread belief that large and powerful parts of the private sector were acting so as to damage vital public interests. As the Federal Government abdicates in these areas, there will be no united fund to pick up the pieces. **********If the President's pitch for the private sector to take the place of Government has any credibility, it must be in the areas of health, education and social welfare. Here voluntary activities are already established, and are going on at a rate of about $18 billion annually. Unfortunately, there are strong reasons to believe that an attempt to get volunteers in the private sector to take over an appreciable part of public sector activities is doomed to failure. **********Social scientists who have studied voluntary efforts at action have noted that there is a persistent and systematic problem in mobilizing resources to support these actions. As Mancur Olson, the economist, pointed out in an influential treatise published 20 years ago, the rational self-interest of each individual points away from participating voluntarily even in a group whose purpose that individual enthusiastically approves of. **********When private organizations try to get donations for social purposes, many of the individuals asked to make a contribution will reason (quite accurately) that the dollars each gives can make little difference to the cause. After all, an individual who contributes even a substantial part of his salary may increase a charity's funds by only a thousandth of a percent or less. Reasoning in this way, many individuals will avoid making the contribution. Although each failure to contribute makes almost no difference, added together these failures make a huge difference. The result is slim pickings for charities. **********In a society of one million people, all of whom would support a law forcing each of them to pay $50 a year for social relief, voluntary collections would produce considerably less than $50 million. The more coldly rational that people are, the less that voluntary collections produce. It is precisely for this reason that human beings have organized governments with coercive taxing powers. **********Of course, we live in a society that is far from unanimous about anything, and in which majorities shift from one side to the other.  When the Liberals win, they use the power of government to coerce contributions from themselves and from those less liberal than themselves. When they lose, they lose the ability to use the coercion of the tax collector to collect even from fellow liberals what those liberals would be willing to give. **********Another problem with voluntary provision relates to the cost of making voluntary collections. While some charities have low collection costs, it is not unusual for voluntary organizations to spend more than 90 percent of the funds they take in on expenses relating to fund solicitation. This expenditure is not a sign of corruption. It is simply a necessity under modern conditions. **********B UT the result is that only a fraction of the contributed money goes to relieve the social distress that the donors were worried about. The knowledge of these high collection costs provides a further rationalization for not contributing. **********Another reason that we cannot go back to voluntary provision for a sizable proportion of social needs is the atrophy of habits and attitudes and institutions that used to support voluntary giving. A higher proportion of us used to attend religious services regularly, where we were regularly exhorted to give, where there was social pressure to give, where compassion for the less fortunate was instilled and where collection was done at low cost. **********The establishment of Federal programs to deal with social ills has had an adverse effect on the public's attitude toward the beneficiaries. The President now talking up voluntarism is the very man who as a candidate whipped up sentiment against clients of Federal programs, and characterized them as a pack of parasitic cheaters. **********A recent newspaper article told of a Florida city where transients were annoying the residents by hunting in their garbage pails for food. The city's mayor referred to the garbage eaters as ''vermin,'' and spoke of the possibility of dousing the garbage with kerosene. In a country where that kind of sentiment is publicly expressed, voluntary provision for the poor is going to be on the short side. **********We have our Scrooges, and lately the Scrooges have grown bolder in expressing themselves. But we are not a nation of Scrooges. On the contrary, we are a nation that, seeing voluntary efforts as commendable but chronically insufficient, has for almost 50 years been relieving social distress through the Federal Treasury, using the coercive powers of government to collect the funds. **********If a majority of the voters have become convinced that Federal social programs have become overly generous, it is certainly legitimate for the President to want to try to rein them in. But to ask volunteers to make up for more than a small portion of what the Federal Government is taking away is asking for the impossible. That helps neither the volunteers nor the poor.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Barbara R.

No other major banks immediately followed suit, but bank economists predicted that the 19 1/2 percent rate would soon spread throughout the industry. **********Further cuts in the key lending rate are expected in the next six months if the inflation rate continues to decline and the pace of economic activity slows, the analysts said. **********Several smaller banks also announced reductions in their prime lending rates yesterday. The UMB Bank and Trust Company, a subsidiary of United Mizrahi Bank of Tel Aviv, trimmed its prime to 19 1/2 percent from 20 percent, while the St. Louis County Bank dropped its prime rate to 20 percent from 20 1/2 percent. **********The fall in the prime was foreshadowed Monday when the Bank of New York and the Chemical Bank reduced their broker-loan rates, the fee charged to securities dealers on loans backed by stock as collateral, to 19 1/2 percent from 20 1/2 percent. Several others, including Irving Trust and Marine Midland, lowered their broker-loan charges to 20 percent from 21 percent. Marine Midland trimmed its broker-loan rate again yesterday to 19.5 percent. **********''It does look like there are pressures building for the rest of the industry to fall in line,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president of the Bank of New York. If the cost of Federal funds and certificates of deposit, two of the most important sources of bank funds, hold their present level, Mr. Sullivan said, ''a move to 19 percent is not unlikely in the near future.'' **********The Federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another for overnight loans of uncommitted reserves, is considered an important indicator of the degree to which the Federal Reserve is making funds available to the financial system. The rate fell as low as 16.5 percent early yesterday, down from 20 percent as recently as last Friday, but closed the day at 18.58 percent. The Fed has apparently allowed the rate to drift lower because of a slackening in the growth of the nation's basic money supply over the last three weeks. Quarterly Tax Date Cited **********Mr. Sullivan said other major banks might delay their moves to the 19 1/2 percent level until after next Monday, when quarterly Federal income taxes come due. Businesses often borrow heavily to pay their quarterly tax liabilities. **********The prime is the basis for the rate that banks charge on most three-month loans to their best corporate customers, although many large corporations obtain short-term loans at rates well below the prime. The prime also serves as the basis for a variety of loans to consumers and smaller businesses. **********''The prime rate moves up and down much more frequently than it did traditionally, therefore a single move does not have the significance it did before,'' said John R. Petty, president of Marine Midland. ''The modest easing of New York, London and Federal fund interest rates led us to believe that 19 1/2 percent is the right rate for the near future. Whether this is the start of a long-term trend is too early too determine.'' **********However, Irwin L. Kellner, senior vice president and chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover, described yesterday's drop in the prime as ''the early stages of what will be a long-term downturn in interest rates.'' Although he foresees a steady decline in interest charges, Mr. Kellner said there would be a few ''ups and downs'' along the way. Drop Called Justified **********Mr. Kellner said the fall in the prime lending rate to 19 1/2 percent was justified because companies were demanding less credit from commercial banks at the present costs. With the economy slowing and the pace of inflation down to an annual rate of 10 percent or less, businesses are finding it increasingly difficult to pass on the high lending rates to consumers, he said. **********''With the Federal funds rate around 17 percent, it would seem that the Fed is under no great pressure to drain reserves from the system,'' Mr. Kellner said. ''As long as the Federal funds rate stays in that range, I think the others will follow the parade.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/07/business/northwestern-public-service-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NORTHWESTERN PUBLIC SERVICE CO reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "NORTHWESTERN PUBLIC SERVICE CO reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/20/business/saturday-june-20-1981-companies.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 734, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Companies", "print_headline": "SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1981; Companies", "body_text": " **********Conoco rejected a proposal by ''a major foreign corporation'' to buy about a quarter of its stock for as much as $2 billion.

But corporate executives are still intent on helping the Administration sell the plan. **********As Cabinet officers fan out to build up public support for the proposed tax cuts and spending cuts, companies are promoting the package in advertisements and public forums.

She seemed close to tears. ''We've been given 24 hours to rescue what we can,'' she said, ''then the bulldozers are coming.'' **********A few yards away, young antiriot policemen slouched in the shade, one eye on their horses and another on the somber family groups gathering their belongings - an oven, a bed, perhaps a television -on the unpaved street before their ruined homes. ''We don't like doing this,'' a policeman said, ''but we have to obey orders.'' **********The order to dismantle the so-called Second of October Encampment caught the squatters by surprise. Suddenly, around 11 A.M. on March 2, 6,000 policemen fell upon the slum, some waving pistols and submachine guns as they burst into homes to search for weapons, others standing guard while heavy machinery reduced the first 500 shacks to rubble. **********Officials explained that the squatters had ''consented'' to be moved to plots in another part of Mexico City where water, drainage and electricity were already installed. The flattened area, they said, would be turned into parks and children's playgrounds. ''No money will be spared in improving the quality of life here,'' a government planner pledged. Settlement's Leader Arrested **********But the real reason for the eviction may have been different. For the past six years, the militantly independent squatter community has been a thorn in the side of the authorities and the Government's patience seems to have run out. On the day of the police raid, the settlement's leader, Francisco de la Cruz Velasco, was arrested and charged with crimes that could keep him in jail for 40 years. **********''The Government didn't move against them because they were squatters,'' said a leftist who helped organize the slum. ''There are squatters all over the city. It acted because it cannot tolerate an independent organization that doesn't follow the political rules of the system.'' **********The Second of October Encampment -its name commemorates the killing of some 300 anti-Government demonstrators here on Oct. 2, 1968 - began life like most Mexican slums with the illegal ''invasion'' of undeveloped urban land by homeless families, many of them recent migrants from the countryside. **********The organizer of the group, ''Pancho'' de la Cruz, now 55 years old, had come to Mexico City as an illiterate peasant from Oaxaca State in 1958, but he was determined to improve himself and, after years of evening classes, graduated as a lawyer from the National University in 1974. Community Organization Formed **********After the seizure of some 100 acres in the Ixtacalco district of Mexico City on March 10, 1975, Mr. de la Cruz emerged as the new slum's undisputed leader. And to help persuade the Government to grant legal titles and provide public services in the area, he set about building a strong community organization. **********The squatters built a three-floor building for offices and meeting halls as well as a health clinic, a kindergarten, a cheap restaurant and a mechanic's shed. But Mr. de la Cruz also inspired other squatter settlements to become more militant and eventually helped found the Urban Block of Popular Communities, made up of some 30 slum organizations. **********As Mr. de la Cruz emerged as a political figure, however, his relations with the Government deteriorated. One night early in 1976, the police raided the encampment to arrest him and, although he escaped, a fire broke out and five children died. Mr. de la Cruz went into hiding outside Mexico City. **********When he returned in January 1977, soon after President Jose Lopez Portillo took office, he found his leadership challenged. And in the subsequent conflict, the couple who had run the organization in his absence formed the breakaway Independent Democratic Committee. A Friend in High Places **********Over the next four years, the authorities sought hard to neutralize Mr. de la Cruz. For example, they encouraged his opponents to take their complaints about his alleged corruption and authoritarianism to local newspapers. There were also occasional clashes in the community. **********Early in 1979, though, the president of Mexico's ruling party, Gustavo Carvajal Moreno, began courting Mr. de la Cruz and, according to the squatter leader, even offered to make him a member of the Chamber of Deputies in the elections of July that year. Mr. de la Cruz in turn tried to use his friendship with the party boss to squeeze concessions out of the city authorities. But after a few months, the bizarre alliance collapsed. **********Around the same time, apparently eager to expand his influence, Mr. de la Cruz used the squatter organization to ''protect'' a fleet of over 2,000 ''pirate'' taxis whose drivers were given special injunctions to shield them from arrest for driving without proper permission. Each driver paid the organization around $500 for the injunction and a further $10 a week for ''protection,'' although friends maintained that Mr. de la Cruz needed the money to pay large bribes to police officials. **********Mr. de la Cruz's political manuevering won him new enemies. His ''pirate'' taxi operation led to clashes with established taxi fleet owners who had influence in the Government. The city authorities also complained that he had repeatedly blocked their efforts to bring order to the encampment. Finally, on March 2, the decision was taken to break the organization. Supporters Are Loyal **********Until the end, Mr. de la Cruz's supporters - some 5,000 squatter families - remained loyal. Wherever he went, he was ''guarded'' by dozens of women. Even on the day of his arrest, he was accompanied by a crowd of several hundred when he was called to a government office for a meeting, but only he and four aides entered the building. The doors were then locked and he was seized. **********Now, sitting in jail awaiting trial on charges including theft, assault and arson, Mr. de la Cruz feels betrayed. ''The mistake of any leader is to believe in the authorities,'' he told the political weekly Proceso from his cell. ''I believed in the agreements, in their promises and here I am.'' **********He asserted that his downfall came when he refused a bribe of $450,000 from Mr. Carvajal, the party chief. ''It meant selling out my people and I refused,'' he said. ''Carvajal told me that since I didn't want power, I didn't want money, I didn't want to become a deputy, our relations were over.'' **********Mr. de la Cruz insisted that he never took money from the squatter organization. ''Everyone used me, everyone wanted to use my name,'' he said. ''I never thought of myself as a god, but I was a good leader because, when I spoke, people followed me. I always understood the problems of my followers because I am also from humble extraction.'' 'Like a Father to Us' **********Climbing among the dusty ruins of their homes, picking out clothes, dolls and cooking pots from among the bricks, waiting for city trucks to take them to their new plots, Pancho de la Cruz's supporters seem lost without him. ''He was like a father to us,'' a grandmother said, tears rolling down her face. ''After all we have suffered here, we must now suffer more.'' **********In the sprawling slums surrouding the Second of October Encampment, life goes on normally. Only people in the zone controlled by Mr. de la Cruz are being evicted. In a temporary office, Government officials conferred with leaders of the rival Independent Democratic Committee. **********But some of the men waiting to be transferred to their new plots seven miles away vowed to keep up ''the fight.'' ''They said that the Second of October Encampment will soon be only a memory,'' a young man said defiantly. ''Well, the memory will live on in the new Second of March Encampment.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/26/business/building-rate-said-to-slow.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Building Rate Said to Slow", "print_headline": "Building Rate Said to Slow", "body_text": " **********Construction contracts will rise by 12 percent in 1981, to $164.5 billion, or about $10 billion less than was predicted six months ago, the McGraw-Hill Information Systems Company said yesterday. **********In an update of its ''1981 Dodge-Sweet's Construction Outlook,'' McGraw-Hill predicted a 1 percent gain in nonresidential construction, to $53.1 billion, as President Reagan's reindustrialization program goes into effect. **********It forecast a 12 percent rise in the value of public works construction and a 10 percent increase in the number of residential building units, a decrease from earlier forecasts. **********In the nonresidential category, office building construction for 1981 was estimated at $13.03 billion, down 3 percent from last year; stores and other commercial buildings at $11.6 billion, up 2 percent; and manufacturing buildings at $7.9 billion, down 4 percent. **********''While there is bound to be a reversal of the recently strong rate of contracting for commercial and industrial buildings, manufacturing building should be showing improvement in the second half of 1981, as the new Administration's program for reindustrialization gets under way,'' said George A.

Blin, senior vice president of the New York Futures Exchange. **********Mr. Blin, an economist, is regarded as one of the designers of Eurodollar futures, which he helped develop for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's International Monetary Market several years ago.

The London interbank offered rate is the base borrowing cost of these dollars, which are lent to foreign governments as well as to large corporations. Mr.  Blin added: **********''One major reason is that these Eurodollars are not influenced by the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve because they are outside the country.

Unlike ordinary bank deposits here or abroad, Eurodollars are not subject to central bank reserve requirments, which are a factor in determining the prime and all other lending rates.'' **********Much of today's international financing involves Eurodollars, which are mainly deposits from the Middle East oil exporting countries, Mr. Blin said. ''The banks that use these dollars for lending have always faced big risks because of the often volatile rate moves. Often, the petrodollars deposited in London are for shorter periods than the maturities on their loans to customers.'' **********As for the Eurodollar futures, the lenders can lock in rates just as grain and other commodity dealers can hedge their exposure.  ''Also,'' Mr. Blin stressed, ''Government monetary authorities could eventually use this market, in effect, to insure against adverse fluctuations in the value of their currencies through the purchase and sale of Eurodollar futures. Assuming, as many of us believe, the Eurodollar futures market will grow large enough to accommodate such operations.'' **********Traditionally, a central bank seeking to stabilize the value of its currency would either support it through purchases and sales or enter into various ''swap'' arrangements. **********The Chicago Mercantile's three-month Eurodollar time deposit futures contract carries a face value of $1 million. The minimum price move is $25 per contract. For the first time in any commodity futures market, the underlying goods are not deliverable, although the delivery months are January, March, June, September and December. Instead, all contracts are settled for cash. **********No Eurodollar futures contracts will change hands, just as New York banks operate in the London Eurodollar market without one dollar actually moving between the two cities. When the contract expires, the exchange will, in effect, average the interbank rates of the leading banks in London on that day and that will be the final settlement price for the delivery. **********At last Friday's close, for example, the active March Eurodollar delivery at ''85.80'' was off $150. The 85.80 means a rate of 14.20 percent on an annual basis on the March contract (100 percent face value minus 85.80 equals 14.20 percent)."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/22/business/small-savers-interest-rises.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 44, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'Small-Savers' Interest Rises", "print_headline": "'Small-Savers' Interest Rises", "body_text": " **********and-a-half-year ''small-saver'' certificates, up from the ceilings of 12.95 percent and 12.7 percent for the previous two weeks. **********Interest limits on the two-and-a-half-year certificates are linked to yields on medium-term Treasury securities during the five days ended today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/16/business/hunts-cleared-in-oil-dispute.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 217, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hunts Cleared in Oil Dispute", "print_headline": "Hunts Cleared in Oil Dispute", "body_text": " **********A Federal judge dismissed a $231 million antitrust suit Friday against Herbert, Nelson and Lamar Hunt, ruling that facts stipulated by both sides indicated the wealthy brothers did not violate Federal law in a dispute involving oil from a nationalized Libyan oil field. **********The Coastal States Marketing Corporation and the Valero Energy Corporation filed the suit in 1974 contending the Hunts had conspired to restrain trade in Libyan oil. **********United States District Judge Carl O.

''So long as the investor can earn 17 percent and more on commercial paper versus 13 percent on a long-term bond, they tend to buy the paper,'' one dealer said. **********High Federal Funds Rate Cited **********''Right now, I'd say the bond market's advance is inhibited by the high rate for Federal funds,'' said Jay Goldinger, an associate at Cantor, Fitzgerald & Company, a bond and money-market brokerage firm. If the funds rate, which is the cost of overnight loans arranged by banks and others, does not decline soon, Mr. Goldinger and others say, the market might even give up some of its recent gains. **********A decline in the funds rate is widely predicted, however, and Mr.  Goldinger concluded that ''the market rally is for real, with an excellent possibility of further gains.'' **********Similarly, Robert Wade, president of the Crocker Investment Management Corporation, an affiliate of the Crocker National Bank, observed that ''over the first half of the year we still expect the bond market to give a good performance, perhaps even a superior one'' compared with the equity markets. In the immediate future, however, ''we are cautious because the market has already come so far so quickly,'' he added. **********Over the longer term, Mr. Wade noted that many investors were still wary of fixed-rate investments, such as bonds, and were continuing to emphasize stocks, whose values they think will rise along with inflation. ''If the Reagan administration does anything good to combat inflation, it will be good for bonds,'' Mr. Wade said, ''but it will be even better for the equity markets.'' Many Companies Plan Sales **********While investment bankers cannot agree on how low interest rates will go, they do agree that a large number of companies are preparing to sell notes and bonds now that rates have declined from the midDecember peak, where Treasury issues yielded 13 percent and Aaa-rated telephone issues yielded 15 percent. **********''There is at least $10 billion of corporate issues'' poised for public sale, ''with one heck of a lot of intermediate maturities,'' said S. Daniel Evans, a vice president at E.F. Hutton & Company. If the optimists are correct, and the Reagan administration does show some ability to reduce inflation, then more companies might issue traditional 30-year bonds later in the year, he added. **********The first sign of that volume came yesterday afternoon when plans were announced for $300 million of 20-year Conoco debentures, $200 million of Tenneco 10-year notes and $150 million of Commonwealth Edison Company bonds. Investment bankers said more issues would follow. **********Investor demand was brisk for the few corporate issues that came to market while it was rallying. Yesterday, underwriters reported quick sellouts for a $100 million issue of Aa-rated American Express Credit Corporation 12 7/8 percent notes due in 1991 and a $100 million issue of Baa/BBB rated Alabama Power Company 14 3/4 percent notes due in 1991. Both issues were initially offered at par and then at slight premiums late in the day. Treasury Prices Up Slightly **********In the Treasury market, prices were only slightly higher yesterday. After the Treasury sold $1.5 billion of new 11 3/4 percent 20-year bonds at an average yield of 11.82 percent, the outstanding 12 3/4 percent bonds closed at 109 to yield 11.64 percent. The 15 1/8 percent notes due in two years were offered at 104 20/32 to yield 12.41 percent. **********In the tax-exempt market, yields are continuing to decline. In advance of today's $200 million issue of Aa-rated Oregon bonds due in 1991-2000, dealers estimated that yields of 9 percent and more would be readily available, with some of the longest-term bonds yielding as much as 9 1/2 percent. **********The sharp decline in rates in the last month was clearly shown at yesterday's auction of housing project notes by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. After bidding for $1.1 billion of the United States Government-guaranteed notes, underwriters were reoffering notes due in August 1981 to yield 7.05 percent, compared with a 9 percent yield for comparable notes sold a month ago. **********Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 20-year onemonth Treasury bonds:"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/07/business/china-bank-branch.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 28, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Bank Branch", "print_headline": "China Bank Branch", "body_text": " **********The Bank of China will open a branch in New York by the end of the year, the New China News Agency reported today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/17/business/advertising-personal-safety-items.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Personal-Safety Items", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Personal-Safety Items", "body_text": " **********Garrity Industries, in Stamford, Conn., wants you to know that it is in a position to help you feel safer.
