King Could Intervene **********The revered King of Thailand, King Bhumipol Adulyadej, is also thought to be opposed to coups, and has been instrumental in the past in persuading the military to abandon its efforts. It is possible King Bhumipol, one of the world's longest-serving monarchs, will try to intervene again, despite the dissolution of both houses of Parliament and the military's revocation of the Constitution. **********Mr. Chatichai is reported to have been arrested at the airport as he was about to fly to Thailand's northeast to meet with the King, reportedly to get his constitutional assent to the promotion of a former army Chief of Staff, Arthit Kamlang-ek, to Deputy Defense Minister. Mr. Chatichai himself served as Defense Minister. **********Mr. Arthit is disliked by Supreme Commander Gen. Sunthorn Kongsompong, who announced the coup, and the more powerful army Chief of Staff, Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon. General Sunthorn has been perceived as more prickly in defending the military against perceived slights, while General Suchinda has publicly played a more calming role, while warning that the army has \"limits to its patience.\" Criticism Has Grown **********In the last year or so, there has been increasing military criticism of Mr. Chatichai and his \"no problem\" attitude to charges of corruption, lack of direction and incompetence in his administration. He has ignored such criticism from his political opposition, but it has been heard, with increasing sharpness of tone, from the country's powerful military commanders. **********The role of Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the former army Chief of Staff and supreme commander, is currently unclear. General Chavalit was widely expected to be Thailand's next Prime Minister, and Mr. Chatichai tried to establish General Chavalit as his successor in the Chart Thai Party. General Chavalit joined the Chatichai Cabinet as Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister in the spring of 1990, but resigned only 10 weeks later. **********He had attacked alleged corruption in the Government and among Thai politicians, but another Cabinet minister described General Chavalit's wife as \"a moving jewelry box,\" implying that he, too, was corrupt. The army has been threatening coups ever since, managing to get the offending minister dismissed and political shufflings engineered more to their liking. **********It seemed the military was angling for new elections, and General Chavalit decided to form a new party so he could get elected to Parliament. **********Mr. Chatichai, himself a former general, was the first Prime Minister to have been an elected member of Parliament since 1976, the date of the last successful coup, and a parliamentary seat seemed a prerequisite to becoming Prime Minister in a modern Thailand. All Eyes on Elections **********It may be that the coup is an effort to arrange these elections, but under a new Constitution that could provide more checks and balances on the power of elected politicians, a favorite issue among military commanders. **********Mr. Arthit's appointment as Deputy Defense Secretary was believed to have been made without the approval of Generals Sunthorn and Suchinda. It also seems to have signaled the 71-year-old Mr. Chatichai's efforts to arrange for Mr. Arthit to succeed him, since General Chavalit has chosen his own path. **********The military has also been upset by the sudden re-emergence of rumors about a 1982 assassination plot allegedly aimed at the King, the then-Prime Minister, Prem Tinsulanonda, and Mr. Arthit, army Chief of Staff at the time. **********In April 1981, Mr. Arthit put down a coup attempt, then survived numerous attempts on his life. Plans to kill the leaders were apparently laid for October 1982, but twice came to nothing, and the plot was covered up. **********In the last few weeks, leaflets have been distributed in Thailand trying to implicate Mr. Chatichai's son, Kraisak Choonhavan, a former left-wing academic, who has been a confidant to his father, and another key Chatichai aide. The leaflets started after Mr. Chatichai removed two senior police officers who had worked on the assassination plot investigation. **********These efforts at destabilization simply display how isolated Mr. Chatichai has become. When he refused to defer to the military, they did what they continually promised not to do -- interfere with the political life of the nation -- in an effort, they no doubt will suggest, to purify and improve it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/13/business/company-news-hasbro-extends-tonka-bid-again.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 164, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hasbro Extends Tonka Bid Again", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Hasbro Extends Tonka Bid Again", "body_text": " **********Hasbro Inc., which is trying to complete its planned $470 million acquisition of the Tonka Corporation, has again extended its deadline for Tonka's bondholders to tender their securities, from 7 P.M. today until 7 P.M. on Monday.

She noted that last month's increase included both houses and multifamily dwellings and all regions of the country. Data Often Erratic **********While analysts shied away from downright optimism since these figures are notoriously erratic and were rebounding from severely depressed levels, most said they were heartened. **********\"They're better than we expected,\" said Michael Carliner, an economist for the National Association of Home Builders, noting particularly the broad nature of the gains. \"It's a positive sign.\" Yet he added that sales of new homes continued to be depressed and that builders' surveys did not yet show any real pickup in customer traffic despite the lowest mortgage rates in about 15 years. **********Conventional mortgages averaged just under 8 7/8 percent in mid-October and have fallen since to just under 8 3/4 percent. Most in 11 Months **********\"The housing market is clearly off the bottom and is moving up\" because of lower rates, said Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist at ASB Capital Management in Washington. Modest gains in starts have now been recorded in six of the last seven months, the report showed. **********Housing starts in October ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,096,000, the most since 1,130,000 for November 1990 and 6.8 percent higher than in the month a year earlier. **********Without adjustment for seasonal variation -- starts in midsummer typically double those of midwinter -- the October pace was 1,031,000 compared with 865,000 in September and 942,000 in October 1990. **********Even with last month's jump, however, starts are running at barely half the 1986 yearly peak of just over two million dwellings. This indicates that further increases will need to be substantial if they are to provide a significant thrust for economic recovery. Analysts watch housing closely since starts imply demand not only for construction materials and labor but also appliances, carpeting and other goods. **********Single-family homes rose 3.9 percent last month to a rate of 898,000, the fastest since April 1990. Apartments and other multifamily dwellings rose to a 198,000 rate, a 26.1 percent jump from the September pace. **********The South had the biggest overall increase, 9.7 percent, followed by 9.3 percent for the Northeast, 7.4 percent for the Midwest and 2.4 percent for the West. **********Although the Northeast's percentage gain was comparable to that of the other regions, the level of starts was far below any of the others, both with and without seasonal adjustment. **********John P.

They said that the principle of deterrence by threat of massive retaliation remained the bedrock of nuclear policy. For 40 years, the United States and Soviet Union have held each other's nuclear arms hostage with the threat that a first strike would unleash a devastating nuclear counterpunch.  Deterrence's Defense **********To those who maintain that this policy should be changed to reflect thawing cold war tensions, its adherents say deterrence has worked for the last four decades and ask why it should be abandoned so quickly now. **********President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev pledged at last year's summit meeting in Washington to push for deeper reductions after the strategic arms treaty, but negotiators, weary from their nine-year labor, seem to have neither the energy nor the inclination to pursue more radical cuts anytime soon. **********\"We have to see how this works out,\" said Jay P. Kosminsky, deputy director of defense policy studies at the Heritage Foundation. **********In all likelihood, say Administration officials and arms control specialists, there will be a pause in the arms talks to gauge not only the treaty's results but also the future course of the Soviet Union. **********\"Certainly in their present situation the Soviets are not going to be thinking of attacking the United States, but we have to think about 5, 10, even 15 years from now,\" Harold Brown, a former Defense Secretary, said in a telephone interview. **********Amid this wariness, however, there are some signs of accord between the two armed forces. Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on the ABC News program \"Nightline\" last week that joint military exercises between American and Soviet forces are possible in the future. **********\"The relationship is growing so that we may well see that happening at some point in the future,\" said General Powell, who was in the Soviet Union for a weeklong tour of military installations. **********Seven years after it takes effect, the strategic-arms treaty will bring the number of Soviet long-range nuclear weapons down from nearly 11,000 to between 7,000 and 8,000, and the United States warheads from 12,000 to 10,500. **********The number of Soviet ballistic missile warheads -- which the United States considers most dangerous -- would be reduced by about 50 percent. The United States would reduce its ballistic missile warheads by about 35 percent. **********While the total number of strategic weapons will be about the same as it was nine years ago, Edward L. Warner of the Rand Corporation said the number of ballistic missile warheads would decline by about 30 percent from 1982 levels. **********The treaty covers only strategic weapons, those with ranges of more than 3,000 miles. The Natural Resources Defense Council, a private, nonprofit group supporting limits on weapons, said that shorter-range nuclear missile warheads in Europe, as well as other warheads not covered by the treaty like those dropped by planes or fired from ships and submarines, the United States has a total of about 27,300 nuclear warheads and the Soviet Union about 30,000. Most Soviet Missiles Withdrawn **********The Soviet Union has withdrawn most of its tactical nuclear missiles from the former Warsaw Pact countries in Eastern Europe. The United States has said any decision to remove its 3,000 to 3,500 short-range nuclear warheads in Europe would be made in consultation with its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. **********The aim of arms control is to prevent nuclear war. The current deterrence philosophy evolved after the deployment of American nuclear weapons in postwar Europe to deter the threat of attack from the much larger Soviet conventional forces. **********The signing of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, which codifies reductions in troops and equipment and reverses the advantage in NATO's favor, has largely eliminated that threat. **********At issue now is how many nuclear weapons Washington needs to deter a Soviet attack against the United States. **********A weapon's ability to withstand a first strike increases its retaliatory value and, by definition, enhances its deterrent capability. The goal of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty has been to slim and shuffle the superpower nuclear menu into a more predictable and therefore more stable mix. This encourages the development of quieter submarines, gravity bombs dropped from planes and mobile ballistic missiles, and discourages land-based missiles with multiple warheads.  Missile Rules Differ **********\"The irony is if an enemy's forces are survivable, that's good,\" said the Rand Corporation's Mr. Warner. **********The treaty, for example, cuts the number of SS-18's, the Soviets' most accurate weapon against hardened targets like American missile silos. Under the pact, the Soviets would cut SS-18's to 154 from 308. Each missile carries 10 warheads. **********At the same time, the treaty is more permissive in its counting rules for warheads carried by heavy bombers or cruise missiles, because these weapons are less capable of launching a first strike and less vulnerable to attack. **********\"Start is designed to encourage the restructuring of nuclear forces in ways that will make them more stable and less threatening,\" a senior Administration official involved in the talks told reporters last week. \"Cuts for the sake of cuts isn't just missing the point, it's bad arms control.\" **********But many arms control specialists and former Administration officials contend that both sides could come down to as low as 3,000 weapons without eroding the ability to deter a nuclear attack.  Biden Poses Question **********\"Must we continue to accept a world in which the capability to detonate tens of thousands of Hiroshimas is deemed a necessary and normal fact of international life?\" asked Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe, two weeks ago at an arms-control hearing. **********Dunbar Lockwood, a senior analyst at the Arms Control Association, a nonprofit advocate of arms reduction, said lowering the levels would also reduce the need for costly nuclear fuel production; improve the ability of the superpowers to prevent an accidental launch -- a growing concern given the domestic unrest in the Soviet Union -- and put more pressure on the superpowers to discourage nations with budding nuclear programs. **********Moreover, arms control advocates say, Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty negotiators have settled the difficult task: niggling but important details like rules about counting, weapon definitions and verification procedures. With an enduring framework in place, these officials said, making the actual cuts is easy. **********Driving the number of warheads is the number of targets in the Soviet Union that American planners assign as they consider contingencies. Administration officials said that the United States has slashed about 3,000 potential targets from a group of 10,000 in its most recent list. **********Many of those targets were fixed structures in Eastern Europe or military equipment that the Soviets have withdrawn under the conventional forces agreement. Several nuclear arms specialists said the Admistration could shrink its targeting list even further. **********\"You don't have to hit every P.T.A. building in Siberia to deter the Soviet Union,\" said a Senate staff member who follows arms control."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/29/business/arco-posts-loss-unocal-net-off-sharply.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1991-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 490, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARCO Posts Loss; Unocal Net Off Sharply", "print_headline": "ARCO Posts Loss; Unocal Net Off Sharply", "body_text": " **********ARCO Inc. said today that it took a $340 million charge against earnings to pare 2,100 workers from its payroll and other actions, and that as a result it reported a net loss of $156 million in the third quarter. **********The Unocal Corporation said its net income fell by 92.5 percent in the quarter.

They might even surprise everyone with specific proposals early on. They want this process to succeed more than anyone else. **********The Syrian-Israeli talks, obviously, are a bigger question. I imagine there will be a meeting, but I don't know where -- or how optimistic the parties will be to continue. The real process of the Israeli-Syrian accommodation will not be seen in official negotiation committees. Those responsible will probably be their intelligence services meeting in Czechoslovakia or somewhere and seeing what they can agree on. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see the conference established elsewhere than in the formal negotiating forum. **********It's also possible to see Lebanon-Israel negotiations turn serious, but with a strong Syrian hand reflected in the discussion. I can almost imagine Israel and the Lebanese talking about Syrian issues and the Syrians plugging into that. **********The United States has to recognize its ongoing role as a mediator. The United States has to have substantial ideas to inject into the negotiating process. President Bush cannot go to the conference and then say, \"O.K., now we've done our job, we can go home and leave you to it.\" We should present certain ideas on specific issues with the objective of trying to define what the big trade-off will be. We need to go to the parties and say, \"If you could get so and so, would you consider such and such?\" **********Judith Kipper  Political Analyst Brookings Institution **********The fact that the parties to the conflict are meeting in one room changes the agenda in the Middle East. It means de facto recognition of one another and acknowledging that they must find some form of coexistance. **********I think bilateral talks will take place because none of the parties can refuse to go. That party would be blamed for the talks' failure. None of them can afford this, with the end of the Cold War and each of them looking towards the United States for assistance. **********But there will be ups and downs, walkouts, consultations, assurances, clarifications, Arab summits, elections in Israel -- every Middle East postponement tactic they can use. The parties to the conflict enjoy the role of victim too much and are too fearful of taking the risks necessary without mediation from the United States and the Soviet Union. It will require powers of persuasion, new ideas, incentive, threats, the whole basket of instruments available -- not a specific plan, but for the United States to suggest ideas when the parties reach a deadlock. **********Everyone will take familiar positions and we will hear some vitriolic speeches and accusations of all kinds of things. But the bilateral talks will start for a couple of days, then stop, and everyone will go back for consultations with their governments and leaders. So clearly, the United States and the Soviet Union will have to have teams for handholding. These negotiations mirror what has happened in the world, the transformation from the cold war to a new world order. **********Joseph Sisco Assistant Secretary of State, 1969-74 **********I don't accept the gloom and doom scenarios that this will break up. There will be stops and starts, surprises and crises. It is significant that the Israelis and Arabs are in the room together. It is not a guarantee the conference is not going to fall apart. But something happens when people get into the room together. **********The Arabs and Israelis will begin bilateral relations. The most hopeful dimension is in Baker's framework within which Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian residents in the West Bank will focus on bilateral dialogue over some form of autonomy as reflected in Camp David. The general understanding is that they'll leave the tough issues of sovereignty, borders, Jerusalem and the like for the later stages. **********My concern is really the Syrian position. I think Syria is pivotal. Historically, they have been the spoiler. Syria made it very clear they want to play a role in three dimensions -- the question of the Golan Heights, the question of Lebanon, where Syria as well as Israel is present, and the position that they don't believe in separate agreements. That means they are seeking to exercise a veto over Israeli-Palestinian negotiations relative to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. **********Each of the parties will play to its own home audience during the talks. At the outset each side will adopt totally impossible positions. But even so, that will not prevent bilateral dialogue. The reason is the pressures that brought them to the conference table are the same pressures that will keep them there. Neither side wants to affront the United States, which is at the zenith of its power in the area. And everyone knows that the route to Jerusalem is through Washington. **********Zbigniew Brzezinski   National Security Adviser, 1977-81 **********There will be enduring difficulties, occasional disruptions, some dramatic abortions, but in the end I think there will be a peace treaty. It will involve both the Syrians and Palestinians. It could conceivably happen within a year. **********What no one has fully seized is that there are three important changes here: First, this is the first time in the modern age that only one power is dominant in the Middle East, the United States.  The Arabs have nowhere to go. Israel has to take American views extremely seriously, especially since the President has demonstrated over the housing loan guanrantees that he will not be jerked around. Second, every peace conference in the past has included only Egypt, not any of the other Arab states. Third, this time we know exactly what the outcome will be, though we are not sure how to get there. **********There will probably be some arrangement on the Golan Heights that is similar to the arrangement in Sinai. And some sort of arrangement in the West Bank that is similar to Camp David. **********Above all, the United States has to keep the pressure on, and make it clear that there are definite penalties for any party that disrupts the process. **********Samuel Lewis   U.S. Ambassador to Israel, 1977-85 **********I think the end result, by the end of the decade, will be a large measure of peace. I think we'll have a settlement in five to six years, maybe a decade, that reaches some accommodation of the Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian part of the problem. My guess is it won't be total independence but a confederation structure with different borders than 1967. **********I'm not sure about Syria. Maybe there will be recognition of Syrian sovereignty in the Golan Heights with some Israeli and international forces present. But it will be less clear-cut than an Israeli withdrawal. Hafez al-Assad deciding to enter negotiations was the key element that broke the logjam, but it doesn't mean he's ready to go to full peace. **********There will be a lot of turbulence between the opening conference and the bilateral talks. But there's too much invested to walk away. The Arabs and Israelis are in a bazaar, where there are a lot of negotiations. Once they begin the less public horse-trading, the mediators can begin to operate outside the public glare. The Israelis are not going to make concessions on territory in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the near future. The present bilateral negotiations are over autonomy, and that does not involve territory. **********I certainly hope the United States will not come up with a peace plan. That would be the end of the story. When the United States put forward peace plans in the past, everyone turned from dealing with each other and began shooting at the plan. We should assist with the deadlocks. But it will take an enormous committment and will divert attention from the rest of the world and domestic issues. **********Richard Murphy **********Assistant Secretary of State, 1983-89 **********We should try to play down the content of the conference. It's the symbolism that is important. Israelis and Arabs listened to each others' speeches, and that is something they don't even do at the United Nations. The substance is not in what goes on in the three days at Madrid, but the stated intent to continue into bilateral talks. There we will see how serious each one is in their profession to want peace. **********They wouldn't be at the conference without having the stage set by what happened in Europe to end the cold war and what happened in Iraq. I hope they find that the geopolitical situation has changed on a global scale, and the Middle East is not immune to that change. But what happens in Madrid is really more of a television show. It's more visuals than oral. **********Bush pledges his support for a continuing effort to bring about a comprehensive peace. But it is important that at the beginning there not be an American plan. Why put forth something that we know in the initial stages will be shot down? The United States has to determine early in the bilateral talks, when the parties realize that their real positions are those stated in public, to say, \"All right, here's a standoff, two fixed positions clearly expressed, but what do you think about this or that possibility?\" **********People said the only reason they parties are there is because they don't want to say no to the United States. I don't think that is the full reason. Both sides -- and there is no one Arab position -- are aware that times have changed. It is the end of their ability to depend on the grace and favor of a superpower in the sense of the 1970's and 80's. I think they're aware times have changed. **********Robert Oakley National Security Council Special Assistant, 1987-88 **********The real catalyst here is the feeling of the people of the region. They believe the time has come to do something different and end this conflict. Arabs and Israelis prefer the benefits of peace. It requires responsible, courageous political leadership because a lot of people are working against any compromise. All the players invested a lot of political capital in going to the conference, and they didn't do that because of war or because of United States pressure. That explanation has been exaggerated. Rather, they believe the world has changed and they realize they'd better change with it. **********But the process is going to take a long time. There was a similar conference in Geneva in December 1973. Syria did not attend, and it took six more years to get to the Camp David talks. Still, the conference ran directly into the beginning of the movement towards a peace between Israel and Egypt. **********I don't think anything more could be done than has not been done already. It almost looks as if the United States is more interested in peace in the Middle East than the Middle Easterners. Middle East leaders have to understand that this is what the people there want. That will be the catalyst. **********We have to help them learn how to talk to each other. The President has done just right. He saved himself for the big issues, as a court of last resort. He has not adopted the Carter approach of getting in there. But he has full confidence in Secretary of State Baker and everyone knows that."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/18/world/moscow-to-ask-help-from-west-on-reform-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1991-05-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 952, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Moscow to Ask Help From West On Reform Plan", "print_headline": "Moscow to Ask Help From West On Reform Plan", "body_text": " **********The Kremlin has begun an initiative to get major Western countries to join directly in drafting and financing a far-reaching plan for economic and political reform, including creation of a market economy, political decentralization and privatization. **********The initiative, details of which were made public in the weekly Moscow News, has not been formally endorsed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev or by the Group of Seven industrialized powers. **********But extensive private contacts have produced an appeal to the West signed by Yevgeny M. Primakov, a senior adviser to Mr. Gorbachev, and Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a widely respected economist.  Young Aide's Second Initiative **********Mr. Yavlinsky, the 39-year-old economist who was the primary architect of the \"500 day plan\" of radical economic reform rejected by Mr. Gorbachev last summer, was said to be the major mover behind the new initiative. **********His aides say he and Mr. Primakov are to fly to Boston on Sunday to discuss refinements for the plan with economists at Harvard University. The idea began taking shape last month when Mr. Yavlinsky was invited to a meeting of experts on the Soviet economy from the Group of Seven. **********The initiative that emerged is still taking shape, and Mr. Gorbachev is said to be awaiting the reception in the West before he publicly endorses the plan. The Kremlin reportedly hopes to reach sufficient agreement for Mr. Gorbachev to be invited to the summit meeting of the Seven -- the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Japan -- in London in July. **********In Moscow, the initiative is thought to come at a propitious time. On the Soviet side, Mr. Gorbachev has struck a promising truce with Boris N. Yeltsin, the head of the Russian republic and the primary champion of radical economic reform, in which the President finally recognized the sovereignty of the republics and their right to secede.  Growing Sense on Need for Aid **********There is also a growing sense in the Soviet Union that the \"crisis program\" produced by the government of Prime Minister Valentin S. Pavlov can only be a stopgap measure without extensive Western assistance. Mr. Pavlov himself in a recent interview appealed to the West not to be bystanders to the Soviet crisis. **********On the Western side, President Bush has lately demonstrated a renewed interest in assisting Mr. Gorbachev, prompting a flurry of new contacts, including a telephone conversation between the leaders on May 11. **********In addition, many Western experts have come to say that the West cannot sit on the sidelines if it is interested in genuine reforms in the Soviet Union. One of these, Graham Allison, former dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, helped Mr. Yavlinsky shape the proposals. **********Mr. Yavlinsky is considered by many Western experts to be the most competent of Soviet economists. He has remained active as an adviser to Mr. Yeltsin and other republican leaders. Mr. Gorbachev's willingness to listen to him again was in itself viewed as further evidence that the President is retreating from the alliance with hard-line forces that he formed last fall.  Basic Principles Outlined **********The basic principles of the new initiative are included in an \"Appeal to the Group of Seven\" signed by Mr. Yavlinsky and Mr. Primakov. It calls on the Soviet Union to draft a comprehensive reform plan and asks the Group of Seven to prepare a parallel plan of economic cooperation. **********The letter outlines these basic objectives: ***********\"A concrete distribution of powers between the center and the republics, especially in economic matters.\" ***********Strict financial and monetary policies and liberalized prices. ***********A \"broad program of privatization and demonopolization.\" ***********\"The creation of conditions for the formation of an open economic system in the Soviet Union and its integration into the world economy.\" ***********The development of legislative bases for a market economy. **********These elements have been cited in most previous reform plans. The difference is that this is the first to propose an active role for the West. The financial package, the Soviets say, could include new terms for repaying Moscow's foreign debt, the lifting of trade restrictions, Soviet membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, long-term credits and diverse technical assistance.  No Cost Mentioned **********Drafters of the letter did not include a cost for the proposal. But Aleksei Mikhailov, a member of Mr. Yavlinsky's economic think-tank, \"Epicenter,\" pointed to a recent article by Prof. Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University -- currently an economic advisor to the Polish government -- in which he said Western assistance to Moscow should be on the order of $30 billion per year for five years. **********Mr. Mikhailov said the proposal resolved the needs of both the Soviet Union and the West. The West would help Moscow achieve the political and economic stability without which it cannot introduce reforms, and the Soviet Union in turn would launch the reforms that the West demands as necessary for any assistance. **********In an interview with Moscow News, Mr. Yavlinsky said he was prodded to seek new solutions after Mr. Gorbachev ordered troops into the Moscow streets in March in an unsuccessful attempt to block a pro-Yeltsin rally. The stalemate, he said, proved \"that nobody can win,\" and that the only path was through compromise and negotiation. **********Then last month he was invited to attend a meeting of experts preparing the Group of Seven summit talks. Before going he consulted with Mr. Primakov and other Government officials. Mr. Yavlinsky's departure coincided with Mr. Gorbachev's meeting with the presidents of nine Soviet republics, at which they called off their destructive feuding and agreed to cooperate. **********Mr. Yavlinsky said he argued his case for cooperation in Washington. The experts wanted a sign that the Kremlin shared his interest, and from this arose the idea of a joint appeal from him and Mr. Primakov."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/13/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-872691.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 32, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; People", "body_text": " *********** Robert Horne has been named senior vice president and group director at Griffin Bacal Inc., New York.

It will be more than twice the size of an edition of Time magazine called Time Business, which at 1.635 million circulation is currently the largest. **********Some agency executives will be \"surprised that we can come up with an edition that size,\" Mr. Donoghue said, adding that The Reader's Digest has always seen itself as a magazine \"that carries the type of editorial that attracts all kinds of people, including affluent people.\" **********Power Plus has the same goal as any higher-income demographic edition, Mr. Donoghue said: to attract new advertisers in categories like travel, financial services, home electronics and imported cars. **********Roberta Garfinkle, vice president and director of print media at McCann-Erickson New York, sees another purpose.

Indefinite detention preserves flexibility and avoids angering the West with announcements of long sentences. In addition, the system exercises maximum pressure on the inmates, partly because they are frequently prohibited from seeing their families until after sentencing. **********\"My greatest fear was that they would just keep me inside indefinitely for years, without even handing me over to the courts,\" said a dissident who was recently released after many months in prison. \"It's that constant uncertainty that gets to you.\" **********Thousands of young people, mostly workers, appear to have been sentenced to prison or to \"labor re-education\" camps because of their involvement in the Tiananmen movement, and a small number were executed. **********Robin Munro, a researcher in Hong Kong for Asia Watch, the American human rights organization, said the Government may try the remaining cases secretly, to avoid attracting attention in the West.

They may seize an issue -- like accusations that Western relief for Kurdish refugees is deficient -- to prod the authorities to reassert their own, revolutionary credentials. **********But after the strictures of the revolution under Ayatollah Khomeini and over a decade of war and decline, the radical message has lost some appeal. **********Asked if radical influence was declining, Mr. Khoeniha said: \"Your question is correct. Islamic fundamentalists are in a different situation now than when Ayatollah Khomeini was alive.\" **********The political considerations have a central bearing on the continued detention of Western hostages by Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon. The hostages represent one of the principal obstacles to a resumption of ties with Washington. **********The hostages, Mr. Larijani said, are \"for Iran a pure liability,\" although he denied that Teheran exercised decisive influence over their captors. **********Within Iranian politics, however, a Western diplomat said, any release of the Western captives that seemed submission to the West could be used by the radicals to belabor the authorities. **********President Rafsanjani, the diplomat said, \"does not wish to jeopardize his position for parliamentary elections\" next year, when the expectation among foreign analysts and some Iranians is that the radicals will lose their parliamentary footing.  Issue of Regional Security **********Even if that happens, Iran seems unlikely to abandon a perception of Washington, bred over 12 years, as the ogre that once bent Iran to its will. \"The hostility toward the United States is not right now a problem that differentiates the two groups,\" Mr. Larijani said. **********But, the official said, both Washington and Teheran share an interest in a peaceful and stable Persian Gulf region, and in reliable oil markets. **********So there could be, even without diplomatic relations, what he termed a \"marriage of convenience\" whereby the United States helped rid the region of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq by promoting a coup and sponsored a \"regional security arrangement,\" or a \"United Nations monitoring group with U.S. participation.\" **********Washington seems unlikely to show much enthusiasm. But the notion of an Iranian official publicly acknowledging an American interest in the Persian Gulf and envisaging the prospect of a United States role, however indirect, in regional security seemed a marked divergence from what it called the line of Ayatollah Khomeini. **********But it is not, so far, the public line."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/07/world/war-in-the-gulf-iraq-iraqis-sever-ties-with-six-nations.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 652, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: Iraq; IRAQIS SEVER TIES WITH SIX NATIONS", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: Iraq; IRAQIS SEVER TIES WITH SIX NATIONS", "body_text": " **********The Baghdad radio reported today that Iraq was severing diplomatic relations with six allied countries, and Iraq reported that about 150 people, including 35 children, were killed by allied bombing in a southern city. **********The report of the deaths in the southern city of Nasiriya overnight is by the far the highest casualty toll reported by Iraq in a single attack since the Persian Gulf war began on Jan. 17. **********Iraq said it would break off ties with the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

Retaliation Is Likely **********China will also use high tariffs to drive American companies out of its markets if the United States does not renew the current trade privileges, Mr. Zhu added. Billions of dollars in contracts and thousands of jobs in industries from aircraft manufacturing to agricultural chemical production would be at risk, he said. **********Mr. Zhu's remarks were only a little more strident than other policy statements by Chinese officials. For China has pursued a pugnacious four-pronged lobbying strategy here that has dismayed its friends and gladdened its foes. **********Mr. Zhu's comments were not what members of Congress had hoped to hear. The massacre at Tiananmen Square in 1989, along with reports in the last month by a human rights group and a Congessman that political prisoners are being forced to produce goods for export, have so stained the reputation of China's leadership that diplomats' assurances carry little credibility. **********A growing number of American lawmakers say they want China's \"most favored nation\" trade status revoked outright. \"The Ambassador's threats will strengthen their case,\" said Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who opposes renewal unless it is linked to human rights improvements. Bush Decision Due by June 3 **********President Bush must notify Congress by June 3 if he wishes to renew for one year China's most-favored status, which is due to expire on July 3. A motion of disapproval, which seems likely to be introduced, would have to pass both houses of Congress within 90 days, and it probably would provoke a Presidential veto. **********When President Bush renewed China's trade status last year, the House voted to disapprove the renewal. The Senate considered similar action but did not take a vote before the 90-day time limit expired, so the renewal stood. **********Several lobbyists who favor renewal expect that this year President Bush will recommend a renewal of the special status, that both houses of Congress will disapprove it, and that the President will veto the disapproval. It is possible, though unlikely, that Congress will then override the veto. **********Another possibility is that Congress will pair its disapproval of the status for China with approval of a renewal for the Soviet Union, said one lobbyist who favors a renewal for China. In that case, the President would face a particularly difficult dilemma, because the Soviet Union is in desperate need of certain trade subsidies and other credits that indirectly depend on a renewal of its status. Tariff Would Rise to 47.48% **********The U.S.-China Business Council, a Washington-based group of American companies with investments in China, has estimated that the average tariff for the 25 biggest categories of American imports from China will rise to 47.48 percent, from 8.35 percent, if most-favored status is not renewed. With this status, Chinese products enter the United States at the lowest rate available to any American trading partner for each category of goods. **********The test of China's strategy will come soon. Congress appeared increasingly likely last week to authorize the Administration to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico and another round of reductions in global trade barriers. At the same time, China's trade status was moving quickly toward the top of the agendas of Washington's economic policy makers. **********An eclectic alliance of trade protectionists, anti-Communist conservatives and liberal human rights advocates opposes an unconditional extension. **********The strongest of China's four lobbying themes has been that Congress and the Administration should value the United States' strategic relationship with China too highly to risk endangering it for the sake of human rights or trade surpluses. President Bush, a former chief of the American liaison office in Beijing, is widely seen as particularly influenced by this argument. Overestimation by Chinese **********But the Chinese consistently overestimate how much weight is given to such long-term considerations on Capitol Hill, said Warren W. Williams, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. Mr. Williams has led a delegation to lobby Washington in support of the Chinese. **********\"Their fundamental lack of understanding of how things work in Washington, D.C., is a continuing surprise,\" he said. **********Another Chinese lobbying tactic is to insist that China guarantees different human rights, including rights to food and shelter, than the the United States does. American officials, by this argument, should not judge a foreign country by their own standards. **********Chinese officials also criticize American trade statistics showing that China shipped $15.1 billion worth of goods to the United States last year while importing products worth only $4.8 billion. Excluding Chinese exports that pass through Hong Kong, the trade is nearly in balance, Mr. Zhu contended. But this argument has not been persuasive in Washington, Mr. Williams said.  Attempt to Intimidate U.S. **********The last of China's four approaches to lobbying in Washington has been intimidation. \"I have a fondness for the American people,\" Mr. Zhu said after his speech on Tuesday. \"I really don't want to see West German or Japanese people there, taking over.\" **********Business conditions for Americans in China are said to be deteriorating already. For three weeks, Chinese negotiators have been stalling in contract talks with American companies, said an American businessman with extensive contacts there, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. He said the Chinese negotiators were acting on Government instructions. **********But in a possible change of tack, the New China News Agency said Saturday that China would send a buying mission to the United States, Reuters reported. **********Some people in Washington question the credibility of Chinese threats to exclude American businesses and products. \"They may not love capitalism; they may not love human rights, but they love money,\" Representative Pelosi said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/16/world/security-seen-as-a-dividend-of-soviet-aid.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1991-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1322, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Security Seen as a Dividend of Soviet Aid", "print_headline": "Security Seen as a Dividend of Soviet Aid", "body_text": " **********As a debate simmers in Washington over what sort of economic aid the United States should extend to the Soviet Union if it adopts democratic, free-market reforms, the question inevitably arises: what is in it for the United States? **********The answer from many of those who favor aid, including economists, members of Congress and Administration officials, is that the payoff for the United States -- if there is one -- will be primarily in political-security terms and not economic ones. **********\"For the United States, the case for Soviet aid is really a political call, not an economic one,\" said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International and former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. Buying a Tranquilizer **********\"If you really want to get some economic bang for the 30 billion in bucks people are talking about, there would be a lot better way to spend it,\" Mr. Hormats said. \"If the aid works, what you are buying is an economic tranquilizer designed to stabilize a potentially chaotic situation in the Soviet Union, in order to permit a transition to a free market and more democratic confederation of some sort.\" **********To be sure, whether the Administration chooses to develop a Soviet economic rescue package will depend primarily on the seriousness of the Soviet Union's own rescue plans, or as President Bush said Friday: \"The reforms have got to be detailed a bit more before blank checks are written, and even then it would be difficult. We're not rolling in cash.\" **********But Mr. Hormats said the size of any aid program would also depend on \"how desperate\" the Administration believed the political situation in the Soviet Union to be, whether it was in the national security interests of the United States to try to stabilize it and whether that would be possible with any amount of money. Hopes for immediate benefits to the American economy will be secondary. **********Indeed, Administration officials acknowledge that the key factor prompting President Bush this week to grant Mr. Gorbachev's request for $1.5 billion in additional credits to buy American food was a fear that food shortages in the Soviet Union, coupled with political turmoil, might lead the country to implode before any reform program could be instituted. Possible Global Consequences **********Since the Soviet Union occupies one-sixth of the world's landmass, has 12,000 nuclear missiles, countless conventional weapons and some 50 nuclear reactors, a few billion dollars in credits is deemed a small price to pay for helping to prevent political and economic turmoil there, the consequences of which could be global, officials say. **********\"Spending American tax dollars to aid the Soviet economic transformation is the easiest proposition in the world to mock,\" said Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University economist who has been working with Soviet economists on a five-year, $100 billion reform plan. \"But those who want to stand by and see the Soviet Union collapse have an incredible lack of historical memory.\" **********Americans are taking for granted the cooperation exhibited by the Soviet Union in recent years on a broad front including Eastern Europe and the Persian Gulf war, Mr. Sachs said. **********\"Do we really want to wait for a right-wing backlash in the Soviet Union, produced by a sense of failure, paranoia and anger about losing the cold war?\" he added. \"We will very much regret that. That is exactly the sort of sentiment that produced a man like Hitler after the First World War.\" **********Not everyone, though, accepts this aid-to-prevent-nuclear-chaos argument. **********\"I think that it's somewhere between a new form of nuclear blackmail and gross exaggeration,\" Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, said in an interview on the Public Broadcasting System foreign affairs television series \"American Interests.\" \"The fact is that the Soviet military is in control of the nuclear weapons, they're primarily controlled by Russians in Russia and I don't think that it's a serious, very serious problem.\" Some See Political Benefits **********Nevertheless, the potential benefits in American national security terms go beyond preventing nuclear chaos. Virtually all of the leading economists and lawmakers now advocating some American aid package do so on the condition that it not be paid out unless the Soviets take concrete steps to transform their economy from central control to a free market and their polity from a Communist system to a democratic one. **********If such a transformation can be promoted, said Stanley Fischer, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist working with the Soviet Union, \"you will end up with both a democratic and capitalist Soviet Union, and the fact is you find very few wars between democracies.\" **********When Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on international operations, is asked by constituents why their tax dollars should go to help transform the Soviet economy, this political point is where he takes off from. **********\"We now have the opportunity to participate in the most fundamental change in a major society in the 20th century and to help shape that society in a way that will give us an opportunity to minimize our defense expenditures,\" Mr. Obey said. \"We now spend $120 billion a year on military expenditures, which principally involve the defense of Western Europe from the Soviet Union. **********\"If we can promote democratic changes in the Soviet Union that will allow us to reduce that by only 10 percent a year, you could still save a lot more than the few billion that anyone up here is talking about for programs to promote Soviet reform. It makes sense financially, it makes sense economically and it makes sense in security terms. The most expensive thing would be to do nothing.\" Effect on Eastern Europe **********Mr. Sachs argued that to think that an internal explosion in the Soviet Union would not have a spillover effect in Eastern Europe or the Muslim nations to the south would be \"extremely naive.\" The Soviet Army remains in Germany and Poland, and its withdrawal from Eastern Europe could easily be derailed by internal turmoil. **********Eastern European economies have already been badly hurt by the fact that the Soviet authorities have halted virtually all of the barter arrangements they had and are now insisting on being paid hard currency for Soviet oil exports. Because the Eastern Europeans are short of hard currency, they are having to look to the West for help in buying oil and have lost about 50 percent of their exports by no longer having access to many Soviet markets. **********\"So here we are pumping money into Eastern Europe to support reforms there, and it is being offset by the economic downturn in the Soviet Union,\" Mr. Sachs said. \"And ask yourself: How many Western businessmen are going to want to invest in Eastern Europe if the Soviet Union is exploding next door? Imagine the refugee problems for Eastern Europe that would cause. You can't bottle up turmoil.\" **********Finally, an orderly transition to democracy in the Soviet Government would, almost by definition, have to be accompanied by granting republics the right of self-determination, and that means the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia would be much more likely to find a nonviolent path to independence, which has been a basic objective of American foreign policy. **********On the purely economic side, the Soviet Union with its 290 million people and vast natural resources represents an enormously attractive potential market if its resources could be fully tapped through a free-market system. But there would be little direct benefit to the American economy, except for certain sectors like consumer product and food producers, oil and gas equipment manufacturers and machine tool makers. The most immediate beneficiaries would be the Europeans in general and the East Europeans in particular, given their historical trade links with the Soviet Union."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/06/world/the-un-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 26, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

At the same time the taxable funds continued their steady downward progress, dropping quite sharply. **********Referring to the tax-exempts, Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/ Donoghue's, said that yields had probably risen \"because of the large supply of municipal securities that has come to market before the year end.\" **********But he said total assets of the tax- exempts were $91.5 billion, down $1.2 billion for the week. The decline probably indicated that a substantial number of investors had withdrawn money to seek better yields elsewhere.

Outflow of Assets **********With regard to the taxable funds, Martha Wittbrodt, editor of the IBC/ Donoghue Money Fund Report, said that their total assets showed a sizable drop, declining $6.4 billion to a total of $468.8 billion.

But it was clear that other parties will have to form coalitions to face the Islamic Salvation Front in most districts where there are run-offs. **********Speaking at a delayed news conference tonight, Algeria's Interior Minister, Larby Belkhair, said more than 60 percent of the eligible 13.3 million voters participated in the elections, which he said took place in a \"calm and serene atmosphere.\" **********Without giving any final results, Mr. Belkhair said the Government had respected its pledge to remain \"totally neutral\" and had conducted \"a free election in total transparency.\" He described the vote as \"a new phase in Algeria's history.\" **********Algerian officials said final returns in this round would be announced by early Friday.

Forty-nine parties ran a total of 5,712 candidates for the 430 seats. **********The F.L.N. has ruled Algeria ever since it achieved independence in 1962. **********Observers from all participating parties could be seen at many polling stations in Algiers and were reported to be present throughout the country too. There were no reports of interference by the authorities or significant distrubances. **********Over the last two years, the Salvation Front, known by its French initials F.I.S., has clearly emerged as by far and away the most powerful opposition party to the Government, having won 55 percent of the posts in gubernatorial and local elections held in May 1990. **********Veiled women were present at many voting stations in the capital, driven there or accompanied by male relatives.

The warehouse stands near a supermarket in Al Khobar, a town considered to be part of Dhahran. **********The attack on Monday night killed more people than the 70 previous Scud attacks on Israel, Saudi Arabia and smaller gulf nations combined. And it inflicted more casualties on American troops than the Iraqi military had in the first two days of ground combat, based on casualty figures from the American military command.  Missile Broke Up **********The Scud apparently fragmented above the atmosphere, then tumbled downward. Its warhead blasted an eight-foot-wide crater into the center of the building, which is three miles from a major United States air base, Brig. Gen. Richard I. Neal of the United States Command, said. The Scud could not be tracked by the Patriot missile radar system, he said, because it had fragmented when it entered the atmosphere. **********\"The system we utilize to defeat this system has a known trajectory,\" General Neal said. \"Our investigation looks like this missile broke apart in flight. On this particular missile it wasn't in the parameters of where it could be attacked.\" **********General Neal said the warehouse stood in a \"major civilian area.\" He also insisted that the United States military uses a dependable missile defense system. **********Baghdad radio hailed the attack against \"the coward traitors who mortgage the sacred places of the nation and turn Arab youths into shields of flesh.\"  Attacks on Gulf Emirates **********Most of the Scuds fired by Iraq, including one fired on Monday at the island nation Bahrain, about 20 miles east of Dhahran, have been intercepted by American Patriot defense missiles. Iraq earlier today also fired its first missile against Qatar, an Arab member of the multinational coalition. It crashed in a deserted area and no damage was reported. Just after dusk this evening, air raid sirens went off again but no missile was reported to have hit in Saudi Arabia. Scud attacks have usually occurred when there is heavy cloud cover and the weather in Dhahran has been overcast during the last several nights. **********A sign at the entrance of the barracks marked it as the home of the 475th Quartermaster Group, an Army Reserve water and petroleum distribution unit based in Farrell, Pa. Although the wounded and the dead had still not been identified this evening, it appeared that the casualties had been from a number of units. Military officials said the wounded had been taken to the 85th Evacuation Hospital located at an air base here in Dhahran as well as to an air transportable clinic. Officials also said there were women among the soldiers who were killed. **********In Farrell, a town of 6,000 people close to the Ohio state line, Ella Ward, whose husband Roy is a staff sergeant in the 475th Group, said that her husband called her Monday night and said that most people in the unit were all right. But Hugh Farnen, of Columbia, Mo., the father of one of the reservists, said today that his 22-year-old son had been killed in the blast. Iraqi Withdrawal Announcement **********The missile hit only hours after Iraq announced it was withdrawing from Kuwait. Less than a minute after the air raid sirens sounded throughout Dhahran, the missile appeared as a burning streak of light crosding the night sky and then blasted into the building, setting it afire. **********Many of the soldiers were eating dinner or relaxing. Others were sleeping. No one had the time to don gas masks, as is the military procedure when the sirens sound. In the chaos that ensued, soldiers digging through the rubble attempted to give first aid to their comrades. Foil sheets were used to wrap those who had been badly burned and any mode of transport to hospitals was commandeered. Bus windows were smashed so that stretchers could fit inside and convoys of dozens of ambulances raced to hospitals. The worst cases were stretchered to waiting helicopters. **********As the dead were brought out and the casualties ferried to the hospitals, soldiers cried and embraced each other.

Lawyers and accountants have long followed rules similar to those now being required by the court. **********\"It puts the investment bankers down to the status of mere mortals with the rest of us, because they have to comply with the time-record-keeping requirements that everybody else has had to comply with all along,\" said Robert Miller, a bankruptcy lawyer at Berlack, Israels & Liberman. He does not expect the guidelines to require a drastic change in the way his firm does business. **********The issue has become significant because of a growing consensus that bankruptcy fees \"have simply run amok,\" as Mr. Miller put it yesterday. Stories of abuse have become legion, like that of a law firm involved in the Drexel Burnham Lambert bankruptcy that billed thousands of dollars to cover the time it spent preparing its bill. **********By law, big companies involved in bankruptcies must pay not only for their own legal and financial advice, but for that of creditors and shareholders. That requirement might cost $5 million a month in fees, about 20 percent of which might go to investment bankers. That money ultimately comes out of the pockets of creditors and shareholders. **********Investment bankers interviewed yesterday acknowledged that fees were getting out of control, but said their firms were not geared to bill by the hour. **********\"We do not have an hourly billing rate, nor do we have any intention of setting a billing rate,\" said Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the head of corporate finance at Rothschild Inc. \"In our industry, the month is a standard unit of time, and I don't know why it's any easier to figure out what's an hour's worth of work than a month's worth of work.\" Partly to Blame **********Although Mr. Ross said he thought a middle ground could be found, he also acknowledged that the investment banking business was partly to blame for the court's current stance. **********\"What they're really grappling with is how do you measure an investment banker's productivity?\" he said. \"I think it's a fair question. The real problem is the courts don't see investment bankers much, because much of what an investment banker does is in the conference room, not in the courtroom. \" **********How would he cut bankruptcy fees? \"The ultimate thing is to cut the duration of the cases,\" Mr. Ross said. **********Another investment banker warned that the new rules might force some firms to decline cases. \"If these rules were to be literally enforced as is, it would be difficult for the biggest securities firms to participate in bankruptcy court cases,\" said Norman Brown, a managing director for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. He said his firm was \"still trying to figure out whether it could comply.\" **********The guidelines' impact could reach beyond the Southern District if the reaction of A. Jay Cristol, a bankruptcy judge in Miami, is any guide. \"If they have done something to require investment bankers to account for their time, I look upon that with great favor,\" he said. **********Though the administrative order is labeled \"guidelines,\" nearly all of the rules it outlines will be mandatory in the Southern District, the document states. Departures from the norm, in the few categories where they are permitted, will have to include a detailed explanation of why the adviser thinks them justified. **********Advisers will be expected to keep records to support their fees, the document says. Records of expenses for things like photocopies and faxes will also have to be submitted to the courts before reimbursements can be approved. And charges have been limited: Photocopies can not exceed 20 cents a page, outgoing faxes can be reimbursed at no more than $1.25 a page domestically and $2.50 abroad, and incoming faxes are not reimbursable. **********The document discourages unnecessary overnight mail service and forbids the use of radio cars or taxis to deliver documents. Dinners eaten before 8 P.M. can be reimbursed only if professionals return to their offices for at least an hour and a half. **********The document states that \"local taxi and limousine charges should be minimized and justified.

The late June rate compared with an 8.1 million rate a year earlier and a 6.5 million rate in mid-June. **********The Big Three and the seven Japanese companies that build vehicles in North America sold 212,491 cars in late June, down 11.1 percent from 268,953 a year earlier.

Earlier this week, Ward's Automotive Reports said North American auto makers would produce 57,000 additional cars and light trucks in the third quarter. **********Among the Big Three, it was a relatively strong month for G.M. and Chrysler, each of which gained market share, and a weak one for Ford, which lost share. **********Industry analysts said G.M.'s Chevrolet division sold aggressively to rental fleets during the month, while Ford passed up fleet sales, which typically provide little profit. Chrysler's market share was bolstered by strong light-truck sales, particularly of the company's mini-vans, the Dodge Dakota pickup and the Jeep Wrangler and Cherokee models. **********Despite declining sales of import models, Japanese auto makers continued to offer large sales incentives.  Three's Car Share Dips **********The Big Three's share of the car market, imported and domestic, dropped to 62.3 percent in June from 63.1 percent a year ago. At the same time, the Japanese producers increased their share to 29.2 percent, from 27.2 percent last year. Non-Japanese importers, hurt by big declines for European luxury cars, dropped to 8.5 percent of the car market, from 9.7 percent last year. **********In light trucks, which include mini-vans, utility vehicles and pickup trucks, the Big Three makers were able to gain some market share, to 86.7 percent in June from 85.8 percent last year. Japanese producers, meanwhile, dropped to 12.6 percent of the market, from 13.4 percent a year earlier. Non-Japanese importers fell to six-tenths of a percent, from eight-tenths of a percent a year ago. **********Over all, the Big Three's share of the total vehicle market fell slightly, to 70.3 percent, from 70.5 percent last year, while the share of Japanese producers rose to 23.8 percent from 22.7. The share of non-Japanese importers dropped to 5.9 percent from 6.8.

Yeltsin has moved to assert the Russian republic's dominance over the foundering Soviet economy, proclaiming control over Russia's dwindling reserves of oil, gold and other precious metals and opening its doors to foreign trade. **********The package of new measures, officially announced early today, would lift most controls over imports, exports and foreign-currency transactions on Russian territory and allow the value of the ruble -- now fixed by the Soviet central bank though widely traded on the black market -- to float according to market rates, starting Jan. 1. **********The floating of the ruble would sharply reduce its value, but would greatly improve the climate for foreign investment by allowing investors to take their profits in cash instead of having to resort to cumbersome barter arrangements. Undercutting Union Accord **********With his latest flurry of decrees, Mr. Yeltsin appears to be undercutting a union economic agreement signed early this month by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the leaders of 9 of the 12 remaining Soviet republics. **********The agreement recognized individual republics' sovereignty over their own economic output, but it provided for a single currency administered by a Soviet central bank. **********Efforts to coordinate policy continue to be hampered by unilateral decisions, as each of the republics stakes out turf and takes measures to assure its own survival. Since the failed coup attempt against Mr. Gorbachev in August, Mr. Yeltsin has steadily sought to expand the power of his giant republic, filling the vacuum created by the disintegration of Soviet state authority and the erosion of Mr. Gorbachev's influence. **********With his decrees -- issued in the name of the Russian republic's government, which under his current special powers is effectively under his personal control -- Mr. Yeltsin again showed his determination to drive the pace of economic reform not only in Russia but also beyond its borders. **********But the Russian leader's ability to dictate change has come under question in recent weeks, as his decrees, like those of Mr. Gorbachev, are swallowed up in the growing economic and political confusion. **********Last week, for instance, his Parliament overruled his effort to impose emergency rule in a troubled Muslim region, Chechen-Ingushetia, forcing him back to the negotiating table with Chechen separatists. **********The new package of decrees and government resolutions made no mention of Mr. Yeltsin's proposal last month to lift controls on consumer prices. This sharply increased the cost of most goods, from food to computers, as Russians rushed to protect themselves from expected hyperinflation. **********The Russian President, however, seemed to anticipate the social strains of his economic policy. Among other steps, he raised minimum salaries to 200 rubles a month -- the average salary is 350 rubles a month -- and pay for certain state employees 90 percent. Oil and Convertible Currency **********Russia's announcement that it would liberalize the rules governing foreign trade came just after Ivan S. Silayev, head of the interim Soviet economic council, moved to lift a number of restrictions on foreign trade across the Soviet Union. **********But Mr. Yeltsin's measures, which would allow all registered Russian companies to engage in foreign trade and Russian citizens to hold hard-currency bank accounts, go further. **********Russia controls 90 percent of Soviet oil production. Odfficials of the republic, worried about meeting the needs of their people as winter approaches, are now calling for a review of all existing oil-export licenses, and have frozen the granting of any new ones until Dec. 1. **********The measure would impose quotas on all exports beyond Russian borders. The production of oil, one of the links that still binds the economies of the republics, has been steadily falling. The resolution calls for strict controls over illegal bartering of oil for other products, arrangements that have become commonplace as oil-producing regions in Russia search for contracts to supply their people with desperately needed goods. **********According to the newspaper Kommersant, Russian authorities are also concerned about mounting prices paid for Russian oil on the Moscow Oil Exchange. This is seen as an attempt by other republics, in particular the former Baltic republics and the Ukraine, to unload unwanted rubles before issuing their own currencies. **********Mr. Yeltsin this weekend also carried out a long-threatened move to wrest control over gold, diamonds and other precious metals mined in Russia from the Soviet authorities. He declared that the production, processing, sale and storage of these metals would fall under Russian jurisdiction, with local producers to be paid 25 percent of their value in hard currency. **********The status of Soviet gold -- of which 67 percent comes from Russia -- has become a hot political topic in recent days, after reports that the country's supplies have been steadily depleted by Soviet officials in their anxious search for foreign currency reserves. Grigory A. Yavlinsky, an economic adviser to Mr. Gorbachev, recently announced that Soviet gold reserves had shrunk to 240 tons, from 2,050 tons in 1953. **********In a newspaper interview Friday, Aleksandr Orlov, who heads an audit commission of the Soviet Parliament, asserted that there were no gold reserves left in the Soviet central bank. Tales of Vanishing Gold **********\"Our specialists have analyzed the gold situation,\" Mr. Orlov said, \"and come to the conclusion that the Soviet state bank is bankrupt.\" **********The newspaper Izvestia, following the trail of Soviet gold, last week presented documentary evidence that five tons of \"hard-currency freight\" -- gold and platinum -- had been taken out of the country in the last six weeks. **********There was no clear answer available on the gold question, with various officials contradicting each other and Soviet credibility facing increasing doubt in world markets.

Public opinion polls predict that Poland's new proportional election rules will produce a fragmented Parliament elected with a turnout expected to fall below 50 percent. **********While comparable with elections in Western European nations, the expected turnout worries political leaders.  European Standard Unmet **********\"We are having democratic and free and fair elections, with a European level of participation, but we cannot cope with such a European standard,\" said Bronislaw Geremek, a leader of the Democratic Union who was one of Solidarity's top strategists in the 1980's. **********\"For our reforms, we need social involvement,\" he said. \"That was our capital at the beginning of this process. Since we couldn't obtain what the East Germans obtained, that means money, our capital was human. **********\"The question, now that we are in the second stage of this economic transformation, is whether we can count on this capital. Will there be a minimum of confidence, a minimum of hope?\" **********Political leaders agree that election results will set the course for this country's transition to a free-market economy and democratic politics. **********Among the first tasks facing the new government will be whether to continue the \"shock therapy\" reforms that have brought Poland a booming private sector but sharp rises in unemployment. Many of the 7,600 candidates for 560 seats have called for significant loosening of the existing tight monetary policies. Some also called for delays or revisions in the privatization of major state-run enterprises scheduled to begin shortly. Looking for Coalition **********On Friday, Mr. Geremek met with other leaders of the Democratic Union trying to figure out how a governing coalition could be assembled from the jigsaw puzzle of parties. **********The Union, the center-left party to emerge from Solidarity, includes many of the intellectuals from the anti-Communist movement and is led by Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the former Prime Minister who finished third in the presidential election last December that was won by Mr. Walesa. Recent nationwide polls suggest that Union will finish first, with anywhere from 15 to 25 percent of the vote. **********But as Mr. Geremek acknowledged, the process of building a majority is likely to be complicated by a wide spectrum of parties representing competing interests, from the farmers to the new urban middle class to the Solidarity trade union. **********The current Prime Minister, Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, heads the Liberal Congress, which preaches doctrinaire devotion to free-market principles. Mr. Bielecki has expressed willingness to join the Democratic Union and continue the existing economic policies. The Parties' Positions **********On the other hand, the more rightward leaning party of former Solidarity figures, the Center Alliance, has unequivocally ruled out cooperation with the Democratic Union, and favors an extensive easing of Poland's tight monetary policies. Parties hoping to appeal to the 30 percent of Poles who work as farmers have said they would join any party willing to accept their budget-busting plans for guaranteed farm prices. The Solidarity union, which favors major modifications in the economic plan, is also running a slate of candidates and is expected to fare well in major industrial areas. **********With all of the confusion and dissatisfaction, there have been fears among some analysts that the former Communists might fare well, as they did in the recent Bulgarian elections. **********Aleksander Kwasniewski, a leader of the Social Democratic Party, predicted in an interview that his party would score between 7 and 10 percent and said his party stood ready to join virtually any coalition. In fact, every major party has already ruled out cooperation with the Social Democrats, which would probably leave Mr. Kwasniewski in the position of what he terms \"responsible opposition.\" **********If the next government continues the free-market reforms along current lines, the resulting bankruptcies and layoffs could make the Social Democrats' election calls for more social spending, more job creation and more production at state-enterprises even more popular. **********Campaigning in these elections was mostly done retail, with candidates trudging from town to town meeting small numbers of voters in movie theaters and local schools. Every night at 10 P.M., an hour was set aside on national television for campaign commercials. The time was divided equally among all parties, and national surveys showed that most people responded to the parade of politicians by switching off their set or changing the channel. **********A week ago, the Roman Catholic Church injected an unpredictable element into the races. A letter from the nation's bishops endorsing candidates who espouse Christian principles and oppose abortion was read out at every Mass. Polls taken before the bishops' letter showed the five self-proclaimed Catholic parties running well behind. But there was speculation that such new groups as the Committee for Catholic Action might benefit from the last-minute endorsement. **********Poland, the first nation in Eastern Europe to oust Communism, is paradoxically the last to dismantle the remnants of the old system. In 1989, after months of talks between Solidarity and the regime, the Communists agreed to hold parliamentary elections in which all of the 100 seats in the Senate and 35 percent of the places in the Sejm, or lower house, would be freely elected. The remaining 65 percent of the seats, and control of the presidency, military and the police, were to be reserved for the Communists and their allies. **********In the ensuing election in June of 1989, Solidarity swept nearly every contested seat and cobbled together a coalition that brought Mr. Mazowiecki to power. Although seen at the time as a stunning success, the Polish victory was soon eclipsed by the fall of Berlin wall and collapse of Communism through the Eastern bloc."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/06/business/media-business-advertising-addenda-ogilvy-mather-direct-honored-conference.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-11-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ogilvy & Mather Direct Honored at Conference", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Ogilvy & Mather Direct Honored at Conference", "body_text": " **********Ogilvy & Mather Direct, New York, garnered two plums this week at the Direct Marketing Association's 74th annual conference and exhibition in Boston. **********Jerome Pickholz, chairman and chief executive of Ogilvy Direct, was named the 1992 chairman of the association yesterday, succeeding John A.

I don't live -- I exist.\" **********There has been no shortage of debate, confusion and anxiety since Mr. Yeltsin called Monday for people to face up to a hard year of price rises and shrunken purchasing power that he estimated would allow the government to get a foothold on the free-market next fall. **********He followed that up today by discussing one of the difficult tasks required by his strategy, the possible creation of a separate central bank for the Russian federated republic. If it proves necessary, he said it would be done by appropriating resources from Gosbank, the national bank of the Soviet Union, which represents the central economic monopoly Mr. Yeltsin is committed to undoing.

Mr. Yeltsin's aides stressed that he was raising the problem with the hope of reaching an orderly understanding with Gosbank officials.

The effect in the capital has bordered on bureacratic panic. Estimates are that this will mean that tens of thousands of Muscovites will lose their jobs by the end of the year.

And despite an all-out effort by the Red Crescent and Iran's military, disease and hunger were beginning today to gain the upper hand in some areas nearby. **********The Kurds said the rubble-strewn town of Halabja lacks sanitation and harbors disease, but seems safe for the moment from Iraqi troops. An Iranian Government official in Shushami today said that Iraqi troops were 20 air miles away and still posed a threat. **********\"We will go to Halabja. There is no Saddam there,\" said a Kurdish exile who calls himself Ismail said as he stood only 100 yards from the border. **********\"They have no place here -- no food, no medicine,\" a doctor at a frontier station said of the refugees. \"So they are going back to Halabja and Sirwan,\" a tiny village three miles from the Iranian border. **********Iran controls not only its own territory, but also effectively occupies a nearly four-mile stretch of Iraqi territory that serves as a no man's land between the two countries. Iranian helicopters and trucks have been distributing food and medicine in that area and allowing the sick to cross the border to visit the medical station. Menace of Impure Water **********Nevertheless, dysentery and other diarrhea-related illnesses have been epidemic because of a lack of sanitation and a shortage of clean water. Mountain breezes that were clear during a visit to this camp on Monday are now foul with the stench of human waste after three days of heavy rain. **********The one doctor at the border medical station, himself a Kurdish refugee named Azar, said the installation had run out of anti-diarrhea tablets and antibiotics and was almost out of baby formula and sugar-saline solution for infants dehydrated by diarrhea. **********The doctor added that typhoid had begun to break out among refugees still in Iraq, but that he had no drugs with which to treat it.  German Assistance Begins **********As he spoke, a team of German military doctors arrived to assess the area's needs and to plan a mobile hospital -- the first sign of international help, the doctor indicated, since he began work at the station a week ago. **********German officials said tonight that no help could be sent to the region until Monday at the earliest. **********Asked how many people had died at the medical station at Shushami, the doctor replied: \"They don't reach here. They die in the mountains.\" He later said he had learned of or seen 500 to 1,000 deaths since coming to the station a week ago. **********Refugees, whose claims are often exaggerated, said the number of deaths among Kurds deep in Iraq is far higher and that 200 are dead in Halabja alone. **********In recent weeks, the Kurdish refugees have been allowed to cross freely over this mountain road into Iran. Lately, however, the flow of Kurds has been reduced to a trickle, and there are rumors that the border will close entirely. **********The reasons are not clear. An Iranian Government official here said today that the military was deliberately curbing the entry of more Kurds into the province. \"The question is not about room, it is about security,\" the official said. \"We don't know if these people are Iraqi intelligence agents or mujahedeen,\" members of an Iranian opposition army based in Iraq. **********But the region is also overflowing with refugees, and resources are strained. Today, Iranian earthmovers were frantically scraping bare the mountain valley around Shushami, seeking to level areas for new tent cities. The Government says that more than 500,000 Kurds have already been admitted to this area, and food is said to be running short. A Plea to 'Mr. Bush' **********Today, thousands of Kurds huddled with their few possessions along stretches of mountain roads. Many, especially children, were visibly ill. Others approached foreign visitors with what quickly became a daylong refrain: \"In markets, in stores, we hang pictures of Mr. Bush,\" a middle-aged Kurd said. \"We all love Mr. Bush. Why doesn't Mr. Bush help us?\" **********At a vast refugee encampment at Do Ab, eight miles from Iraq, sanitation and health conditions were deteriorating, refugees and doctors said. **********A doctor at one of the encampment's four medical stations said pneumonia, dysentery and infant diarrhea had become serious problems, as had kidney ailments.

Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, operator of the New York Health Careers Center, which provides information about wages, job opportunities, educational requirements and scholarships in imaging, as well as other hospital job openings. **********Mr. Raske said that in New York City radiologic technologists earn $26,000 to $28,000 a year. Diagnostic medical sonographers, who work with ultrasound, make $31,500, and radiation-therapy technologists, who work mainly with cancer patients, $36,000. **********He said most hospitals were raising wages in these specialties by 10 percent annually to compete with higher offers from a rapidly growing number of independent imaging centers. James N. Heuerman, a partner at Korn/Ferry International, a health- care management recruiter, said technologists at some imaging centers earned $50,000 to $60,000 a year. **********Nationally, the average pay scales are several thousand dollars lower than in New York, where living costs are high. Mr. Schwartz said that a Minneapolis ultrasound technician, for example, might earn $24,000 to $25,000, plus benefits. The American Medical Association publishes wage and school information in an annual Allied Health Education Directory. **********Applicants for imaging jobs must have certificates or associate degrees from a one- or two-year training program. Some earn four-year college degrees. To be admitted to the training, students must have a high school diploma, or its equivalent, with classes in mathematics and science. **********\"It is a tremendous opportunity,\" said Barbara Bloom Kreml, director of the human resources department at the American Hospital Association. \"They have the potential of studying for two years and coming out and making a good salary.\" **********There were 672 radiography training programs in community colleges and hospitals last year, and most could have admitted more students. \"Student spaces are going begging,\" Ms. Kreml said. **********Mr. Schwartz said hospitals and radiologists became alarmed when the Labor Department predicted that the number of imaging jobs would increase by 66 percent between 1988 and 2000. \"We had to do something,\" he added, because the supply of candidates was growing much more slowly. Indeed, the number of high school graduates was shrinking, and under budget constraints many schools curtailed career-counseling programs. **********Physicians' professional groups, administrators and licensing boards in radiology, nuclear medicine, ultrasound and radiation therapy organized a consortium, the Summit on Manpower, to drum up interest in the school programs and job opportunities. The group sponsored public service radio and television announcements and is working on videotapes and high school science workbooks to describe the field. **********The consortium also hopes to improve the status of imaging technicians in hospitals, which provide 90 percent of the jobs. \"We used to call these jobs X-ray technicians,\" Ms. Kreml said. \"Now they want to call them radiologic scientists.\" Mr. Schwartz said that another problem was to answer concerns about exposure to AIDS and other diseases in hospital work. **********Some hospitals are broadening the possibilities for advancement, for example, by raising the pay of employees who learn to operate both X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging scanners.

But a Kalashnikov rifle now goes for 11,000 Saudi riyals, or about $2,900, and one Saudi recently paid $1,200 for a tiny revolver, which he called a \"precaution\" against possible panic and rioting by foreigners from poor countries working here. **********While most people are reaching for gas masks rather than guns, the boom in small arms reflects the anxiety so many people feel about the pyrotechnical display of exploding Scud and Patriot missiles that kept residents of the capital awake throughout the night. **********Most Saudis, however, are handling the crisis with aplomb. Unlike many foreigners, who huddled in shelters in the luxury hotels, hundreds of Saudis could not resist watching the action from their balconies and gardens. **********\"It was sensational,\" said Abdullah Dabbagh, Secretary General of the Saudi Chamber of Commerce. \"I saw one missile after another whooshing over my head. You don't see that everyday.\" 'Our First Major Crisis' **********The relative Saudi sang-froid is even more remarkable considering that the kingdom has not known strife of this magnitude since its unification in 1932. **********\"This is really our first major crisis,\" Mr. Dabbagh said. \"We're learning how to manage it. And we're not doing a bad job.\" **********But diplomats and even Saudis cite two distinct failures in crisis management -- the Government's approach to news, particularly bad news, and a lack of gas masks. **********There is in the kingdom, as the warden in the film \"Cool Hand Luke\" put it, a certain \"failure to communicate\" -- both before and after air raids. On Sunday night, for example, Saudi television did not interrupt its programming to announce the first air raid until after the all-clear siren had sounded. And there was no prompt Saudi announcement on television of what had hit the city or of casualties and damage after the Scud attack. A City of Rumors **********As a result, Riyadh was a city of rumors today, with diplomats and Saudis exchanging anecdotes about what they saw and what politically connected friends told them. **********By the day's end, a consensus on this informal grapevine had developed: despite official pronouncements, prominent people in this city were saying that one of the four incoming Scuds had been damaged, but had struck the ground and exploded, along with pieces of a Patriot that had failed to self-destruct. Some 17 people were said to have been wounded. Twenty-four hours after the attack, the Ministry of Interior finally announced that 12 people had been wounded by unspecified \"debris\" that left a crater 15 to 20 feet wide in the ground and shattered windows in a nearby building. **********The lack of reliable information has troubled Saudis and foreigners alike. \"This is the major cause of panic,\" Rajib Nair, an Indian store manager in downtown Riaydh said. Gas Masks Not Delivered **********As for the gas masks, the Saudi Defense Ministry recently ordered 700,000 of them, but because Saudi airspace has been under military restrictions, many have not arrived. The Government did not start issuing masks to residents of Riyadh until last Wednesday. Saudis and foreigners had to get in long lines at banks to pay $37.50 for a receipt entitling them to a mask. But distribution centers quickly ran out, leaving hundreds of angry customers. **********Word spread quickly on Sunday night that one center had gotten a new shipment. \"It was worse than Bloomingdale's on a sale day,\" a Westernized Saudi said. **********Officials at the Defense Ministry have masks, but several complained that their families do not. Others in need include nurses and health workers at Riyadh Central Hospital's Maternity and Children's Hospital. Most are Indian or Philippine. **********Mr. Nair, whose wife works at the hospital, said that during the air raid, doctors ordered nurses into a safe room and told them they would look after the wards. The doctors, at least, had masks. Fatigue and Skepticism **********Fatigue is perhaps the most difficult effect of the missile war, far more debilitating than excitement or fear. Hardly anyone has gotten much sleep. As a result, the normally chaotic driving patterns here are even more so. And the Saudi post-lunch siesta has been extended. **********Many Saudis have sent their families north and west to family villages for safety, but until recently few had thought they would have to leave. The United States had assured the Saudis that Scud missiles could not reach Riyadh. Saudis are now more skeptical of American assurances. **********And they take issue with the way the Western press often portrays them. \"Sometimes we really can't win,\" Abdulaziz Fahad, a lawyer, said. \"If we act calmly, we're fatalistic. If we panic, we're excitable Arabs.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/28/world/war-gulf-torture-freed-kuwaitis-tell-iraqi-abuse-including-some-cases-torture.html": {"writer_name": "Chris Hedges", "pub_date": "1991-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1054, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: Torture; Freed Kuwaitis Tell of Iraqi Abuse Including Some Cases of Torture", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: Torture; Freed Kuwaitis Tell of Iraqi Abuse Including Some Cases of Torture", "body_text": " **********On the third floor of a gutted mansion, a Kuwaiti Army major slowly pushed open a door with his foot to what was once a laundry room.

Next to the springs was a crude brown box with bare electrical wires protruding from black cords. **********\"They put the prisoners on the springs, poured water over them and then applied the current,\" said the Kuwaiti Army officer, Maj.

Destroying the Evidence **********\"This was one of the central rooms,\" said Ahmed Othman, a Kuwaiti underground fighter, who appeared after the Iraqis left. Standing in front of the blackened walls with a .38-caliber pistol tucked into the waist of his gray sweatsuit, he said: \"They tried to destroy as much evidence as possible before they left.\" **********The Kuwaitis said they also believe that women were held prisoner and tortured in the Meridien Hotel, which was shelled by a tank and burned before Iraqi troops made a hasty retreat from the city. **********Kuwaitis who fought against the Iraqis, wearing red armbands as they patrol roadblocks and ferret out Iraqi soldiers who remain hidden in the city, are also going through houses confiscated by Iraqi troops. **********\"They used these private homes to carry out their worst interrogations and torture,\" Mr. Othman said. Disappearance of Young Men **********One of the subjects frequently raised with the American correspondent, was the disappearances of Kuwaitis, mostly young men, after being picked up by the Iraqi police. **********In a few cases, families with money were told that their loved ones would be returned for ransoms. **********\"The Iraqis came and told me they had my brother,\" said Abdul Hamid, a retired civil aviation official. **********\"They said we could have him back for 5,000 Iraqi dinar and a car. We paid them and he came back.\" **********But others said they had spent fruitless hours going to and from police stations to seek information. Finally, the Grim News **********A few said the Iraqis finally, after much pleading, informed them that their relatives were dead. **********\"After three months of going nearly every week to the Iraqi police, they told us that my cousin had died in Iraq,\" a woman said. She asked that her name not be used since family members abroad did not know of her cousin's death. **********\"We do not know how he died and we never received his body,\" she said. **********Some Kuwaitis said that Palestinians, foreign workers in Kuwait, had aided the Iraqi police after the invasion in August. **********\"The Iraqis gave arms to some Palestinians,\" Major Hassan said. \"These Palestinians, many of whom had lived here for a long time, were very useful to the Iraqis. They knew where people lived and who was influential. We have not found any of these Palestinians. They may have left with the soldiers.\" Hospital Atrocity Stories Wrong **********Some of the atrocities that had been reported, such as the killing of infants in the main hospitals shortly after the invasion, are untrue or have been exaggerated, Kuwaitis said. **********Hospital officials, for instance, said that stories circulated about the killing of 300 children were incorrect. **********Rumors circulated around Kuwait City in the immediate hours after the Iraqi withdrawal about young girls being hung with wire until they were dead and children being shot, but none of these stories could be substantiated today. **********There is increasing evidence, however, that those Kuwaitis considered opponents of the Iraqi occupation were selected for very rough treatment. Late-Night Visits **********Families suspected of aiding the opposition movement or having members in the underground say they were frequently visited during the night by Iraqi policemen. **********\"The Iraqis burst into my house late at night,\" said Taiba al-Ayar. \"They flipped over our beds and dragged my son-in-law away in his pajamas.

Gamsakhurdia says he wants nothing to do with the Soviet Union any more, whether it is a democracy or a dictatorship. All he wants is real autonomy for Georgia, which he rules like a freely elected despot, preoccupied with plots, real and imagined, to do him in and keep his land under Moscow's domination. **********Since Georgia declared independence on April 9, only Romania has recognized it, and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has ignored it. **********Mr. Gamsakhurdia, as if paralyzed, has let the Georgian economy go to ruin until the republic is free, and last week his government forbade the export of meat, milk, vegetables, building material and most other goods, all in acute shortage. **********His government's price controls and tax laws discourage private enterprise, seemingly a natural tendency for a land known over the centuries for its traders. Mr. Gamsakhurdia blames a Soviet \"embargo\" for the shortages, and said on Saturday that Georgia could not even begin to make economic progress until Moscow let it go its own way. **********The difficulties of this republic of five and a half million people seem to show that autonomy is hardly the end of trouble for the long-unwilling partners of the Soviet Union; independence for the Soviet republics also raises new problems. **********Mr. Gamsakhurdia's behavior has puzzled many former friends, even those who know that Georgia is the land of Medea and the birthplace of Stalin -- an old, querulous mountain country where intrigues are as gnarled and thick on the ground as the grapevines in people's backyards. **********On Saturday, speaking of plots against his leadership by Georgia's enemies in Moscow, Tbilisi and even in the United States, he said that his recently dismissed Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, the head of the national guard, and the leader of the opposition in the republic's Parliament had all betrayed him. **********He recently suspended publication of the most critical Georgian-language opposition newspapers, setting off nightly demonstrations in the streets of the capital calling for his resignation. And a small-scale civil war continues in the South Ossetian Autonomous Region north of Tbilisi, where separatists want to secede from Georgia and join a similar region just north of the Caucasus, in Russia.  All a Plot **********To Mr. Gamsakhurdia, all this is part of a conspiracy to thwart Georgian independence. **********\"Moscow wants to create civil war here,\" he said Saturday, and he held little hope that things would change. \"I believe Gorbachev continues this usual line against Georgia,\" he added. He said that Boris N. Yeltsin, President of the Russian federated republic, had promised to consider recognition, but so far had done nothing. **********Anti-Georgian provocateurs in the United States are keeping Washington from extending diplomatic recognition, he said, and Moscow and its agents are waging a whispering campaign in the West: \"Here is a fascist dictator, and the people are against him. You must not recognize Georgia.\" **********These hardly sound like the words of a man who was elected with 87 percent of the popular vote in May. Now, in early September, his power seems to be waning prematurely. **********Last Monday, a violent clash between demonstrators and special police units in Rustaveli Square, near the center of Tbilisi, raised fears that there might be a macabre replay of the events of April 9, 1989, when Soviet troops used entrenching tools, and allegedly poison gas, against demonstrators, killing 20 of them. **********This time it was Georgian versus Georgian as gunshots were fired, by policemen and perhaps also by demonstrators. Twenty people were wounded, four seriously. **********Protesters have been out in the streets every night since. But the police, instead of charging them with shields and nightsticks, have sealed off part of the area with buses drawn up in front of the pink stone neo-Classical government headquarters. Down a winding boulevard, demonstrators and onlookers ambled under trees, listening to recorded speeches demanding Mr. Gamsakhurdia's resignation and new elections. The Coup  Treading Carefully, And Getting Burned **********The 52-year-old President, dignified in a dark suit and a thin mustache, sounded irritated, chopping the air with impatient gestures. **********Surrounded by bodyguards and journeying back and forth from his home in the hills above Tbilisi in a cavalcade of armored black Mercedes limousines, Mr. Gamsakhurdia seems increasingly distant from his dissident past. **********The son of the pre-eminent writer of modern Georgia, Konstantin Gamsakhurdia, he was first jailed for nationalist activities in 1956, at the age of 17. He finished his last prison term in 1980, after three years behind bars for \"anti-Soviet activity.\" **********His latest troubles have intensified since the failure of the coup in Moscow. **********By his own account and those of others, President Gamsakhurdia trod a tightrope during the revolt, agreeing to cause no trouble in Georgia and appealing to his people to remain calm, while calling on the world to show its support for the forces of democracy -- in Georgia and elsewhere. **********Defying an order by the coup leaders, he said, he also refused to dissolve his 15,000-member national guard, a group created in November from the ranks of Georgians who objected to service in the Soviet Army. **********Gen. Valery A. Patrikeyev, the Soviet troop commander of the Caucasus Military District, appeared on Georgian television during the coup and said his relationship with Mr. Gamsakhurdia was \"excellent.\" Mr. Gamsakhurdia later carefully distanced himself from the putsch attempt, saying it had not been clear to him that it might not have been a charade. **********But his opponents seized upon the events and charged that he had been ambivalent. Last Monday's rally was called by Georgi Chanturia, the head of the National Democratic Party, one of a coalition of groups that boycotted Parliament elections last year and the presidential voting in May. **********\"We wanted to expose his links with the coup leaders,\" Mr. Chanturia said in an interview, saying he had proof of the President's complicity. The proof turned out to be an assertion, made by the dismissed Prime Minister, Tengiz Sigua, that a Deputy Prime Minister \"must have\" discussed plans with the coup makers during a one-day trip to Moscow on Aug. 18, the Sunday the coup began. **********Before last Monday's rally began, Mr. Chanturia said, the President's commandos charged the crowd with batons, firing pistols into the air. A videotape of the incident was broadcast on Soviet television the next evening. Mr. Gamsakhurdia's officials say the police were attacked first, but the President said they should not have used their weapons in any case. **********On Wednesday, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister and a Georgian, commented on the violence. He said on television that it was a direct result of Mr. Gamsakhurdia's refusal to talk with the opposition. **********People here remember Mr. Shevardnadze as their Interior Minister and Communist Party leader, the job he held in Tbilisi when Mr. Gamsakhurdia was being prosecuted for nationalist activities. Now, in the President's eyes, Mr. Shevardnadze is in league with those who want to bring him down. **********The violence also split the Georgian national guard, whose commanding officer, Tengiz Kitovani, broke with Mr. Gamsakhurdia and said the force would \"resist any activity directed against the people.\" **********Mr. Gamsakhurdia said Saturday that he no longer recognized Mr. Kitovani as being in charge. Now he groups him among his enemies -- along with Mr. Sigua; his former Foreign Minister, Georgi Khoshtaria, dismissed in August for \"wanting to make his own foreign policy,\" and Nodar Notadze, another longtime former comrade of the President's, who is now the leader of the opposition in Parliament. **********\"He is very close with the armed opposition now,\" Mr. Gamsakhurdia said of his onetime colleague in the dissident movenment, \"and he protects them in Parliament -- also now these criminals.\"  Home and Abroad  Little Recognition; Rebellion Aplenty **********At the empty and echoing Foreign Ministry, a former Communist Party school and agricultural institute up one of Tbilisi's steep hills, Deputy Foreign Minister Nodar Gabashvili complained about how difficult it was to get foreign nations to recognize Georgian independence. **********\"The extra-parliamentary opposition wants the world to see Georgia as a Soviet colony, and not to recognize us until the Soviet Army is forced out and new general elections are called,\" he said. \"Under our former Foreign Minister, our ministry didn't make much effort at counter-propaganda.\" **********Mr. Gabashvili said he hoped that the new minister, Murman Omanidze, would have better luck. Mr. Gamsakhurdia said the new Prime Minister, Vissarion Gugushvili, would meet with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in Moscow on Monday to plead Georgia's case for recognition by the United States. **********\"We have more democracy than in your countries,\" Mr. Gamsakhurdia told a group of Western correspondents. \"Nobody can stop traffic in the streets in your country and make rallies, can they?\" But, he added, \"When you are in war, you cannot think of democracy. Now we are in war.\" **********The struggle in the South Ossetian Autonomous Region, which has been formally abolished by Mr. Gamsakhurdia, has taken perhaps a hundred lives so far this year, and sent 50,000 Ossetians fleeing north across the mountains. **********On Thursday, the government says, four Georgian partisans there were killed and a herd of sheep was stolen by the Ossetian rebels, who have vowed to continue the struggle for their own independence. The Soviet press agency Tass reported that more Ossetians and Georgians were killed in shootings on Saturday. **********Mr. Gamsakhurdia refuses to give independence to the Ossetians because, he said, the separatist leaders are agents of Moscow, which hopes to divide and continue to rule Georgia. He has declared a state of emergency in what he calls \"the former southern Ossetia\" and issued orders to arrest its leaders. They have gone underground. **********\"The leaders of South Ossetia officially supported the coup in Moscow,\" he said, reading from statements published in their Russian-language newspaper, Sovetskaya Ossetiya, on Aug. 20. \"This territory belongs to Georgia. National minorities have only cultural rights in every country, not political autonomy.\" **********Mr. Chanturia, once Mr. Gamsakhurdia's friend, said of him, \"He is a pathological coward, and a coward who holds power is very dangerous.\" **********The Georgian leader is a complex character, a man who told the court at his sentencing in 1978, \"I sincerely regret what I have done and condemn the crime I have committed.\" The statement, taped and edited, was broadcast over Soviet television at the time, and made many people wonder what had come over Mr. Gamsakhurdia. **********In an interview with this correspondent in January, he explained that he had bargained with the K.G.B. and expressed regret for distributing \"anti-Soviet propaganda,\" books and materials on the United States that had been provided by an American diplomat and several journalists. \"I never renounced my Georgian nationalistic activities,\" he said, but added he feared that if he did not compromise, he would lose his citizenship and be expelled. **********He said he had also agreed to testify as a prosecution witness against this reporter and Harold Piper, then a correspondent for the Baltimore Sun, in a July 1978 case charging the American reporters with slander. The Soviet State Committee for Television and Radio brought charges against the reporters for writing articles reporting friends' and relatives' doubts about the genuineness of his televised confession and apology. The correspondents did not take part in the trial in Moscow, where Mr. Gamsakhurdia testified that the broadcast confession had been accurate. **********His three-year sentence was later reduced to two years, since he had been held in solitary confinement for a year before his arrest. And instead of being exiled to Siberia, he was released after serving the two years in jail and allowed to work in Georgia. **********Despite all his troubles, Mr. Gamsakhurdia remains popular among many Georgians. Crowds of supporters who gather in front of his headquarters every day do not want him to go. **********\"Those people just want disorder so the West won't recognize us,\" said Gabunia Daredzhali, 40 years old, a Tbilisi office worker. \"They want the world to think we're killing each other. Our President is not a dictator; he's a good Christian believer.\" **********Mr. Gamsakhurdia addressed a rally of several thousand in front of the government buildings on Saturday afternoon, to cheers. But the police had barricaded the square with buses yet again, giving the event an almost claustrophobic air."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/18/business/fha-posted-big-loss-in-89.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "F.H.A.

But the struggle that he mentioned might have included the adjustment problems confronting his group of 94 exiles and dependents who arrived here last week. **********As many as 40,000 South Africans who left because of apartheid are thought to be abroad.

It is going to be a difficult time for them.\" Rivalry and Resentment **********Thousands of the exiles have no marketable skills beyond those they learned for guerrilla warfare and personal survival. Children who studied in another language will face difficulty catching up in school. In the competition for meager resources in the black townships, where unemployment sometimes exceeds 50 percent, those returning have already encountered resentment from those who stayed behind and do not want to yield priority for scarce housing and jobs. **********\"It would be a tragedy if we turned on each other now, claiming, perhaps, that we have suffered more than they and regarding the returning exiles as a threat to our own positions,\" said The Sowetan, which urged its readers who help the newcomers. \"We have endured too much for that.\" **********An African National Congress official said returning exiles would each get the equivalent of $120 and fare back to their old hometowns, where they must look for work and housing. **********Other exiles will fare worse, including those who belong to the rival Pan-Africanist Congress or the Azanian People's Organization, which have not joined the repatriation program, or those who are unaffiliated. **********Cecil Hoyi, a former member of the Pan-Africanist Congress who fled abroad a decade ago, quit his organization in 1984 and returned to South Africa last year. He said the South African Council of Churches provided train tickets home to Port Elizabeth.

Mr. Louw said last week that as South African citizens, those returning were entitled to \"normal state assistance\" under existing social welfare programs. **********Overseas aid for South African exiles is limited. Sweden agreed to finance the five flights of congress supporters from Lusaka. And Britain offered $40,000 to renovate and furnish a hostel near Cape Town that will provide some exiles with short-term accommodations and counseling. So far, the United States has not moved to help. **********If the United Nations High Commission for Refugees became involved, this might well encourage more foreign aid. But the Government has balked at letting it operate in South Africa. Mr. Louw said the refusal would be reviewed this month.  Opportunity and Difficulty **********The return home prompted mixed emotions among the exiles who flew in last week. **********\"I am very happy to be back in my country again after so many years,\" said Ben Koppie Baartman, 67, a union organizer who left the Cape Town area 30 years ago. \"But I'm not happy because the system which had made me leave is still there, still exists in this country. There is still a difference between a white man and a black man.\" **********But for all the obstacles ahead, the exiles seemed confident. Thobila Zondani, 30, who fled in 1979, had suffered the loss of his left foot, which was blown off two years ago by a bomb planted at the African National Congress office where he worked in Lusaka. Mr. Zondani said he did not regret having left because he hated apartheid. He remarked that other exiles had suffered worse injuries from bombings by South African agents."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/15/world/after-the-war-pow-s-ex-pow-s-offer-accounts-of-terror-and-torture-in-iraq.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Wines", "pub_date": "1991-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1240, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-P.O.W.'s Offer Accounts Of Terror and Torture in Iraq", "print_headline": "AFTER THE WAR: P.O.W.'S; Ex-P.O.W.'s Offer Accounts Of Terror and Torture in Iraq", "body_text": " **********In their first extensive public comments since being released two weeks ago, Americans taken prisoner in the Persian Gulf war today recounted tales of terror, torture and, occasionally, compassion at the hands of their Iraqi military captors. **********Almost all the former prisoners who spoke today recalled feeling confident that the United States would extract them from prison, either by force or by a quick victory in the war, if they could merely survive their ordeals. And they expressed delight at the patriotic greeting they received on their release. **********Although several said they endured beatings severe enough to dislodge teeth, and one told of being shocked with electric wires wrapped around his face, none of the former prisoners said the mistreatment was life-threatening. But some said the prospect of dying, either by execution or by strikes from allied warplanes, was ever-present. Brief News Conferences **********More than a dozen of the 21 American prisoners freed from Iraq held brief news conferences today to describe their experiences. All those who spoke were men. **********\"About 90 percent of the time you felt you were in danger of losing your life,\" said Lieut. Jeffrey N. Zaun of the Navy, from Cherry Hill, N.J., whose swollen and wounded face, displayed in an antiwar videotape in which he was forced to take part, brought national outrage over Iraqi treatment of American P.O.W.'s. **********Lieutenant Zaun said that 90 percent of his facial injuries occurred when he ejected from his damaged A-6 Intruder attack jet over Iraq 36 hours after the air war began in January, and most of the rest came from \"getting slapped around.\" Seven Cite Reasonable Treatment **********He said he also \"banged my nose\" in a failed effort to appear so badly beaten that his captors would decide not to place him on television. **********Outwardly, the former prisoners looked none the worse for their abuse. Seven Air Force pilots who appeared at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington looked fit in crisp flight suits, bore no marks of beatings, and displayed broad smiles. **********At their news conference, the seven Air Force pilots generally maintained that that they had been reasonably treated by Iraqi officials, with the exception of physical beatings during interrogations. But they refused to recount their lives in captivity in any detail, apparently because some worried that their remarks could affect the fates of Americans still in Iraq. Evaded Capture for 2 Days **********Iraq has insisted that it has freed all allied prisoners of war, and the highest-ranking Air Force P.O.W., Col. David W. Eberly, said that he and his fellow pilots believed \"that everyone is either present or accounted for.\" **********\"Beyond that, we know there are still people missing,\" he said, \"and our prayers still go out to the families of those people to say that we hope there is a chance that maybe others who are still listed as missing may turn up.\" **********Colonel Eberly and a fellow Air Force pilot, Maj. Thomas E. Griffith Jr., evaded capture for two days after a surface-to-air missile downed their jet in western Iraq the night of Jan. 19, Major Griffith said today. They were later moved to a central holding pen in Baghdad for interrogation. **********He gave a typical account of conditions endured by the seven Air Force pilots, who stayed for all but a few hours in individual solitary-confinement cells near other prisoners from Kuwait and Britain. Pilot Tells of Hospital Care **********\"We were captured near the Iraq-Syrian border by an army border patrol, basically,\" he said. \"The initial treatment under the hands of the army was pretty fair. They treated us basically as soldiers doing our duty and in accordance with the Geneva Convention. **********\"Later on, during the longest stay we had in one particular prison, the conditions were pretty harsh. We had, obviously -- I guess this is standard in their prisons -- we had no beds. They gave us a couple of blankets so we had to sleep on the floor. And we got very little food, which is the reason most of us were able to lose a little bit of weight. But again, nothing as severe or harsh as what you read about during the Vietnam War.\" **********A third Air Force pilot, Capt. William F. Andrews of Mechanicsburg, Pa., said he broke his leg in two places while parachuting from his damaged plane Feb. 27. He described his treatment on the ground and in a military hospital in Basra as \"pretty good.\" **********\"The soldiers that captured me did a pretty good job, showed a lot of -- it seemed like compassion,\" he said. \"They gave me their food and helped take care of my leg. **********\"In Basra, a military doctor took an X-ray, saw it had some broken bones, and put half a cast on it and wrapped it up. And that pretty much held my leg in place until I was able to come back to freedom.\" **********Others said they were treated far less charitably. The most terrifying account came from Maj. Jeffrey S. Tice of the Air Force, from Sellersburg, Pa., who was hit near Baghdad and glided his jet south for 150 miles before bailing out. He said he was captured by Bedouins who turned him over to Iraqi soldiers for the trip to Baghdad. Thought to Be an Arab **********Major Tice, who has dark hair and a mustache, said his captors might have punished him more severely because they suspected him of being an Arab and a traitor, not an American. **********\"I was subjected to a form of electrical shock therapy that I called the 'talk man,' \" he said, \"and basically had some wires wrapped around my ears and under my chin and was shocked periodically during early captivity, when they were trying to coerce me into making a videotape. **********Major Tice said he \"lost a few pieces of teeth and other things like that\" during this interrogation, but never feared for his life. 'Numb After the First Shocks' **********\"You got kind of numb after the first few shocks. You know, it wasn't that terrible,\" he said. \"It sounds bad but, it wasn't that terrible. It was more physically tiring than it was physically damaging.\" **********Some servicemen who appeared in Iraqi propaganda broadcasts said they had been coerced into making the videotapes. Lieutenant Zaun, whose appearance included a monotone statement that the allied coalition had \"wrongly attacked the peaceful people of Iraq,\" said he had deliberately tried to \"screw up\" the tape to indicate that he had spoken under duress. **********\"They took me to a TV studio and sat me next to the big guy and then told me what questions they were going to ask and they told me what my answers were going to be,\" he said. \"I had enough faith in Americans to know that anybody who saw this was going to say, 'This is ridiculous.' \" **********For Colonel Eberly of the Air Force, the low point came days after his capture when he realized that his family did not know he was alive. **********\"I suddenly realized that somebody had to notify my family,\" he said. \"And that realization, that for a period of time my family had to go through somebody telling them that I might be dead, that was the toughest night of all of it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/26/business/business-people-president-of-primerica-surprised-by-promotion.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1991-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 434, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "President of Primerica Surprised by Promotion", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; President of Primerica Surprised by Promotion", "body_text": " **********When he graduated from Harvard Business School in 1982, James Dimon faced the same question as many of his classmates: Where should he work as an investment banker? **********Mr. Dimon asked the question of an old family friend, Sanford I.

American pilots began firing a large number of Maverick antitank missiles over the potential battlefield in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. **********American pilots reported that the Iraqis, who are said to have shifted some of their command and communications installations into schools to protect them from attack, were moving antiaircraft artillery onto rooftops in residential areas, probably to give them similar protection. **********Early this morning, Iraq fired a long-range Scud missile at Riyadh, the Saudi capital, but it was destroyed by Patriot defense missiles. No casualties were reported. , **********Air activity was intense on Thursday. The American command announced that a Navy F/A-18 fighter bomber was lost as it returned to its carrier base, disappearing suddenly over the gulf, apparently without having been hit by hostile fire. A Huey medical evacuation helicopter went down over Saudi Arabia, also for unknown reasons, killing one person and injuring four. **********Brig. Gen. Richard I. Neal, an American military spokesman, said at the central command briefing on Thursday in Riyadh that American fliers had shot down three enemy helicopters in two days. He also disclosed that Air Force F-15C Eagle interceptors had bagged two Soviet-built Iraqi SU-22 fighters that were trying to reach haven in Iran and probably also downed a third that was with them. Type Used by Senior Officers **********One of the helicopters was an Alouette, manufactured in France, of a type usually used for transporting senior officers in the Iraqi Army. **********Revising figures he had issued a day earlier, General Neal said American pilots shot down four planes headed for Iran on Wednesday, not two. The pilots had reported the kills but official confirmation was withheld overnight. And he increased the United States estimate of Iraqi planes in Iran to 134 -- 109 warplanes and 25 transports -- including 11 that arrived there on Wednesday. **********An Iranian television broadcast reported that five Iraqi aircraft headed for Iran crashed and one landed safely during the previous 24 hours.

Baker 3d proposed the creation of a Middle East Bank for Reconstruction and Development as part of the plans for a postwar Middle East that the Administration started to make public this week. Mr. Baker said Iraq itself could benefit from such an institution, but that aid would be more forthcoming if Mr. Hussein were no longer in power. **********\"There is no suggestion on our part that the rebuilding of Iraq could proceed, if the current leadership of Iraq remained in power, to the same extent and degree that it could otherwise,\" Mr. Baker said. **********On the ground in the Middle East, action was again desultory, with only three brief, inconclusive border skirmishes between American forces and Iraqi units. The Wisconsin on Duty **********At sea, the Wisconsin replaced her sister ship, the Missouri, on duty off the Kuwaiti coast and fired 11 rounds from her 16-inch guns at an artillery emplacement. Commissioned in April 1944, the Wisconsin, which carries a crew of 1,500, last saw combat off Korea, as did the Missouri. **********Marines on board the amphibious helicopter vessel Okinawa, part of a big task force steaming north in the gulf, interpreted the use of the heavy guns on the two battleships as part of the preparation for a landing.

The allies also struck near Iraq's border with Iran, where the official Iranian press agency, monitored in Cyprus, reported \"massive explosions.\" **********Ramsey Clark, a former United States Attorney General and an opponent of the gulf war who visited the southern city of Basra on Tuesday and Wednesday, told reporters in Baghdad that what he saw was \"a human and civilian tragedy\" exceeding the mandate given by the United Nations. **********Mr. Clark said the relentless allied bombardment of Basra had destroyed residential areas, hospitals, nightclubs, coffee shops, clinics and law offices. He told reporters that a doctor in Baghdad told him several thousand people were killed or wounded by the bombing. **********Officials at a hospital in Baghdad's Al-Adhamiya district said six people died shortly after they were brought there after a midnight raid.

They declined to discuss the timing of such an offensive, but Mr. Cheney challenged arguments by some lawmakers that a ground assault should be delayed for months while air bombardments of Iraqi targets continue. **********Mr. Cheney is to brief the President on Monday on the recommendations he receives from military leaders during his three-day trip. **********The Defense Secretary said that air power would be more effective if used in tandem with ground power, allowing the allied coalition to win the war more quickly. \"We're thinking in terms of the situation, which clearly would continue the air campaign, and add to that other capabilities: the amphibious capability, your ground forces as well. **********\"And it's the use of all these assets, all those capabilities, that's likely ultimately to produce the result, our objective, and that is to expel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/28/business/ncnb-plan-for-merger-advances.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1991-06-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NCNB Plan For Merger Advances", "print_headline": "NCNB Plan For Merger Advances", "body_text": " **********The directors of the C&S/Sovran Financial Corporation are discovering that two years and one false step make all the difference in the turbulent banking industry. **********In 1989, Bennett A. Brown, then the chairman of the Citizens and Southern Corporation, would not even meet with Hugh L. McColl Jr., the aggressive chairman of the NCNB Corporation, who had started a hostile takeover bid for Citizens and Southern. Instead, Mr. Brown, a courtly Georgia banker, not too politely told Mr. McColl to mind his own bank. **********Months later, Mr. Brown agreed to merge Citizens and Southern with the Sovran Financial Corporation. A New Merger Proposal **********Now, the C&S/Sovran board is \"looking seriously\" at an informal proposal to merge with NCNB, said Mr. Brown, now the chairman of C&S/Sovran, following a special meeting in Atlanta yesterday where the regional banking company has one of its headquarters. **********The NCNB bid, if successful, would amount to a nearly $4 billion exchange of stock, making it the costliest merger in American banking history and making NCNB the nation's second-largest bank, after Citicorp. **********Although Mr. Brown's statement today plainly raised the prospect that C&S/Sovran might accept a merger, Mr. Brown also expressed caution. He said the board had not decided \"to depart from its strategy of proceeding as an independent institution.\" **********Mr. Brown added: \"We are trying to determine from information obtained from NCNB and further discussions whether a combinaton of the two companies is in the best interests of the C&S/Sovran stockholders. The due-diligence issues are important, and we will consider them very carefully.\"  NCNB's Statement **********Yesterday, Ginny Mackin, a spokeswoman for NCNB, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., said, \"We are looking forward to continuing the discussions\" with C&S/Sovran. The talks between the two began last week when Mr. McColl met with Mr. Brown at his Atlanta condominium. **********Since the C&S/Sovran merger, the company's once-optimistic prospects of rising income have been derailed by a surge of troubled real estate loans on Sovran's books that had gone unnoticed, or were underestimated, by Mr. Brown. Nonperforming assets at the company soared to $1.1 billion at the end of March, from $703.2 million at the end of December, and company executives have not promised that the loan troubles will end soon. **********Sandra J. Flannigan, a banking analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., a brokerage in Baltimore, estimated that as much as $300 million in additional bad loans would be reported this quarter. And the company's yearly dividend of $1.56 a share may soon be cut, said Richard Stillinger, who follows Southern banks for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., a bank research firm in New York. **********The setbacks for C&S/Sovran have forced Mr. Brown, who is 62 years old, to postpone his planned retirement, which was scheduled for the end of the year when the merger with Sovran was announced. They have also contributed to his change of heart toward Mr. McColl, his longtime competitor. Though NCNB has only modest operations in Georgia and Virginia, where C&S/Sovran has large operations, the two banking companies compete in several surrounding states. **********According to a person close to Mr. McColl, the NCNB chairman would not have agreed to the meeting in Mr. Brown's Atlanta condominium without strong indications that C&S/Sovran would actively consider a merger bid from NCNB.  Terms of the Informal Offer **********Mr. Brown outlined to C&S/Sovran's directors yesterday the informal offer that Mr. McColl presented to acquire C&S/Sovran. It would involve an exchange of one share of C&S/Sovran for three-fourths of a share of NCNB stock. **********NCNB's stock closed yesterday at $37, down $1.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. At that price, the proposed deal would be worth $27.75 a share to C&S/Sovran stockholders, or $3.7 billion. Such a price would represent a 17.5 percent premium over C&S/Sovran's stock price yesterday. C&S/Sovran's stock closed at $23.625, up 87.5 cents, after trading around $24, after the company announced the board's position yesterday afternoon. **********Mrs. Flannigan, of Alex. Brown & Sons, said directors of C&S/Sovran would probably reject Mr. McColl's initial offer as inadequate. But, she added, \"When you start getting into an offer of $30 to $35 a share, then there has to be greater pressure on the board\" to approve a merger. **********Indeed, Bloomberg Business News reported that two shareholders of C&S/Sovran had filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against Mr. Brown and 28 other officers and directors of the company yesterday to pressure them into broadening the talks with NCNB into a full-scale auction of C&S/Sovran to a high bidder. **********The lawsuit said NCNB was maneuvering to exploit the downturn in C&S/Sovran's stock value and real estate loans to acquire C&S/Sovran for a bargain-basement price, Bloomberg reported. **********C&S/Sovran said it did not know the details of the lawsuit and could not comment. **********The 1989 offer that Mr. Brown had emphatically rejected from NCNB would have been worth $39 a share then to Citizens and Southern's stockholders, and about $40 a share today. Instead, the shares of Citizens and Southern and, subsequently, C&S/ Sovran made a steady decline, falling below $15 late last year, before rising moderatly to $19 before reports of NCNB's overture emerged early this week.  New Signs of Trouble **********The final straw for C&S/Sovran directors could be new signs that real estate problems will worsen in the District of Columbia suburbs, and elsewhere in C&S/Sovran's seven-state territory in the South. **********Dennis C. Bottorff, the 46-year-old president and chief operating officer at C&S/Sovran, told stockholders in Atlanta at the annual meeting in April that he could not say when the mounting real estate problems near Washington would peak. **********\"The market continues to deteriorate, and we expect further increases in nonperforming assets,\" he said. Bad real estate loans in the Washington area contributed $342 million of the $403 million rise in C&S/Sovran's problem loans in the first quarter.  Unhealthy Level of Bad Assets **********The percentage of total nonperforming assets rose to an unhealthy level of 3.25 percent of total assets in the quarter, a figure that analysts said was certain to rise this quarter. **********Thus far, Mr. Brown has kept C&S/ Sovran's loss reserve at a conservative ratio of 91 percent of the nonperforming total. The loss reserves of many Southern banks amount to less than 70 percent of their nonperforming loans. **********Mr. Stillinger of Keefe, Bruyette said this meant that Mr. Brown was not so desperate that he would be forced to seek a merger partner, even if the NCNB bid was rejected. **********At March 31, the company's common equity capital, the clearest measure of the bank's capital cushion, totaled $2.94 billion, or a healthy 5.9 percent of $50 billion in total assets. **********Mr. Stillinger added that bank regulators probably would not protest if Mr. Brown let his loss-reserve ratio drift down a bit this quarter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/01/world/judge-backs-gulf-use-of-unapproved-drugs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 161, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Judge Backs Gulf Use Of Unapproved Drugs", "print_headline": "Judge Backs Gulf Use Of Unapproved Drugs", "body_text": " **********The military may require troops serving in the Persian Gulf to take unapproved drugs to protect against biological and germ warfare, a Federal judge ruled today. **********Judge Stanley S.

The most lavish is a six-lane highway that begins in a tobacco-growing province, Pinar del Rio, runs east through Havana and ends 435 miles later in Cabaiguan. **********But even on the main highway, a drive down the spine of Cuba is like taking a journey back in time. **********The roads are dotted with rolling ghosts made by General Motors, Chrysler and Ford, cars that haven't been sold here new since the revolution. **********There are 1958 Chrysler New Yorkers, '55 Buicks, '55 Chevrolets cruising among the small East European and Soviet makes, seeming like whales among sardines. Most are painted over three times, riding on mismatched tires and held together mostly by ingenuity. **********Maurino Camilo is the manager of a filling station in Aguandad de Pasajeros, 120 miles east of Havana on the main road. It is the equivalent of the American or European oasis where motorists refresh in one section and refuel in another. **********Before becoming the manager, Mr. Camilo, who operates the station with his wife, spent four years in Halle, East Germany, at a mechanics' training school. The training has not been in vain. After filling the tank, Mr. Camilo motions to follow him into the station and back into his work area. There sits his masterpiece: a fully restored 1957 Chevy Belair, which he bought in 1990. **********Everyone who drives must have a touch of Camilo. All along the road, hoods are raised as self-taught mechanics coax and kick their old Chevrolets, De Sotos and Fords into running order. A Thoroughfare For Cars and Cows **********Just outside Santa Clara, three goats prance across the highway. A few miles later, a cow ambles across. They do not seem frightened and walk as though the road is theirs as much as the machines'. **********In Cuba, the road is a river, carrying most of the country's traffic. The shoulder of the road is not for emergency stopping; it is the lane for bicycles, horses and ox-drawn wagons. **********Even for the minority of families who own cars, few can drive the 841 miles from Havana to Santiago. **********The trip requires two months' ration under a system in which car owners are allotted 13 to 16 gallons of fuel a month -- a rationing system imposed after the Soviet Union sharply reduced oil allocations as part of an overall aid reduction. Cuts in Soviet aid have produced Cuba's \"special time in a time of peace,\" a slogan announced by Mr. Castro last year and repeated every time some new restriction is announced. **********For the traveler, there are mass-transit options, but the rail system cannot serve every village. Now, even the bus system, which most Cubans rely on for long-distance travel, is erratic. **********The standard scene along the highway is of people standing on the soft shoulders of roads, waiting. The reduction of fuel deliveries by the Soviet Union is the overriding cause; the other is the Pan American Games, which have been taking place since Aug. 2 in Havana and Santiago de Cuba. To accommodate the thousands of visitors, buses that normally serve the provinces have been diverted, along with fuel, to the major cities. **********The consequence of this diversion is sitting, often in 100-degree heat and blinding sun. People thumb rides and climb into flatbed trucks or any other form of mass transportation. Each car is \"the bus,\" trucks are the bus, anything that stops can be the bus. Capitalism Rears Its Athletic Head **********Havana and Santiago are engaged in a dollar-driven competition wrought by the Pan American Games. **********Although this country's Communist leaders denounce capitalism, they are allowing large-scale commercial advertising for the first time. Big signs advertising everything from McDonald's to Puma line sports stadiums. **********These advertisements are intended for the overseas fans watching the games on television, not for the domestic market. There are no McDonald's in this country. **********Away from the camera's eye, it becomes quickly apparent that the sights ahead will include no commercial billboards selling french fries or motels. Communism, however, is energetically marketed. **********The first cluster of billboards is on the main highway. It is a painted poster of Fidel and Ernesto (Che) Guevara, Cuban Communism's No. 1 martyr. **********Every village and hamlet has a billboard welcoming travelers and offering a slogan with the picture of a hero of the revolution. **********\"For peace, life and against imperialist aggression,\" one says. Invariably there is the bust of Jose Marti, the 19th-century writer and nationalist leader. **********For variety, there are public service messages, announcing that \"alcohol is an ally of death\" and that \"speed is the ally of death.\"  Cratered Road Leads To City With Charm **********As the two-lane road from Santa Clara to Trinidad climbs toward the Sierra del Escambray, the second-highest mountain range in Cuba, there are stretches of fresh paving that suddenly give way to cavernous, bone-jarring craters. The road is winding and treacherous, with the potholes and two-way traffic that includes large flatbed trucks, buses, cows, mules, bikes and pedestrians. **********After two hours, the tension is broken. With the beginning of the descent from the Escambray, there is a breathtaking, panoramic view of the Caribbean and on its shore about a mile inland, Villa de la Santisima Trinidad. Founded in 1514, it is one the first settlements in Cuba. **********Compared to Havana, with its crumbling roadways, buildings and other main facilities, the cobblestone streets and Moorish architectural motifs of Trinidad seem like an oasis. It has been turned into a museum piece, and its buildings are carefully restored to lure the Europeans and Canadians who come here for sun and relaxation. **********But for all of its charm, Trinidad is the major city in Sancti Spiritus province, with the attendant problems of a city. **********The tourists draw beggars, small children follow foreigners, wait outside the shops, and then beg for candy, soft drinks and chips. Gradually, their pleas escalate to watches, caps and bags. \"A dollar, senor. For my baby,\" asks a young woman holding a child. **********A red police car passes by and angrily shoos the children away. **********One child doubles back. \"One dollar. One dollar,\" he says. Along the Roadside, 2 A.M. Camouflage **********If alcohol and speed are allies of death, night driving is normally the ally of fatigue. Yet on a two-lane highway from Las Tunas to Bayamo, the road is alive and bustling. **********The moon and headlights are the only guides to a road that cannot make up its mind whether to be bad or fair or horrible. The spare tire has already been used, thanks to a crater-induced flat tire outside Jatibonico. Now it is 2 A.M. between two major towns, with cane fields in between. **********Even at 2 A.M., there are more bikes, pedestrians and horse-drawn wagons than cars. Because most do not have taillights or any other form of illumination, it is necessary to guess at forms in the night to avoid running them down from behind, or meeting them head-on when attempting to change lanes to pass a slow-moving vehicle. **********There are cane fields on each side of the road. One can travel for 15 minutes; then suddenly a man with white clothing and a white hat steps out from between the stalks. **********It goes on like this for the next hour and a half. Darkness, cane field, soldiers standing in the middle of nowhere watching the car as it speeds by. Darkness, cane field, an old man walking down the road, hands clasped behind his back, walking, head bowed, contemplating. Darkness, small town. A man standing on the side of the road holding a machete, with a pool of blood and something freshly killed at his feet. Havana's Strain To Santiago's Ease **********At 1 A.M., on a descent from the Sierra Maestra mountain range, Santiago de Cuba appears as a cluster of lights nestled on a sweeping bay that flows into the Caribbean. Santiago is Cuba's most Caribbean region, laid-back and tranquil compared to the bustle and hustles of Havana. The narrow streets are cleaner, the intensity of work, poverty and decay markedly reduced. **********But the strain of revolution that begins in Havana and flourishes in the countryside is ever-present in Santiago. This is the home of Antonio Maceo, the son of a black merchant in Santiago who is one of the two great leaders of Cuba's war for independence. This is also the city where Mr. Castro accepted the surrender of General Batista's army in January 1959. **********Thirty-two years later, the revolution is no longer an event but an institution, from one tip of the island to the other. A trip along much of its length in this \"special time in a time of peace\" suggests a country undergoing difficult times. Where it is going is anyone's guess."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/10/business/business-digest-641891.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 720, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********MARKETS **********Financial markets gyrated as traders reacted first with hope, then with alarm, to the American-Iraqi talks in Geneva.

In a survey of young joyriders, he said 70 percent of those sampled said they would race off or encourage a chase if approached by the police. **********In the street violence in North Shields, young rioters spread the word on Monday night that the two young men killed in the weekend crash had been killed by their police pursuers, whom they accused of ramming the stolen car into a lamppost. The police denied this, saying the young men lost control of their car while traveling at 125 miles an hour. 400 Rioters on Monday **********In a five-hour rampage Monday night, more than 400 rioters firebombed buildings, looted shops and cut telephone wires. The area was calm Tuesday night. **********Last week, in Oxford, two nights of street disturbances similarly grew out of police efforts to crack down on hotting exhibitions by young people. As a measure of how audacious some of the young car thieves have become, one youth wearing a scarf across his face to conceal his identity raced a car back and forth in front of riot police who had answered a call to stop the disturbance. **********The rioting in North Shield on Monday was the worst episode of street troubles at the end of summer in several cities across Britain, including Cardiff and Birmingham. **********In addition to the antics of the car thieves, the police said warm late-summer weather also contributed to the problem, by drawing large numbers of young people into the streets. On Tuesday, Prime Minister John Major condemned the violence, which he attributed to a \"copycat effect.\" **********But Labor Party politicians said the incidents had less to do with hotting and warm weather than the problems of poverty and unemployment. **********Unlike the disturbances that swept London in the early 1980's, which broke out in predominantly black neighborhoods and were racial in origin, the troubles over the last two weeks have involved mostly white youths who live in public housing, where there is a high percentage of unemployed people and single-parent families. **********According to Mr. Gow, car theft among juveniles have grown sharply over the last two years. In South Wales, for example, 16 percent of all juvenile crimes committed in 1990 involved car theft, compared with less than 9 percent the year before. **********Largely as a result of the hotting craze, the police say Britain now has the highest rate of car theft in Europe.

A recent copy of The International Herald Tribune, thus, went from page 2 to page 7, with nothing in between. **********The censorship reflects an official urge in Syria and most other parts of the Middle East to control the flow of information about the war. The phenomenon that has shriveled press freedoms throughout the region, which is caught nervously between old calculations and a precarious, uncharted future. **********For alongside the military campaign in the gulf, another campaign is being waged by Arab leaders, who using images and hints, smoke and mirrors, seek to position themselves for a post-war era where their wartime stands and statements will help or hurt them. **********In a region bitterly divided by the conflict, the question is: who, really, pursued the long-term Arab interest -- those who sided with Saddam Hussein in the name of Arab pride, or those who opposed him in the name of other principles?  Stakes Are Survival **********The answers, which are now being shaped, are framed in terms of survival -- not only political survival of key figures but also their very physical survival. A reporter criss-crossing the Arab divide gains the impression that the stakes are so high that no one can admit to being less than absolutely right. **********\"Politically, Saddam Hussein is dead,\" said an official in Syria, which supports the United States-led coalition against Iraq. \"He won't last a week after the war is over.\" **********\"I have the feeling that when all this is over, Assad and Mubarak won't be around for too long,\" said a senior politician in Jordan, which has swung toward Iraq. The politician was referring to the leaders of Egypt and Syria, which oppose Baghdad. In both cases, the assessments reflected an unusual acknowledgment that in tempestuous times, the feelings of ordinary people will count. **********The result of such sentiments is a propaganda war that pits Baghdad Radio's appeals to pro-Iraqi Arab emotions in many parts of this region against the attempts of anti-Iraqi regimes to contain explosive passions among their own people. **********\"The problem in this region,\" said an exiled Iraqi politician with long experience in Arab politics, \"is the lack of democracy. Most people don't like their regimes. They don't like the United States. They don't like Israel. When they see someone who stands up to all these things, they ignore the other factors and applaud.\" Exploiting Frustrations **********\"Saddam Hussein is very successfully exploiting the frustrations of a region that is replete with frustration and denial,\" said a senior Western diplomat. \"He is appealing to Islamic sentiment, Palestinian sentiment, rich-poor sentiment to try to build opposition to the regimes that oppose him, to destabilize them.\" **********Many Western diplomats suspect that the Iraqi Embassy in Amman, Jordan, is the source of much manipulation, planting stories on a Jordanian press that is at once among the most free in the Arab world and also among the most eager to stoke the fires of anti-American and pro-Iraqi sentiment. **********\"The Iraqi Embassy in Amman is the source of a variety of untrue rumors of coups and lethal violence against demonstrators here,\" a Western envoy said. \"There is a thin line between propaganda and the attempt to destabilize.\" **********Such is the Syrian sensitivity that Jordanian television broadcasts, which are regarded as pro-Iraqi, have been jammed here for months. Syrian reporters working for foreign news organizations say they have been told to avoid all reference in their dispatches to pro-Iraqi sentiment on the streets. It is a sentiment that Western diplomats call widespread in a land that reversed decades of anti-American hostility to align itself with the United States-led coalition against Baghdad. **********\"When I speak against Saddam, I know that 75 percent of my staff are against me for saying so,\" said a pro-Government Syrian entrepreneur, who declined to be identified by name. \"They do not say it with their voices. They say it with their eyes.\" **********Such are the concerns about the impact of hard news on volatile sentiment that when Syrian and Iraqi soldiers clashed in Saudi Arabia -- a grievous offense to the pan-Arabist ideology embraced here -- official public acknowledgment was delayed for 48 hours. **********The day after this week's American bombing of a building in Baghdad where many civilians died, an event that inflamed Arab passions, the official Syria Times did not refer to the catastrophe at all. The reticence was reflected in officially controlled newspapers in other parts of the Arab world that are aligned with the United States. In those places, commitment to the Western-led coalition faces a potential challenge from pro-Iraqi sentiment on the streets.

If adopted, the proposal could affect tens of millions of dollars in contributions and possibly impose substantial new recordkeeping burdens. **********Inspired in part by the Bush Administration's \"thousand points of light\" mandate, various corporate contributors decided the Government might want to smile particularly brightly on donations to American charities. Corporations thus sought to get full deductions for contributions to charities in the United States, instead of being required -- as under current law -- to allocate such deductions against income earned in this country, but not income earned abroad. **********But what emerged from the I.R.S. was an addition to Sec.1.861(e) of the Federal Tax Code that would allow a company that contributes to an American charity to deduct from domestic income only that part of the contribution actually used by the charity in the United States. Money used abroad would have to be deducted from money earned abroad. **********More than 100 American charities say the proposal would cut donations to organizations working overseas and would discriminate between types of nonprofit groups, create more paperwork and diminish the ability of the private sector to support worldwide efforts to, as one document put it, \"feed children, distribute medicines, save rain forests or even arrange educational exchange programs.\" **********One of those charities, the Fund for Private Assistance in International Development, contends that the I.R.S. took a \"bookkeeper's view\" when devising the proposal and failed to realize the negative effect on contributions, especially from multinational companies with foreign tax credits greater than can be applied against liabilities in the United States. **********With the support of more than two dozen senators and various members of relevant House committees, officials of the charity say they are increasingly confident the proposal will be withdrawn. The I.R.S., however, has yet to acknowledge any change of heart, with a spokesman insisting that it will use the public hearing at its Constitution Avenue headquarters on Thursday to make sure that the agency fully understands the issue, not to debate or defend its proposal.  Democrats' Theme: Fairness **********Democrats in the House are pressing the leadership to keep alive an issue of potential impact in next year's Presidential campaign: tax fairness.This week, the Democratic Study Group, sent a letter with 156 signatures to Speaker Thomas S. Foley urging that a \"concrete\" outline for a tax bill be developed so it can be considered early in 1992. **********\"The central component of this package should be a significant reduction in the tax burden on middle-class and working families,\" the letter stated. \"If such tax relief must be offset by revenue from other sources, we believe that the tax rates paid by the very wealthiest individuals should be raised.\" **********Bills embodying tax cuts for Americans of ordinary means have already been introduced, however, and the Democrats are at odds over how best to replace the lost revenue as required under last autumn's budget agreement. **********Republicans, meanwhile, are busy disputing the Democrats' premise, denying that changes in the tax code over the past decade favored the well-to-do at the expense of those with low and middle incomes. Footnotes **********The I.R.S. figures that the proposed simplification of rules covering maids and other household employees would reduce by 80 percent the paperwork burden of filing, reporting and paying tax obligations. Among other things, the threshhold for being subject to Social Security taxes would be raised to $300 of wages a year from $50 a quarter. **********By increasing its cigarette tax to 5 cents from 2 cents, North Carolina no longer has the country's lowest tax.

So far, the Administration has not explained its approach beyond predicting that Mr. Hussein will probably not be in power by year's end. **********Mr. Bush and his advisers also face a critical decision on whether the United States should abandon the Iraqi insurrection that it has nurtured by protecting it from the Iraqi fighters, bombers and helicopter gunships grounded for now by American air patrols. **********By forcefully telling Iraq that any airplane that flies -- even 1,000 miles north of the cease-fire line to attack Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq -- is a threat to the United States, Mr. Bush has for the moment attached the fate of the rebellion to the allied cause. **********Senior Administration officials continue to say the overall American objective is to bring United States troops home as quickly as possible. But they also continue to call on the Iraqi people to overthrow their vanquished leader. **********\"There clearly is a bit of ambiguity in our position,\" an Administration official said today. \"We've talked a lot about getting Saddam out, but the clear priority is to get the troops home. It seems to be a contradiction and if you look at our public statements, the Administration has not been very effective in explaining its position.\" **********There is still another Iraqi alternative Washington may face, no happier than the others. It is that the Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim rebels may take control of the country and impose a fundamentalist system similar to the one in Teheran. **********At the heart of the United States' problem is the fact that as long as 100,000 troops are bivouacked in southern Iraq and American planes patrol the skies, President Bush has the ability to influence events in Iraq and could be forced by events to do so. **********Last week in Martinique for his meeting with President Francois Mitterrand of France, Mr. Bush was asked whether it would be safer for Persian Gulf security to allow Mr. Hussein to reassert his authority by crushing the rebellion or run the risk that fundamentalist Shiite Muslims, who make up 55 percent of Iraq's 18 million people, would take control and establish an Islamic republic similar to Iran's. 'A Little Too Negative' **********\"I'm not going to answer your question,\" Mr. Bush replied. \"But you spell out two hypotheses. It's a little too negative. Perhaps there's something that's a little more positive than either of those alternatives. Let's hope so.\" **********Mr. Bush's remarks reflect the still dominant assessment among American intelligence officials that neither the southern Shiites nor the northern Kurdish minority can defeat Mr. Hussein's authority and the tradition of Sunni Muslim control it represents. **********The most likely Iraqi institution that would act to save Iraq from centrifugal disintegration and then challenge Mr. Hussein's claim to rule after his disastrous adventure in Kuwait is the military, which is imbued with Iraqi nationalism and which has suffered mightily under Mr. Hussein. **********But a critical policy question that has arisen in the three weeks since the end of hostilities is whether the Iraqi military is more likely to act while it is engaged in putting down rebellion, or after it crushes the rebellion and in doing so eliminates the threat to the territorial integrity of the country. **********\"It is important to stabilize the situation in Iraq,\" said Christine Moss Helms, an Iraq scholar who has advised the White House and Pentagon during the Persian Gulf crisis. \"Until the situation is stabilized nobody is going to be able to focus on getting rid of Saddam Hussein,\" she added.  An Iraqi 'Pandora's Box' **********That may mean that on completion of a formal cease-fire, the United States will have to cede control of the Iraqi skies to Iraq, where the military will certainly launch a punishing air campaign against rebel strongholds. **********Ms. Helms argued that the Bush Administration, having devastated the Iraqi military and thereby \"opened the Pandora's Box\" of religious, ethnic and irredentist forces in Iraq, may not fully appreciate the consequences of encouraging the drift toward civil war. But there are contrary views. **********Some United States officials and allies, notably Saudi Arabia, are pressing Mr. Bush to maintain a strong military presence in southern Iraq for as long as possible to prevent Iran from taking further advantage of the situation. **********Iran, already said to be aiding the rebels in both north and south, is well positioned to influence the outcome of any civil war. **********\"We are creating a situation where the United States wins the war and the Iranians win the peace,\" said Laurie Mylroie, an Iraq scholar on leave from Harvard University as a visiting fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. **********In an interview, Ms. Mylroie said that the United States was dealing itself out of any role in a future government in Baghdad by refusing to talk to the coalition of opposition groups that held its first postwar convention in Beirut last week. \"We are now in a situation where you have an armed revolt of 75 percent of the population,\" Ms. Mylroie said. Why, she asks, should the Administration look to the other 25 percent, the largely Sunni leadership class, to control the future? **********The answer may lie in the belief among senior analysts in the Administration that the Sunni elite of Iraq, the nationalist core of the country from which leaders have sprung and provided the hard control to hold together Iraq's disparate population, has the best credentials to ultimately remove Mr. Hussein and appoint a successor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/17/business/company-news-briefs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** AMC Entertainment Inc., Kansas City, Mo., an operator of movie theaters, will sell eight theaters, with 45 total screens, to Carmike Cinemas Inc., Columbus, Ga.

Can't Get Enough of It!", "body_text": " **********There is clearly no recession in advertisements with recession-related themes. Anyone unaware that the economy has been in a slump since July need only watch television or leaf through a newspaper to learn all about it -- not from the news, but from the ads. **********These ads began appearing in the fall, increased in frequency during the winter and now, as the recession nears its first anniversary, are in full flower. Especially unusual is that the ads use words and images at odds with the advertising's traditionally perfect universe, a world of endless horizons, blue skies and cheerfulness that might tire even Pollyanna. Here, the horizons are limited; the skies are cloudy, even stormy, and terms like \"gloomy,\" \"bad\" and \"recession\" appear. Cajoling and Advice **********\"Where is the good news in all the bad news?\" asks the headline of a print ad created by Grey Advertising, Los Angeles, for the Coldwell Banker Residential Group real estate brokerage. Another ad in the same campaign advises would-be home buyers on \"how to step up in a down market.\" **********\"Look, I know you have less to spend these days,\" R. David Thomas, founder of the fast-food chain Wendy's International, says earnestly in a television spot created by Backer Spielvogel Bates, New York, \"but that doesn't mean you have to eat less.\" **********In a newspaper ad for Konica Business Machines USA's copiers and facsimile machines, a mock supermarket tabloid carries the headline \"Expert tells how to beat recession: Try nothing.\" The ad, by Keiler Advertising, Farmington, Conn., pitches a program selling office equipment with no finance charge. **********\"The economic recovery may be months away,\" reads the text of a newspaper ad, created by Chiat/Day/ Mojo, New York, for the brokerage firm Shearson Lehman Brothers, \"but that doesn't mean you have to wait around to start benefiting from it.\" The ad offers readers a research report on 14 stocks \"that could start recovering before the recovery,\" so that \"you could start your own economic recovery now.\" **********The trend is not limited to large national advertisers. A series of small newspaper ads for the Adrienne restaurant in New York's Peninsula Hotel asks questions like \"Hard times, hard rolls?\" **********Recession-related advertising is based on a time-honored tradition of playing off the news of the day. **********\"You're trying to create empathy with the consumer, and this is what's on people's minds,\" said Donny Deutsch, executive vice president and creative director of Deutsch Inc., New York. For one client, the furniture retail chain Ikea, Mr. Deutsch is producing print ads showing fashionably furnished rooms above headlines like \"What recession?\" **********\"Anytime you can bring anything relevant into an ad, the difference of being topical makes it fun,\" Mr. Deutsch said. **********\"It's a sensible strategy,\" said Judith Langer, head of Langer Associates, New York, a market research and trend-spotting consultancy. In the firm's focus-group interviews, there has emerged \"a strong sense among consumers that even if they haven't been affected yet personally,\" she continued, they are fully aware of the depth and breadth of the country's economic problems. **********Leo J. Shapiro, chairman of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a market survey and consumer research company in Chicago, said: \"During a period like this, it irritates people if you tempt them to buy things they don't think they can afford. So there has to be a shift in the way you advertise.\" **********What makes recession-related campaigns stand out is that advertisers are talking to consumers about an economic climate in which they are spending less money to get them to spend more money. **********\"You have to give them permission to spend,\" Mr. Deutsch said, \"because everything out there tells you, psychologically, 'Don't spend; don't spend.' \" That is why, he said, his agency's Ikea campaign stresses the chain's philosophy, as described in the advertising, of offering high-quality furniture for lower prices than other furniture retailers. **********One vital ingredient, Mr. Deutsch said, is humor, which leavens the otherwise serious thoughts that might be stirred by frequent invocations of hard times. For that reason many of his agency's Ikea ads also include puns. Other advertisers, including the Stouffer Foods Corporation, temper the somberness of their messages by emphasizing how their products are priced to offer \"value,\" and playing down the economic conditions causing consumers to be concerned about saving money. **********Look for recession-related campaigns to remain popular, Mr. Shapiro said, until they become so popular that \"all the competitors\" in various consumer-product categories are running them. Then they will be replaced by a new generation of advertising, he said, in which marketers will \"talk about their products being better or different.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/24/business/media-business-advertising-4-big-agencies-will-share-work-for-northwest-airlines.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-07-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 706, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "4 Big Agencies Will Share Work for Northwest Airlines", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 4 Big Agencies Will Share Work for Northwest Airlines", "body_text": " **********NORTHWEST AIRLINES joined the ranks of giant marketers using more than one large advertising agency when it announced yesterday that it would create a four-way \"communications partnership\" for worldwide advertising, marketing and promotional campaigns. **********Northwest is hiring this shop quartet: the J. Walter Thompson Company, New York; Ogilvy & Mather, New York; FCB/Leber Katz Partners, New York, and McElligott Wright Morrison White, Minneapolis. **********Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, would not discuss billings, but it is estimated that they could reach $90 million in the next year. Northwest's spending has fluctuated between $20 million and $60 million in the last three years, varying with the economy's ups and downs and the Persian Gulf war. **********\"It became obvious to us we needed to present a face, and communicate, on a global basis,\" Christopher E. Clouser, senior vice president of communications and advertising, said in a telephone interview from Northwest's offices in Minneapolis. The joint task of the four agencies, he added, will be \"to produce the operating and communication strategy for a global brand.\" **********While specific assignments for each agency are still to be determined, Mr. Clouser described this general lineup: domestic and international advertising aimed at consumers, to Thompson; the Trump Shuttle, assuming Northwest's deal to manage it goes through, and a second, undisclosed project, to Ogilvy; direct-marketing campaigns aimed at business travelers and frequent flyers, to FCB/Leber Katz, and corporate identity, to McElligott Wright. **********Hiring two or more agencies to work on huge accounts has become popular in the last couple of years. Among those doing so are McDonald's, which splits its account between the Leo Burnett Company and DDB Needham Worldwide; I.B.M., which employs Wells Rich Greene BDDP and Lintas New York, and Burger King, which has on its roster Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising and D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles. **********\"This is a pretty bold experiment,\" said Tony Wright, president of McElligott Wright, \"to choose four agencies to work together to come up with big global ideas.\" Mr. Wright, who worked on the British Airways campaigns in Britain, said he would welcome the partnership because it was \"tough to do great advertising that crosses borders.\" **********At Ogilvy, Bill Hamilton, executive vice president and creative head, said, \"We're going into this with the idea we're going to work together to leverage the entire Northwest brand.\" It can work, he added, \"if you have your head screwed on right and don't play N.I.H. games\" -- meaning accepting the others' ideas instead of resisting them as \"not invented here.\" **********To help make the partnership work, top executives of the agencies will meet quarterly with Northwest officials. All will become members of a new communications board the airline will create. Mr. Clouser hopes new ads can appear in the next 90 days. **********Northwest's decision ends a seven-year relationship with Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, New York, which handled Northwest's consumer account. \"We're very proud of what we did,\" said Ed Wax, president and chief executive of Saatchi. \"But this is a business where change is inevitable.\" The ad community had been speculating about an agency change since April, when Mr. Clouser and Peter Hoult, senior vice president of marketing and sales, joined the airline. Indeed, the company acknowledged in May that it was reviewing the status of its account. **********Once Northwest decided to rethink its marketing communications in worldwide terms, Mr. Clouser said, that presented a conflict for Saatchi. Its British parent, Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., represents British Airways internationally. **********For Ogilvy, the assignment means \"we're back in the airline business,\" Mr. Hamilton said. Its relationship with Eastern Airlines ended when Eastern went out of business this year. The Trump Shuttle account, which billed as much as $7 million to $9 million under Donald J. Trump, had been handled by Scali, McCabe, Sloves, New York. **********Northwest's decision also puts Thompson back in the airline business for the first time since it handled USAir's account from 1978 to 1986. \"It's exactly what we've been looking for,\" said Donald Sullivan, executive vice president of Thompson. The agency is known for its Pan Am campaigns from 1942 to 1978, including \"Pan Am makes the going great.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/12/business/washington-state-health-care-issue.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Washington State Health Care Issue", "print_headline": "Washington State Health Care Issue", "body_text": " **********The Washington Health Care Facilities Authority yesterday tentatively priced $80.1 million in revenue bonds with a maximum yield of 7.46 percent for an issue due in 2018. **********Underwriters led by John Nuveen & Company said the tax-exempt issue, which will provide funds for the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, was priced to yield from 5.5 percent in 1994, 5.85 percent in 1996, 6.75 percent in 2002 to 7 percent in 2005.

The ghastly implications of this\"creeping Vietnamization\" are clear. But human sacrifices will not be the only costs. **********In modern wars, a Fifth Horseman always trails behind the more familiar quartet to claim the toll on mountains of debt run up by the armies as they fire the cash equivalent of Mercedes-Benzes back and forth at each other. In 1991, this horseman's long, black shadow already stretches far across America. **********Back in November 1990, when Desert Storm was still Desert Shield, the Center for Defense Information, a private research organization in Washington, estimated that the operation added about $74 million a day -- or $27 billion a year -- to the military budget. **********This sum, however, did not take account of subsequent deployments, later revelations that the Pentagon was paying premium prices for equipment acquired on short notice or the gigantic costs of canceled debts and foreign-aid payments funneled to third world economies devastated by the crisis. For example, the United States has already forgiven about $7 billion in loans to Egypt alone. As of last December, at least half a dozen more countries had also received money from the allied coalition. **********Once the air war started -- at about $500 million a day -- the sky became the limit in many senses. A recent Congressional Budget Office report suggests that a short, one-month war could cost about $28 billion while a longer one of six-months would cost $86 billion. But these widely repeated figures also neglect the costs of foreign aid and debt forgiveness. **********The Administration, however, argues against any tax increase, claiming that the war amounts to an extraordinary one-time expense, which should simply be rolled into the deficit. **********The Bush team also suggested that the allies and the gulf states will bail out the United States by agreeing to pick up much of the tab, a claim the President advanced himself in the State of the Union address. **********These assertions essentially represent a very curious new \"voodoo economics\" of war. **********While Administration economists sit in one room of the White House explaining that the war is a one-time expense, their colleagues down the hall at the National Security Council and across town at the State Department are leaking sweeping plans to restructure the whole Middle East once the shooting dies away. **********Now it is perfectly obvious that the web of bilateral treaties and special security agreements American policy makers envision for the region will be spun from threads of the purest gold. Foreign aid \"loans\" -- better read as grants -- and, particularly, foreign military assistance, are destined to skyrocket. And while the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, argues that costs can be contained by not replenishing depreciated equipment, the postwar scenarios envision a massive pre-positioned buildup in the desert for possible future use. **********The golden cloud does come with a silver lining: Saddam Hussein is an authentic monster whose departure will be extensively unlamented. **********But there is a tunnel at the end of the light. Apparently unaware of how its \"new world order\" looks to the vast mass of poor Arabs, Washington now appears determined to throw its full weight behind a set of quasi-feudal regimes on the verge of a head-on collision with democracy and the 20th century. This we have all seen before and as we know, implies further visits by all Five Horsemen. **********As for the allied promises to pay, the paltry amounts actually anted up thus far suggest that for purposes of realistic fiscal planning, these must be regarded as the equivalent of sovereign \"junk bonds\": worth something, but much less than face value. **********Nor is it reasonable, once the war ends, to expect either the gulf states or the allies to finance a Middle Eastern Pax Americana at anything remotely resembling concessionary rates. Obtaining foreign financing for two major wars cost Britain its empire; in the long run, Americans cannot expect to pay any less if they go that route. Citizens and especially the Congress, accordingly, should recall that the policy makers who now assure them that foreigners will open their wallets are the same ones who said the allies would open their markets. **********The Fifth Horseman, however, is implacable. He must still be paid. How? **********Probably not in steeply inflated dollars. For this to occur, the political and economic establishment would have to be prepared to cede the international role of the dollar. This is about as likely as oil flowing uphill. **********In the end, it is all too clear who will pay. American overseas assistance to less strategic areas will be cut even more, but most of the costs will come out of the domestic civilian sector. **********Spending on virtually everything besides the military will be even more desperately squeezed. Financial pressures on states and cities will intensify. However, many of the foregone expenditures are precisely those that are most vital to the revival of American productivity. **********But the Fifth Horseman will claim still more. In the short run, extra military spending will help pull the economy out of recession. But as the economy revives, the tumescent deficit will keep fueling total demand. To limit inflation, the Federal Reserve will have to tighten the money supply, bringing the economy right back to the devastating combination of tight money and expansive fiscal policy that defined real-life Reaganomics. **********In the short run, as we learned in the 1980's, such policies can produce political business cycles substantial enough to guarantee the re-election of almost any regime. But as we also learned in the 80's, the cost in terms of long-term industrial competitiveness is steep: fixed investment by business -- outside of the military sectors -- is desperately squeezed, while import-competing and interest-sensitive industries like automobiles are hammered. **********The Fifth Horseman's ultimate victims will thus be the middle- and working-class Americans whose real earnings will continue falling while racial and economic inequality increase."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/28/business/making-a-difference-on-the-block-yogi-co.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1991-07-28", "snippet": "Hanna-Barbera Productions created Yogi Bear and Fred Flintstone.

Last year, in a reservation of 7,200 Indians, there were 29 suicides, and 8 more were reported by mid-May of this year. **********\"Nineteen-ninety was the year it exploded,\" said Maria Aparecida da Costa Pereira, a psychologist sent here by the National Indian Foundation, a Government agency known to everyone here as Funai. \"They are sending out an appeal. The suicides speak of a lack of prospects, of a lack of a future.\" **********The Americas are littered with unsuccessful attempts at reconciling Indian and European cultures, but the Dourados reservation is an especially stark example as the hemisphere prepares for observations next year of the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus.  Reserve Dates to 1920's **********In an attempt to speed the Kaiowa Indians' assimilation of European ways, the Dourados reserve was established here in the 1920's alongside one of the few white outposts in a wilderness territory called Mato Grosso, or Big Forest. **********\"When I came here, Dourados had six inhabitants,\" recalled Irenio Isnard, a wizened Kaiowa man of 91 years who sat on a stool, protected from the shade by a crumpled hat. **********Today, Dourados is an agro-business center of 150,000 people. But over the years, the adjacent 8,819-acre reservation has become a dumping ground for ranchers who wanted to rid their lands of migratory bands of Kaiowa, a subgroup of the Guarani, an ethnic group once found across southern Brazil and Paraguay. **********Today, the Dourados reserve holds almost one Indian per acre -- not enough land for traditional subsistence farming. To survive, Indian men work as migrant laborers, leaving the reservation for months to cut sugar cane for alcohol distilleries situated several hours by truck from here. Indian women walk to town to sell Indian trinkets, to beg or to engage in prostitution. Until it was closed recently, a town dump was on the edge of the reserve, providing limited material for scavengers. **********\"I once saw 30 to 40 Indians fighting over clothes and toys in the dump,\" Joel Vitorino da Silva, a former Indian protection agent, said as he drove a car down the red dirt roads of the reserve.  Churches Move In **********Neighboring white farmers started to rent Indian land, and traders brought in alcohol from the adjacent town. The last traditional shaman died a decade ago, and evangelical churches aggressively moved into the reserve, preaching against the Indians' ancestral beliefs. An Adventist mission had been on the reserve since the 1940's, maintaining the Kaiowas only hospital. But five new churches have opened recently, limiting their social action to collecting monthly tithes. **********\"Historically, in situations of pressure, the Guarani withdraw,\" said Ms. Pereira, the psychologist. \"Under pressure, the Guarani resort to migration, prayer or death.\" **********With the big forest now a big farm, there is nowhere to go. **********In Mato Grosso do Sul state, the Kaiowa and other Guarani subgroups have been concentrated in 11 reserves, totaling 52,000 acres. The Missionary Indigenous Council, a Roman Catholic group, seeks legalization of 10 more reserves, which would almost double recognized Indian land. **********But previous attempts at protecting the Indians have been slapped down by hostile local judges or by violence from ranchers.  Encounter With the Pope **********In one appeal that caught the eyes of the world, a Kaiowa leader from Dourados, Marcal de Souza, addressed Pope John Paul II during the Pope's visit to Brazil in 1980. **********\"When Brazil was discovered, we were a great nation,\" Mr. de Souza said of Brazil's Indian population, which has dwindled from an estimated six million 500 years ago to 230,000 today. \"Today, we inhabit the margins of this country with no way to live. Even our survival is in danger as we are being murdered on this land.\" **********Turning to the stocky Indian leader, the Pope replied: \"With all my heart, I hope that you, as the first inhabitants of this land, will obtain the right to live in peace and tranquillity. May you not suffer the true nightmare of being removed for the benefit of others.\" **********Three years later, Mr. de Souza was slain. Although evidence appeared to point to a local rancher, Libero Monteiro de Lima, the case has never gone to trial. Moving faster, however, a state judge recently upheld Mr. de Lima's claim to 5,700 acres of land now occupied by 200 Indians. Funai, the Indian protection service, is appealing the decision. **********Feeling corralled on all fronts, the Kaiowa here started to turn to suicide. **********\"For the Guarani, death is not the end,\" said Olivio Mangolim, regional coordinator of the Missionary Council. \"It is a way to get to a better situation without suffering.\"  Remedial Plan Drawn Up **********Alarmed by the rising suicide rate, especially high among adolescents, Funai drew up a remedial plan in late April. **********To reduce the need for men to migrate for work, the Indian agency plans to build fish ponds and to supply seeds, tools and fertilizers to improve farm yields. To strengthen the role of traditional leaders and of traditional rituals, a prayer house is to be built and a shaman is to be brought in from Paraguay. **********\"If necessary, we will remove the new churches,\" Edivio Battistelli, the superintendent of Funai, said in an interview in Brasilia. \"There are also plans to increase the reserve areas. There are Guarani in the state who are completely landless.\" **********From his perch by his family's mud and wattle house here, Mr. Isnard, like most Indians interviewed, skirted direct talk about the suicides. **********\"When I gave orders around here, this didn't happen,\" said the old man, who handed his chieftancy to his son-in-law in 1986. Mr. Isnard did not mention that his son-in-law attempted suicide himself last year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/26/business/a-revival-is-seen-for-junk-bonds-as-market-gains.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1725, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A REVIVAL IS SEEN FOR 'JUNK BONDS' AS MARKET GAINS", "print_headline": "A REVIVAL IS SEEN FOR 'JUNK BONDS' AS MARKET GAINS", "body_text": " **********The Wall Street market for high-risk corporate bonds, which fueled the corporate takeovers of the 1980's only to collapse after a series of defaults and bankruptcies, is showing signs of life. **********More than a year after the bankruptcy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which pioneered and promoted the market, prices for high-risk, low-grade \"junk bonds\" have improved sharply, the market seems calmer and major buyers, sellers and underwriters are starting to describe the recovery as viable and real. **********If a new junk bond market takes hold, the effects will be felt from Wall Street to Washington. Companies in need of credit would be less dependent on scarce bank loans. The owners of junk bonds, including a host of savings and loan institutions and insurance companies, would be able to value their assets more accurately and sell them more easily and at better prices. Rescue Cost Could Be Cut **********That, in turn, could pare the bill for rescuing insolvent savings and loans and ease the strain on the nation's insurance industry. **********Junk bonds are corporate bonds whose creditworthiness is at the low end of the grading scale used by Wall Street rating agencies. They came to prominence during the 1980's when they were used by many corporate raiders to stage hostile takeovers that reshaped some of America's largest corporations, and that were blamed for plant closings, job losses and community upheavals. **********The collapse of many junk bond deals also caused bruising losses for many individual investors who were initially attracted to their eye-catching yields. With the bankruptcy of Drexel and the criminal prosecution of Michael R. Milken, the head of the firm's junk bond operation, the market shriveled and seemed on the verge of vanishing. **********But the market seems to have confounded its critics. It has weathered both the Persian Gulf war and an economic recession, two developments that were widely thought to be deadly for junk bond investors. The market is coping surprisingly well with the junk bond sales conducted as part of the Federal bailout of insolvent savings and loans that were major junk bond holders. **********Market research is broader, as firms like Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette have stepped in to fill the knowledge gap left by Drexel's demise. And new ways of obtaining current, realistic prices are springing up to guide the traders who are tiptoeing back to the game. **********The clearest sign of recovery is the market's ability to absorb new issues. Since January, three major corporations, RJR Nabisco, Chiquita Brands and Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group, have been able to find buyers for a total of $1.85 billion worth of newly issued junk bonds. At least three more new issues totaling $675 million have been announced. Last year, by contrast, only $385.8 million worth of new junk bonds were issued publicly, most of it by only two corporations.  'Fundamental Reason to Exist' **********\"The market has a fundamental reason to exist,\" said Garrett Moran, managing director of the high-yield bond department at Donaldson, Lufkin. \"Companies need to raise money to grow their company or make sensible acquisitions. The market is a lot smaller, the deals will be smaller, and the buyer universe will be smaller. But if the deals make sense you'll be surprised how many buyers there are.\" **********Donaldson, Lufkin did almost $1 billion worth of private junk bond financings last year because \"there was so much dislocation in the public market,\" Mr. Moran added. \"If I had those deals to do today, I'd do them as public deals -- there's absolutely no question about it.\" **********Philip Sanford, senior vice president and treasurer of Johnston Coca-Cola in Chattanooga, Tenn., said he would have been leery of trying to raise money in the junk bond market a year ago. \" Clearly there were questions created about the marketplace,\" he added. \"Any issuer would have felt less comfortable than now. But our recent issue was very successful. Our underwriters tell us it was oversubscribed, with new buyers as well as repeat buyers.\" **********Those who buy bonds also see a sharp improvement. \"The market machinery is much stronger that it was,\" said Morris W. Offit, chief executive of Offitbank, a New York money manager specializing in bonds. \"You have securities firms committing more resources to the area, in terms of trading, research and sales distribution. And institutional portfolios are taking a close look at the issues. There is still enough of a yield differential to give you an incentive to buy, as long as you do your homework.\" Reminder to Investors **********For now, no one is predicting that this reborn junk market will grow into the behemoth it became in the 1980's, when junk bonds fueled a binge of poorly structured deals that made Wall Street rich and left many American corporations laden with expensive debt. Indeed, the failure of many of those companies to pay their bond obligations today is a constant reminder to investors that junk bonds remain a risky venture. But even major defaults do not rattle the market as they once did, as investors have become better at assessing the debt renegotiation process. **********\"It's not a completely healthy market yet,\" said Kingman Penniman, senior vice president in the MCM Investment Research unit at Duff & Phelps, a credit rating agency in Chicago. \"But it's certainly been wheeled out of critical care and into the recovery room.\" **********The prognosis was far less encouraging in the months immediately after Drexel limped from the scene. Firm price quotations were difficult to come by, the available quotes were at fire-sale levels, few dealers were willing to make trades, and analysts were leaving the market in droves. Then came last summer, with the threat of war, an economic recession and an uncertain regulatory climate. Surprises on Regulatory Front **********It has helped, of course, that the gulf war ended so quickly, and that the recession's end is almost, if not certainly, in sight. But market analysts say the real surprises have been on the regulatory front, most notably, the skill with which the Resolution Trust Corporation has handled the $9.1 billion portfolio of junk bonds it accumulated in the course of the savings and loan bailout. **********Fears that a clumsy liquidation of that portfolio would swamp the unsteady junk market have proved groundless. \"I give them all the credit in the world,\" said Martin S. Fridson, managing director of Merrill Lynch's high-yield research unit. \"They have felt their way along to see how much they can sell, and how quickly. They've handled it extremely well, and that has reassured the market.\" **********Market participants have also started to solve some of the information problems that plagued them last year. Duff & Phelps, for example, is offering a new electronic service to provide daily price quotations, based on actual transactions, for 100 junk bonds, and weekly price quotes for more than 200 additional issues. **********And a six-month rally has helped push junk bond prices up to levels that are attracting the attention of professional investors. The investment return on junk bonds this year, as measured by Merrill Lynch's high-yield bond index, is up nearly 20 percent, after a 4.35 percent decline last year. The flow of funds into junk bond mutual funds is improving, and some pension funds have been shopping in the higher-grade end of the junk market, portfolio managers report. **********Although the economic forecast and the gyrations of the stock market still have a powerful effect on junk bond prices, the tone of the market is so much improved that the chief junk bond analyst at Salomon Brothers reversed his earlier pessimism and endorsed junk bonds early last week as a good long-term investment. **********\"I had not been bullish for two years,\" said Joseph C. Bencivenga, the director of high-yield research at Salomon. \"But I am definitely optimistic now. When things are fairly priced, it is hard for people to argue with the product.\" **********Mr. Fridson, of Merrill Lynch, is similarly encouraged. \"The market adjusted very quickly to all its problems, and now we're in a position where you can do a reasonable level of business,\" he said. \"We're not going to get back to the Drexel days, with $30 billion in new issuance a year. But there's a reasonable flow of business, and people are feeling much better about the conditions in the market.\" Nervousness on Insurers **********The market is still nervously waiting to see how state insurance regulators handle the insolvencies of the First Executive Corporation and the First Capital Corporation, two insurance holding companies that had invested heavily in junk bonds. \"That's the next 800-pound gorilla this market has to deal with,\" said Mr. Bencivenga. \"Together, they have about $14 billion to $15 billion worth of junk bonds and nobody is eager to see that hit the market.\" But the regulators have indicated that they will not liquidate the portfolio in a hasty fashion, he added, so he is not unduly alarmed. **********Not everyone in the market is as confident. Some analysts point out that defaults are expected in about $20 billion worth of junk bonds this year, not counting bond issues that are renegotiated before an official default. That is almost 10 percent of the total market, and five times the default level the market had expected back in the early 1980's. Warning by Magazine **********Investment Dealer's Digest, a magazine serving the brokerage community, recently ran a cautionary cover story warning that the mutual funds that are now investing in junk bonds could flee the market just as quickly at the first sign of trouble, increasing volatility and demolishing prices. The magazine warned traders against becoming overly optimistic. **********But for Mr. Bencivenga, this cover story itself was evidence of the market's changed mood; it is unthinkable, he said, that any publication would have felt it necessary or newsworthy to emphasize the junk bond market's weaknesses just a few months ago. **********\"This is the way markets work,\" he said. \"They overreact in both directions. We're coming off a huge bottom, where investors overreacted in pounding prices down. We've weeded out the players who don't want to be here. What's left are the people who do want to be here. All told, I think we're poised for continued double-digit annual returns, despite the defaults.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/10/business/company-news-stanley-expecting-drop-in-1990-net.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stanley Expecting Drop in 1990 Net", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Stanley Expecting Drop in 1990 Net", "body_text": " **********The Stanley Works, the hardware and tools supplier, predicted its earnings for 1990 would be down 5 percent to 8 percent. \"Stanley fourth-quarter sales and earnings have been affected by the spreading economic weakness in the United States,\" said Richard H.

But few contracts define the stakes so starkly as the selection the Navy will make soon of a company to build its next attack submarine. **********Industry executives and Government officials say that what is at stake is the survival of one of the two remaining submarine-building shipyards -- the General Dynamics Corporation's Electric Boat division in Groton, Conn. **********Electric Boat has said that unless it receives the next Seawolf contract, which could be awarded as soon as this week, it will probably not have enough business to stay open beyond the middle of the decade. A closing of Electric Boat would mean the loss of 22,000 jobs at the company and thousands more at its suppliers and subcontractors. **********That would leave the Navy totally dependent for its submarines on a single source, Tenneco Inc.'s Newport News shipyard in Virginia. **********While the Seawolf program would be \"a matter of relative prosperity for Newport News, it now appears to be a matter of survival for Electric Boat and much of the submarine industrial supplier base in New England,\" James E. Turner Jr., Electric Boat's general manager, told a Congressional hearing last month. **********The situation at Electric Boat is just one example of how declining military budgets and the resulting shrinkage of the contracting business are raising fears within the Government and the industry of a permanent erosion in the nation's ability to design and manufacture weapons. **********The Air Force's selection last week of a team headed by the Lockheed Corporation to build a new generation of fighter planes gave Lockheed and its partners, General Dynamics and the Boeing Company, a solid base of military aircraft orders for the next two decades. And it left the losing team, the Northrop Corporation and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, seemingly dropped from the front ranks of the combat aircraft business, and in the long run, perhaps even being forced out of the field. **********The Army is down to one tank manufacturer, General Dynamics, which is struggling to win enough domestic and foreign tank orders to keep its production line open after 1995. And the Army's selection earlier this month of Boeing and the United Technologies Corporation's Sikorsky division to build a new light attack helicopter seems to doom McDonnell Douglas's helicopter operations to a long period of retrenchment. **********The Grumman Corporation, formerly the premier builder of Navy aircraft, is lobbying furiously in Congress to overturn a decision by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to end the F-14 fighter program. Mr. Cheney's decision would essentially force Grumman out of the aircraft-building business. Only Moderately Concerned **********So far Pentagon officials say they are only moderately concerned about the industry's diminishing size and strength and its ability to provide military superiority to the nation's forces. **********In announcing the selection of the Lockheed team last week, Air Force Secretary Donald B. Rice said concerns about the military contracting industry played no role in his decision. He added that the Air Force \"will simply have to leave to market forces\" the question of whether some companies leave the airplane business. **********Some people argue that the shrinking of the industry is overdue, since it has been plagued for years with overcapacity, particularly in aircraft manufacturing. Many Government officials say it would be a mistake to start awarding weapons contracts on any basis other than merit and cost. **********But as more companies approach the day when they must mothball their assembly lines, dismiss engineering and scientific staffs and cut back on research, there are growing warnings -- some, predictably, motivated by self-interest and pork-barrel politics -- that the Pentagon should slow the dismantling of the industrial base on which it has relied. **********In a speech last month, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said, \"Our declining defense industrial base and the long-term consequences of decisions made today about the procurement of weapons systems\" amount to a \"serious problem that threatens to endanger the security of the United States.\" He urged the Navy to give the Seawolf contract to Electric Boat. **********Many industry executives and analysts and Government officials stop short of calling for the Pentagon to take an active role in managing the shrinkage of the industry. But they say the military should do more to define what it needs to insure that the appropriate industrial abilities are retained. **********\"We still face the question of what is the minimum capability we require and what are the necessary inefficiencies we need to put up with in order to maintain it,\" said Gordon Adams, the director of the Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan research group based in Washington. \"Even if they are making the decisions without industrial base considerations, the decisions have industrial base implications.\" **********The implications are clear on the Seawolf program. Electric Boat won a competition with Newport News several years ago to build the first Seawolf under a $726 million contract. The Navy originally planned to buy three or four Seawolfs a year and to split the business between Electric Boat and Newport News. The Navy thought the competition between the shipyards would bring down the program's costs. **********But with the cold war apparently over and Pentagon budgets being slashed, the Navy now plans on buying no more than one Seawolf a year. **********\"We need to honestly face the fact that long-term procurement of one submarine per year will not sustain both submarine construction yards,\" H. Lawrence Garrett 3d, the Secretary of the Navy, told a Congressional committee several weeks ago. **********The military aircraft business is also being forced to shrink. The Northrop-McDonnell Douglas team's loss on the new fighter program last week leaves Northrop's future almost totally dependent on the B-2 Stealth bomber program, which accounts for more than half the company's revenues. If the B-2 were to be canceled after the 15 planes the Air Force has already ordered -- a step many in Congress think is likely this year -- Northrop would be left as a producer of missiles and electronics systems and as a subcontractor on a few aircraft programs. **********McDonnell Douglas has a large backlog of commercial and transport aircraft orders. But over the next several years, most of its biggest combat aircraft programs will end, including the F-15 and AV-8B fighters and the Apache helicopter. Earlier this year, the Navy canceled the company's other big hope for the future, the A-12 attack plane."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/13/world/soviets-assure-safety-at-a-plant-damaged-by-fire.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1991-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 518, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviets Assure Safety at A-Plant Damaged by Fire", "print_headline": "Soviets Assure Safety at A-Plant Damaged by Fire", "body_text": " **********Officials said today that no radioactivity escaped during a fire that occurred on Friday night at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, site of the infamous nuclear eruption five years ago. **********About 300 firefighters and 60 fire trucks were rushed to fight the blaze from as far away as Zhitomir, 100 miles away, and Kiev, 60 miles away, and brought it under control by 11:30 P.M., three and a half hours after it began, officials said. **********The fire destroyed the roof over a generator attached to the No. 2 reactor, one of three still functioning since the April 1986 disaster destroyed the No. 4 reactor. **********The blaze was evidently limited to the area of the turbines, which are in a building adjoining a separate building housing the reactors, and did not affect the nuclear reactors.

The 23-cent premium will raise about $870 million a year for the F.D.I.C.'s Bank Insurance Fund. Banking industry profits last year were estimated at more than $17 billion. **********Under the current system, where insurance premiums are charged only on deposits in domestic offices, the impact is greatest on those banks that rely heavily on domestic deposits and whose earnings are already at a low level. **********John W. Spiegel, executive vice president at SunTrust Banks Inc., in Atlanta, said the need for banks to keep profits high enough to attract capital will require that the higher insurance costs be eventually passed on to customers. \"Most of the banks in our system were planning for a 19.5 cent premium this year, though some had anticipated it could be higher,\" he said. **********\"It is reasonable to expect the banking system to pay for its deposit insurance system\" Mr. Spiegel said, \"though I think higher-quality banks should pay lower premiums than weaker banks, just like non-smokers pay lower life insurance premiums than smokers.\" **********James W. Kienker, executive vice president at Boatmen's Bancshares, St. Louis, said that collecting the higher deposit insurance premiums from bank customers and shareholders was ultimately not much different from collecting the cost from taxpayers. \"Indirectly, all taxpayers are customers of ours or some other deposit-taking institution,\" he said. **********Orin Kramer, a New York consultant to financial companies, said that questions about the health of the banking system were more important than the debate over how to refinance the F.D.I.C. **********\"The more important question still facing the F.D.I.C.,\" he said, \"is which banks are going to fail and how fast will they be closed.\" **********Because insurance premiums are charged only on deposits in domestic offices, a recent analysis by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods concluded that the higher rates will hurt many banking companies in the economically troubled Northeast and Middle Atlantic States. These banks, the study said, are already financially weak and rely heavily on domestic deposits for their capital."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/03/business/mutual-funds-the-no-load-closed-end-munis.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1991-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 870, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mutual Funds; The No-Load, Closed-End Munis", "print_headline": "Mutual Funds; The No-Load, Closed-End Munis", "body_text": " **********The closed-end municipal bond fund industry is a sedate business -- a haven for investors seeking high tax-free yields. But a spark of creativity has energized the $19.5 billion industry. One fund group has eliminated the upfront sales charges, and some people think this approach is likely to spread. **********The investing public is snapping up Van Kampen Merritt's no-load series of six closed-end municipal bond funds. The offerings have raised more than $980 million since the initial subscription started in August. \"It was a tremendous success, far beyond our expectations,\" said Stephen J. Hodgdon, marketing director for Van Kampen Merritt, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill. **********Unlike mutual funds, which continuously issue shares as more investors buy in, closed-end funds sell a fixed number of shares that trade on stock exchanges. Because share prices are set by supply and demand, fund shares can trade at a premium or discount to the value of the securities in their portfolios. **********Until now, new offerings of closed-end funds came to market with hefty underwriting costs built into their share prices. These costs create an immediate premium. So investors might pay $10 for a share of a closed-end fund with a net asset value of $9.30 a share -- for a premium of 7.5 percent. **********After the initial public offering, the share prices often drop, sometimes to the point where the fund is trading at a discount to its underlying holdings. Therefore, many investment advisers steer investors away from initial offerings. Wait until the shares begin to trade, they say; then buy shares for less than the fund's net asset value. **********But the closed-end municipal bond funds have so far proved an exception, sustaining premiums almost continuously for several years. This is good for stockholders, but many advisers believe the premiums will disappear once the huge demand for tax-free funds is filled. In any event, the higher the purchase price for a fund, the lower the effective yield. **********That is why Thomas J. Herzfeld, an investment adviser in Miami who specializes in closed-end fund investment and analysis, calls the Van Kampen Merritt move \"one of the most significant developments in the industry.\" If other issuers follow its lead, \"you'll see price competition in underwriting for the first time in the closed-end municipal market,\" he said. **********W. Douglas Dent, editor of Cappiello's Closed-End Fund Digest, a newsletter based in Santa Barbara, Calif., calls the Van Kampen innovation \"the beginning of a new way of marketing closed-end funds.\" **********Other fund groups are quietly taking notes. A spokesman for John Nuveen & Company, one of the biggest players in the municipal market, said that while the company had no current plans to issue no-load closed-end municipal bond funds, \"we're watching what they are doing.\" **********If the new marketing structure catches on, it may help convert the entire closed-end industry to no-load form. That is because investors will dump shares that they hold in existing funds that sell for premiums, pocket the profit, and then reinvest in no-load funds with the same yield. The selling in turn may drive down the premiums on existing funds. **********Even now, premiums have been sliding on two other Van Kampen funds: the premium on the Investment Grade Municipal Bond Fund peaked at 8 percent in September and slipped to 6 percent last week; the premium on its Municipal Income Trust dropped from 9 percent in early October to 3 percent. **********Here is how the Van Kampen Merritt deal works: Instead of tacking on the normal underwriting fee of 6 or 7 percent, Van Kampen is acting as its own distributor and using its own money to pay 3 percent commissions to the sales force. To recoup the upfront sales costs, Van Kampen charges higher management and administrative fees than comparable funds. Its fees total about 1.2 percent; by contrast, the Nuveen Investment Quality Municipal Fund has expenses of 74-hundredths of 1 percent. **********Which is the better deal for investors -- a lower upfront sales charge or lower expenses? Because both reduce the fund's yield, the answer depends on the size of the expenses and the premium on the fund. **********For example, on Oct. 23 the Nuveen fund yielded 6.76 percent after expenses. A comparable Van Kampen fund would yield 6.30 percent. But because the Nuveen fund sells for a 7 percent premium, its real yield is only 6.29 percent, roughly the same as the level of a Van Kampen fund. **********Even with their higher annual costs, the Van Kampen funds confer an extra benefit: the new no-load funds are less vulnerable to market risks than funds that sell at premiums. Premiums can erode for many reasons, and it is simpler for fund sponsors to erase a discount than re-create a premium. **********For these reasons, both advisers recommend the new no-load funds, which Mr. Dent calls an \"attractive, innovative deal\" -- the flaw, if any, is the high administrative expense. **********Van Kampen Merritt is still offering shares in the California, Florida, New York and Ohio funds. The Pennsylvania and national funds are closed, although trading has not yet begun."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/21/business/managing-americans-aim-to-speak-in-many-other-tongues.html": {"writer_name": "Claudia Deutsch", "pub_date": "1991-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 882, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Managing; Americans Aim To Speak in Many Other Tongues", "print_headline": "Managing; Americans Aim To Speak in Many Other Tongues", "body_text": " **********Market research told the Ryko Manufacturing Company that selling its car wash equipment in France would be a breeze. But when it tried, potential buyers resisted mightily -- and for a good reason. Ryko's instruction manuals were in English, a language that few car wash operators could read. **********So Ryko translated its manual into French, and 1991 sales took off. \"Operating in local languages has become a necessary part of competing overseas,\" said Barbara Wilson, international administrative assistant for the Grimes, Iowa, company. **********No one has hard numbers to prove it, but language experts insist that more American companies are reaching that conclusion. \"The demand may not be a gusher yet, but it is a lot steadier than a trickle or a drip,\" said Bernard Bierman, editor of Translation News, an industry newsletter. **********All of this is wonderful news for the 4,500 members of the American Translators Association, as well as linguistically talented students who may want to join the profession. **********\"Our graduates no longer have to go to Europe to find good jobs,\" said Margarita B. Bowen, head of the division of interpretation and translation at Georgetown University's School of Languages and Linguistics. **********Peter Priest, who heads a Russian translation program for engineering students at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind., has noticed that \"Corporate recruiters who used to only care about our students' engineering skills increasingly ask about their translation abilities.\" **********There are many reasons for the upsurge: *********** More strategic alliances with foreign companies. \"American companies do not want a foreign partner's translation of a contract to be the operating document,\" said Marilyn Miller, president of Language Services International, a Des Moines translation agency whose volume of corporate assignments has doubled annually for three years. *********** The opening up of Eastern Europe to foreign commerce. \"Eastern Europeans have no point of reference for phrases like 'stock exchange' or 'leveraged buyout,' so the translations have to be done here,\" said Ronald J. Patten, dean of DePaul University's College of Commerce. *********** More innovation, particularly in pharmaceuticals. \"Intensified competition has yielded more research, more patents, and more multinational lawsuits -- all of which means more translations,\" said Peter C. Richardson, general patent counsel of Pfizer Inc. Anne Saxon, a New York interpreter of Italian, adds that pharmaceutical companies are holding more international teleconferences, requiring oral interpretations of speakers. *********** The increased flow of immigrants and tourists to the United States. Spanish-language translators report more assignments to translate textbooks, bill inserts, advertising and other material from English into Spanish, for the benefit of the rapidly growing Hispanic population. American hotels, travel agents and restaurants are translating brochures, menus and such from English into Japanese, German and other languages spoken in thriving economies. *********** Increased clamor from overseas distributors of American products for materials in their own languages. Amana Refrigeration Inc., for one, just translated user manuals for its major appliances into Greek and Hebrew, at the request of distributors in Greece and Israel. It is now doing one in Portugese, for its distributor in Portugal. \"They say they can sell our product more readily if we stop assuming that everyone speaks English,\" said Brian K. Parrott, who supervises the production of Amana's customer literature. **********Fisher Controls, the instrumentation subsidiary of the Monsanto Company, even wants to match dialects. For its European customers, it has customer training guides in French, Spanish and Portugese. Now it is tailoring those guides to match the way Spanish and Portugese are spoken, respectively, in Columbia and Brazil. \"We want to accommodate any culture that uses our equipment,\" said Joseph M. Morris, a marketing manager in Fisher's education department. **********Of course, not all translations are done in the United States. Fisher, and other companies looking for local nuances, generally turn to translators in the country they have targeted. Companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange generally have their annual reports translated into Japanese in Tokyo. And companies often let their own overseas offices translate brochures. **********\"The products we sell overseas, we make overseas, so doing the translations here doesn't make sense,\" said John Cox, a senior vice president at Avon Products Inc. **********Maybe not -- but foreign translators can massacre idioms. One American company just asked Louis Korda, a Hungarian translator in New York, to retranslate several documents. \"They got nervous when the Hungarians translated 'blue chip company' as 'maker of blue chips,' \" Mr. Korda said. TRANSLATORS AND ANTITRUST **********Four years ago, the American Translators Association, rankled that its members often got paid just a few hundred dollars for translating complicated documents, began publishing annual guidelines for what translators should charge. **********The Federal Trade Commission was not amused. It is investigating whether the practice constitutes price-fixing. **********Frank Patton Jr., a New York lawyer representing the association, says that in January his client provided the F.T.C. with the documents it requested and has heard nothing further. But the group is taking no chances on an unfavorable ruling. It has adopted a \"specific and defined and tough policy to comply with antitrust requirements,\" Mr. Patton said.

The broadcasts are beamed into Iraq on four frequencies and, according to some Iraqi exiles, use transmitters in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Coupled with President Bush's call to the Iraqi people and army to force President Hussein to \"step aside,\" they may have encouraged the rebellion. **********But it is not known what percentage of the Iraqi population can receive radio broadcasts. Allied bombings knocked out much of the country's electricity, and because of the global embargo against Iraq, batteries have been scarce and expensive. In addition, the Voice of Free Iraq is only one of at least four opposition radio stations. **********The station announced its existence in a broadcast on Jan. 2, two weeks before the beginning of the war. **********\"It will be an information backup for the Iraqi people's struggle, whose nationalist forces are gathering today to exercise their role in deciding the fate of Iraq and liberating it from the dictatorial regime,\" the broadcast proclaimed. **********Iraqi exiles who have taken part in the broadcasts say the station operates under the authority of the Saudi intelligence services and is run by two Iraqi exiles who were once senior members of the governing Baath Party and close associates of Mr. Hussein.  Army Is the Primary Target **********One of the chief managers, Ibrahim al-Zubaidi, is the former director of the state-run Baghdad Radio. He lived in the United States for a number of years. Another manager, Salah Omar Ali al-Tikriti, was involved in the seizure of power in Iraq by the Baath Party in 1968 and played an important role in the public hangings of Jews and other Iraqis as spies in 1969. He served as Minister of Information and Culture and in the early 1980's was Iraq's chief delegate to the United Nations. **********A review of the broadcasts as recorded by the BBC indicates that the primary target is the army. **********In its first broadcast, for example, the radio praised Mr. Hussein's Minister of Defense, Gen. Saadi Tuma Abbas, as a \"successful military man, intelligent and educated, who appreciates the current military situation in the region.\" The broadcast called on General Tuma Abbas to curb \"the mad bull and take things in hand.\" Two weeks ago, Mr. Hussein named his son-in-law, Hussein Kamel al-Majid as Defense Minister, appointing General Tuma Abbbas as a military adviser. **********Only a few of the broadcasts speak about democracy, and none criticize the United States or the vast destruction caused by allied bombing. Rather, they call on Iraq's military to end the civil war by joining with the people to topple the Government. **********\"Sons of our Iraqi people, sons of our valiant army, officers and men wherever you may be in all sectors, champion your people's uprising,\" said a program on the day after the White House statement on noninterference. \"Back the will of the people to overthrow the Saddam regime. Slain Iraq will not come back to life except through the force of the army and the people.\" The broadcast continued, \"Stop the bloodshed of your people by staging an army uprising and toppling Saddam.\" **********On April 6, the radio said that the people looked to the army as the only structure that could unify them and lead them to victory. But some broadcasts directly called the Iraqi people to arms. In an effort to broaden the revolt beyond the Shiite Muslim areas of the south and the Kurdish north, for example, a commentary on April 6 called on \"brother Iraqis\" to liberate Baghdad.  C.I.A. Role Debated **********A commentary by Mr. Zubaidi on March 20 appeared to revel in the revolt, saying, \"The Iraqis have never felt such enthusiasm, joy and a desire to take part in the revolution or to be martyrs.\" **********The question of C.I.A. involvement has been debated by Iraqi opposition leaders. \"This is a C.I.A.-British-Saudi operation,\" said Talib al-Shibib, an opposition leader who was Foreign Minister of Iraq during the Baath Party Government that was briefly in power in 1963. \"I have met a lot of people who know about this, including C.I.A. people. They're my friends, and I have nothing against them.\" **********On the other hand, Saad al-Jabr, a London-based Iraqi exile leader, denied that the C.I.A. was involved. \"As far as I know, it is run 100 percent by the Iraqis,\" he said. \"It's paid for by the Saudis and other Arab states. To bring in the C.I.A. into everthing is unfair.\" **********The C.I.A. and the British Government have neither confirmed nor denied involvement, although both have experience in setting up clandestine radio stations around the world."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/11/world/after-the-war-for-kuwaitis-first-war-and-now-wheeze.html": {"writer_name": "Matthew Wald", "pub_date": "1991-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 859, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Kuwaitis, First War and Now Wheeze", "print_headline": "AFTER THE WAR; For Kuwaitis, First War and Now Wheeze", "body_text": " **********The weather forecast, as carried today by the Armed Forces Desert Network: smoky with a chance of thundershowers. **********This time the forecast was right, although predicting the smoke part was not much of a challenge.

Doctors are advising patients with asthma to leave the country, because the smoke is setting off their attacks, and increasing the likelihood that a trip to a hospital emergency room will mean a stay. Wondering About Risks **********But that is no escape, because the air in the hospital is really no better, said Dr. Shafika al-Awadi of the Amiri Hospital. It simply means \"we put them in a place where they can't run around, going inside and outside,\" she said. **********It is hard to judge how many people face an acute risk. There are fewer people living here than there were before the war, and thus fewer asthmatics as well. **********At the Chest Disease Hospital, Kuwait's only specialized hospital for respiratory diseases, the 300 beds in use before the war have been reduced to 80, and on Monday only 12 were in use for respiratory problems. Of those, 6 had cancer and 6 had problems unrelated to the smoke, according to the physician in charge. But on bad days, 4 or 5 people come in. **********And everyone, from doctors to soldiers to oilfield workers, wonders about the longer-term risks. **********There are more pressing risks. Some hospitals have running water only part of the day, and the Chest Disease Hospital got electrical power back only last week. Most hospitals relied heavily on nurses from Egypt, the Philippines and other distant places, and many have returned home. So have many doctors.  'It Can't Be Good for You' **********But despite those problems, the smoke is on everyone's mind -- not to mention everyone's car, clothes and hair. It is also in everyone's nose. **********\"It can't be good for you,\" said Billy Ray Patterson, a drilling superintendent with the Kuwait Oil Company. He left his wife and 12-year-old son in his native New Mexico, which they were visiting on the day the Iraqis invaded, and now he sees no point in exposing them. He is suffering from a sore throat, as is virtually the entire country, and waiting for his shift of 40 working days to end. **********\"We've all got raw throats,\" said Barry Collins, an American supervisor of Dowell Schlumberger, a French company helping to plug wells. \"We've warned the company not to be bringing in anybody with respiratory problems -- we could be facing litigation.\" **********Soldiers from an Army Signal Corps unit stationed near the Iraqi border said that sometimes the smoke was so bad that they quit their volleyball games and sealed themselves in their tents or in air-conditioned shelters. **********\"We talk about it, but there's nothing we can do,\" said Staff Sgt. Jesus Pardo, who is from Sacramento, Calif. **********Sgt. Jonny Campbell of San Francisco said, \"Maybe in 10 or 20 years they'll give us compensation pay, like the Agent Orange people.\" **********Warrant Officer John H. Smith of the 301st Support Group, a retired New York City detective, said that he had never seen air pollution like this, and that his unit moved north from its camp near the port of Shuwaiba to get away from the smoke. **********The smoke had a psychological effect, he said. After his unit crossed the Saudi border at Khafji, his group did not see daylight for two days, and now at night, he said, when a soldier leaves his tent \"you walk into a cloud of smoke.\" **********Ordinary Kuwaitis also describe a psychological effect. Ahmed al-Yaquob, a producer with the state radio network, said that each time he smelled the oil he was reminded of his country's wealth being burned. **********Officially, the Army has no warning or advice for its personnel in the smoke; the spokesman at Camp Freedom, a post south of Kuwait City and near the Ahmadi field, said the issue had not been mentioned in the daily high-level meetings of officers. **********Civilian doctors do not have much advice, either, other than to leave, and they are worried. **********\"It's really unhealthy,\" said Dr. Yousef Mustafa of the Chest Disease Hospital. \"Even healthy people are suffering when the smoke blows to our side.\" **********The clinical definition of chronic bronchitis, he said, includes symptoms like a sore throat and coughing for three months a year for two or three years. The air could be bad that long, and so by definition, most of the country would have chronic bronchitis, he said. **********Wearing a mask might help a little, he said, but \"you'd have to wear it 24 hours a day for 2 years.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/01/business/seagram-is-selling-7-liquor-brands.html": {"writer_name": "Eben Shapiro", "pub_date": "1991-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 541, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seagram Is Selling 7 Liquor Brands", "print_headline": "Seagram Is Selling 7 Liquor Brands", "body_text": " **********The Seagram Company yesterday agreed to sell a group of well-known liquors to American Brands Inc., a diversified company and the maker of Jim Beam bourbon, for $372.5 million. **********Analysts said the deal signaled a move by Seagram to build a war chest for an acquisition.

But already the focus of attention seemed to be shifting to the political and diplomatic challenges ahead. **********\"If we cannot win the peace, our military victory could turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory,\" the Italian Foreign Minister, Gianni De Michelis, said today. \"Winning the peace will be much more difficult than winning the military conflict.\" **********In London today, there were no victory parades or pealing church bells, but British political leaders in the House of Commons paid tribute to President Bush and their own and allied forces for their swift success. **********\"The victories of peace will take longer than the battles of war,\" Prime Minister John Major said in the House of Commons. Regional security, he said, \"must also deal with the other problems of the region, above all, that of the Palestinians.\" **********Britain and France feel confident that their participation in the war has already earned them places at future negotiating tables. But Germany, Italy, Spain and other European Community nations are also claiming a role in promoting security, stability and development in the postwar Arab world. France Takes 'No Orders' **********Signaling France's intention to play an active role after the war, President Francois Mitterrand said last weekend, \"We will spell out the objectives that we consider just, and no one will give us orders.\" France will demonstrate, he added, that \"it has not gone to war against Islam or Arabs.\" **********Today, the European Community promised \"a global approach\" to the problems of the Middle East, a phrase that Community foreign ministers defined last week as dealing with the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Palestinian question and the Lebanese crisis as well as the aftermath of the gulf war. **********Driving the diplomacy is acute awareness that Europe's historical, cultural and geographical links to the Arab world make its interests different from those of the United States. It therefore hopes to insure that Washington is not alone in determining the future of the region. **********It also wants to protect European companies that have long done good business in the Middle East. The only recent sign of disharmony between London and Washington came last week when Britain complained that most contracts for the reconstruction of Kuwait were going to American companies. **********In the months leading up to the war, though, the 12 showed anything but unity. Unable to agree on a joint response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Britain strongly backed the United States, France offered its own peace plans and other nations refused to send ground troops to Saudi Arabia. Regional Bloc Frays **********Yet now that the fighting is over, the cohesion of the anti-Iraq coalition may again be tested by differences within Europe as well as by competition between Europe and the United States. Indeed, in recent weeks European governments have acted more individually than as a regional bloc. **********Britain, for instance, has strong historical and economic ties to Kuwait and the gulf emirates and seems most interested in helping to build a security system in the region, albeit without direct participation of British ground troops. In this, its position is almost identical to Washington's. **********For Bonn, the war has been a diplomatic disaster, as Germany was criticized for its reluctance to help the allies and embarrassed by revelations that German companies developed Iraq's chemical weapons capacity. Earlier this month, it sent Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher to Israel and then to Jordan, Egypt and Syria in the hope of patching up ties. **********France, Spain and Italy, which have large populations of North African immigrants, are most alarmed by the deterioration of their relations with Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, where pro-Iraqi sentiments were running strong. \"We must avoid hurting Arab public opinion that felt solidarity with Iraq,\" a French politician said today. **********Paris, Madrid and Rome also believe that the bitter legacy of Iraq's defeat can be buried in these and other Arab countries only if the Palestinian problem is addressed. But they recognize that only Washington can persuade Israel to take part in an international conference that tackles this question. **********European governments do at least agree that the Palestine Liberation Organization has destroyed its credibility by supporting Iraq in the war. \"The question of the P.L.O. will have to be looked at differently in the light of many of its reactions in recent weeks,\" Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/30/business/money-fund-assets-off.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Money Fund Assets Off", "print_headline": "Money Fund Assets Off", "body_text": " **********The assets of the nation's 560 money market mutual funds decreased by $3.4 billion, to $463.23 billion, in the week that ended on Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday.

Yeltsin, the republic's leader, under pressure from neighboring republics to hold off on his reform plans, said after a Kremlin meeting that there would be no delay in the timetable to begin freeing prices on most foods and consumer goods in 10 days. **********\"Liberalization of prices will start on Dec. 16,\" Mr. Yeltsin told the Soviet press agency Tass. **********A value-added tax is levied at various stages in the production and sale of a product, putting the burden on businesses to report their full dealings more honestly in order to realize Government rebates. Maintaining Finances **********The tax was chosen as the best way to maintain essential Government finances as prices rise rapidly under the reform program. An income tax would miss the considerable business activities of the black market, and would also be largely irrelevant in the republic's low-wage environment, said finance officials who added that a sales tax, in turn, would be too easily avoidable through off-the-books dealings. **********Tass said six other republics had reacted to Russia's decision by agreeing on plans to begin setting higher limits on certain controlled prices by Jan. 1. Their agreement, Tass said, was made in the hope of absorbing some of the effects of the Russian changes and as a preliminary move in ultimately freeing their own prices. **********Tass identified the six as Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Tadzhikistan, Kirghizia and Georgia. But no independent confirmation of this was immediately available, particularly from Ukraine, the republic second in size and economic power to Russia. **********Ukraine sealed its own fervid independence path in a referendum last Sunday and has thus far made a point of avoiding most joint economic operations with other republics. Ukraine finance officials, however, have been most concerned with the aftershocks of Russia's ambitious reform plan and have talked lately of trying to tailor Ukraine's accordingly.  Yeltsin's Forecast **********\"In December, Russia faces historic events, the transition to a market economy with all the consequences -- privatization, issuing of shares, changes in taxation and the financial system, liberalization of foreign economic activity and of prices,\" Tass quoted Mr. Yeltsin as saying. **********Prices have already been shooting upward and consumer goods have become scarcer in anticipation of the Russian reform program. The flow of food supplies into this hard-pressed capital has been severely worsening in the last three weeks and heightening panic buying, say city officials who varied considerably in their estimates of how severe a winter Moscow faces. **********The office of Mayor Gavriil K. Popov insists that while supply lines are increasingly destabilized with the collapse of the Soviet Union's interrepublic structure, the city is certain of enough basics to avoid hunger and manage another bad winter. **********However, Deputy Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, the executive charged with overseeing food supplies, has lately begun issuing more alarming warnings, saying the consumer market was \"on the verge of catastrophe.\" It was Mr. Luzhkov's direct appeal to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that caused the Soviet leader to issue his own sudden appeal Thursday to the rest of the country to help with a \"critical situation.\" Mr. Gorbachev followed up with a message today to Ukraine, Byelorussia, Kazakhstan and Moldavia, all important agricultural areas, saying current reserves of meat, butter and sugar might last only a few more days in the capital. Supplies at State Stores **********His estimates, based on what city officials told him, referred to the situation at state stores, where most people shop. Prices are theoretically low there, but such basic consumer goods have been in rare supply in state shops for months. They have been available, however, in the parallel open-priced markets at costs that have begun rising rapidly in the last several weeks in anticipation of Government price reforms that will end most state price subsidies. **********Mr. Luzhkov estimated that the supply crisis could come to a head in 10 to 15 days if emergency relief was not obtained. But Mayor Popov's office said the city's previous precautions were bearing enough results to protect the city's population of nine million. **********In the most basic measure of the situation, bread, panic buying was occurring at some neighborhood bakeries, even though the city already has enough flour in its storehouses to produce the usual supply through the winter and up to next year's wheat harvest, said Sergei K. Stupar, a spokesman for Mayor Popov. **********But in a whole range of other foods, including meat and dairy products, the city's supplies have waned steadily all year with each new worsening of the union's political and economic crisis, Mr. Stupar said. The city normally consumes 2,000 tons of meat a day, for example, and already is cumulatively short by a total of 60 days' need, which Moscow shoppers have felt and been adjusting to for months. **********\"Our normal suppliers are holding on to their produce for themselves or are waiting for prices to rise,\" Mr. Stupar said. \"And that situation is growing worse, in turn, because people are panicking.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/05/world/war-in-the-gulf-war-summary.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 350, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "War Summary", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF; War Summary", "body_text": " **********\"BIG MO\" GOES TO WAR, AGAIN  For the first time since the Korean War, the battleship Missouri fired its 16-inch guns in combat.

Principles of Law **********But some civil liberties experts say the proposal would violate fundamental principles of American law: that the Government's evidence against a person must be public, and that the accused has a right to be informed of that evidence and rebut it. **********The provision has been largely overlooked until now in the public debate over the anticrime bill but is drawing increasing fire from civil libertarians as the larger measure nears Senate consideration in June. **********A similar proposal was offered several years ago by Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. It was subsequently incorporated into anticrime legislation put forth by the Reagan Administration, but that bill was never passed. The greatest support for the idea now appears to be coming from within the Justice Department. **********No Congressional hearings have yet been held on the proposal. But aides on Capitol Hill said it was likely to encounter strong opposition on civil liberties grounds, although they acknowledged that heightened anxiety over terrorism in the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis might lend it added support.  'No Secret Courts' **********Representative Don Edwards, a California Democrat who heads a House civil rights subcommittee, predicted that most Democrats on the panel would oppose the provision. \"We need no secret courts in America,\" he said. \"There are other ways of handling problems like they seem to fear. There's a Kafkaesque tinge to all of this.\" **********The Supreme Court has long held that aliens living in the United States who face deportation are entitled to constitutional protections, including a public hearing in which the Government is not entitled to keep evidence against them a secret. **********Existing immigration law does permit the Government to prevent a foreigner from entering the United States on the basis of evidence that can be withheld from that person. The Administration's proposal now seeks to apply similar procedures to foreigners already living in the United States. **********\"We're faced with the dilemma of either declassifying information we have about an alien, and compromising our intelligence-gathering methods and endangering human sources, or we have to allow an alien who we know is providing material support to a terrorist group to remain in this country,\" said Steven R. Valentine, a deputy assistant attorney general who oversees the Justice Department's immigration litigation office. **********The special proceedings could be initiated by the Justice Department against any alien who had \"engaged in terrorist activities,\" as defined by the Immigration Act of 1990. Under that law, terrorism includes support activities like fund-raising and recruiting members for a terrorist group. **********As a result, the Government could seek the deportation of a person who raised money for the African National Congress, for example, or anti-Government forces in El Salvador, said David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor who works for the Center for Constitutional Rights and who opposes the proposal.  Groups Under Scrutiny **********\"The Government will obviously be very political about who would be considered a terrorist,\" said Mr. Cole. \"Groups that will be targeted will be those that the Administration doesn't approve of politically.\" **********But Mr. Valentine said that the procedure \"would not be invoked lightly\" and suggested that it would be applied in relatively few cases. At present the Government, using ordinary deportation procedures, is seeking the removal of two aliens for associating with a terrorist group, he said.  Both are Palestinians living in Calfornia. **********Here is how the proposal would work, according to both civil liberties lawyers and Justice Department officials: **********The proceeding would begin with the Government's request for a secret hearing before one of five Federal judges who would be designated by the Chief Justice of the United States. With the filing of such a request, which would itself be secret, the Government could arrest and jail an alien under scrutiny. **********If the judge determined that there was probable cause to believe that the alien had engaged in terrorist activities, and that disclosure of the evidence would jeopardize national security, the judge could order the special trial, called a \"special removal hearing.\" **********The judge would be required to decide what, if any, information about the charges could be disclosed. The accused would be given a written summary outlining the general nature of the Government's evidence or a statement that no summary could be made public. **********The removal hearing would be held in public. But the evidence on which the Government's charges were based could be withheld from the accused, and prosecutors could present their evidence to the judge in private, without the accused or defense lawyers present. **********Upon determining that an alien had engaged in terrorist activity, the judge would have to write an opinion to that effect. But those parts of the opinion that related to secret evidence could be withheld from public disclosure. The alien could appeal the decision of the judge, but would still have no access to any evidence presented in secret. **********A person who is ordered deported as a result of such a hearing could be held in jail for as long as it takes the Government to find a country willing to accept him."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/24/business/making-a-difference-end-of-an-era-at-kimberly.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1991-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 354, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Making a Difference; End of an Era at Kimberly", "print_headline": "Making a Difference; End of an Era at Kimberly", "body_text": " **********When Darwin E.

He used cash raised from auctioning paper mills and forest lands, narrowing the Dallas-based company's reliance on commodity products. **********Initially with the Kimbies brand and, since 1978, with Huggies, Mr. Smith gradually wrestled the lead in diaper sales from the giant of consumer marketing, the Procter & Gamble Company. Huggies, with 32 percent of the United States diaper market last year compared with 11 percent in 1980, contributed nearly one-fourth of Kimberly-Clark's 1990 sales of $6.4 billion.

The version of the bill that the Senate is planning to take up this week does not have the same provision. **********But the Senate version would repeal a law concerning who may own power plants, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and many other participants in the electric market are demanding access to transmission in exchange for the repeal. **********Taken together, these legislative proposals would vastly extend the deregulation of the utilities that Congress started in 1978, opening the transmission system and freeing participants to build power plants. **********\"A key to whether there is any real competition at all is transmission,\" said Larry Hobart, the executive director of the American Public Power Association, many of whose members are small utilities that serve commercial and residential customers with power they buy from larger utilities. \"If you have an independent power producer, that's like a dot inside a circle that is the service territory of an investor-owned utility. We're another dot, outside the circle. Unless you can tie them together with a transmission line, it's of no use to us.\" **********The producers also seek more competition, arguing that they must be freed from \"monopsony,\" a variation of monopoly in which there are many sellers but only one buyer. Under the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978, independent producers now sell to the utility in whose territory they are situated at \"avoided cost\" -- the price that the utility would have to have paid to make the power for itself. Many independent producers think they could do better if they could offer their product more widely. 'Just Like the Phone System' **********The utilities argue that their control of the transmission system is essential to the stability of electric supply. At the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of investor-owned utilities, Mary Kenkel, a spokeswoman, said the demand to open the transmission system came from \"a bunch of people wanting to take something without paying for it.\" **********Many investor-owned utilities see no advantage to a proliferation of independent producers, because no one can build power plants more cheaply than they can. But some utilities would like to see more such plants, because they themselves would like to build them, either inside their territories or far afield. That group of utilities is also seeking repeal of the holding company act, which puts onerous regulation on utilities doing business in more than one state. **********Experts say that opening the transmission system would remove a large part of the monopoly power of utilities, turning transmission lines, now private property, into something akin to common carriers. If the market were thrown open to competitors, the amount of power traded that way might be small, but it would go far toward determining electric prices for everyone. When President Bush proposed the National Energy Strategy earlier this year he called for such open access, and there is substantial support in Congress. **********\"It's got to be opened up, just like the phone system,\" said Senator Timothy E. Wirth, a Colorado Democrat. Giving small producers and small utilities more access to transmission would mean big improvements in competition and efficiency, he said. **********In a possible model for opening the transmission system, in two recent cases courts or regulators have required open access as a condition of utility mergers. **********Lurking behind both the holding company act, which the Senate bill would repeal, and the transmission access issue is the question of whether the utilities' three traditional roles -- as generators, transmitters and distributors of power -- should be split up. **********Independent producers say access will create competition that lowers price for everyone. Traditional utilities say that with access, independent producers can go \"cherry picking,\" stealing away the best customers, like major industrial plants, and leaving the utilities with generating stations with no one to serve, creating \"stranded investments.\" **********The cost of those plants will have to be spread among small consumers, they say, who will be captive and heavily saddled. \"You've built to satisfy all customers equally, and now these customers can go elsewhere, so who pays for all that investment?\" said Dick Disbrow, the chairman of American Electric Power, a Midwest holding company. If the cost of idle plants is spread among the remaining customers, he said, the price that the traditional utility must charge will rise further, creating an even bigger cost differential. The Issue of Priority **********On the other hand, the Public Service Company of Indiana favors transmission access and has proposed opening its system in exchange for the right to sell its surplus power elsewhere at whatever price it can get. **********\"Injecting competition into regulated industries is good public policy,\" said James E. Rogers Jr., the company's chief executive, in a speech in Chicago earlier this year. **********In between is the position taken by a coalition of 17 large public power agencies, led by Richard M. Flynn, the chairman of the New York Power Authority. In this hybrid, small producers would negotiate for access, and impasses would be resolved by binding arbitration. **********\"The maximum savings from competitive bidding won't flow to consumers unless all potential power suppliers have a fair shot at the transmission system,\" Mr. Flynn said. **********Among the thorny issues is who should have priority on the system. Should it be the third-party buyer and seller, who want round-the-clock access, or the existing utility customers, who use the system far less but save money doing it? 'Economy Transfers' **********Utilities currently use their lines for unscheduled \"economy transfers,\" so that if one company has a plant that can produce power for 2 cents a kilowatt-hour but is idle and a neighboring utility is running a plant at a cost of 4 cents a kilowatt-hour, the second utility will shut its plant and buy from the first at a cost of 3 cents a kilowatt-hour. The volume of such transfers increased nearly 20-fold between 1960 and 1985, when a huge difference existed between the fuel costs of oil and coal. **********Costs have narrowed somewhat since then, but transfers still save consumers $18 billion a year, the investor-owned utilities stress. **********The system was paid for by those customers through their monthly bills, the investor-owned utilities point out. At the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners in Washington, Michael Foley, an electricity specialist, said, \"Given the fact that they paid for that hardware, shouldn't they get first dibs on any of the power?\" **********The Edison Electric Institute casts it in a somewhat grimmer light. \"If access to the system is mandated for a few special interests, the benefits now accruing to the majority of a utility's customers may be compromised,\" it said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/07/world/3-in-coup-feared-us-dependency.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1991-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 351, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 IN COUP FEARED U.S. DEPENDENCY", "print_headline": "3 IN COUP FEARED U.S. DEPENDENCY", "body_text": " **********Plotters who tried to overthrow President Mikhail S.

But outside experts were not certain whether this was a symptom of the continuing decline in production in the Soviet Union, which is the world's largest producer, or part of an internal power struggle or the restructuring of the Soviet economy. **********The announcement, the kind of news that the market has been more or less anticipating for two years, pushed crude prices up 60 cents a barrel early in the day on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but prices declined later, with oil for December delivery closing at $22.79, up 27 cents on the day. **********\"Clearly it is a major source of concern going into the winter,\" said Nauman Barakat, an oil expert at Merrill Lynch. But he said that while exports might fall, \"they won't entirely suspend them, because of their desperate need for foreign exchange.\" **********While the price move yesterday was not large, it was a reverse in direction, pointed out Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroleum Finance Corporation, a consulting firm in Washington. Oil prices are down $1.50 from recent highs, and the price would have gone down yesterday but for the Soviet announcement, he said. \"The market is terribly oversupplied,\" he said. \"There's far too much crude; we're swimming in it.\" **********Several analysts said that while the announcement could be a symptom of declining production, it might also reflect a general loss of control in the Soviet economy. Thane Gustafson of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Cambridge, Mass., said Soviet refineries were making private deals with foreign companies, and so were some production units, so that crude oil and refined products were flowing out of the country in an unaccustomed way. **********In addition, he pointed out, control over export licenses is now being transferred from the central Government to the republics. The Russian republic may have decided to block some exports until it can figure out what is going on, he said. **********Mr. Zanoyan said that oil was trading within the Soviet Union at about 70 rubles a ton, but that with rubles selling on the street for 110 to the dollar, the world price is about 9,000 rubles a ton, creating great inducement for producers and refiners to export. **********George Friesen of Deutsche Bank Group in New York said it would take a severe drop in Soviet production to create problems on world markets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/28/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-brand-officer-quits-burger-king.html": {"writer_name": "Kim Foltz", "pub_date": "1991-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 192, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brand Officer Quits Burger King", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Brand Officer Quits Burger King", "body_text": " **********Gary L.

Smith, who also did not return them. **********Several associates and customers of Mr. Smith's firm, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that firm officials had told them that Mr. Smith was seeking to sell the broker-dealer that he started in 1985 to an employee group to minimize charges of conflicts of interest between trading for himself and for customers. **********Regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission are known to have made recent inquiries into some of R. D. Smith's practices, as well as those of other distressed investors, and some of the firm's customers have complained that the firm puts Mr. Smith's interests ahead of their own. Many have taken their business elsewhere, and as a result, R. D. Smith and its affiliates have been laying off many of their analysts and salespeople. **********By separating the broker-dealer from Mr. Smith's other affiliates, the trader appears to be putting some distance between himself and the part of his empire that is watched most closely by regulators. **********Still, some customers and competitors noted that a Smith family member would continue to own a minority interest in the brokerage, and that John Adams, Mr. Smith's former tax lawyer and one of his closest confidants, would be the co-head of the brokerage firm with Carl W.

In fact, when he unveiled his plan for Allied-Signal last Wednesday, the shares jumped even more dramatically, even though the plan included a sharp cut in dividends, to 25 cents a quarter from 45 cents. **********The plan involved some extremely painful steps for the company: a 14 percent reduction in managerial staff, a 24 percent cut in proposed capital spending, the sale of numerous smaller businesses, a smattering of plant closings and consolidations, and warnings that some high-profile product lines like anti-lock brake systems might be dropped unless profits picked up in a year. But what really impressed analysts was how detailed a program Mr. Bossidy had been able to present in just 90 days. **********Mr. Bossidy said that he was confident the plan was realistic because it had been developed and accepted by the company's top management, in Morris Township, N.J., rather than imposed by him. **********Immediately after presenting the plan to analysts in New York, Mr. Bossidy flew to Los Angeles as part of a taxing schedule of discussions with groups of employees. \"I've got a lot of preaching to do,\" he said before leaving. \"Not everyone in the company thinks this is great.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/29/business/greenspan-sees-turn-for-worse.html": {"writer_name": "David Rosenbaum", "pub_date": "1991-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 659, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Greenspan Sees Turn For Worse", "print_headline": "Greenspan Sees Turn For Worse", "body_text": " **********In his gloomiest assessment since last winter, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said today that the national economy had taken a turn for the worse. **********The economy is still growing slightly, Mr. Greenspan told a group of business executives in Providence, R.I., but \"in recent weeks, it's turned demonstrably sluggish.\" **********Early news service reports characterized Mr. Greenspan's speech as even more pessimistic than it was, and traders in the stock and bond markets took the remarks to mean the Fed would act soon to lower interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 40.70, to 3,045.62, and prices of Treasury notes and bonds rose.  [ Pages D10 and D22. ] No Indication on Rates **********Mr. Greenspan, however, gave no indication even indirectly of what his intentions might be on interest rates. He has recently been under increasing pressure from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and others in the Administration to drive rates lower. The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Fed, meets next on Nov. 5. **********In July, when he gave Congress his official midyear review of the state of the economy, Mr. Greenspan proclaimed the recession over, reported signs that inflation was slowing, predicted progress on the Federal budget deficit and was otherwise remarkably optimistic. **********Today's speech, which he delivered from notes, had a much different tone. The \"signs of spark\" that could be observed in the economy in the spring and early summer, Mr. Greenspan said, were no longer apparent. 'Credit Crunch' Cited **********In addition to not tipping his hand on interest rates, Mr. Greenspan did not say whether other steps should be taken to lift the economy. Many lawmakers of both parties have offered tax-cut proposals in recent days, saying that a cut was necessary to generate a surge in the economy. **********Mr. Greenspan referred often today to what he called a \"credit crunch\" and suggested that it was now the main factor dragging the economy down. \"The economy is moving forward, but in the face of a 50-mile-an-hour head wind,\" he declared. **********When bank lending is tight, the growth in the nation's money supply is inhibited, and that inhibition acts as a drain on the economy. **********The Federal Reserve has been pushing interest rates down steadily, so that they are now at their lowest point since the 1970's. But since that decline has not led to more bank lending, it has not caused the economy to grow as much as Mr. Greenspan and other officials hoped. **********Some Bush Administration officials have been arguing that the main cause of the credit restrictions is overly zealous restrictions placed by bank examiners. **********But Mr. Greenspan suggested that more important reasons were the reluctance of banks to lend freely when they have many bad loans already on their books and the disinclination of businesses to borrow money in the face of a weak economy. Focus on Credit **********Most of Mr. Greenspan's speech today was devoted to the credit situation, a problem that is especially severe in New England. Mr. Greenspan implied, although he did not say so directly, that he was not sure whether the inability of creditworthy customers to find loans was a short-term or a long-term phenomenon. **********The problem had its roots, he said, in the tax law of 1981, which allowed generous new tax breaks for real estate construction. Many parts of the country experienced a significiant overbuilding of commercial real estate, and banks found that their loans for these buildings were not repaid. **********\"We just overbuilt to a point that is quite incredible,\" he said. **********Eventually, Mr. Greenspan said, credit will once again become more available. He said that availability would begin when banks see that they have fewer nonperforming loans in their portfolios. Banks will then realize that unless they lend more aggressively, they will lose their share of the market to competitors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/13/world/alberta-and-california-at-odds-on-natural-gas.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1991-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 699, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Alberta and California at Odds on Natural Gas", "print_headline": "Alberta and California at Odds on Natural Gas", "body_text": " **********A natural-gas war has broken out between Alberta and California, which could undermine some of the energy trade gains made by Canada and the United States under their epochal free-trade agreement. **********A United States official said energy officials of the two Governments had held \"frank and open\" discussions about the conflict in Ottawa last Thursday and Friday under a special free-trade consultative mechanism. **********[ The matter -- considered one of the most divisive on the trade front since the pact went into effect on Jan. 1, 1989 -- stepped up to a higher level on Dec. 10, when Canada's Energy Minister, Jake Epp, took up the issue in a meeting with the United States Ambassador, Edward Ney. ] **********The hostilities arose from a decision in November by the California Public Utilities Commission to break a 30-year-old supply arrangement between Alberta's gas producers and their principal customer in California, the San Francisco-based Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The utility, in turn, resells the gas to seven million users in Northern California. **********A Pacific Gas and Electric subsidiary in Calgary pools the gas from 190 Alberta producers, including such international companies as Amoco and Shell Oil, that have entered into long-term contracts covering supplies beyond the year 2000. The gas is then shipped to California over a pipeline owned by P.G.& E. **********The commission says the long-term supply contracts -- especially in the current period, when both Canada and the United States have excess supplies of gas -- keep prices too high and penalize users, including hospitals, nursing homes and schools. **********The California commission ordered that the pipeline be open by November 1992 to any group that wants to buy gas directly from any Canadian producer. With buyers able to shop Alberta for the best buy, the lower imported gas prices could put price pressure on American producers as well. **********\"We've been trying to open up and unbundle the gas market for years,\" the Public Utilities Commission's president, Patricia M. Eckert, said in a telephone interview from San Francisco. \"We want our end users to be able to cut the best deal. We want the least expensive gas for California.\" **********Californians are now paying up to 33 percent more for their gas than consumers in Alberta. A consumer agency in the California commission has charged that P.G.& E. owes consumers $390 million because it sold them Alberta gas at above spot-market prices in the last three years. **********But the Alberta producers counter that the contracts were freely entered into as a way of providing secure supplies at times of shortage as well as excess, and that it is unthinkable for a state regulatory body to ask that they be revoked. **********\"If you have the potential for unilateral regulatory intervention in gas pricing, how safe do you feel investing a few million dollars in a pipeline?\" said Ian Smyth, president of the Canadian Petroleum Association. \"We have to send the message that we are deadly serious, and that's what we're doing.\" **********To the cheers of the industry, Canada's provincial and federal authorities have now challenged the Calfornia order. They said they would refuse to give gas removal permits for any sales to California that would displace any of the fuel being shipped under the long-term contracts. **********It was considered a modulated response that permits the Canadians to press for enforcement of the contracts without raising the possibility of re-regulating the industry, which won market freedom on both sides of the border with the free-trade agreement. **********But the owner of one gas company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said in an interview: \"Contract sanctity is the basis for all civilized business dealings. Do away with that, and you're back to the jungle.\" **********Ever since oil and gas were discovered here after World War II, much of the energy has been sold to the United States.

One carried by Iran's official press agency said that later this week, Israel might free a Shiite Muslim cleric who has been a pivotal captive for the last two years. **********Officials here refused to talk publicly about the possible solutions that could end the hostage ordeal, and a senior Foreign Ministry official closely involved in the discussions, Yohanan Bein, said the Iranian report \"doesn't make very much sense.\"  Two-Phase Process Described **********While Israeli officials declined to discuss the specifics of a possible deal, newspapers and Israel radio today outlined a two-stage plan that is supposedly being considered. **********Under it, Israel would first commit itself formally to releasing prisoners in return for word on seven Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon. The second stage would involve a full exchange of captives -- Arab prisoners under Israeli control, surviving Israeli soldiers and the Western hostages, five of them Americans. **********The fact that Israeli officials were tight-lipped suggested that negotiations had reached a critical stage. Several officials acknowledged that they were reluctant to say much in public out of fear that a single slip could blow apart delicate arrangements. White House officials said they, too, were trying to avoid stirring the waters at this point.  Solution Serves Many Interests **********Mr. Bein said the situation \"looks quite hopeful\" and he added that the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, \"believes a solution is at hand, most probably because the countries that are responsible for a solution want it.\" **********The Israeli Defense Minister, Moshe Arens, said that the willingness expressed by the hostage takers to talk and the Secretary General's personal involvement \"allow an opening for hope.\" **********For his part, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who has become the middleman in the hostaging bargaining, said in Geneva that he now sees a basis for a broad exchange of captives. The various sides were \"not that far apart,\" he said, adding: \"It is not an ocean. I would say a river.\" **********Israeli negotiators, led by a veteran diplomat and trouble-shooter, Uri Lubrani, prepared to leave for Geneva on Wednesday to meet a second time this week with the Secretary General, who has also had talks there with a senior Iranian diplomat. **********It seemed clear that broad arrangements for any bargain would have Israel release about 375 Arab prisoners under its control while Islamic groups give back the Western hostages and the Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon for many years. Some of the Israeli soldiers are assumed to be dead, and Israel wants their remains returned. **********An important question is whether this sort of plan would satisfy the kidnappers. One group holding several hostages, Islamic Holy War, sent a letter to Mr. Perez de Cuellar demanding the release of \"fighters\" held by Israel and by European countries. These include convicted killers and hijackers, and some of the European Governments are hardly eager to free them. **********To its discomfort, even resentment, Israel has found itself thrust into a central role in the crisis.  A Central Figure **********It has been asked by British leaders and other Westerners to offer a good-will gesture to the hostage-holders in Lebanon by letting some of its Arab prisoners go. **********High on most lists is the Shiite cleric, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, at the time of his abduction believed to be the Party of God's representative in southern Lebanon, who Israelis admit was taken by its soldiers from his home in Lebanon to serve as a bargaining chip in a situation like this. **********Nonetheless, Israel feels that the spotlight is focused on it unfairly -- obscuring, in its view, the fact that Syria and Iran are the Lebanese kidnappers' patrons and have shown through the release of three hostages in the last few days that they control events when they want to. **********Reflecting this attitude, Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee urged today that no Israeli good-will gesture be offered unless the the missing servicemen were made part of the bargain. 'Great Importance' **********That underlined the degree to which the fate of those men was the key to a settlement. **********\"If I could solve this problem, almost everything would be solved,\" Mr. Perez de Cuellar said, \"so I attach great, great importance to the whereabouts of the seven Israelis.\" **********News reports from Beirut today quoted officials of the Party of God, a pro-Iranian group of Muslim fundamentalists, as saying that they are holding two unnamed Israeli soldiers who have been missing in Lebanon since 1982. They would include those men in a comprehensive prisoner exchange, the officials reportedly said. **********A Palestinian faction, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said in Damascus that it was willing to turn over the body of an Israeli Druse soldier captured near Sidon, Lebanon, in 1983. The group asserted that the soldier, Sgt. Samir Assad, had been captured alive but was killed in an Israeli air attack. **********According to still another report here, the Party of God has said that it would let the International Committee of the Red Cross visit the Israeli soldiers in its custody if Israel would do the same for Sheik Obeid. Mixed Feelings in Israel **********Israeli officials say they have had \"no credible knowledge\" about what happened to their missing soldiers. Only one man, an air force navigator named Ron Arad, is believed with a high degree of probability to be alive. **********Israel's deep involvement in the crisis is laced with intricacies. Officials acknowledge that they worry about being accused of having torpedoed the hostage-release process should it break down. Such a development could have unwelcome repercussions for the regional peace conference that the United States is promoting. **********But pragmatic politics aside, the hostage crisis has given Israel a welcome chance to get back its missing soldiers or their remains, always a matter of abiding concern and emotion here. **********\"This country is mentally vulnerable to situations of missing soldiers, dead soldiers,\" an official said. \"When they get us on that, they get us where it hurts.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/19/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-kroger-assigns-more-regional.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1991-09-19", "snippet": "Two more portions of the Kroger Company's advertising account have been assigned to regional agencies, as the supermarket chain continues to divide its $20 million national advertising account into 10 regional accounts. \n\nThe account for Kroger's ...", "word_count": 257, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;\nKroger Assigns More Regional Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;\nKroger Assigns More Regional Accounts", "body_text": " **********Two more portions of the Kroger Company's advertising account have been assigned to regional agencies, as the supermarket chain continues to divide its $20 million national advertising account into 10 regional accounts. **********The account for Kroger's Columbus, Ohio, marketing area, which stretches from Toledo to Wheeling, W.

But some bankers and analysts said the guidelines would do little to help an economy hobbled more by a lack of loan demand than by an unwillingess of banks to lend. And others feared that yesterday's action could cause banks to make the kind of poor loans they did in the 1980's, which are causing problems today. More Scrutiny of Regulators **********This also comes as greater attention is being paid to the actions of regulators. On Wednesday, a Senate committee rejected Mr. Bush's attempt to reappoint Robert L. Clarke as Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator of some 4,000 nationally chartered banks, in part because Mr. Clarke was considered too lenient in the 1980's and was seen as having failed to head off a wave of bank failures. And it comes as Congress is considering a complex bill to overhaul the banking industry and mandate earlier regulatory intervention at troubled banks. **********\"All this stuff is pretty marginal as far as I'm concerned,\" said Robert E. Litan, a banking industry analyst at the Brookings Institution. \"I don't think the new regulations will do much to change things and the key thing is what message gets to the troops. In reality, examiners are probably totally perplexed. They've just seen their leader whipsawed in Congress and they know the climate on the Hill is to be tough rather than lenient. I think examiners are going to be very nervous about getting too liberal all of a sudden.\" **********The measure, however, was praised by representatives of the banking and real estate industry, but raised concerns among others who feared any relaxation in regulatory standards. The document, which will be distributed to bank presidents and examiners, was drafted by the Comptroller's office, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of Thrift Supervision. Last March, these agencies issued general guidelines and the document released yesterday provides specifics to guide examiners. **********\"A lot of this is common sense stuff,\" said Wendy B. Samuel, general counsel of the National Coucnil of Community Bankers. \"But I can't picture a lot of bankers immediately changing their lending practices. Bankers would love to make loans and are finding that the sort of loans they want to make are just not there.\" 'Constructive Approach' **********Steven A. Wechsler, president of the National Realty Committee, said the guidlines were a \"constructive approach to restoring regulatory balance to the system,\" while Robert H. Dugger, chief economist at the American Bankers Association, said the new guidelines \"will definitely help.\" **********But Herbert M. Sandler, chief executive of World Savings and Loan Association, one of the nation's largest, said \"I'm concerned that a message not be given to go back to the old practicies of the 1980's when people received credit for loans which should never have been made. Now we're saying, gee, we're wrong, let's go back and give these people credit.\" **********Among the specifics of the guidelines are details about when real estate loans should be classifed as in danger of default and how much should be set aside as reserves against them.

But the 38-year-old leader has fallen victim to Haiti's oldest game, a power play by soldiers fearing they were being cut out of the picture. Senior Officers Retired **********In his inaugural speech, Father Aristide stunned his audience with an alternately playful and poker-faced delivery as he announced the \"marriage\" of the armed forces with the people and proposed the immediate retirement of a cast of senior military officers he felt he could not trust. **********It appeared that President Aristide had scored a major victory when the soldiers dutifully retired. **********With his grassroots support still strong and pledges of good will and assistance pouring in from abroad, a resentful army, mindful of the violent routing of a band of coup plotters only a month before by hordes of Aristide supporters, could do little but swallow hard and play along. **********But in the succeeding months, diplomats and Haitian experts say, tensions grew. A number of unorthodox moves by the new President further riled many in the army. For example, at public appearances around the country, Father Aristide has spontaneously promoted enlisted soldiers to the officer corps, bypassing the military promotion system. Special Militia Worried Soldiers **********Wary of conspiracies, diplomats said, Father Aristide recently began constituting a 300-man militia thought to be detached from the ordinary chain of command. **********Soon, soldiers began bitterly referring to the force's members as attaches, a name previously used to refer to members of the Tontons Macoute, the murderous private militia formed by the dictator Francois Duvalier. **********For the Haitian military, the parallel is a frightening one. Mr. Duvalier used his militia to murder and exile ambitious soldiers, soon reducing the army to a marginal force in national life. **********Father Aristide earned high marks from diplomats for naming Brig. Gen. Raoul Cedras as provisional commander in chief in June. General Cedras replaced Herard Abraham, who had overseen the country's bumpy transition last year to democratic rule. **********General Cedras, 43 years old, reportedly gained the President's confidence as a moderate professional through his smooth handling of security arrangements for the elections last December, which Father Aristide won in a peaceful landslide. Cedras's Role in Coup **********Until shortly before the announcement late Monday, nearly a day after the coup began, that General Cedras was claiming to head a three-man junta, Western diplomats and observers insisted that the Haitian command was uninvolved in the coup. **********Today, diplomats said that while the situation remained clouded, it appeared that General Cedras had been a reluctant participant at first, moved in part by the detention of his wife by rebelling enlisted men. **********\"We had the impression he wasn't free to talk, that he was physically surrounded by rebels,\" said one envoy who had spoken repeatedly with the new military leader as the coup unfolded on Monday. **********Observers said an added motive for General Cedras to cast his lot with the rebelling soldiers was the suspicion generated by Father Aristide's failure to submit the general's name to the legislature for its formal approval as commander in chief. **********The delay was one of the grievances cited by soldiers in Haitian radio broadcasts today. **********Unlike the plotters of the coup attempt in January, led by Roger Lafontant, a former official of the Duvalier Government, the organizers of Haiti's latest coup took no chances at allowing popular support to rally around the President, sending soldiers to shut down radio stations and break up crowds as they began to form. **********Sure to be scorned locally for their overthrow of a popular leader and the deaths of dozens of people who fell in the coup, and frozen out by the international community, it is unclear how Haiti's new rulers will hold on to power. The United States and France, the largest sources of Haiti's desperately needed foreign aid, immediately condemned the takeover and cut off aid. **********\"We consider this a wholly illegitimate event,\" the United States Ambassador to Haiti, Alvin P. Adams Jr., said in a telephone interview from Port-au-Prince."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/24/world/germany-rejects-a-hostage-prisoner-link.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 188, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Germany Rejects a Hostage-Prisoner Link", "print_headline": "Germany Rejects a Hostage-Prisoner Link", "body_text": " **********In a declaration that could complicate efforts to free the Western hostages in Lebanon, the German Embassy in Beirut today rejected any link between the release of the two German hostages and two Shiite Muslim Lebanese jailed in Germany on terrorism charges. **********The declaration appeared to rebut reports by fundamentalists here of an agreement between Teheran and Bonn according to which the Lebanese prisoners, Mohammed Ali Hamadei and his brother Abbas, would be freed from prison in Germany several months after their associates here free the German captives, Thomas Kemptner and Heinrich Strubig, as part of a general exchange of prisoners in the Middle East. **********The release of the Hamadeis is the sole demand of the captors of the German hostages.

Foreign aid has been held up by concerns about Government disarray and free spending that has forced Mrs. Chamorro to draw down the country's scarce reserves by roughly $50 million in the last two months alone. **********In Managua, traffic has become sprinkled with the shiny vehicles of visiting exiles weighing whether to return. But there has been little new long-term investment to help reverse a decade of economic decline. **********On the rutted streets of the capital, beggars have begun to go door to door in search of handouts, and currency changers wave thick stacks of local bills that lose up to half their value each month due to five-digit inflation. **********\"A worker, a carpenter, a tailor can't even afford a pound of meat a week for his family,\" said Alfredo Vega Mendoza, a 50-year-old clothing salesman, carrying a small bag of rice and other purchases from a Managua market. \"There hasn't been any kind of change -- that's all a lie.\"  High Cost of Concessions **********Mrs. Chamorro's aides staked the economy's future on her ability to win commitments of aid from the international community, and credits from international institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which American sanctions effectively made unavailable to Nicaragua under the Sandinistas. **********But the arrival of a mission from the I.M.F., World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank this month is also certain to focus hard international scrutiny on the admitted disarray of the Chamorro Government's economic policies. And it is expected to highlight the high economic cost that the Government has paid for its policy of cushioning its transition to power with salary concessions and slow reductions in Nicaragua's armed forces. **********\"The concern is that the policies will not measure up, and instead of opening the door to new credit, the visit will only make things harder by confirming the worst impression that donor countries have about this Government,\" said a European diplomat whose country has been approached for aid. **********The Government's economic problems have weakened the effect of the outside aid that is already coming in, including $300 million in emergency American aid approved last year, and they have effectively delayed other major foreign commitments. **********Part of the American aid is the key to benchmarks of economic progress the Government has been unable to meet. Other important donors, like Japan, which has tentatively committed large amounts of aid, have dragged their feet, waiting for signs that the Government can make effective use of the money.  Production Shrinks **********Once expected to hold steady or even increase by the end of 1990, the economy's overall production shrank by as much as 5 percent -- even more than the relative loss suffered in the final year of Sandinista rule -- and is continuing to fall, Government analysts say. **********The deteriorating production has been accompanied by a resurgence of the hyperinflation that stripped the value of local currency for several years in a row. The Nicaraguan cordoba, which was reissued in February 1988 by the Sandinista Government at an exchange rate of 10 to the American dollar, now trades at roughly 3.2 million to the dollar. The Government's plan to introduce a new dollar equivalent currency, the gold cordoba, has been frozen by a lack of reserves to back it. **********Diplomats and independent economists here attribute much of the economy's trouble to the Government's inability to control social and military spending. **********Under a plan developed by Francisco Mayorga Balladares, a Yale-educated economist and key member of Mrs. Chamorro's campaign circle, the Government's monthly deficit fell from more than $30 million in the month after the President's inauguration to roughly $8 million in September. Mr. Mayorga also succeeded in obtaining large foreign aid commitments at a June conference of potential aid donors in Rome. Tight Restraint Abandoned **********But after worsening clashes with Mrs. Chamorro's family advisers, Mr. Mayorga was forced to resign in October. And the tight budgetary restraint he imposed was gradually abandoned, first in generous settlements of nationwide Sandinista strikes in May and July, and later in broader employment and salary concessions that formed part of a national pact signed with unions and business leaders on Oct. 26. **********As part of its policy of avoiding confrontation with the Sandinista-dominated military, the Government has also made a series of secret payments to the army that have amounted to as much as several million dollars a month above its formal budget, said diplomats and Government officials who have witnessed the payments. **********Signs of economic crisis have grown more urgent. The Government's monthly deficit has risen to at least $35 million, and inflation has surged again to roughly 50 percent a month. **********Early in December, Mrs. Chamorro's son-in-law and chief strategist, Antonio Lacayo Oyanguren, led the Nicaraguan delegation to another donor's conference in Paris. But the delegation came away empty-handed after presenting a report that aid officials said made little attempt to justify the Government's deepening deficit. **********\"The Rome document found acceptance among almost everyone; the Paris document found acceptance among almost no one,\" said another independent foreign expert. \"The difference between was politics.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/13/business/key-rates-878791.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/02/business/company-news-bid-extended-for-square-d.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bid Extended For Square D", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Bid Extended For Square D", "body_text": " **********Groupe Schneider S.A., the French electric equipment concern, said that Square D shareholders had tendered 67.5 percent of their shares in support of its $78-a-share cash offer for Square D. **********Schneider said that when those shares were combined with the 318,000 it already owned, 68.9 percent of Square D shareholders favored the acquisition. **********Schneider said it had extended its tender offer to April 12 from March 29. **********\"In light of the clear message being sent by Square D shareholders, I would like to renew our invitation for Square D to meet us,\" Didier Pineau- Valencienne, chief executive of Schneider, said. \"We are prepared to discuss all aspects of our proposal.\" **********Square D, an electrical equipment maker in Palatine, Ill., called the Schneider offer inadequate and urged shareholders to reject it. \"There is nothing to gain by tendering now,\" Jerre L.

The 90-day bills slipped two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.76 perent; six-month bills dipped a basis point, at 5.79 percent, and the one-year bills lost three basis points, at 5.89 percent. **********The Treasury sold $13.5 billion of 15-day cash management bills at an average discount rate of 6.05 percent, and also announced that it would hold its regular auction of one-year bills on Thursday. The size of the auction is $10.75 billion. **********Among the longer maturities, the Treasury's 7.75 percent notes of 2001 were unchanged in price and yield at 97 31/32 and 8.05 percent, respectively. The benchmark long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue due February 2021, rose 3/32, to 95 31/32, as its yield slipped to 8.23 percent, from 8.24 percent the day before. **********For its part, the Federal Reserve added $1.5 billion of reserves to the banking system to accommodate the usual holiday demand for cash. The funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans was at 6 1/8 percent when the Fed intervened. The funds then traded down to close at 6 percent, the Fed's perceived target level for this bedrock cost of credit. **********Following are the details of the Treasury's auction of 15-day cash management bills: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price . . . 99.748 Discounted Rate . . . 6.05% Coupon Yield . . . 6.16% High Price . . . 99.750 Discounted Rate . . . 5.99% Coupon Yield . . . 6.12% Low Price . . . 99.747 Discounted Rate . . . 6.07% Coupon Yield . . . 6.19% Accepted at low price . . . 42% Total applied for . . . $40,545,000 Accepted . . . $13,505,000 N.Y. applied for . . . $37,847,000 N.Y. accepted . . . $13,035,000"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/06/business/market-watch-services-a-boom-area-goes-bust.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1991-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 522, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Services: A Boom Area Goes Bust", "print_headline": "MARKET WATCH; Services: A Boom Area Goes Bust", "body_text": " **********It WAS the boom area of the economy in the 1980's, and the bust area in the current recession. Now the economic statistics show that the service sector is once again starting to hire workers. **********But the catch may be that hiring is still at a low level in the precise area that this economy depends on to provide a push. \"This really undermines the growth in purchasing power that consumers need to sustain recovery,\" said Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley. **********For those who focus on economic statistics, discerning the transitory from the permanent, the cylical from the secular, is a major challenge. Mr. Roach's bet is that the weakness in services will endure, as industries that became \"complacent and bloated\" are forced to restructure because of increased competition, some of it from overseas, just as manufacturing industries were forced to retrench in the last decade. **********Not counting health care -- an industry that grows merrily along, since no one seems able to get a grip on the upward spiral in costs -- this recession was roughly four times as severe as the one in 1981-82 in terms of private service jobs lost. And while 50,000 such jobs were gained last month, that is only a third of the average monthly gain from 1983 through 1990. **********Services is an amorphous grouping. It includes the folks flipping burgers at McDonald's, but it was not those jobs that provided the 80's boom. It was work in banks, law firms, health care, airlines, entertainment and retail sales that set the tone. Unfortunately, argues Mr. Roach, all that hiring, and billions spent on computers, produced rising incomes but not improved productivity. Now there are layoffs at lots of service firms, ranging from American Express to Skadden Arps. **********\"This will be a recovery that is driven by productivity, or efficiency improvement, rather than one that is driven by excess hiring,\" Mr. Roach said on Friday, adding that more effective use of computers will be a big help. \"That is good news for cost control, for inflation and, hopefully, for interest rates. It is bad news for those who have to pay the price for cost control by losing their jobs.\" **********Among Wall Street economists, Mr. Roach has not been a paid-up member of the alarmist camp. He has been calling for a recovery, and still is, but sees a greater downside risk than he had. \"My single greatest concern is seeing this take a tremendous toll on white-collar job creation,\" he said. **********If Mr. Roach is right, then pressures to stimulate the economy are likely to increase, perhaps as stock traders grow more nervous. In the near term, that is likely to mean lower interest rates as the Fed eases monetary policy. **********But that could change. Just now, nobody in Washington wants to be known as a \"budget buster,\" and there are government layoffs from coast to coast. But as the election nears, fiscal stimulus may regain respect and government spending may take off, scaring bond traders and pushing up rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/03/business/mutual-funds-as-the-ira-season-draws-near.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1991-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 839, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Question", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mutual Funds; As the I.R.A. Season Draws Near", "print_headline": "Mutual Funds; As the I.R.A. Season Draws Near", "body_text": " **********Like crocuses, mutual fund advertisements -- coaxing investors to open individual retirement accounts before April 15 -- are harbingers of spring. So far, they have succeeded: Mutual funds had captured almost a quarter of the $465.4 billion I.R.A. market at the end of 1989, the most recent totals from the Investment Company Institute, a trade group. That's a bigger chunk than the I.R.A. money invested through banks, savings institutions, life insurance companies, credit unions or brokerage firms, which also offer the tax-deferring I.R.A.'s. **********So far during this tax season, mutual fund companies say, new accounts are down, probably because of the Mideast conflict. But they believe that sales will pick up before April 15 as tax time draws nearer and a market rally, driven by apparent war success, takes hold. **********Given that, how should people invest their I.R.A. funds? Most investment advisers recommend putting a big chunk of retirement savings into stock funds, which outperform fixed-rate investments over time. But it makes sense to move into stocks slowly to limit losses in case the market slips. Put cash into a money fund and then buy shares in stock funds at regular intervals. **********The following are questions investors are asking Oppenheimer, one of the big fund groups, and answers from Sam Freedman, president of Oppenheimer Shareholder Services; Robert M. Fields, an attorney with the New York law firm of Spengler Carlson Gubar Brodsky & Frischling, and Lewis J. Altfest, a New York investment adviser. **********Question: How much can I contribute to an I.R.A.? **********Mr. Freedman: Anyone younger than 70 1/2 can contribute up to $2,000 of earned income each year -- or $2,250, if your spouse doesn't work. But you lose part of the tax deduction for the contribution if you participate in your employer's 401 (k) or another retirement plan (or if your spouse does, if you file jointly) and your adjusted gross income rises from $40,000 to $50,000 for married couples filing joint tax returns (for singles, the equivalent is $25,000 to $35,000). When you earn more than that, you lose the deduction entirely. **********Q. Is it worthwhile to contribute to an I.R.A. if I can't deduct the contribution? **********Mr. Altfest: I urge clients to set aside the maximum amounts in pension and 401 (k) plans but I'm less enthusiastic about I.R.A.'s. **********They make sense for people who lack the discipline to save. They are also good bets for active traders, because the I.R.A. shields trading profits from the capital gains tax. **********But for everyone else, the sole advantage is that earnings in the account build up tax-free until the money is withdrawn. But you can get that elsewhere. Let's say you put $2,000 into an I.R.A. every year for 20 years and the account earns 10 percent annually. You end up with $126,005, or $86,943 after Federal tax is paid at the 31 percent rate. But if you invest the same amount of money in municipal bond funds earning 7 percent, you would have slightly more, $87,730. **********The longer you leave the money in the I.R.A., the more valuable the tax deferral.  You can also come out ahead with the I.R.A. if you pay tax at a lower rate at retirement. **********One warning: When you withdraw money, you will need records to show which contributions were deductible and which were not. Keep copies of Form 8606, filed with your tax return. To make record-keeping easier, Oppenheimer, for one, will segregate nondeductible contributions in a separate I.R.A. **********Q. How can I move my existing I.R.A. account into a mutual fund? **********Mr. Freedman: The easiest way is called a \"trustee-to-trustee\" transfer. You complete an I.R.A. application and a \"Change of Trustee\" form, which authorizes the mutual fund group to take the money from your old I.R.A.  Unlike an I.R.A. rollover, this transfer does not have to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service by the fund or by the investor. **********Q. When must I begin withdrawing money from the I.R.A.? **********Mr. Fields: You can start withdrawing the money without penalty when you turn 59 1/2. If you don't, you must begin taking out a minimum amount based on I.R.S. tables by April 1 of the year following the year that you turn 70 1/2. You have to take another minimum distribution by Dec. 31 of that year; after that, one annual withdrawal is required. **********Some fund groups will calculate the minimum required amount and then mail you checks on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. **********Q. How much will it cost to set up an I.R.A.? **********Mr. Fields: Some funds charge a small fee, around $10. After that, you should expect to pay a yearly fee of about $10 or $15. The fees come under the heading of \"miscellaneous expenses,\" which when toted up can be deducted to the extent that the total exceeds 2 percent of adjusted gross income. To claim the deduction, you must write separate checks for the I.R.A. contribution and expenses."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/17/business/magazine-sale-in-california.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Magazine Sale In California", "print_headline": "Magazine Sale In California", "body_text": " **********A Santa Monica, Calif., trade-magazine publisher has purchased S.F. and Angeles, glossy home-design and fashion monthlies that appeared doomed when their parent company went under last month. **********Steve Goldstein said in a telephone interview that he had purchased all of the assets \"and none of the liabilities\" of the two publications.

The problem, however, is that a pet door also opens a home to other furry guests, from inquisitive racoons to passing strays. **********The solution? Give kitty a key. **********Reilor Ltd., a privately held British company, has developed an electronic door that lets the cat of the house come and go freely, but denies entry to any other creature. **********Once the door, marketed under the brand name Staywell, is plugged in, a small transmitter emits a high-frequency radio signal at one-second intervals, then waits for an echoing signal. When the authorized cat approaches, a small \"key\" worn on its collar intercepts the signal, and generates the answering frequency.  When the door \"hears\" the response, it relaxes the latch with a loud click. This signals the cat to push against the door to gain entry, and also lets the owners know where the cat is. Cats will have to be taught push the door; a short lesson should suffice. **********The door also has a manual lock, which allows the owner to override the electronics and keep things closed, or to set the mechanism so the door will open one way but not the other. For example, it might allow the cat to come in but not go back out. **********There are three different frequency codes available, limiting the possibility that two cats on the same block will have the same key code. **********If overlap does occur, the company will tune the door to a different frequency without charge. The door also comes with two spare keys. More are available from the company for $7.50 apiece. **********Reilor, which operates in this country through a Pennsylvania-based subsidiary, has been selling these doors for about two years, alongside its line of nonelectronic cat and dog doors. The company estimates that it has sold about $85,000 worth of the electronic variety so far in this country, mostly through catalogues. Richard Charney, the American unit's general manager, said the electronic door made up about 1 percent of total United States sales. **********\"Sales haven't been astronomical,\" Mr. Charney said. \"This is a select item, with a limited appeal.\" One reason, Mr. Charney pointed out, is the electronic door's price, which averages about $125 retail.

But economists said inflation at the retail level was not as bad as it seemed. **********Separately, new housing activity skidded to its lowest levels since the early 1980's, with builders starting just 850,000 new homes and apartments at an annual rate, 12.8 percent below the depressed December level. Permits for future construction fell 4.7 percent. **********Taken together, the reports provided a mixed reading of economic performance last month, with the price figures tending to support the notion that downward momentum was being contained and the housing figures reflecting an industry mired in deepening recession.  War and the Credit Crunch **********Even housing, however, was said by various specialists to have shown signs of rebound in early February. **********\"Hopefully, we are near the bottom of this recession,\" said Mark Tipton, president of the National Association of Home Builders. He attributed the January drop in housing starts to a sharp decline in consumer confidence before the outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf and \"a severe credit crunch,\" or a reluctance of banks to make loans. **********Patrick C. Jackman, the Labor Department official who supervises the data-gathering for the price index, said most of the unexpected jolts in today's report could be explained away and that inflation seemed likely to remain in check. **********\"If I were Mr. Greenspan, I certainly would not change my policy based upon these numbers,\" Mr. Jackman said, referring to Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.  Greenspan's Forecast **********Indeed, the Fed chief projected at a Congressional hearing today that consumer prices would rise by 3.25 to 4 percent this year, down from 6.1 percent in 1990. The Fed chairman also said that he expected a recovery \"reasonably soon,\" but saw risks to the economy from the war, the health of the banking system and availability of credit.  [ Page D19. ] **********The consumer price figures, which were worse than expected, pushed up interest rates in early trading in the credit markets, but upon closer examination traders and investors appeared to have decided that there was little danger of a sustained rise in inflation. **********Much of the increase reflected the imposition of luxury and other taxes on Jan. 1 and presumably temporary advances for new cars, resort lodging and fresh fruits and vegetables. **********\"The rate of inflation is likely to be lower\" in coming months, said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. He contended, for example, that a 1.3 percent January jump in the price of new cars, the biggest increase since May 1981, was unlikely to be repeated anytime soon.  1991 Models Costlier **********The Labor Department said the January rise reflected the continued introduction of higher-priced 1991 models as well an end to rebates on some models. The introduction of new models, starting in the fall, has been slower than usual this year. **********The four-tenths of 1 percent rise in the January Consumer Price Index covering all urban consumers followed two months of three-tenths of 1 percent increases. It was marked, among other things, by a 2.4 percent drop in the price of energy, and was partly offset by a nine-tenths of 1 percent jump in the price of food and beverages. **********Exceptionally cold weather in late December, especially in California, sent some food prices soaring, with oranges up 37.2 percent and lettuce up 24.5 percent. The price of alcoholic beverages advanced a record 4.9 percent, partly reflecting a Jan. 1 rise in Federal excise taxes but also reflecting industry increases put through at the same time. **********Cereal and bakery products jumped 1.3 percent, but dairy products fell for the third straight month and beef, pork and seafood also fell.  Housing Component Up **********The housing component also rose much faster than in December, increasing eight-tenths of 1 percent. That was the largest increase since mid-1982. A big factor, however, was a 6.8 percent jump in out-of-town lodging costs, reflecting greater-than-usual increases in vacation areas. Mr. Jackman speculated that advertised hotel and motel discounts applied mostly to weekend and other brief trips and not to longer stays. **********But household fuels also rose 1.5 percent as increases for electricity and natural gas -- up 2.8 percent and 1 percent, respectively -- more than offset a 5.6 percent drop for fuel oil. Local phone service rose 4 percent. **********The transportation component dropped 1.2 percent as gasoline fell 6.9 percent and used cars, tires and automobile body work also cost less. Besides new cars, the cost of auto financing rose and there was another sharp increase in airline fares that brought the advance to 13.4 percent over the latest five months. **********Apparel jumped 1 percent, reflecting smaller-than-usual price reductions for fall and winter clothing, as well as an earlier-than-usual introduction of higher-priced spring and summer clothing, the department said. The subindex for watches and jewelry climbed 4.3 percent, partly reflecting the new Federal luxury tax. Medical Costs Rise **********Medical care rose six-tenths of 1 percent last month, somewhat less than the eight-tenths of 1 percent average in the second half of 1990, while the \"other\" goods and services category rose seven-tenths of 1 percent for the third straight month. The latter category includes tobacco, on which taxes were also raised last month, and school tuitions. **********The eight-tenths of 1 percent increase in the so-called core inflation rate that excludes food and energy compared with a four-tenths of 1 percent average monthly rise in 1990. **********Before rounding, the consumer price index covering all urban consumers rose 0.4470939, a rate that if maintained and compounded over 12 months would produce annual inflation of 5.5 percent. **********Prices in the New York City area rose 1 percent last month, today's report also showed, with one of the main factors being the jump in out-of-town lodging. Mr. Jackman said that if many New Yorkers wintered in, say, Miami the cost of Miami lodging would be incorporated in the New York inflation rate. **********The index now stands at 134.6, which means that a basket of goods and services that cost $10 in 1982-1984 now costs $13.46. **********The C.P.I.-W covering urban wage earners and clerical workers also advanced four-tenths of 1 percent last month following two months of minimally smaller increases. **********Housing Starts **********The housing figures, which are compiled by the Commerce Department, showed that starts of new homes ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 850,000 last month, down from 975,000 in December and barely half the 1,543,000 started in January 1990, which was exceptionally warm. Last month's was also the lowest since January 1982, which had an annual rate of 843,000 units. **********Single-family dwellings accounted for most of the decline, falling 15.6 percent to a rate of 632,000, the lowest since June 1982, when 613,000 houses were started at an annual rate. Buildings with five or more units accounted for 189,000 at an annual rate, with smaller multiple-dwellings accounting for 29,000. **********By region, the drop in the Northeast was just under 30 percent, to a rate of 77,000 a year. The Midwest and South had 15 percent declines, to 198,000 and 340,000, respectively, while the West posted a tiny advance to 235,000. **********Amid the gloomy figures, however, the home builders' group and other analysts said they see some signs of revival. Mr. Tipton, of the home builders association, said he expected construction to begin rising after another two months or so because of lower interest rates, a restoration of confidence and evidence from a survey in the first half of February showing 42 percent of builders experiencing \"high to average\" traffic in their subdivisions, up from 24 percent who ranked traffic that high a month earlier. **********Mr. Rippe of Dean Witter also found \"some positive signs\" emerging in housing, including a faster rate of sale of existing homes and increasing affordability of housing over the past six months. **********Permits for future construction fell 4.7 percent last month to a rate of 804,000, 5 percent below the revised December rate of 844,000 and far below the 1,739,000 rate of January 1990 when there was a rush to beat new Federal requirements for accessibility by the handicapped to multi-family dwellings. **********Permits for single-family units were 6 percent lower, at an annual rate of 606,000, with the rate about unchanged at 99,000 in the Northeast, modestly higher at 187,000 in the Midwest and lower in the South and West with 301,000 and 217,000, respectively. **********The Commerce Department's report also showed that shipments of mobile homes for December ran at a rate of 167,000, 8 percent less than in November."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/22/business/court-papers-provide-a-look-at-sears-defenses.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1991-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 769, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Court Papers Provide a Look at Sears Defenses", "print_headline": "Court Papers Provide a Look at Sears Defenses", "body_text": " **********Sears, Roebuck & Company released a trove of documents today, part of a shareholder lawsuit against Sears that had been sealed. While incomplete, the documents support the shareholders' view that one reason for Sears's large-scale restructuring announced in October 1988 was to thwart hostile bidders. **********Directors of a public company can legitimately defend it against a hostile bidder, but the defense becomes illegal if the company cannot offer shareholders a better alternative than the bidder and if the directors' primary purpose is to entrench themselves. The shareholders' suit contends that Sears's management acted to entrench itself, rather than to benefit shareholders. Sears disputes that contention. **********The documents released are mostly shareholder accusations and Sears's responses. Sears released only snippets of depositions by its executives and of internal Sears memorandums that have been offered into evidence.  Secret Meeting **********In one memorandum, James M. Denny, Sears's chief financial officer, wrote to other Sears executives in advance of a secret meeting they held at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Chicago on Aug. 30, 1988, to discuss the planned restructuring. **********\"The purpose of the analysis is to assist in the formulation of a strategy to deal with a hostile approach to the company,\" Mr. Denny wrote. In another memo released today, Mr. Denny discussed the plan for a huge repurchase of Sears stock as part of the restructuring, saying, \"It is important to act before too large a percentage of stock falls into the hands of arbritragers.\" **********The documents also referred to a memo written in March 1988 by John Sayre, a Sears financial analyst, to Stanley Wright, head of Sears's corporate financial analytical group. Mr. Sayre wrote that the restructuring would be an \"essential weapon against unfriendly investors.\" **********In another memo, an unidentified Sears executive encouraged Sears to play down the anti-takeover effects of an employee stock ownership plan, which Sears formed in 1989, and to develop instead a \"legitimate\" public reason for establishing the plan. **********The documents released today were seen by only a handful of reporters, but as they are more widely circulated, they are expected to be grist for discussions on corporate governance. **********But even if a court finds that Sears's restructuring was an effort to protect management, the top executives may still not be in jeopardy. \"For a corporation not to have some sort of defense against an abusive takeover would itself be irresponsible,\" said Robert Hessen, a corporate governance specialist at Stanford University. \"The beauty of a public corporation such as Sears is that you have the ability to bail out, that is to sell your shares. Anybody who believes that management was simply stalling and did not have a plan to strengthen the company could get out.\" **********The documents also show that Goldman, Sachs & Company, Sears's longtime Wall Street adviser, concluded in November 1987 that a raider might be able to restructure Sears and achieve a 37 percent to 68 percent premium for investors, compared with the 23 percent to 38 percent premium that Sears could achieve if it restructured itself. The documents say Goldman, Sachs then recommended a series of anti-takeover measures that Sears subsequently adopted. **********A Goldman, Sachs spokesman declined comment, referring reporters to Sears. **********Sears has said all along -- and it repeated today -- that the overriding purpose of the restructuring is to benefit investors. The sweeping corporporate overhaul included a $1.7 billion stock buyback; plans to sell the Sears Tower; divesting the commercial division of Sears's Coldwell Banker real estate unit; refocusing Sears's Dean Witter Reynolds and Allstate Insurance groups and overhauling the troubled Sears Merchandise Group by cutting prices and introducing more brand names. **********Despite the breadth of the restructuring, the court documents indicated that Sears's directors had taken only two hours and 20 minutes to approve the plan. In a deposition made public, Mr. Denny acknowledged that key elements of the restructuring -- for example, the decision to move Dean Witter away from the institutional brokerage business in favor of small investors -- had not been discussed by the board before the restructuring meeting. **********The plaintiffs are trying to show that the Sears board acted hastily, rubber-stamping a restructuring plan favored by top executives who wanted to keep management intact. Sears disputes that accusation. **********\"The Sears board was well informed with the information it needed on these issues both before the meeting and at the meeting,\" a spokesman said. **********David Shute, Sears's top in-house legal counsel, acknowledged that the restructuring was accelerated because of takeover rumors then swirling about Sears, but he insisted that its purpose was to generate more earnings for Sears shareholders."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/21/world/athens-journal-at-the-foot-of-the-acropolis-a-big-dream-unfolds.html": {"writer_name": "Marlise Simons", "pub_date": "1991-02-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 946, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Athens Journal; At the Foot of the Acropolis, a Big Dream Unfolds", "print_headline": "Athens Journal; At the Foot of the Acropolis, a Big Dream Unfolds", "body_text": " **********In this city of breathtaking ruins and some of the nastier urban tangles of these times, an ambitious planner has taken office, impatient to mobilize barriers and bulldozers and start changing the face of the capital. **********He is the new Mayor of Athens, Antonis Tritsis, an architect, engineer and town planner, trained in Chicago and the first man to come to this job with a far-reaching new master plan for the town center in more than 150 years. **********\"It's a matter of survival,\" said the Mayor, who has gained a reputation for creating controversy.

City's Monotonous Look **********Which other city in Europe has a soul more than 3,000 years old? the Mayor said, making that sweep across the centuries that comes easily to Greeks. \"We must reveal and recapture this historic soul,\" he said. **********As an epicenter of Western thought, Athens may be among the oldest and most evocative of places. Yet ever since the Turks left and the first king called on Bavarian architects in the 1830's to draw up a street plan, the town at the foot of the Acropolis has been straining at its leash. **********The city doubled in size in the last three decades.

Then Mr. Tritsis, now 54 years old, sat down to explain his plans. **********One calls for banning a portion of the one million buses and private cars from perennially jammed downtown streets. Instead he wants to bring in streetcars. **********\"My pet project is a light tramway system,\" he said. \"It's electric so it's clean, it can carry many people and it can combine with pedestrian ways.\" **********Besides, he said, unlike a new subway, streetcars stay safely above ground -- no small advantage in a city where digging invariably draws archeologists who may find important reasons to suspend the work.  Cleaning Up the Capital **********A former Environment Minister, Mr. Tritsis has been prodding the Government to deliver cleaner fuel and is asking Athenians to make room for trees to improve their air and relieve the stark cityscape. With only 2.8 percent green space, Athens has less than any European capital. **********In office since Jan. 1, the Mayor said he was still sorting out the books and dealing with his bureaucracy. He has been talking to garbage workers and gardeners and, not least, bankers and business executives to raise money. **********He is of course not the first Mayor pledging to clean up the capital. Others have promised but tripped over hurdles that say as much about Greece as about the job. **********In the land of the ancient city-state, today's metropolis has virtually no power and no income. An administrator said Athens does not even get to keep its parking fines. The Culture Ministry jumps in if plans are made in the vicinity of one of the dozens of ancient monuments. The Health Ministry has a say in basics like where to dump garbage. Almost all the funds depend on the Finance Minister.  Breathing Space and Visitors **********Some residents here suggest that getting anything done is a feat for any Mayor in Greece's antagonistic political climate, where rivals readily thwart each other's projects. **********\"I have a double-edged problem,\" said Mr. Tritsis, who has taken office at a moment in which Greece is almost broke. \"I need extra financing from the Government, and at the same time I need to fight for more power.\" **********Yet he said he believed that by rehabilitating the past he can enhance the present. An archeological park in the center will provide a breathing space, he believes, and bring in visitors who avoid this bad-tempered city and treat it merely as an airport on the way to the islands. **********He said he wanted to link all the sites from Classic to Roman to Byzantine Greece. That means an area embracing the temple of Zeus, the towering Acropolis, reaching through the Roman market, Monasteraki, the Agora as far as the Academy of Plato. It means closing roads and building new plazas and pedestrian ways.  Rundown Zone Restored **********Associates describe the tenacious planner as the main engine behind the transformation of Plaka, the old and rundown zone below the Acropolis. It is now cleaned up, restored and brimming with restaurants. **********When Mr. Tritsis was Minister of Environment and Planning, one friend recalled, people told him that taming Plaka would be impossible. But enlisting the police, he saw to it that in one night 93 places were shut, including seedy nightclubs and fronts for drug-dealing that had ignored official deadlines to close. **********He referred in jest to 1984, when he was dismised as Environment Minister, apparently because he fought with the real-estate lobby and refused to compromise. **********\"The difference is,\" he said, \"I can't be fired now for four years.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/29/business/making-a-differnce-a-mutual-attraction.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1991-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 365, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Making a Differnce; A Mutual Attraction", "print_headline": "Making a Differnce; A Mutual Attraction", "body_text": " **********JOHN GUMMERE, chairman and chief executive of the Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company, expresses nothing but contempt when he surveys the large number of mutual life insurers that have converted to stock ownership to raise capital. **********Mutual companies -- those owned by their policyholders -- are formed \"to enable the policyholders to obtain insurance at lower prices than they could get from a stock company,\" Mr. Gummere said. \"De-mutualization is an admission of management failure.

That in turn would increase profits, the companies say, as well as the capital base that has become so crucial in this period of growing life insurer insolvencies.

Their aim is to build up, in a period short of three years, a core of Palestinian leaders in the Israeli-occupied territories at the nuts-and-bolts level of governing. **********Israel had said it prefers a five-year time span for local autonomy. **********The Palestinians will also strive to widen the concept of self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza to include all municipal, administrative and educational matters, Arab diplomats and Palestinian officials said.

Israeli Signals Seen **********Palestinians say they see signals supporting their analysis in some recent Israeli and American actions. **********\"The Americans are telling us to go directly into the substance of self-rule, and we will,\" said another P.L.O. official at the Tunis headquarters. **********In Israel, some Palestinian analysts say they see subtle indications of a slowdown in construction of new Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza resulting largely from a lack of funds in the Israeli treasury. This, they speculate, may be an excuse to freeze settlements without saying so. **********Tactically, the Palestinians see an opportunity to put their case directly to the American people from the American capital. \"We will be the first to sit down at the table on Dec. 4,\" said a Palestinian academic, who like other negotiators insisted on anonymity. **********Palestinians want to pursue their objectives under the international umbrella of a peacekeeping force, preferably one from the United States. **********They also want to label the entire process a \"transitional period,\" as opposed to \"self-rule,\" thereby affirming that it is not an end in itself. **********Palestinian officials say they know that the Israeli Government led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir will fiercely resist any idea of an independent Palestinian state. But they believe that before discussions reach that stage, there may be a change of government in Israel. **********They are betting on the eventual replacement of Mr. Shamir's Likud Government with a coalition of the Labor and Likud parties \"that can take things further from the self-rule stage,\" said the senior planner. **********They acknowledge that while these initial steps may be attainable, talks with Israel will bog down in great difficulty on the emotional issues of the status of refugees from the Arab-Israeli wars and the Jewish settlements in the territories. **********Syrian talks with Israel appear far more difficult to start than those with the Palestinians, Egyptian and Palestinian officials interviewed over the last few days said. **********But they are convinced that if the Syrians and Israelis can overcome a psychological barrier -- mutual hatred and contempt -- their major territorial issue, a final status for the Golan Heights, can be resolved. Israel captured the strategically important area from Syria in the 1967 war and annexed most of it. **********The area could be demilitarized and returned to Syrian sovereignty without altering Israel's security there, experts interviewed said. Similarly, they said, an agreement with Syria would entail an accord with the Lebanese Government, which demands the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the southern part of Lebanon. **********An Arab envoy here expressed optimism. Speaking of the Syrian President, he said, \"Hafez al-Assad can sell any Syrian concessions on the Golan Heights to his people as a triumph of Syrian will over the Israelis the same way he told them he has entered Lebanon to free it from Israeli occupation, and protect the Christian Lebanese, and then the Palestinians.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/16/world/soviet-crackdown-foreign-minister-man-aleksandr-aleksandrovich-bessmertnykh.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1991-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 869, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET CRACKDOWN: The Foreign Minister Man in the News: Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Bessmertnykh; Soviet Master of Washington's Ways", "print_headline": "SOVIET CRACKDOWN: The Foreign Minister Man in the News: Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Bessmertnykh; Soviet Master of Washington's Ways", "body_text": " **********In 1988, after assuring members of the Soviet Parliament that the treaty limiting medium-range nuclear missiles was good for Moscow, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, then a Deputy Foreign Minister, paused in the Kremlin to chat in English about the agreement with an American journalist. **********The Soviet official was at ease as he talked about the political dimension of Soviet-American relations and the importance of the treaty. Such informality, common with American officials, was unusual for a top Soviet official. **********But it was typical for Mr. Bessmertnykh, now 57 years old, who has spent most of his professional life working in or studying the United States. He became Soviet Ambassador to the United States in May 1990, arriving here to take up his diplomatic duties the same week President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived for summit meetings with President Bush. **********So when Mr. Bessmertnykh was named Foreign Minister today, Bush Administration officials welcomed the appointment as a reassuring indication that Soviet-American relations would remain on track. Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said: \"We've all worked with him in a number of capacities. He's been very instrumental in shaping Soviet-U.S. relations, particularly through this gulf crisis.\" In U.S. Many Years **********American officials and Soviet scholars say nobody in the Soviet Foreign Ministry knows the United States better, and few Soviet officials have more experience dealing with Washington. Mr. Bessmertnykh -- the name is pronounced byeh-SMEHRT-nikh and means immortal -- worked at the United Nations Secretariat in the 1960's, served at the Soviet Embassy here from 1970 to 1983 and was later head of the Foreign Ministry department responsible for the United States and Canada. **********Paul H. Nitze, the former arms control negotiator for the United States, said: \"Mr. Bessmertnykh is very intelligent and friendly. His sympathies are basically with the United States. He knows the U.S., and I think he is fond of Americans.\" But Mr. Nitze said, \"I don't think he will be as influential\" as the last Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, whom Mr. Nitze described as \"one of the two or three great men\" of the Soviet Union today. **********\"Bessmertnykh is an attractive man, but not a great man,\" Mr. Nitze said, adding, \"I'm very fond of him.\" **********Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Bessmertnykh, the son of a civil servant, was born Nov. 10, 1933, in Biysk, in south-central Siberia. He graduated in 1957 from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations and has a degree in international law and political science. He gives the impression of being precisely what he is: a well-trained bureaucrat.  Worked Hard on Treaty **********Acquaintances say that Mr. Bessmertnykh, as a diplomat here in the late 1970's, worked hard on a treaty to limit strategic arms, hoping it would contribute to a lasting improvement in Soviet-American relations. They recall that he was downcast after the treaty was shelved after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979. **********Dimitri K. Simes, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Mr. Bessmertnykh was \"probably the best expert on the United States in the Soviet Foreign Service.\" **********\"If you wanted to find somebody who would be a good partner for Secretary of State Baker and has a longstanding relationship with the State Department, someone who understands how the U.S. political system functions -- the role of Congress and the news media, and constraints on the President -- I don't know anyone who would perform better than Mr. Bessmertnykh,\" Mr. Simes said. **********Mr. Simes described Mr. Bessmertnykh as \"an honorable man who displayed a great propensity for lying on behalf of his country when appropriate.\"  Defended Afghanistan Role **********For example, he said, Mr. Bessmertnykh publicly defended the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan as a response to an invitation from Afghan officials, and Mr. Simes asserted that Mr. Bessmertnykh \"would have no particular difficulty justifying to the world what the Soviets do in the Baltic republics, if Moscow decides to proceed with a crackdown.\" **********Mr. Bessmertnykh took diplomatic lessons from a master, Anatoly F. Dobrynin, the urbane former Ambassador to the United States. The two served together in the embassy here from 1970 to 1983. Mr. Bessmertnykh said Mr. Gorbachev chose him to be the Ambassador here last year because Soviet-American relations required \"the professional touch.\" **********As one of three First Deputy Foreign Ministers from 1988 to early 1990, Mr. Bessmertnykh was responsible for North America and the Middle East. In those years, he visited Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, among other countries. **********Diplomats at the Soviet Embassy say Mr. Bessmertnykh is a connoisseur of art and classical music. \"He took advantage of every spare moment to go to art galleries and art exhibitions\" in Washington, said a Soviet diplomat. While working in Moscow, Mr. Bessmertnykh discovered some paintings in the Foreign Ministry archives and put them on display. **********From his first marriage, Mr. Bessmertnykh has a daughter, Marina, who was born in 1961. His first wife died in April 1989. A year later he married Marina Vladimirovna, now 35 years old.

Questionable Links to Research **********Although the investigations are not complete, they have already turned up evidence that Stanford charged the Government for part of the costs of work that do not seem related to research, like a cedar closet and the refurbishing of a grand piano in the university-owned home where Mr. Kennedy, who has been president for 10 years, lives. **********At issue is the amount Stanford charges the Federal Government for the indirect, or overhead, costs of conducting research for all Government departments on its campus. The Defense Department was named from among the departments with research done at the university as the agency responsible for the costs there. **********The way the Government finances research grants consist of two components: direct costs, which can easily be attributed to a specific project, like laboratory equipment and professors' salaries, and indirect costs for the overhead charges, including administrative services, operating university buildings and maintenance of roads. **********It is difficult to quantify the expenses of running the library or the provost's office, for example, that should be allocated to research, and each university reaches its own agreement on such figures with the Federal Government.  Denial of Wrongdoing **********Mr. Kennedy has repeatedly denied that the university did anything wrong, saying that Stanford merely fought aggressively for every dollar to which it was entitled under Federal rules. **********Larry Horton, Stanford's associate vice president for public affairs, said the charges for Mr. Kennedy's home were allowed under Federal regulations because the residence was used for receptions and other official functions, some of them related to research. But because of the controversy, Stanford would voluntarily refund the $500,000 in costs claimed since 1981 for the operation of the homes of Mr. Kennedy and two other university administrators, he said. **********Mr. Horton emphasized that Mr. Kennedy himself did not make decisions to charge items like antiques and the closet to the Federal Government. Rather, he said, all the expenses of running the house were put into a pool and the total costs of the pool were allocated to different sources of money like indirect research costs and tuition. **********While repeating that nothing wrong had been done, Mr. Kennedy in a statement today acknowledged that Stanford's accounting system had \"some shortcomings, real as well as perceived\" and that there were legitimate questions about Stanford's procedures. Committee Is Being Formed **********In addition to refunding the money, Mr. Kennedy also said today that Stanford has hired the accounting firm Arthur Andersen and Company to do an independent evaluation of the university's accounting practices. **********He also said an advisory committee of five people was being formed to review these practices and recommend changes. Retired Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, the former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Father Timothy Healy, president of the New York Public Library and the former president of Georgetown University, and Joseph Connor, chairman of Price Waterhouse World Firm Ltd., another accounting company, have been named to the committee so far. **********Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is the chairman of the subcommittee investigating Stanford, today called the university's moves \"a good beginning.\" He added, \"We're delighted they realize they have a problem and are taking some steps to solve it.\" But he said the investigation would continue. **********It is also expected that the investigations will look at other universities. **********Refunding the money for administators' houses may not be the only concession that Stanford will eventually have to make.  Charges Among the Highest **********The amount Stanford charges for indirect costs is among the highest assessed by any university. Until recently it has been 74 percent of the amount gained in grants. For each $100,000 a professor receives in direct research grants, Stanford receives an extra $74,000 to cover overhead costs. The university, under pressure from Defense Department auditors, recently dropped that to 72 percent, a reduction that will cost it more than $2 million a year. **********Such charges for indirect costs, for which the Government paid about $80 million in the 1989 fiscal year, account for almost one-third of Stanford's operating budget and are its second biggest source of unrestricted funds after tuition. **********Since the Federal investigations began late last year, a series of embarrassing discoveries have been made. As part of its indirect research costs, for instance, Stanford charged taxpayers $184,000 to cover depreciation on a luxury yacht that had been donated to it. Stanford said the charge was a mistake and has refunded the money. **********Then it was discovered that the costs at least partly billed to the Federal Government included $2,500 for refurbishing a grand piano, $3,000 for a cedar-lined closet and up to $2,000 a month for flowers at the university president's house. An investigator with the House subcommittee said today that other charges at Mr. Kennedy's house included $9,000 for antique furniture in 1988 and $7,000 for linen in 1987. **********While charges for the cedar closet and the yacht receive attention, the money at stake is determined by far more complex matters, like the accounting procedures used to determine what percentage of the costs of running the libary should be allocated to research, which can then be recovered from the Government as indirect costs. **********A Defense Department representative stationed at Stanford, for instance, has said Stanford used a cost allocation formula that allowed it to receive about $5 million more each year from the Federal Government than it would under a formula used by many other universities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/30/business/the-executive-life-dirty-shirts-at-the-6-18-clean-collars-tonight.html": {"writer_name": "Nancy Better", "pub_date": "1991-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 888, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Executive Life; Dirty Shirts at the 6:18, Clean Collars Tonight", "print_headline": "The Executive Life; Dirty Shirts at the 6:18, Clean Collars Tonight", "body_text": " **********It's 6:18 on a Tuesday morning, and the Greenwich, Conn., train station is bustling. Cars drop off sleepy-eyed commuters, who dash to the newsstand, coins and monogrammed briefcases in hand, before heading to the Manhattan-bound platform. **********Some commuters, however, carry something more. James Carrier, a salesman with Reuters Information Services, races in with an armful of crumpled shirts. \"No starch,\" he blurts to an attendant at the blue-and-white booth just inside the station's entrance.  \"See you tonight.\" **********When Mr. Carrier returns 12 hours later, his fresh-pressed shirts will be waiting, done by Commuter Cleaners, a four-year-old service that has grown to seven outlets -- at railroad stations and in small shops -- in suburban Westchester County and Connecticut. \"It used to be that I could never get to my cleaners except on weekends,\" Mr. Carrier said. \"This is much more convenient.\" **********Commuter Cleaners is the brainchild of Paul McDonald, a 31-year-old former accountant who got fed up with working long hours and commuting -- and never having a clean shirt as a result. His early efforts involved standing outside the Greenwich station with a laundry basket, offering to ferry commuters' clothes back and forth from local cleaning shops. Today he runs a $1 million business with 20 employees, a fleet of vans and his own production plant. It is, to the best of his knowledge, the only such service in the country, and he also offers tailoring and shoe repair. **********\"Our concept is to attract the time-sensitive customer,\" Mr. McDonald explained.  \"These people spend 40 hours a month on the train. Anything they can do to save a little leisure time is a big help.\" **********Operating a cleaner along one of the nation's chief power corridors means Mr. McDonald sees some unusual dirty laundry.  Take the morning Tom Sexton, manager of the fixed-income department at First Boston, left a pair of golf slacks at the Greenwich station. During the cleaning, a money clip turned up -- with more than $1,000 in cash.  \"He gave our driver a pretty big tip when he found it waiting,\" said Mr. McDonald. **********Another time, a prominent executive -- whom Mr. McDonald won't identify -- arrived with his wife. When he dumped his clothes on the counter, a peep show token rolled out of a pocket. \"He told his wife he found it on the street, that it was a coin from another country,\" recalled Mr. McDonald. **********Until 1987, Mr. McDonald had had little experience with either commuting or cleaning. The Oklahoma-bred entrepreneur earned an M.B.A. from Tulane University in New Orleans, then took a job with Arthur Andersen there. When the regional economy headed south, he headed north to Creditanstalt Bankverein, an Austrian bank with offices in midtown Manhattan. He settled in Westchester, and for 18 months commuted to his job as an account supervisor. **********\"There's a lot of time on the train to sit and ponder your future,\" he said. **********Armed with demographic statistics from Metro-North, Mr. McDonald did a market analysis of commuters using the New Haven and the Harlem-Hudson lines. He started his service in Greenwich because it had the right station configuration. \"You need to get customers between their cars and the train,\" he says. \"It helps if they all come through the same entrance.\" **********He negotiated for a lease on the Greenwich (there are also Old Greenwich and Cos Cob stops) station, from a private real estate company; later, in Stamford and Chappaqua, two other station sites, he had to win approval from the municipalities. **********To insure success with customers, he undercut local services, charging $1.50 a shirt instead of $2. Because his business required only low overhead -- a few feet of space in the station and a truck to transport the clothes, which were processed at a low bulk rate by local cleaning plants in their downtime -- he turned a profit in his first month.  (Recently, he raised shirt prices to $1.75, to cover the cost of his production plant.) **********Metro-North's research suggests that more than 60 percent of the area's commuters are men, but Mr. McDonald is trying to woo women, too; their clothes are more expensive to clean, generating higher profit margins, and they are highly appreciative of his service. \"With two-career couples, convenience becomes a major issue,\" says Molly Ingram, director of consumer promotion programs for Cahners Publishing, who commutes from Greenwich. \"This has made things much easier for us.\" **********But some of Mr. McDonald's best customers aren't commuters at all. Two years ago, he added home delivery, and makes pickups and deliveries twice a week. He now also has four small shops in Westchester to soak up his cleaning plant's additional capacity. His storefront customers include the likes of Carl Icahn, who has been seen dashing from his car with dirty shirts in hand. But Mr. McDonald would not air customers' dirty laundry -- or at least the names of the owners of said dirty laundry -- for publication. **********There are still a few kinks to smooth out, such as how to deal with executives who want to drop off shirts in Chappaqua and pick them up in Stamford. But plans are underway to expand this fall into three more stations and Mr. McDonald is considering other sites. \"Imagine Long Island,\" he said, eyes gleaming. \"The Huntington station alone has 5,000 commuters a day. Think of all those shirts.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/03/business/l-look-inward-world-bank-419791.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 361, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Look Inward, World Bank", "print_headline": "Look Inward, World Bank", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********\"Running Aid in Tandem With Reform\" (Forum, Oct. 20) rightly emphasizes the need for reforms involving market incentives and development of \"market-friendly\" institutions supported by foreign finance. **********But Vinod Thomas, the author, also admits that \"when aid programs are poorly designed, they allow recipients to postpone -- or totally avoid -- difficult policy changes.\" Yet the reasons for what might be called the past preponderance of non-success -- and the relatively few success cases -- are never dealt with. I suppose the reader is to conclude that if the symbiosis between reforms and financing doesn't work out, it must be due to the failure of the recipient country to treat the program \"as its own, rather than as a foreign imposition.\" **********Surely there is more to it. One possible cause of failure extends to the behavior of the donor/creditor agencies, including Mr. Thomas's own World Bank. At least part of the problem resides with such agencies' felt need to keep lending even when recipients' actions don't warrant it. Bluntly put, as long as meeting some sort of informal lending levels overcomes the insistence on high quality, donors may undermine their own objectives by permitting recipients to pursue inappropriate policies. **********The World Bank is all too often unwilling to act like a bank at the outset -- to wait until the recipient proposes a serious, long-term program of reform. It is also not often prepared to cease lending if mutual understandings are violated.

The sateliites would relay signals to telephone systems on the ground from light-weight portable telephones at a cost of about $1 a minute. Inmarsat officials say that no more than 30 to 40 satellites will be involved and that they are waiting until next year's conference is over before deciding what kind of satellites to launch. **********Inmarsat's plans for what it calls Project 21 are similar to those announced last year by Motorola Inc., which wants to launch a fleet of 77 small satellites that would provide mobile telephone service. **********One of the biggest obstacles to such plans is that virtually all the radio frequencies assigned for mobile satellite communications are already being used. The same frequencies sought for satellite telephones are also being sought for other technologies, from locally provided wireless telephones to digital radio broadcasts that would have sound quality comparable to that of compact disks. **********But Inmarsat, which is itself owned by 64 Governments around the world, including that of the United States, will bring special influence to the global talks scheduled for February, known as the World Administrative Radio Conference. Indeed, some analysts worry that Inmarsat could cramp the development of other communications systems by obtaining exclusive use of choice frequencies for satellite telephone service. **********\"By the nature of what they're designing, Inmarsat is saying that they need to have spectrum specifically allocated to mobile satellite services,\" said John Pemberton, an analyst at the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn. A better approach, he argued, would be to allocate a large band of frequencies more flexibly, for a wide variety of services. **********The United States, which is Inmarsat's largest shareholder, generally supports new technologies like satellite phones, but officials have tended to advocate assigning frequencies for a range of possible uses. **********The London-based consortium already provides mobile telephone services. During the Persian Gulf war, for example, journalists used suitcase-sized satellite transmitters to communicate over Inmarsat satellites with their home offices and Inmarsat is now preparing to offer services for telephones small enough to fit inside briefcases. **********\"The next step is to make it even smaller,\" said Olof Lundberg, director general of Inmarsat, in a telephone interview from London. \"It is technically feasible; it can be done today. But it can't be a marketable product because the satellite systems being used today are not well suited to these very, very small terminals.\" **********Inmarsat plans to provide the satellite network and set the technical standards for the new servces, but other companies would provide the actual telephones and sell service to individual customers. Market Is Still Tiny **********Despite the futuristic allure of pocket-sized satellite telephones, Mr. Lundberg noted that the market for them is tiny in comparison to that for cellular telephones in Europe, Japan and the United States. The phones are expected to be of use primarily to people who travel heavily in remote regions where conventional telephones are unavailable. They might also be in demand in countries with territories that are largely unpopulated. **********Organization officials said they expect the new system to cost between $500 million and $1 billion to put in place."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/26/world/germans-may-now-try-to-extradite-honecker.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 178, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Germans May Now Try To Extradite Honecker", "print_headline": "Germans May Now Try To Extradite Honecker", "body_text": " **********The collapse of Communism in the Soviet Union has raised new hopes here that the former East German Communist leader, Erich Honecker, might now be subject to extradition and trial. **********Mr. Honecker fled to the Soviet Union in March as prosecutors were preparing to charge him in connection with shoot-to-kill orders issued to guards along the Berlin Wall. **********A German newspaper, Bild am Sonntag, today quoted a former Kremlin adviser as predicting that Mr. Honecker would soon be sent home to face his accusers.

Using Available Technology **********The backers of the new venture are six of the most active trading firms in the Treasury market -- Goldman, Sachs & Company, the First Boston Corporation, Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Citicorp and Shearson Lehman Brothers. Those firms, in combination with 34 more firms that are also primary dealers in the Treasury market, trade about $100 billion of securities daily, and pay annual brokerage fees estimated at more than $500 million. In 1988, before Wall Street consolidations, there were 46 primary dealers. **********None of the firms would comment on EJV, whose initials stand for Electronic Joint Venture, but all six are known to be keenly interested in reducing costs in the highly competitive Treasury securities market. **********\"What we are doing is using the available technology in a way that over the long term will keep our costs well below our competitors,\" said Richard K. MacWilliams, president of EJV Brokerage. **********The competitors are a half-dozen brokering firms that match securities firms' orders to buy Treasury issues with orders to sell; they do no business with the general public. Securities dealers trade through brokers rather than directly with each other to conceal their identity and trading strategies. **********\"You have to question whether there is a need in this market for 40 primary dealers and five or six brokers,\" said Peter Carney, president of Fundamental Brokers Inc., one of the brokering firms, when asked about EJV. \"With so many people serving vanilla ice cream, you see people putting sprinkles on top to make themselves different.\" **********Harry Needleman, senior vice president at the Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Corporation, one of the largest brokers of Treasury securities, said the idea of matching buyers and sellers electroncially \"is something we have seriously considered,\" but he declined to discuss the firm's current plans. **********The prices and yields of Treasury securities are closely watched and serve as benchmarks for other interest rates ranging from home mortgages to short-term corporate i.o.u.'s. **********Most of the advantage of EJV comes, Mr. MacWilliams said, from its system of allowing buyers and sellers to enter the amounts and prices of securities they wish to trade directly into a computer, which then displays the information on a screen. **********Trades on the EJV system would also be handled by the computer, following instructions received directly from the securities dealer. The system would use a voice recognition system where each trader's voice pattern is identified by the computer so that trade instructions can be taken verbally rather than by entering numbers and letters on a keypad. At present, a securities dealer delivers instructions to a human broker. **********EJV has not yet set a price for its service, \"but we expect to have the lowest price in the market,\" Mr. MacWilliams said. He said the firm would begin brokering only Treasury bills and notes due in less than three years, but would expand to longer term issues by the end of the year. **********\"When you have a commodity-type product, such as Treasury securities, electronics can play a role in breaking down the cost structure, and that is what EJV is doing,\" said one of the largest dealers in government securities, who asked not to be identified.  Treasury Bill Fees Fall **********Securities dealers noted that anticipation of EJV's arrival had already caused brokerage fees on Treasury bills to fall by about a third to around $12 to $15 per $1 million of securities traded from about $20. **********In the long-term bond market, where EJV does not pose any immediate threat, brokering commissions are much higher -- about $39.06, or 1/256th of a point, for each $1 million of bonds. Brokers fees for long-term bonds were about twice as high in the early 1980's, before securities dealers joined forces to create Liberty Brokerage Inc., which cut prices to levels that became the industry standard. **********When EJV stops testing its system and begins live trading, Mr. MacWilliams expects that the firm will need only six to eight people to provide the training and instruction dealers need to use the new system for short-term issues, plus the Digital Equipment Corporation computer that organizes and displays the information that securities dealers provide. At a traditional brokering firm, more than a dozen brokers would be needed just to handle trading in very short-term Treasury issues, and a few hundred are needed to handle the full range of Treasury securities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/08/business/the-media-business-magazines-urged-to-be-aggressive.html": {"writer_name": "Deirdre Carmody", "pub_date": "1991-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 524, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Magazines Urged to Be Aggressive", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Magazines Urged to Be Aggressive", "body_text": " **********In a speech he billed as a \"call to arms,\" the chairman of the Magazine Publishers of America today asked for an industrywide effort to halt the shift of magazine advertising dollars to non-traditional advertising like telemarketing and supermarket rebates. **********\"Promotion alone is where 45 cents out of every advertising dollar goes today,\" the chairman, Reginald K. Brack Jr., told hundreds of magazine executives gathered here for the American Magazine Conference. \"Promotion is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and we should all be chasing that rainbow.\" **********He urged the executives to stop fighting one another for declining advertising dollars and to join in the effort to show advertisers that magazines are the most effective medium in which to distinguish their brands from those of their competitors. **********\"There are 1,300 magazines represented in this room this morning,\" he said. \"If each of you creates just one ad showing how a specific advertiser has been helped by an ad placed in each magazine you publish, can you imagine the effect?

The philosophical ones point out that it is the 250th anniversary of magazines (Andrew Bradford, a printer, beat out his old boss, Benjamin Franklin, by three days and published the country's first magazine, American Magazine, in January 1741) and that grim times are nothing new. Doing Away With Gimmicks **********Calling for \"nothing short of a revolution in the magazine business,\" Mr. Brack told publishers that they had to change the way they did business with their customers. He called for a halt to building up circulation with gimmicks and premiums just to attract advertisers. He also chided publishers for making pricing and editorial compromises. **********The speech was striking because of its assertions that the magazine industry was responsible for some of its own troubles. The industry has traditionally been in a self-congratulatory mood when it gathers for its annual meetings and has tended to deny that trouble existed. **********In an interview Mr. Brack said that too much attention had been placed on the business practices of magazines, like cross-media advertising, with too little focus on the effectiveness of the editorial side of magazines. As an example of editorial influence, he pointed to a recent article in Money magazine naming Seattle as the No. 1 city in the country, which resulted in such a mass of visitors coming to see for themselves that the highways around the city were clogged. **********\"Every good editor should know -- and every good publisher should acknowledge -- that the only important measure of a magazine comes from asking one question over and over: What are we doing for our readers?\" Mr. Brack said. **********\"No successful magazine was ever created just for the sake of an advertiser,\" he said. \"Readers are the masters we serve.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/17/business/merck-posts-18-higher-profit-for-quarter.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1991-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 478, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Merck Posts 18% Higher Profit for Quarter", "print_headline": "Merck Posts 18% Higher Profit for Quarter", "body_text": " **********In the latest in a string of strong quarterly results in the pharmaceutical industry, Merck & Company, the world's largest drug maker, said yesterday that profits rose 18.8 percent. **********Dr. P.

Impact of Strong Dollar **********Dr. Vagelos said that 45 percent of sales were outside the United States.

The negative effect of currency exchange on sales \"will worsen if the dollar remains where it is right now,\" Mr. Nordmann said. **********Sales of Merck's leading products continued to grow.

Vietnam Deception Recalled **********Both sides of this controversy concede that they are fighting the last war, the one in Vietnam. **********Journalists now mistrust the Government and especially the military in large part because of their experience of having been deceived in Vietnam, where officials consistently painted a much rosier picture of the war than turned out to be justified. \"Given the record of significant deception, reporters and the American people are entitled to skepticism,\" said Marvin Kalb, a veteran television correspondent who is now director of the Shorenstein Barone Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. **********Similarly, the view prevails within the military that the free rein journalists had in Vietnam led to reporting that seriously damaged morale and turned the country against its own troops. **********There is general agreement on two other points growing out of the Vietnam experience. **********The first is that if the press had more access to unfavorable information -- evidence, say, that equipment was malfunctioning or that a particular tactic had gone awry -- the journalists would focus on it. It is in the nature of journalism that bad news tends to be overemphasized and good news underplayed. **********The second point growing out of Vietnam is that if the public knew how gruesome the fighting was, more people would turn against the war. There is even a suspicion among journalists here that the Government wants to keep news of the damage and casualties in Iraq to a minimum to keep Arab allies from turning against the United States out of horror. On the Military's Side **********If members of Congress reflect public opinion on the question whether the Government is controlling the news too tightly, then the public, at least at the outset of the war, is clearly on the side of the military. **********At a briefing for lawmakers on Thursday evening, Representative Mary Rose Oakar, an Ohio Democrat, complained to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney about the degree of control. Her question was greeted with a chorus of groans from colleagues of both parties, and Mr. Cheney brushed off the question by saying he saw no problem. **********\"Not everybody was against me, but most of them certainly were,\" Ms. Oakar said later. **********The main complaint from editors is that by selectively releasing information, the Government has prevented reporting of the scale of the military operation in Iraq and Kuwait. **********\"We are not getting any information that really fully and properly describes the magnitude,\" said Max Frankel, executive editor of The New York Times. \"We don't know how many are participating, how much ordnance is being dropped. It's hard to remember this is a nonstop, massive operation, the likes of which we may not have seen before.\" **********Other editors agreed and said they could not understand why, after the fact, the Government could not describe the extent of destruction or provide some word about casualties from a night of bombing in Baghdad or of carpet bombing by B-52's in Kuwait. **********\"I can appreciate the national security concerns,\" said David Gergen, editor at large of U.S. News & World Report, who was director of the White House office of communications in the Ford and Reagan Administrations. \"But it appears to me,\" Mr. Gergen added, \"that there is too strong a tendency to lean toward less coverage the better.\" **********The Government's view, shared by many military experts, is that journalists do not understand the extent to which certain details could be helpful to the enemy and even endanger the lives of American pilots. At a Pentagon briefing for reporters Friday afternoon, Lieut. Gen. Thomas Kelly declined, for instance, to say what percentage of Iraqi planes had been knocked out of action. \"If I were in Iraq, I would want to know the answer to that question,\" he said. Reports Prove Wrong **********The main concern of Government officials is the misinformation that has found its way regularly onto the air. **********Then, on Thursday night, most if not all of the networks reported that Israel had launched a counterattack on Iraq. And after the second attack on Israel this morning, CBS News reported unequivocally that four missiles had struck Tel Aviv and 11 had hit Jerusalem.

As the reinforcements searched houses for suspected collaborators, people began to feel the enormity of the most significant action since some of the contras, who laid down their arms after the new center-right President, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, came to power, began rearming early this year. **********\"I don't know what Dona Violeta is going to do with two armies,\" said Donaldo Moreno Ceas. Surrounded by a group of friends gathered in a general store, he said that he was not home when the police came looking for him the night before and that the \"only crime of those being arrested is that we are not Sandinistas.\" **********Sitting in the bullet-scarred city hall, next door to the police station, Mayor Carlos Altamirano did not try to conceal his sympathies with the leader of the attackers, a man known as Comandante Indomable. **********\"Indomable had demanded a dialogue with the Government,\" said the Mayor, a skinny 29-year-old man in jeans and cowboy boots. \"I tried to mediate, but the Government didn't respond. Every day we kept hearing of an imminent attack. Then it came.\" **********At least two men died -- one on each side, according to the Mayor -- and several were wounded before the attackers withdrew. Other accounts put the number of dead as high as four. Mr. Altamirano said Comandante Indomable, whose real name is Jose Angel Moran Flores, was in hiding about 12 miles outside Quilali. **********Like other rearmed contras here in the department of Nueva Segovia and elsewhere across northwestern Nicaragua, Comandante Indomable demanded that Mrs. Chamorro dismiss Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra, the Sandinista who was allowed to continue as army chief despite the front's election defeat. **********He also demanded the breakup of the army, a general purging of former members of the state security force from police ranks, and a new police chief here. Further, he demanded that Mrs. Chamorro dismiss her chief minister, Antonio Lacayo, who is also her son-in-law. **********Keeping General Ortega, as well as the entire Sandinista command structure of the army and the police, was the trade-off Mrs. Chamorro made to be certain the Sandinista Front would peacefully turn over power. **********Shortly after she took office, more than 20,000 contras turned in or hid their weapons, ending a decade of war between them and the Sandinista Government. The Chamorro Government promised the contras personal security and help in returning to farming on their own or new land. **********But there are mounting claims from former contras and their families of abuses at the hands of the police. Dozens of killings have been confirmed -- some people who follow the situation closely say more than 200 have died -- and former rebels regularly complain of threats from the police or armed civilian supporters of the Sandinistas. **********Killings of Sandinistas by former contras appear to be far less numerous. **********General Ortega says more than 1,000 former rebels have taken up arms again. Most Nicaraguans call them \"re-contras.\"  Explosive Situation Seen **********Santiago Murray, an official of the Organization of American States, who directs the demobilization and assistance program for former contras, estimated the number of rearmed men at closer to 500. **********Supporters of the \"re-contras\" say the decisions by individual men to take up arms again have often come after relatives or former comrades in arms were killed or assaulted. **********People in Quilali said Comandante Indomable's return to arms about six weeks ago came after an attack on his farm in which his wife was fatally wounded. Later, just before the attack on the police station, a former contra was shot and wounded by the police at a party in Quilali, and another was killed as he rode on a bus near here."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/24/world/war-in-the-gulf-the-general-briefing-by-powell-a-data-filled-showcase.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Wines", "pub_date": "1991-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 374, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: The General; Briefing by Powell: A Data-Filled Showcase", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: The General; Briefing by Powell: A Data-Filled Showcase", "body_text": " **********In a nationally broadcast report on the Persian Gulf war today at the Pentagon, Gen.

Connecticut Bank and Trust, one of the state's largest lenders, had curtailed lending over the last year. **********\"The action of the F.D.I.C. has helped clean up the situation to the extent that there will be a buyer, and that it will provide a little bit more lending capability,\" said Edward J. Deak, an economics professor at Fairfield University in Fairfield, Conn., and the Connecticut analyst for the New England Economic Project, a nonprofit forecasting group. Calling In Loans **********But Peter M. Gioia, director of research for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, a trade organization based in Hartford, said that if the 135-branch New Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, as the bank was renamed by the F.D.I.C. on Sunday, remained unsold, the bank might have to call in loans to cover nonperforming assets, particularly real estate. \"You now have a major New England bank that is not making any more loans,\" he said. **********The bank lends to many of the companies based in the state, many of which say they will keep their accounts with the bank. As of Sept. 30, Connecticut Bank and Trust's loan portfolio was 28 percent commercial and industrial, 7 percent consumer, and 59 percent real estate and construction. The remaining 6 percent was made up of lending to the state and local municipalities and miscellaneous loans. **********Since 1989, four other Connecticut banks and savings institutions have been taken over by other financial institutions in the state after becoming insolvent. They were National Industrial Bank of Meriden, Columbia Federal Savings Bank of Westport, Brooklyn Savings Bank of Brooklyn, Conn., and Community Federal Savings and Loan of Bridgeport. **********Two other institutions -- the Charter Federal Savings and Loan of Stamford and Financial Federal Savings Bank of Hartford -- have been taken over by the Federal Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency in charge of the Government savings and loan bailout.

On Monday, the City of Hartford postponed a decision made on Friday to transfer $2 million to another bank. **********And Tuesday, the State Commissioner of Banking, Howard B. Brown, rescinded a Jan. 4 order that gave the city 30 days to remove its transaction accounts from the bank. **********The order had been issued because the bank fell below the requirement in a state law that says it must keep at least 3 percent of its assets in cash.

B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. has thrived under the freedoms brought by the deregulation of the trucking industry in 1980. **********A nonunion carrier, it benefited from lower costs, an absence of union work rules, and an aggressive management that knew how to exploit the opportunities created when hundreds of older unionized companies failed. Hunt, based in Lowell, Ark., saw its revenues grow to $579 million in 1990 from less than $100 million in the early 1980's. Hunt is the second-largest full-truck-load long-haul carrier, behind Schneider National Inc. of Green Bay, Wis. **********The company became a favorite of investors and analysts, whose reports helped push the price of the stock up to $33 a share in 1987, from an average in the low teens in 1985. It closed at $19.75 yesterday in over-the-counter trading. **********In recent years, Hunt has sustained growth of about 15 percent a year, but it expects to find it more difficult now to meet that target. **********When it faced a severe shortage of drivers, the company parked many trucks and then raised its pay rate to 33 cents a mile last year, from 25 cents a mile in 1987. The raises brought a flood of applicants, from which Hunt was able to pick the best, but its cost advantage over union carriers and other nonunion carriers has lessened. **********At the same time, its customers, like Ford Motor and Reynolds Metals, have become tougher. They are resisting rate increases and demanding better on-time service, particularly customers that are running their plants on just-in-time inventory deliveries. The recession has also caused many customers to take a sharper look at their haulers. **********\"They just had open-ended growth opportunities,\" said Paul R. Schlesinger, the trucking analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. \"As they could add equipment, they could fill it at decent rates.\" **********But competitors were also adding equipment, which put pressure on prices, making it difficult for truckers to make price increases stick, despite rising labor and fuel costs. **********Hunt's operating costs soared from 77 percent of total revenue in 1986 to 90.2 percent in 1990. At the same time, freight rates were steady until last year, when the industry was able to push through a 3 percent rise. \"They're at the crossroads,\" Mr. Schlesinger said. \"They've discovered that the growth that they had been counting on will not do the job.\" **********As a result, the management has entered new areas of trucking where Hunt has not shown the expertise it demonstrated in the long-haul, full-truckload market. **********Last year the carrier made its first acquisition of a company since 1978. It bought Bulldog Trucking, a short-haul trucking company in the Southeast, based in Carnesville, Ga., to spearhead its drive into the short-haul market. **********From 50 to 70 percent of freight is considered short-haul, thus providing a huge market for growth. Hunt is betting that its large size and reputation will enable it to gain market share quickly in a segment that is dominated by small trucking companies. **********Hunt also plans to build up its flatbed business, through which it hauls mostly building materials, another highly decentralized business dominated by owner-operators or small companies. **********Also, instead of competing in major corridors with railroads, which have made big improvements in the cost of hauling truck containers, Hunt has formed a partnership with the Santa Fe Railway for some of its long-haul business. **********Kirk Thompson, president and chief executive of Hunt, said that about one-third of Hunt's business was for hauls of less than 500 miles. \"This is not anything particularly new to us,\" he added. **********He said Hunt had been able to persuade some of its Fortune 500 customers, who use it for long hauls, to turn over their short-haul freight to the company, because many prefer limiting the number of vendors they use. **********He contended that with its investments in trucks and terminals and with a reputation on which it could now cash in, the company would not have trouble growing in the 90's. **********\"We took the risk and availed ourselves of the opportunities in the 1980's,\" he said, \"and now we have new opportunity in the 1990's.\" He added that the industry was resistant to economic slowdowns, commenting, \"You can live without frozen yogurt, but you can't live without transportation.\" **********Some analysts suggest that Hunt may even benefit from the recession, because it could lead to the failure of more carriers, giving the stronger companies an opportunity to pick up more customers. **********Mr. Thompson also argues that the larger companies have built up such an advantage over smaller truckers that it would be hard to catch up with the efficiencies that a large carrier has."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/23/business/imf-doubt-on-soviet-bid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.M.F.

A Divided Coalition **********Although the three opposition forces formed a loose coalition, it was always deeply divided, with followers of Prince Sihanouk and Mr. Son Sann almost as eager to prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to power as they were to oust the Government in Phnom Penh. **********On Thursday, in preparation for the future elections, Mr. Heng Samrin's party dropped its commitment to Communism, accepted political pluralism and free-market economics and changed its name. **********Under the peace agreement, which is to go into effect as soon as it is signed on Wednesday, the 12-member Supreme National Council, formed from the four factions and led by Prince Sihanouk, will assume the powers of government. But it will also surrender enormous power to what will be known as the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, or Untac. **********This week, the Security Council approved the dispatch of the first peacekeeping unit to Cambodia, comprising 268 military officers and civilians under the command of a French officer, Brig. Gen. Jean-Michel Loridon. It will be in charge of monitoring the initial cease-fire and recommending the size of the main United Nations contingent. **********Some estimates have put the eventual United Nations presence as high as 20,000 soldiers and civilian administrators. **********Before the United Nations can begin preparing for elections by organizing voter registration and drawing up an electoral code, it faces the intimidating task of securing a cease-fire, insuring the withdrawal of the remaining Vietnamese troops, gathering the warring armies in designated areas and taking charge of their weapons. **********The United Nations will also assume responsibility for assisting the return to Cambodia of some 350,000 refugees living in camps across the border in Thailand."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/08/world/after-the-war-the-overview-red-cross-says-iraqis-will-release-journalists.html": {"writer_name": "R.

But the spokesman, Dr. Akram al-Witry, also said the Iraqi Government was \"now engaged in a search for the missing journalists to insure they are safe,\" the statement quoted by the news agency said. **********The six participating nations -- the United States, Britain, France, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Iraq -- signed a \"memorandum of understanding,\" the Red Cross said, agreeing to expedite the repatriation of prisoners of war held by the allies and civilian internees held by the Iraqis. It made no specific reference to the number of Kuwaitis held or to the journalists. **********The American command's statement early today said the mass repatriation of Iraqis would begin on Monday, with \"several hundred\" prisoners returning from holding camps in Saudi Arabia each day. **********Iraq says it has already released all of the allied prisoners it held. The Pentagon said Thursday that 24 Americans were now listed as missing in action, including the 14 crewmen of an AC-130 gunship that went down over the Bay of Kuwait. Navy divers are trying to recover their bodies. **********Earlier Thursday, two Iraqi lieutenant colonels and four soldiers arrived at First Infantry Division headquarters near Safwan and asked to talk to the Red Cross about the organization's representatives coming to Basra to pick up the Kuwaiti detainees and foreign journalists.  Offer to Free Journalists **********Thomas Pizer, a Red Cross official, said at Safwan that the Iraqis were prepared to hand over 21 journalists, whose names and nationalities were not given. Gian Battista Beccheta, another Red Cross official, who spoke with reporters in Kuwait City, put the number to be released at 29. **********Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said the best count available to American authorities was 38 journalists missing behind Iraqi lines. They represent news organizations in the United States, France, Britain, Norway, Italy and Brazil. **********Ten Americans, including Chris Hedges of The New York Times, are on that list. Two other journalists who had been on the list, Chris Everson and Tim Dickey of CBS News, turned up at the 24th Division, in good shape after spending several days in the custody of Iraqi troops, Mr. Williams said. **********According to an Iraqi opposition leader, the journalists were detained to prevent them photographing or writing about civil unrest in Basra.  U.S. Holds Iraq Responsible **********In Washington, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said that the United States would hold Iraq responible for the journalists' safety. But he added, despite the Red Cross officials' statements, \"Unfortunately, it may not be that Iraq has them.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/20/business/stocks-slide-in-tokyo.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 40, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stocks Slide in Tokyo", "print_headline": "Stocks Slide in Tokyo", "body_text": " **********Stock prices fell today in Tokyo.

But its walls are intended to keep out people, not commodities. **********A flood of people fleeing poverty and political unrest in parts of Eastern Europe, in Africa and in South Asia has combined with years of high unemployment in Europe to inflame social and political tensions not only in European Community countries but in Austria and Switzerland as well. **********A total of 500,000 people applied for asylum in Western Europe as a whole last year, according to the British Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker. And as unemployment levels have risen in every major European economy this year, popular resentment at the influx has nurtured right-wing political movements in Belgium, Switzerland, France and Germany, among others. Heaviest Influx in Germany **********Time-consuming asylum procedures, including an obligation to house and feed applicants while their cases are being decided, are also imposing a drain on governments already hard pressed to meet welfare demands, and raising questions about how European countries that have never thought of themselves as ethnic melting pots can preserve their national identities. **********The influx has been heaviest in Germany, which because of its past is the European country most inhibited from just sending the refugees packing. As the richest European nation and with a population just over 79 million, it already has its hands full coping with the estimated 2.5 million ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe who have taken up citizenship over the last three years, a right the 1949 Constitution automatically guaranteed to Germans everywhere. **********While 500,000 applications for asylum does not seem a lot in a continent of more than 300 million people, there are hundreds of thousands more illegal immigrants in most of the principal countries. Until 1985, the number of applications for asylum in Europe and North America combined had never exceeded 250,000. **********Not since the collapse of colonialism after World War II have the countries of Europe faced influxes of people on such a scale. Then, the immigration of hundreds of thousands of Indians and Pakistanis helped change the face of Britain, as the flow of North and Central Africans changed the faces of France and Belgium. **********Now the process is repeating itself in countries that had no overseas empires, challenging Germans, for instance, to re-examine their long-held aversion to immigration by other ethnic groups. While the Europeans are only groping for answers, they seem more intent this time on keeping as many of these people out as they can, if only they can find a way. **********Last summer, Italy sent entire boatloads of would-be asylum-seekers from Albania back across the Adriatic Sea, much as the United States has been barring Haitians from coming across the Caribbean. Spian  Public Attitudes Largely Tolerant **********European approaches to the problem vary greatly from country to country. In Spain, which has tolerated large-scale illegal immigration from Morocco for years, public attitudes so far are relatively tolerant. **********Abdalia Aziz Dukuly, a 27-year-old refugee from the civil war in Liberia, discovered that life in Spain would not be easy after he arrived in the Canary Islands on a freighter from Mauretania on Oct. 29. \"I lost my family, so I had nothing to lose,\" he said one recent morning at the Spanish Red Cross headquarters in Madrid, waiting in a corridor with a score of other refugees, most of them new arrivals from Africa. **********\"My mother was killed in the fighting,\" he said, \"and I made up my mind to come and hide in Europe. They told me in Las Palmas that Spain couldn't accept me unless I went to the capital, so here I am.\" **********It is not easy to establish grounds to stay in any European country as a refugee. Under the terms of the 1951 United Nations Convention that all European Community countries, as well as the United States, are pledged to observe, asylum can be granted only to someone who can prove a \"well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\" **********Only seven percent of applications for refugee or asylum status in Spain are approved, a figure roughly typical for the whole of the European Community, and for a basic reason: Most \"refugees\" coming to Europe actually want to build a better life for themselves, either here or, eventually, back home, and perhaps therefore are better described as immigrants. **********Since few European countries permit much immigration at all, the only way to get a foot in the door is to sneak into countries like Spain, which until recently did not even require visas of people coming over from Morocco, or to fly into an airport and ask for asylum, then taking advantage of the time it takes to determine qualification to settle down and take root anyway. **********But gradually, the new arrivals are beginning to change the face of the country in unexpected ways, even in Spain, where the numbers -- about 5,000 a year -- are relatively small in a total population of more than 39 million. A surprising number of Spaniards had never laid eyes on a black person before Africans began arriving, for instance. **********\"King Balthazar was the only black most people here had ever been familiar with,\" said Felix Barrena, director of the Spanish Red Cross Center for Assistance to Foreigners, referring to one of the Three Magi. **********Referring to the difficulties asylum-seekers have in being integrated in Spanish society, he said: \"It's a social problem, not a racial problem, in my experience. People see refugees sleeping in the parks, and last summer some of them were caught selling drugs on the Plaza de Espana, and they make stereotypical judgments.\" **********So far Spain has been spared the kind of organized campaigns against foreigners that have seen gangs of skinheads demonstrate against and attack Vietnamese and other refugees in some of the hardest-hit industrial towns in eastern Germany, where unemployment after the collapse of the Communist economy has soared to around 50 percent of the work force. Germany  Both Acceptance And Resistance **********The integration of foreigners, whether they are immigrants or refugees, has come a long way in Germany, which has had substantial populations of Yugoslavs, Turks and Italians since the 1960's, when they were invited in as \"guest workers.\" **********In Berlin, for example, 312,374 foreigners now make up 11 percent of the population, and 136,302 of them are Turks. In 1960, there were only 22,065 non-German people in the city. **********The civil war in Yugoslavia has sent more Yugoslavs fleeing into Germany in recent months, and they have displaced Romanians as the largest single group seeking asylum there. **********Many Germans have been as shocked as the rest of the world by the beatings and firebomb attacks on refugee centers. As Barbara John, the Berlin city official in charge of helping foreigners, sees it, the public image of Germany as a country where neo-Nazi thugs terrorize anybody who does not look German distorts the true picture. **********\"That has happened mainly in the East, and it's a sign of the collapse of the old system and of the order that held it up,\" she said. **********Racism in a mostly homogeneous, white society like Germany can hide better than it does in a country like Britain or Belgium that had to accept a large number of immigrants from former colonies. **********And Mrs. John was optimistic. \"We know many Germans don't object to foreigners being here,\" she said. Hundreds of thousands of them took to the streets in November to protest the harassment of foreigners and to demand that the authorities do more to stop it. **********The reason Germany attracts almost two-thirds of the total number of asylum-seekers in the European Community, according to many officials, is that the German Constitution gives them a better chance of getting one foot in the door. It allows anyone a chance to make a claim and obliges the state to look after them while officials painstakingly examine it. **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl tried this year to get the Constitution changed to allow a speedup in the examination procedure, which might discourage some \"refugees\" from coming, but he was blocked by the opposition Social Democrats. **********Failing that, he tried at the meeting of European leaders in Maastricht, the Netherlands, to get the others to agree to a common asylum and immigration policy to be decided by majority vote. Instead, they agreed to coordinate them as closely as possible by the end of 1993, in effect putting off an attempt to find a solution. **********\"Politicians show a helplessness that confuses and disturbs voters,\" Mrs. John said. One way out, she suggested, might be for countries like Germany to give up the pretense that they do not allow immigration -- since most of the asylum seekers who stay on are not expelled even if they are rejected -- and instead to set limits on numbers of immigrants. **********With civil war in Yugoslavia and economic chaos in the territory of the old Soviet Union, German newspapers and magazines often speak of the threat of millions of refugees flooding in unless something is done to bar the door. But so far, the main group that has come are the descendants of ethnic Germans imported into Russia in the 18th century by Catherine the Great.  And according to the weekly news magazine Der Spiegel, only 50,000 non-Germans have been granted German citizenship in the last 10 years. France  New Citizens And Illegal Aliens **********In France, by contrast, the census of 1990 showed that 1.77 million people who had acquired their French citizenship were living in the country at the end of the year, representing 3.13 percent of the total population of more than 56 million. **********Estimates of the number of foreigners living illegally in France range to the hundreds of thousands. Many of them work in the construction industry in big cities like Paris, Lyon or Marseille, according to Michel Devacht, a caseworker with the French Democratic Confederation of Labor. **********\"Any economist will tell you these people are necessary for the economy,\" Mr. Devacht said, because they do dirty or disagreeable work that French workers no longer want to do.  \"But there are three million unemployed, so they are a scapegoat.\" **********Last month, the ultra-right National Front party of Jean-Marie Le Pen proposed an anti-immigration platform that would ship out unwanted aliens by boat, and put those awaiting expulsion into guarded camps. **********It is not competition for jobs, but skin color that often defines the true nature of the antagonism, according to many experts. **********\"What worries the French is not the number of people who are legally foreigners, but the number of non-European immigrants and their children,\" Robert Sole wrote last month in the daily Le Monde. **********Mr. Devacht said, \"Eastern Europeans are invisible.\" Black Africans and people from the formerly French territories of North Africa stood out and were resented, even though statistics show that the North Africans are 80 percent more likely to lose their jobs in hard times than \"native\" French workers are, according to Mr. Sole. Britain New Rules Due On Asylum-Seekers **********Nowhere is the racist aspect of the new European anxiety about immigrants more open than in Britain, where there were fewer than 20,000 nonwhite residents before the collapse of the empire. **********Today the nonwhite population is about 2.6 million, 4.7 percent of the population of about 56 million and more than half of them of Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi origin, according to official statistics, and about one-fifth of West Indian origin. Yet it is still possible for a well-dressed black man to walk into a barbershop, as one did near Victoria Station the other day, and cause all three Italian barbers to stop snipping. Asked what he wanted, the man answered, \"A haircut.\" Apologetically but firmly, the chief barber answered, \"We don't know how to cut your kind of hair.\" **********British immigration from former colonies has been largely stopped, and only about 50,000 people a year are accepted here for settlement every year, many of them from Canada or Australia. The thought that more are seeking entry, most of them from Asia or Africa, raises fears among some Britons that their country might soon become ethnically unrecognizable. **********Applications for asylum in Britain have risen from 5,000 in 1988 to an estimated 50,000 this year, according to Home Secretary Baker. **********The British are enacting new legislation so the authorities can determine whether asylum-seekers qualify within 90 days, instead of years as before.  Refugees would have only two days to appeal refusals, in writing, to immigration officials who could decide, without a hearing, within five days whether an \"arguable\" case exists. **********\"I do not think the problem is a question of numbers, though numbers make it worse,\" wrote Charles Moore in The Spectator Magazine, known for its conservatism, earlier this fall. **********\"It is a question of race,\" he went on. \"You can be British without speaking English or being Christian or being white, but nevertheless Britain is basically English-speaking, Christian and white, and if one starts to think that it might become basically Urdu-speaking and Muslim and brown, one gets frightened and angry.\" **********So the reaction has led, as it has in other European countries, to pressure to crack down and keep more such people out. At the beginning of November, Britain doubled the fine on foreign airlines that fly in foreigners without proper entry documents, from $:1,000 to $:2,000, or $3,600, per person. **********The problem, as Amnesty International and other organizations that look after the rights of asylum-seekers and refugees have pointed out, is that most people who do qualify for asylum are likely as not to arrive without passports or visas because asking for them in the countries from which they fled could have been dangerous. **********Increasingly, the London-based human rights organization said in a report at the end of November, all governments in Europe, not just Britain's, are taking a restrictive approach toward asylum-seekers. And increasingly, they are playing with people's lives. **********Last March, in an example Amnesty International cited in its report, 17 Tamils from Sri Lanka, which has been torn by civil strife for the last several years, arrived at Schwechat Airport in Vienna and claimed asylum. The Austrian authorities turned them back to Rome, through which they had passed in transit on their way to Vienna, saying that because they had first arrived on Italian soil, Italy should consider their claim first. **********\"In Vienna, they were held in the transit lounge and denied access to a U.N. representative,\" Amnesty International reported. Upon their return to Italy, they were sent back to Sri Lanka as \"deportees in transit\" from Austria. **********United Nations officials said later that at least some of the Tamils had presented \"clear grounds for asylum\" to the Austrian airport authorities, according to Amnesty. The Outlook Restrictions Seem Most Likely **********Small wonder, perhaps, that at Maastricht, the European Community countries agreed to leave asylum policies in the hands of national governments, for the most part, instead of agreeing to common policies. **********\"That would have lost us our ability to control our own borders,\" said a British official close to Prime Minister John Major. \"The long-term solution is to strengthen everybody's external frontiers.\" **********The outlook, as Eastern Europe and the lands of the former Soviet Union continue to be wracked by upheavals, is for a restrictive policy that, in most countries, favors whites from Eastern Europe who can speak the language of the country they seek to settle in and have, in the eyes of the authorities, a reasonable chance of economic success. **********\"Either we continue with a very restrictive immigration policy,\" Mr. Moore wrote in The Spectator, \"or we develop a more liberal one which is more 'racist.' \" **********With nationalist parties feeding off the discontent with the present trend in Belgium, Germany, Austria, and France, many outsiders fear that he may be right."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/19/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-771891.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Hong Kong Tourist Association to Bozell Inc., New York.

Primakov, told the newspaper Izvestia that what the Government's reform plan needed was coordinated support from the West to help make the ruble fully convertible and keep inflation down when prices are fully decontrolled. Other Soviet officials say controls are to be lifted by the end of next year. **********With a United States-Soviet summit meeting in Moscow tentatively planned to start at the end of June or early July, according to Western diplomats here, Mr. Primakov said he thought the Soviet delegation he led to Washington last week had convinced President Bush that the latest Soviet Government economic reform plan was a serious attempt to move as fast as possible to a market economy. **********In its latest form, he repeated, it laid out a schedule of privatization \"by certain deadlines.\" 'Trickled Into the Sands' **********\"Bush knows that much of what we got in the past trickled into the sands,\" Mr. Primakov acknowledged of Western credits in the past. \"But now he has seen that the new approach is not connected with that but with coordination and synchronization of our actions.\" **********As a first step, Mr. Primakov said, the ruble should be made convertible with other currencies on the Soviet internal market, but to prevent its sudden collapse would require international help, in the form of a stabilization fund. A dollar on the black market here now costs 32 rubles, while some retired people receive a pension of only 79 rubles a month. **********He denied Western reports that he and other officials in Washington last week had told the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that the Soviet economy would need $250 billion in Western aid. **********\"I am convinced that these figures will not crop up from our side during the London summit,\" Mr. Primakov said. 'Economy of Complete Scarcity' **********Maintaining that the latest Soviet Government plan was intended to lead to the complete lifting of all price controls, Mr. Primakov said: \"When price controls are lifted, they begin to rise at first. It's one thing when the market is saturated with goods, and quite another when it's an economy of complete scarcity. So here we will need support and aid from outside.\" **********What the Soviets will be asking for, according to Mr. Primakov and other officials, is Western commodity aid -- not just credits to buy food and other scarce consumer goods -- during the transition period, to keep prices from spiraling out of control. **********\"The Soviet Union is the only large, unexploited, capacious market in the world where somehow there is already a serious industrial base,\" he said. \"Already many are trying, even in not very good conditions, to enter this market just to be in position later.\" **********Legal and financial conditions that would finally encourage large-scale private investment from the West still lie in the distant future. Last week, Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov presented a draft bill on foreign investment to the standing Soviet legislature. If approved, it would allow foreign companies to buy up to 100 percent of some Soviet enterprises, but not in the military industry, and take out profits in hard currency.

In the case, regulators had challenged the propriety of roughly $900,000 in loans that Peter Meeks, the Peat partner in charge of the San Francisco Federal Savings audit, had borrowed from the institution over seven years to build a home in Portola Valley, Calif. **********Though the accounting profession has long tolerated auditors taking out certain loans, like mortgages, from institutions whose books they check, the issue has become a hot one lately because of the number of financial institutions that have failed without any warning from the independent auditors. **********In the case of San Francisco Federal, The Office of Thrift Supervision, the primary Washington regulator for savings and loan associations, contended that the loans to Mr. Meeks involved special considerations. It rejected Peat's 1990 report on the institution's financial statements on the ground the audit was tainted. **********Last month, without admitting any fault, the bank and its chief executive, Roger L. Gordon, consented to a cease-and-desist order that prevents them from making new loans to most outside professionals they hire and agreed to pay $80,000 in fines. **********Peat, in contrast, has defended the loans as complying with all applicable rules and has refused to settle. **********Still, the far-reaching investigation, which was first reported by The American Banker yesterday, took the accounting firm by surprise. Though Peat has always had one of the largest practices in the savings field, it has not been hurt nearly as much as other accounting firms in the collapse of hundreds of savings institutions. **********One of the most prominent cases involving questionable loans to auditors is being pursued by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Ernst & Young, the successor to Arthur Young. **********The investigation reportedly concerns commercial real estate loans that dozens of Arthur Young partners had with Republicbank, an audit client. Though Arthur Young gave the bank clean opinions in all the years it worked for the bank, the bank failed shortly after it merged with the Interfirst Corporation and became the Republicbank Corporation. **********The Government's inquiry into Peat, said Joseph Mauriello, national director of Peat's savings practice, is \"just totally out of proportion to the narrow issue and concern they have, which is with San Francisco Fed.\" He called the investigation a fishing expedition.

He added that Peat had also offered to work with savings regulators in tightening up the profession's rules. **********\"They had asked us to settle,\" he said, \"and we said: 'No, thank you.

And as the result of the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt, Israel returned the Sinai but has retained control over the other areas. **********Asked what assurances the Syrian leader had given Mr. Baker, Mr. Sharaa said that if Israel \"had no plans for a greater Israel or maintaining some of the occupied territories, what President Assad told Secretary Baker is very assuring.\" **********\"There would be a termination of the state of war, guarantees -- international guarantees -- at the conclusion of the peace process after Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab lands.\" **********Questioned as to whether those guarantees covered chemical weapons, the Syrian offical said that details had not been discussed, but added: \"We would be ready to make the Middle East a zone free of all mass destruction weapons.

Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said the President had not yet made a formal decision to extend China's trading privileges, known as most-favored-nation status, for another year. **********Mr. Bush's statement today highlighted not only the basic conflict between the White House and Congress over how to handle relations with China but also the highly secretive and personal way in which the President operates when it comes to relations with the authorities in Beijing. Calls It a 'Big Pitch' **********Mr. Bush considers himself an expert on China after serving as envoy to Beijing in 1975 and generally makes all decisions on Chinese-American relations with one or two advisers in the Oval Office. He disclosed his intentions about China's trading status today without waiting for the normal option papers from Government agencies. His comments took his own staff and other departments by surprise. **********Despite Mr. Fitzwater's efforts to mitigate the political impact of Mr. Bush's statement, the President's intentions seemed clear when he told reporters on the White House South Lawn that he had made a \"big pitch\" for renewing China's trade status during a Capitol Hill lunch with Republican lawmakers. Under Federal law, the President has until June 3 to recommend the extension formally; the trading privileges expire on July 3. **********Mr. Bush acknowledged that \"there are major problems in China\" on human rights, arms exports and other issues, but added, \"I want to see M.F.N. for China continue.\" **********Most-favored-nation status fixes tariffs on imports at the lowest prevailing rates and is not normally granted to Communist countries, including the Soviet Union.  Reward for Support on Gulf **********The President said he did not want to isolate Beijing and indicated that he was trying in part to reward China for not blocking American actions at the United Nations during the Persian Gulf crisis. Mr. Bush said today that he was considering asking the Security Council, where China has veto power, for a new resolution that would send a United Nations police force to northern Iraq. **********\"I look at the big picture,\" he said. \"I look at the support we got from China back in Desert Storm, the importance of China as a country. And I don't want to see us isolate them.

But many lawmakers, who want to squeeze China financially, say the diplomatic efforts have failed so far. **********\"We've had far too many high-level contacts and not much result,\" said Representative Don J. Pease, Democrat of Ohio, who tried to tie China trade to human rights issues last year. **********Other lawmakers zeroed in on the quid pro quo suggested by Mr. Bush in his comments today. \"It's unfortunate that the President sees China in such a different light from any other country,\" said Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California. \"He makes the argument about China's cooperation in the Persian Gulf war and yet we don't have most-favored nation with the Soviet Union, which was even more cooperative.\" **********Ms. Pelosi is sponsoring a bill that would extend China's trading status for this year but make the 1992 extension contingent on human rights improvements and other conditions. Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, the majority leader, plans to introduce a similar bill on Thursday. Limited Requirements Now **********Under current law, Mr. Bush need not consider human rights and other issues in deciding on trade with China. Under a provision of law known as the Jackson-Vanick Amendment, the granting of favored trade status is tied only to emigration. **********China, which sold $15.2 billion in goods to American companies last year, is the eighth-largest exporter to the United States. But its purchases of $4.8 billion made it only the 18th-largest importer of American products. **********Administration officials said the options papers on extending Chinese trade privileges had not even been completed, much less sent to the White House, when Mr. Bush spoke today. The President had received only a strategy memo from Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d that did not discuss the pros and cons of extending the trading privileges but merely outlined ways to sell the idea to Congress, one official said. **********It was not entirely clear why the President chose to reveal his position on China trade so precipitously in an unscheduled question-and-answer session on the White House South Lawn. **********But some officials said the President felt the pressure of time because of two coming events that would make such an announcement particularly inappropriate. On May 23, China plans to unveil a monument to its absorption of Tibet, which is not recognized by the United States, and June 4, a day after the deadline for the trade decision, is the second anniversary of the violence on Tiananmen Square. **********Congress has been pushing Mr. Bush to punish Beijing for that crackdown on political dissent, while the President has always sought to balance those pressures with economic pressures from American companies that do business with China and his strong personal penchant for maintaining relations with Beijing. **********\"I go back to the days when I was in China as the equivalent of Ambassador and though there are major problems in China, things we don't like about their system, things are an awful lot better than they were back in 1975,\" Mr. Bush said. Envoy Dispatched **********Last month, Mr. Bush blocked the sale of satellite parts to China because of concern about its sale of missiles and other weapons to Pakistan and other nations. Earlier this month, Robert M. Kimmitt, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, was sent to Beijing for what American officials called a candid discussion about human rights, trade and weapons sales. **********But since the Tiananmen Square violence in 1989, Mr. Bush came under steady fire from Capitol Hill for not speaking out more strongly against Beijing or taking tough action, like cutting off China's favorable trade status. **********The pressure dramatically increased when it was disclosed in December 1989 that Mr. Bush had sent his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and the Deputy Secretary of State, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, on a secret mission to Beijing that the President later admitted was a failure."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/07/business/business-people-son-of-co-founder-named-president-of-sturm-ruger.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1991-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 317, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Son of Co-Founder Named President of Sturm Ruger", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Son of Co-Founder Named President of Sturm Ruger", "body_text": " **********William B.

The implants can cost more than twice as much as dentures but they are more secure, easier to maintain and less likely to irritate gums or harm adjacent natural teeth. **********\"This field is as hot as can be,\" said Dr. Dennis Tarnow, chairman of New York University's recently formed Department of Implant Dentistry. Consumer spending on dental implants could top a half-billion dollars in the United States this year. **********\"Back in 1988, experts were saying we would have them in 100,000 people by 1992,\" Dr. Tarnow said. \"But it's been growing twice as fast as most people expected.\"  Centuries of Experimentation **********Physicians have been experimenting with dental implants since the days of the Pharaohs. Over the centuries, wood and a variety of metals have been tried. But until researchers began working with titanium in the 1960's, even the best implants were not anchored firmly enough to last more than a few years and the tissue around them was prone to infection. **********Titanium's advantage is that bone tissue actually fuses to it. Today, some implants are coated with a form of synthetic bone to speed the bonding process, which is known as osseointegration. **********\"For reasons we don't understand yet, titanium seems to bond with successive generations of bone cells while other materials lose their bonding power over time,\" said Leif Ek, chief executive of Nobelpharma A.B., the Swedish company that is the worldwide leader in implants. **********Industry sources estimate that implant suppliers in the United States will generate between $90 million and $100 million in revenues this year from oral surgeons, periodontists and dentists who specialize in constructing false teeth. **********Those figures will be dwarfed if, as experts expect, implants eventually take over a large part of the denture market. In the United States alone, there are 40 million denture wearers. Another 60 million Americans are missing one or more teeth and make do without dentures. **********\"We are just at the beginning of what this can do,\" said Gerald A. Niznick, a dentist who founded the Core-Vent Corporation, the leading domestic implant company, in 1982. \"We estimate that only about 11 percent of dentists are working with implants now. As the older people retire and new dentists who have learned how to do implants in school get started, that will change.\" **********For a dental patient, a single tooth implant can cost from $800 to $2,500, depending on the difficulty of the case and on the region of the country where the surgery is performed. Whole arches, which use multiple implants to anchor a complete set of false teeth for the upper or lower jaw, might cost as much as $15,000, barring unusual complications. Implants are most cost competitive with dentures in cases where a single tooth is to be replaced; the implant can be done without grinding down and capping the neighboring teeth, as is required with a single denture. But to date, dental insurance plans rarely cover implants. A Fortunate Discovery **********Nobelpharma owes its industry leadership to a lucky accident in 1952. Per-Ingvar Branemark, a Swedish university professor investigating how living bone recovers from wounds, found that the tiny titanium microscope he had inserted into bone tissue had become stuck. He began a long string of careful experiments on the phenomenon and by 1965 had developed the tools and techniques for implanting titanium roots to anchor false teeth. The artificial teeth attached to those first roots are still functioning, Nobelpharma says. **********Dr. Branemark methodically developed carefully controlled studies of the performance of his implants, and even today he works at refining techniques at the Institute for Applied Biotechnology in Goteborg, Sweden. His emphasis on the need for clinical studies, which many rival companies today credit with \"professionalizing\" the industry, led to a slow international product rollout by Nobelpharma. By 1984, when the company set up a unit in the United States to market its product, Core-Vent was already marketing its own titanium implants at prices as much as 40 percent lower, by some estimates. **********Nobelpharma is a subsidiary of Nobel Industrier A.B., a troubled conglomerate currently controlled by Nordenbanken, a bank owned by the Government of Sweden. Last year was the first that Nobelpharma had a positive cash flow, Mr. Ek said. **********Nobelpharma's efforts to begin reaping the benefits of its decades of investment are being hindered by competition from German and Swiss implant designs as well as those of Core-Vent and smaller American companies. Dr. Tarnow estimates that 40 implant systems are currently on the American market. Many Competitors **********Industry executives estimate that Nobelpharma now controls about a third of the American market as measured by sales revenue, followed closely by Core-Vent, which is based in Encino, Calif. Core-Vent recently sold all rights to market its products to Dentsply Holdings Inc. of York, Pa., the world's largest dental supplies company. Core-Vent offers the broadest product range and asserts that it actually leads Nobelpharma in unit sales, once its lower prices are taken into account. Other domestic vendors include Calcitek Inc. of San Diego, a subsidiary of Swiss-owned Intermedics Inc.; the Denar Corporation of Anaheim, and Implant Innovations Inc. of West Palm Beach, Fla. **********Dr. Niznick gives Dr. Branemark credit for convincing dentists that osseointegration works. But Core-Vent and Nobelpharma have been almost continually locked in litigation in recent years and conflicting patent claims have entangled other companies. Core-Vent is now pursuing antitrust, false advertising and libel claims against Nobelpharma in Federal District Court in Los Angeles. No trial date has been set. **********The differences between the various implant systems reflect minute design features whose long-term impact remains to be seen. The leading German approach, known as the IMZ system, marketed in the United States by Interpore International of Cambridge, Mass., incorporates a small plastic shock absorber. **********The most popular Swiss technique, called the ITI method, marketed in this country by the Straumen Company in Cambridge, challenges the prevailing notion that the implant root must be buried under a flap of the gum during the months it takes for bonding to occur. The ITI system eliminates the need for a second surgical operation to penetrate the gum when the supporting abutment and false tooth are added to the root. **********Despite the competition, everyone concedes that the biggest factors for success are choosing the right dentist and the appropriate implant design for a particular case. **********In general, the chances for success are considerably higher in the lower jaw -- about 95 percent -- because it is a thicker bone. But dentists say achieving such high rates requires rejecting a large number of potential patients whose jaws are not healthy enough to make success likely."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/28/business/oil-rig-count-rises.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Oil Rig Count Rises", "print_headline": "Oil Rig Count Rises", "body_text": " **********The number of working oil and gas rigs in the United States rose slightly last week, with 28 new rigs working, Baker Hughes Inc. said today.

Faces a Harsher World in 90's", "body_text": " **********From a technology standpoint I.B.M.'s house is largely in order, most analysts agree. But the company is clearly worried that it is moving too slowly to transform itself into a pared-down company that can compete in the new world of the 1990's, those analysts say. **********The International Business Machines Corporation announced on Tuesday that it expected sharply lower revenues for the year than most analysts had anticipated. And that sent its stock tumbling, down $12.75 on Tuesday and another $1 yesterday, to $114.125. **********Historically, I.B.M. has always sold itself as a company that could handle any customer's computing needs. But as it has begun to reduce its staff by tens of thousands of workers, through attrition and incentive programs, I.B.M. has found itself stretched thin at some points on the broad front it is trying to cover. **********Not long ago a new chief executive at a major I.B.M. customer had to wait two months after he took office before an I.B.M. salesman made an introductory courtesy call. **********\"How long do you think it should have taken?\" asked the executive, who insisted on anonymity. I.B.M. is still too cumbersome, he said. I.B.M. said on Tuesday that it would continue to reduce its staff, an acknowledgement that it has a distance to go to become the leaner, more competitive powerhouse it hopes to be. **********For decades, I.B.M. has been a powerful battleship, formidable but slow to turn and maneuver. And now it finds itself surrounded by hundreds of smaller, quicker rivals. Unable to stand up to I.B.M.'s firepower, these companies seek to change the rules of engagement to a new way of computing known as open systems. **********In an open system, customers can mix equipment from different manufacturers, as they choose, and find software that will run on the resulting setup. This is attractive to customers because they can shop around for the best prices and modify their systems to reflect innovations. **********The shift to open systems challenges the heart of I.B.M.'s business: the ultra-powerful $10 million to $20 million water-cooled mainframes running I.B.M. software and cared for by I.B.M. technicians. It is on such systems that giant corporations have based their businesses. **********So I.B.M. is trying a balancing act: modifying its computers to incorporate open systems while persuading its largest customers to shift from one generation of its mainframe computers to its next one.  'Troubling Problem' **********I.B.M. has added features to the new mainframes to enable them to plug in and play with other companies' equipment in open systems. But with the commitment to open systems comes another problem: I.B.M. is exposed to competition. **********\"In the long run this is a very troubling problem for I.B.M.,\" said Gary Curtis, a partner in the Boston Consulting Group. \"The company will have to learn how to maintain high margins in an open systems world.\" **********And compounding the other problems is the global economy, which has many spots of weakness. **********\"It has to be their nightmare,\" said Daniel Mandresh, a computer industry analyst at Merrill Lynch who has followed I.B.M. for many years. \"It's a company that gets 61 percent of its revenue from overseas and suddenly finds that local results are weakening while facing a rapid acceleration in the strength of the dollar.\" **********The weak dollar was a significant factor in the unexpected strength that I.B.M. showed in its final quarter last year. But that may come back to haunt it in the second half of this year, when many analysts were expecting the company to shine. **********Another factor appears to be that I.B.M. may have shifted revenue forward to strengthen the final quarter of last year, and may be paying the price now. \"It's a fairly arbitrary decision of where you book the revenues,\" said Robert Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research, a Phoenix market research company. \"I.B.M. may have borrowed revenues from 1991 to beef up last year.\" **********I.B.M. disputes that, saying it is unlikely that companies making multimillion-dollar purchasing decisions could shift them casually.  Analysts Surprised **********Many analysts who follow the company said yesterday that they were stunned that I.B.M. seemed to be giving up on 1991 so early in the year. **********\"It's really unbelievable for I.B.M. to be in a situation where they essentially concede the year in March,\" said Michael Chuba, an analyst at the Gartner Group, a market research group in Stamford, Conn. **********The true test for 1991 will come in the second half of the year, Mr. Chuba said. Until now most people in the industry felt that I.B.M. was virtually assured of selling at least 400 to 500 of its new top-of-the-line System 390 mainframes -- which have the highest profit margins of any I.B.M. hardware. The arrival of those machines will complete the transition to the mainframe family that the company began in September. **********I.B.M. now appears to be saying that it will not be able to use the strength of the mainframes to offset the overall slowness of the first half of 1991. And the biggest ticket items will be the largest question marks if the economy continues to slip. **********\"Customers have never been asked to pay $22 million for a mainframe,\" Mr. Chuba said. **********And Allan Z. Loren, the president of Covia Inc., an airline reservations company with a data processing center in Denver, drove that point home when he said: \"In mainframes we're driven by price-performance. But unless it's a survival issue I'm probably going to fit the new technology in when I can afford it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/05/business/two-insurers-in-settlement.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 210, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two Insurers In Settlement", "print_headline": "Two Insurers In Settlement", "body_text": " **********Two leading insurance companies agreed on Thursday to pay $750,000 each and testify in an antitrust lawsuit against some of the nation's largest insurers. **********Under the settlement signed by State District Judge Peter Lowry, the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company of San Francisco and the USF&G Corporation of Baltimore will pay a total of $1.5 million.

Repeating his vow that he, not President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, would dictate the pace of the war, he said, \"We are going to take whatever time is necessary to sort out when a next stage might begin.\" Overlap Is Possible **********Mr. Bush, who refused to answer questions from reporters, did not say how long the bombardment by planes, cruise missiles, naval guns and land-based artillery might last without an accompanying ground offensive. There probably will not be a sharp line between the air campaign and the ground action, since bombing and artillery attacks are likely to continue throughout a ground offensive. **********But after his meeting with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the President said he had not made the decision to proceed to the next phase of the war by committing ground troops to offensive action. Mr. Cheney and General Powell spent the weekend in Saudi Arabia consulting with Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the American commander, and with other allied officers.  Advice From Saudis **********\"We are not talking about dates for adding to the air campaign,\" Mr. Bush said. He indicated that Mr. Cheney and General Powell, who officials said were advised by military leaders in Saudi Arabia over the weekend to continue bombing alone as long as three more weeks, had not offered a recommendation to start ground operations. **********\"I will rely heavily on the advice of our Secretary of Defense, our Chairman, of our generals out there, General Schwarzkopf and others,\" Mr. Bush said. \"And then if they come to me and say there needs to be another phase, then I will then make that decision, because that is a decision for the President of the United States.\" **********As Mr. Bush put off what could be a politically explosive decision to start a ground offensive that is likely to produce a higher number of American casualties, he and his aides tried to deal with another political problem: the growing debate over the extent of civilian casualties in Iraq and Kuwait from 26 days of nonstop allied bombing. **********During his Rose Garden appearance, Mr. Bush made a special point of addressing that issue. \"I would be remiss,\" he said, \"if I didn't assure the American people that this war is being fought with high technology. There is no targeting of civilians.\" **********The White House has been increasingly vexed by the issue of civilian casualties, as well as by a recent spate of peace feelers toward Iraq by Iran, Pakistan and most recently the Soviet Union, and by questions about whether Washington is exceeding the United Nations mandate in the war. A senior Administration official said those issues not only put political pressure on the alliance against Iraq, but also increase the pressure to begin a ground offensive in hopes of ending the war as quickly as possible. **********At his daily news briefing today, Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, addressed those issues with a rare display of temper, suggesting that journalists -- and even President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union -- had been duped by Iraqi propaganda. **********Mr. Fitzwater asserted that the White House and the Pentagon had no reliable civilian casualty estimates to offer, but insisted that the casualties were lower than Iraq's estimates. He suggested that President Saddam Hussein was using the issue to score political points and thereby diffuse the alliance that is trying to force Iraq to comply with the United Nations demand that it leave Kuwait. Hussein's 'P. R. Points' **********\"The propaganda and P. R. battle is where Saddam is scoring his points,\" Mr. Fitzwater said. **********Answering a question about Mr. Gorbachev -- who said over the weekend that the scope of the allied attack on Iraq, including the bombing of power stations and water supplies, might be exceeding the United Nations resolutions about Kuwait -- Mr. Fitzwater said: **********\"We are going to such great lengths to target military facilities and military installations and to not try to do any damage to civilian targets. And it does strike me that Saddam Hussein must be having some impact in terms of trying to convince the world otherwise. And that is disturbing to us, because clearly one of his major objectives is to show that the United States is attacking civilians and not the military, and that is not the case.\" **********Top American field commanders consulted in the gulf, who generally favored continuing the bombing for at least three weeks, indicated the time could vary, depending on the weather, the effectiveness of bombing raids and Iraq's response, officials said. **********At the Pentagon today, officials generally echoed that sentiment, without being specific about the advice to the President. **********Pete Williams, Mr. Cheney's spokesman, said that \"more progress can be made by continuing the air phase of the campaign,\" although he added that military leaders \"are, of course, preparing for the next phase.\" **********The bombing began on Jan. 17 against strategic targets in Iraq and was aimed first at destroying Mr. Hussein's supply lines, his ability to shoot down allied aircraft and launch his own planes, his chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs, and his ability to command his forces in the field. **********Pentagon officials have said this effort was largely successful. General Schwarzkopf has estimated that 90 percent of Iraq's communications and supply lines have been cut. New Focus on Troops **********More recently, allied bombers have focused on destroying Iraqi troops and weapons in Kuwait and southern Iraq, especially the Republican Guard, the vanguard of the Iraqi army. **********Lieut. Gen. Thomas Kelly, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a Pentagon briefing today: \"We have not passed, I think, what's been referred to as a point of diminishing returns in the air campaign. I think the last report that was publicized was 750 tanks were destroyed, 600 armored vehicles were destroyed, and about 650 artillery pieces. That certainly isn't the lion's share of what they have there.\" **********According to estimates by the United States and its allies, Iraq had more than 4,000 tanks, 2,300 artillery pieces and 2,500 armored vehicles among the 545,000 troops in the war zone. **********General Kelly said he believed that the damage figures had increased in recent days, but he said so much of the Iraqi armor had been protected with sand walls or dug into the sand itself that it sometimes took \"one bomb per vehicle\" to destroy them. **********\"The more that that kind of force can be attrited by air before we send in foot soldiers and tanks and artillery men, the fewer casualties we're going to take,\" General Kelly said. **********Mr. Bush said he was pleased with the report by Mr. Cheney and General Powell on their visit to the gulf and was \"very satisfied, having heard their briefing, with the progress in the war.\" **********But he said he would not discuss the timing of his decision about starting a ground offensive \"for a lot of reasons, including the safety of our own troops.\" He added, \"Their safety is paramount in my mind.\" **********He said the war \"has gone far better, in terms of casualties, than I'd hoped, though we mourn the loss of every single one of our armed forces and the coalition forces.\" He added, \"My heart still goes out to the families.\" **********Mr. Bush also said Mr. Cheney and General Powell were \"very reassuring in terms of the morale of our people over there.\" He continued: \"They know why they're there.

Hills, began a legal process that could result in Japanese companies being barred from many Federal and federally funded construction projects in the United States, beginning on June 1. **********A Japanese negotiator who insisted on anonymity said that if the sanctions go into effect, Japan will retaliate by suspending its current program of giving preferential treatment to foreign companies on 17 big public works projects. But he said considerable progress had been made recently in negotiations and insisted that the American sanctions would probably never go into effect. 3 Nations Cited **********An American official who also insisted on anonymity agreed that some issues were being resolved. The Japanese Government offered today to expand the preferential treatment program to certain other projects, he said, while adding that the sanctions would go into effect if remaining differences were not addressed. **********Mrs. Hills today also officially cited China, India and Thailand for tolerating violations of patents, trademarks and copyrights. This could result in duties or other restrictions on imports from all three countries. **********She said President Bush approved of the decision to name China. The President, a former chief of the American liaison office in China, resisted sanctions after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. **********Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who led a push in Congress for citing the three countries, said he was \"very pleased\" with their designation. A Hardening Stance **********Mrs. Hills's moves reflect a hardening of the Administration's stance on trade and a new willingness to take unilateral action against countries perceived as treating American businesses unfairly. **********The collapse of negotiations last winter in Brussels for a new global round of tariff reductions has cleared the way diplomatically and legally for the more aggressive stance. The American trade laws pertaining to economic sanctions permit less action to be taken when foreign countries are proceeding in good faith with bilateral or multilateral negotiations. **********The move against Japanese construction companies comes five years of increasingly acrimonious disputes over the tiny share of Japanese public works contracts that are awarded to American companies. **********The Japanese Government has maintained that the limited success of American firms reflects their lack of experience in the Japanese market. American trade negotiators have maintained that American firms are excluded deliberately. **********Today's move was partly symbolic, because Japanese companies do little work on Federal and federally funded projects in the United States. In 1989, Japanese companies won contracts worth $2.8 billion in an American market worth $435 billion, said Elizabeth Dugan, a spokeswoman for the Commerce Department. **********But Federal projects accounted for only $14 billion of the market, and Japanese companies won only $100 million worth of contracts for these projects, she said. **********By comparison, the Japanese construction market is variously estimated at $300 billion to $550 billion, with American companies claiming only $300 million a year. **********The proposed regulation would bar Japanese companies from public works projects that receive money from the Energy, Transportation and Defense departments and from the Bureau of Reclamation in the Interior Department. Appropriations for these projects amount to at least $21 billion this fiscal year, Mrs. Hills said.  Problems in Europe **********The procurement practices of the European Community and three of its members -- Germany, France and Italy -- are also causing concern and are now the subject of negotiations, Mrs. Hills said. **********John R. Tucker, president of AEG Westinghouse Transportation Systems Inc., a Pittsburgh-based maker of mass transit equipment, said Japan had raised a series of obstacles to American construction companies.

But there were a few catches: the land could not be rented, mortgaged or sold. **********So when a Government functionary began telling local farmers here the other day how President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was going to change all that, the men might have been expected to applaud. They did not. **********\"What?\" an older man bellowed over the din that rose in the ruins of a once-vast estate here, not far from where the peasant revolutionary Emiliano Zapata was killed in 1919. \"Was the revolution worth nothing? What did all of those people die for? There is nobody, not even the President of the republic, who can take away our land!\" **********There were a few shouts of \"Viva Zapata!\" as the official tried to point out that the proposed law would merely allow peasants to rent or sell their plots or join with outside investors; it would not compel them to do so. But the confusion and mistrust was by no means unusual. Officials in Mexico City said they expected such explaining to continue around the country for months. **********The tumult underscored how Mr. Salinas's plan to transform Mexican agriculture has quickly become the stiffest challenge of his quest to modernize the economy. **********\"This is touching the very heart of Mexican history of the last 70 years,\" said Luis Tellez, the Under Secretary of Agriculture who was a principal architect of the proposed laws. \"It is the point of no return.\" **********The \"agrarian reform\" that most Mexicans knew had been a seemingly endless process, the basic tool by which the Government redistributed wealth in the countryside and asserted political control over it. But early in November, with 2.5 million peasants still waiting for their plots, Mr. Salinas told the country what its leaders had realized for years: that there was no more land to hand out. A Role for Foreigners **********In addition to legalizing the sale of redistributed land, he also moved to permit large-scale agribusiness ventures, with foreigners free to participate. **********While there is little doubt that the Congress, dominated by Mr. Salinas's Institutional Revolutionary Party, will approve his plan, the debate reinvigorated the country's floundering political left to the point that the President took the unusual step of inviting opposition parties to propose amendments to the new laws. **********\"The only thing that will happen is that those who can buy will reconstitute the big estates,\" said Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leftist leader whose father, President Lazaro Cardenas, gave land to nearly a million peasants in the late 1930's. \"Now, instead of the haciendas, it is going to be the great transnational corporations.\" **********Mexican officials say the capitalization and modernization of agriculture are essential if Mexico is to compete successfully with the United States and Canada under the free trade agreement now being negotiated. But they do not doubt that the adjustment will be a wrenching one. Meager Farm Investments **********While farmers and their families now make up nearly a third of the country's 82 million people, they produce less than one-tenth of the gross national product and have collected less than 1 percent of the billions of dollars in foreign investment flowing into Mexico. The great majority of the 17 million Mexicans who, by World Bank standards, live in extreme poverty live in the countryside. And within a decade or two, Mr. Tellez said in an interview, about half of the rural population will most likely be forced to move. **********Many of the migrants, officials say, will settle in towns in the interior. Others will swell the already overcrowded and underserviced cities. But despite the new jobs that a booming economy should create, critics wonder whether a third destination is not most likely. **********\"Where is the support system for those people?\" asked Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, a political scientist. \"It is on the northern border and in the United States.\" **********Even the most passionate of advocates for the Mexican family farmer does not dispute the need for change in the country's system of community farms. **********The ejidos, as both the communities and their lands are called, hark back to the land tenure of the Maya. Reconceived under the revolutionary Constitution of 1917, they have been carved from expropriated holdings until, under Mr. Salinas, they came to cover about half of the country's arable land. They may be worked communally or, far more often, as individual parcels, but can be transferred only from one generation to the next. **********Divided among heirs, farms that were mandated to be at least 25 acres have typically shrunk to half that. Most lack irrigation, and with outside investment barred by law, their mechanization is usually a day's tractor rental at best. Under the weight of Mexico's huge foreign debt, credits to the ejidos nearly evaporated during the 1980's, while many private landowners stopped investing out of fear that land-starved peasants might invade their parcels in order to force the Government's hand. **********Almost as a rule, ejido farmers must take on additional work to sustain their families. Some sell knickknacks or cut wood from outlying forests, and some pick vegetables in California or pack fish in Alaska. Thousands return to harvest their crops; others simply sell or rent their land illegally. **********The system would have collapsed of its own inefficency long ago, economists say, had the Government not heavily subsidized farm loans and grain prices. And despite paying about double world market prices for its peasants' corn, for example, only in the last two years has Mexico not had to import corn and beans. Higher Subsidies Asked **********In selling the new plan, the Government has essentially argued that \"land and liberty\" -- the slogan of Zapata's revolt and the chorus of Government oratory for half a century -- do not necessarily go together anymore. **********By granting farmers the power to vote themselves titles to their land, officials contend, the Government will end its paternalistic control over the ejidos, undercut the power of the corrupt bosses who dominate many farms and free the farmers from the demands of Government banks that often condition loans on the planting of certain crops. **********But critics of the plan are demanding that the Government raise rather than cut its subsidies. \"The Government is backing away from its responsibility,\" said Ramon Danzos Palomino, the 79-year-old former Communist leader who is a sort of grand old man of the peasant left. **********Far as such arguments might diverge from the mainstream of contemporary economic logic, some officials acknowledged that they might still be persuasive to millions of poor Mexicans. **********\"The worry,\" said a senior official who spoke on condition he not be identified, \"is that you could have political unrest in the countryside at this stage, when we are negotiating a free-trade agreement with the United States.\" **********After an initial flurry of leftist opposition to his bill, Mr. Salinas promised to soften the repayment terms on outstanding ejido loans and spend about $3 billion next year on new credits, technology and infrastructure to strengthen the farm system. Different Reactions **********Like Mexican agriculture itself, the longer-term reception given the new law will almost certainly vary by region. In the north, where landholdings are larger and production agriculture is more established, farmers are expected to turn more quickly to the many potential investors whom Government officials say have shown interest. In the south, where plots are smaller, poorer and still disputed by thousands of peasants, the evolution will likely be much slower. **********In visits to ejidos in the state of Morelos, just south of the capital, it was difficult to find a farmer even thinking about cashing in under the proposed laws. \"As long as I have faith in God, I think I would not sell my land,\" said Clemente Torres, 40, who stood on one of the rutted dirt streets of San Jose de Pala. \"It has always given me something to eat.\" **********But the appearance of new crops in the fields belie the outward resistance to change. **********On the ejido of Miacatlan, Valente Mastache, 61 years old, was still smarting from the loss of $670 he suffered when a Canadian company backed out of the pilot project under which he had abandoned his corn to grow Chinese vegetables. But keeping to his diversification, Mr. Mastache had sown peanuts and watermelons this year. And he did not rule out the possibility of another effort to grow oriental squash. **********\"We just have to make the contract a little bit better next time,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/03/business/all-about-denim-the-appeal-of-blue-now-red-or-green-jeans.html": {"writer_name": "Anne-marie Schiro", "pub_date": "1991-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1829, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "All About/Denim; The Appeal of Blue -- Now Red or Green -- Jeans", "print_headline": "All About/Denim; The Appeal of Blue -- Now Red or Green -- Jeans", "body_text": " **********High-fashion denim, these days, means much more than designer jeans. Franco Moschino covers a denim jacket with transparent sequins. Donna Karan shapes a strapless denim minidress. As sales of blue jeans flag, designers are devising new uses for a familiar fabric. **********These novelties tickle the fashion-conscious, but to most people denim still means jeans. More than 650 million square yards of denim are produced in this country every year, mainly by automated factories in the South. At least 90 percent of the denim goes into the basics: blue jeans, jackets, overalls and skirts. The domestic denim market has matured as a vast business. At $6 billion in 1989 retail sales for jeans and $8.25 billion for all denim clothing, it represents one of the largest categories of apparel. **********Jeans and denim manufacturers remain optimistic despite fluctuations in their markets. Domestic demand has suffered from turmoil in the retail industry, a recession and the graying of the jeans generation, but foreign demand is on the rise. Manufacturers continue to expand the variety of jeans with new fabric finishes, colors and styling. \"The key to the growth of the jeans business is innovation,\" said Arnold Elder, a vice president of Swift Textiles Inc., a major denim manufacturer. \"In order to get a person to buy another pair of jeans, the eye must be attracted to something different.\"  Made in the U.S.A. The Big Mills Are In the South **********The United States produces more denim than any other country, primarily for domestic use but increasingly for the world market. The largest denim mills bear little resemblance to the crowded plants of the past. Towering machines suck cotton from bales and spin it into yarn, dyeing the fibers, then weaving them into fabric that flows onto wide 600-pound rolls. The plants are spacious, but eerie for the scarcity of employees, whose duties are mainly to adjust the computer controls and tweak the machines. **********Swift Textiles Inc., a United States subsidiary of Dominion Textiles Inc. of Montreal, is generally regarded as the world's largest supplier. For the year ended last June, Swift Textiles sold more than $300 million of denim, supplying major jeans makers like Levi Strauss, Lee, Wrangler, Sassoon and Liz Claiborne. **********Next comes the Cone Mills Corporation of Greensboro, N.C., privately held but willing to confirm an annual output of more than 165 million square yards. The company says Levi Strauss is its largest account, since almost all the denim for Levi's best-selling five-pocket 501 jeans comes from Cone Mills. It also supplies Oshkosh B'gosh, Calvin Klein and Polo/Ralph Lauren. Industry executives say the next-largest producers are Greenwood Mills Inc. of Greenwood, S.C., and then Burlington Industries Inc. of Greensboro, N.C. **********The mills have learned to produce much more than the traditional, 14 1/2-ounce-per-yard denim used in 501's. The fabric can be as light as 4 1/2 ounces, known as chambray, or as heavy as 15 1/2. About 90 percent of the denim is pure cotton, with 10 percent containing some polyester and a very small percentage incorporating stretchy spandex. Four of every five yards are indigo blue. **********More American-made denim is going to South America, the Far East and especially Western Europe, which imports 40 million to 50 million yards annually. This amount is more than all the other markets combined, said Nessim Levy, president of the Level Export Sales Corporation, which sends Cone Mills products to Europe. Fashion-conscious Italians buy the most from the United States.  American denim and jeans makers hope to find large new markets in Eastern Europe. **********But denim production is by no means limited to the United States. Europe weaves an estimated 275 million square yards annually, while Japan fills much of its own demand and imports some from Hong Kong. **********Arnold Elder, a vice president of Swift Textiles, said exports can more than make up for stagnant domestic consumption. \"Denim is being worn today for everything from casual sportswear to shirts to dresses,\" he said. \"It's acceptable around the world.\"  Levi, the Leader Foreigners Want The American Look **********Levi Strauss & Company, a privately held corporation with headquarters in San Francisco, remains by far the largest jeans company in the world. Since Levi's founding in 1850, when a Bavarian immigrant used French cotton serge to sew sturdy trousers for California miners, the company has stitched up two and a half billion pairs. Sales reached $3.6 billion in 1989, with more than $4 billion estimated for 1990. The figures include Levi's Dockers, a line of cotton twill pants introduced in 1986, with sales of $600 million last year. Dan Chew, Levi's marketing manager, attributes the company's steady growth to the success of Dockers and the increased global demand for American jeans. **********Europe is Levi's biggest foreign market, but Asians also like the American look. \"Even though we manufacture in Japan for the Asian market,\" Mr. Chew said, \"Asians go to great lengths to obtain Levi's 501's made in the United States, so we do export some American-made jeans to Asia.\" **********Mr. Chew said Levi Strauss sells twice as many jeans as its closest competitor, Lee Jeans. Both Lee and Wrangler are subsidiaries of the V.F. Corporation of Reading, Pa., the country's largest publicly held apparel company. Lee estimates that it has sold one billion pairs during its one-century lifespan. **********Jeans makers are still trying to develop computers and machines that can stitch up pants as well as they can weave fabric. Most jeans factories have rows of women tending sewing machines, with computers reserved for cutting patterns, tracking orders and managing inventory and distribution.  The Designer Craze Paying for a Name On the Pocket **********Farmers, ranchers and laborers have always worn denim work clothes, but as a fashion for those with whiter collars, blue jeans have been cyclical. They represented social rebellion in the 1960's and entered the realm of high fashion in the late 70's and early 80's. When Brooke Shields promoted one designer by cooing about her Calvins, other designers rode the trend. Jeans sales reached an all-time high of 502 million pairs, 77 percent of them denim, in 1981. **********Much of the appeal of designer jeans still lies on their back pockets, where labels like Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt or Ralph Lauren merit prices of $70 to more than $100. Basic jeans can be found for less than $20. **********Designers who insist the extra money buys sassier styling do not discount the value of cachet. \"Designer jeans historically cost more, but you buy a name and a fit,\" said Denise Seegal, president of DKNY, Donna Karan's less expensive line of sportswear. **********DKNY spawned DKNY Jeans last year as a separate division, and Ms. Seegal projects sales of $40 million in 1991. But the basic DKNY jeans that sold for $85 in 1989 can now be had for $70. \"I took a haircut to lower the price to position myself to compete,\" Ms. Seegal said. But Donna Karan is no kin of Levi Strauss. \"When a store asks me why we can't sell jeans for $20,\" Ms. Seegal said, \"I tell them that if you produce a million pairs, it costs less than producing a thousand pairs or a hundred thousand.\" **********A designer's name may sell the first pair of jeans, but it will not necessarily produce repeat sales, some jeans makers have found. The customer must be tempted by something new, something he or she does not already own. **********Now there are black jeans and white jeans, jeans in several colors absent even from the rainbow. All manner of finishes -- bleaching, over-dyeing, acid-washing, stone-washing, sand-blasting and even shotgun-blasting -- give denim a new, or old, look. **********Until five or six years ago, 70 percent to 80 percent of the Levi's sold were rigid or slightly prewashed, said Mr. Chew. Now, 80 percent have further finishes. About 35 percent are acid-washed (\"But that's on the way out,\" he said) and 30 percent stone-washed. All these washes and finishes make jeans softer and more comfortable. What's more, the styles make the wearer look like the survivor of a month on the ranch, a landslide, a shootout or at least a good dunking in a Clorox vat.   THE LITTLE BLACK DENIM DRESS **********Donna Karan calls denim the new gabardine. She uses it for much more than jeans. She has had a denim blazer in her DKNY line for two years and included denim in her latest high-fashion collection for spring. She uses a silk-and-cotton denim for dresses, jackets and skirts that bear as little resemblance to jeans as a cocktail party does to a hoedown. Her prices befit her clientele of movie stars and top executives: $640 for a short, strapless denim dress, $1,000 for a satin-lined denim coat. **********Such are the inspirations that have allowed Ms. Karan to become one of the hottest designers in the country, building sales of more than $150 million in six years. \"Denim is wonderful to style,\" she said. \"It comes in different weights and it tailors beautifully. Everything can be made in it. Denim for me is a classic. It's a seven-days-a-week, day-to-night fabric.\" **********Young American designers like Rebecca Moses and Zang Toi also used denim in unconventional ways for spring. Ms. Moses made a bustier and pants covered with transparent sequins. Mr. Toi used bright pink and red denim for short trench coats, strapless dresses and boleros with jeweled fringes. **********American designers are not the only ones pursuing denim panache. Franco Moschino, the enfant terrible of Italian fashion, has a jeans line that racked up worldwide sales of $80 million last year. The line includes sundresses, sequin-covered jackets, skirts trimmed with beaded fringes and denim pants with pleated legs of see-through rayon. **********The basic slacks account for only 10 percent of Moschino Jeans sales.

Riesett, vice chairman of W. B. Doner & Company, the Baltimore ad agency that created the campaign, exhorted the American Newspaper Publishers Association. The association's 1,400 members include most of the daily newspapers in the United States and Canada. **********Mr. Riesett said the campaign was intended to reverse the image of newspapers as old-fashioned, and tout the advantages of advertising in newspapers. He pointed to campaigns by television, radio and magazines that try to portray newspapers as out-of-date. **********Like true believers at a revival, the publishers cheered such ads as one that read: \"Some car dealers love to see themselves on TV. Others love to see a lot of buyers in their showroom,\" followed by the campaign's tagline: \"Newspaper. The best way to close a sale.\" **********The campaign, which will begin this month, includes a $500,000 budget for placing ads in advertising and marketing trade publications and a commitment by 15 major metropolitan papers to bear the cost of repeatedly publishing the ads in their own pages. **********In addition, the ads will be distributed by direct mail, and camera-ready newspaper ads, radio spots and videotapes will be provided to all newspapers at a modest cost so they can localize the campaign in their own markets. **********The advertising agency had recommended a $5 million campaign that would have included national television and billboards, but that approach was deemed too expensive for an industry looking for every opportunity to trim costs. **********The promotion effort comes as newspapers are suffering through what many here say is the worst advertising recession in memory. **********The association reported that newspapers accounted for 24.9 percent of the $129 billion spent on advertising in 1990, which meant newspapers retained their longstanding place as the largest advertising medium, followed by television with 22.2 percent. **********But the newspaper share of the total advertising pie was down from 26.1 percent in 1989, and the decline has only intensified the anxiety among publishers. **********Indeed, this year's convention has been unusually serious. Its theme was \"reinventing\" the traditional local daily to prosper in a dauntingly competitive world. **********\"There has been very much less sizzle and much more on operations,\" said Richard T. Schlosberg 3d, group vice president for newspapers for the Times Mirror Company. **********But the nation's 1,611 daily papers, each with its own quirks and procedures, have a history of talking about change without following through. **********For instance, retailers like K Mart, which advertise in many markets and are newspapers' most important customers, have long complained that the industry should standardize certain procedures and forms to facilitate buying space. **********In 1986, for instance, the association adopted a standard advertising invoice format and loudly predicted its universal use by 1988. But a majority of papers still do not use the format, or use it incorrectly.  Symbol in an Invoice **********The failure to adopt the standardized invoice \"has become a symbol of newspaper inertia to our best customers,\" said Ann C. Hunt, a vice president of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, an industry support organization. **********There are signs that this time, the industry will rouse itself, if only because it has no choice. **********\"We're not alarmist to say that the retail-newspaper partnership may be up for grabs,\" Ms. Hunt warned. **********After years of discussing the need for a mechanism that would allow advertising agencies to buy advertising at many newspapers through a single centralized computer system, such a system now seems a near reality. **********A rapt audience of publishers watched wall monitors today as the new system was put through its paces and, in minutes, was used to plan a hypothetical $75,000 advertising campaign in four cities. Under the system, which is still being refined, the entire campaign could be ordered with the push of a button. **********But, once again, the success of such a system will depend on whether most of the nation's newspapers will provide data and follow procedures in the standardized fashion that such a computerized system requires. **********Jerry Tilis, vice president for marketing at Knight-Ridder Inc., who has headed the project, said that without broad industry support, \"we will end up with a technological success and a marketing failure.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/17/business/credit-markets-treasury-issues-little-changed.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1991-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 870, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Issues Little Changed", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Treasury Issues Little Changed", "body_text": " **********The semiannual report by Alan Greenspan to Congress on the economy and monetary policy, normally an event of some note in the credit markets, was greeted with a yawn yesterday, and prices of Treasury securities were little changed in very slow trading. **********In his remarks to a subcommittee of the House Banking Committee, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board painted a portrait of an economy climbing out of recession while inflationary pressures continued to moderate. **********\"He basically recapped what is a fairly broadly held consensus on the economy and inflation trends,\" said Joseph Liro, senior vice president and money market economist at S.

Those figures suggest members of the group have an average income of $196,000 a year, about what the typical Peat partner makes. **********The program should eventually result in higher pay for those remaining but will mean heavy costs this fiscal year and next, the memorandum said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/27/business/company-news-big-berlin-site-is-sold-to-sony.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 168, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Big Berlin Site Is Sold to Sony", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Big Berlin Site Is Sold to Sony", "body_text": " **********The Sony Corporation of Japan today bought a 7.5-acre site on Potsdamerplatz, the historic square that will be transformed from a cold war wasteland into Berlin's bustling center. **********Officially, the price was a secret.

Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, has been arguing that his plans for a radical overhaul of his republic's economy would have already gone into effect were it not for the \"center\" -- a word that encompasses the Kremlin, the lumbering bureaucracy of the Soviet Union's huge ministries and the long hand of the Communist Party. **********In the last 48 hours, in a blizzard of decrees, Mr. Yeltsin removed the center from his path. He seized control of the party's Moscow-based media apparatus, took over communications networks, and kicked the struts out from under Gosplan and Gosnab, the two state agencies that once controlled planning and distribution for the entire Soviet Union, by banning their activity on the vast territory of the Russian republic. **********Today, after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's order to the party to cease its meddling in government and economic affairs, Mr. Yeltsin would seem to be free to work his will inside Russia and, to some extent, beyond, in what will be left of the Soviet Union. But with events moving more rapidly than even Mr. Yeltsin can issue decrees, the question is whether even he, with his enormous popularity and bull-dog ways, can bring about change in a land that could be on the brink of chaos, and hold the remnants of the union together. **********In an interview televised tonight, Mr. Yeltsin called on his battered nation to get back to work, after the week's tumultuous events. \"The situation is very hard, but I think that people are now very eager to do business,\" he said. \"We must not interfere and just give them freedom of the free market.\"  An Appeal for Calm **********\"The people should be calmed down and we all must part with euphoria, including the euphoria of victory,\" he said. \"And no euphoria of revenge, or else we will lose our self-respect as democrats.\" **********From the White House, as the Russian government building is called these days, Mr. Yeltsin's team, fresh from its triumph over the coup and the outpouring of public support, speaks with the self-assurance of a civics text book as its worka to fill the vacuum opening up at the top and the bottom of the Soviet power structure. **********\"The first task is to create an executive system in the localities, that will be able to function locally,\" said Pavel Voshanov, a top aide to Mr. Yeltsin, in an interview today. **********\"The goal is take economic reform to the end, to realize the reforms,\" Mr. Voshanov said. \"The strategy is the old one, to move quickly to a market economy, privatization, private property and to start on land reform, which is already late in getting started.\"  The Same Old Problems **********But as they look out across a land that stretches across 10 time zones, encompasses 31 autonomous regions and is home to scores of non-Russian nationalities, the Yeltsinites find themselves inheriting problems much like those that bedeviled Mr. Gorbachev when he first embarked on his program of change. **********There are problems of personnel, of expectations and of a clash of national identities that has already begun to emerge. With the party in tatters, a new system of administration will have to be put in place, drawing on the small pool of people who are both uncompromised and qualified. Although he is now riding high in popularity, Mr. Yeltsin will now soon have to answer for an economic crisis that is sure to get worse for the average Russian citizen, as unemployment rises and shortages linger. **********This week Mr. Yeltsin moved quickly to eradicate the obvious pockets of resistance -- those places where in the early hours of the Monday coup, local party and government leaders set up local \"state of emergency\" committees, and issued orders reflecting the junta's harsh directives. Speaking at the funeral services on Sunday for the three young men killed in the coup, Mr. Yeltsin said again that those who supported the coup would be removed from their posts and investigated by the prosecutor's office. **********As Mr. Gorbachev's power goes into eclipse, Mr. Yeltsin has emerged as the caretaker of the Soviet Government, adding its complex problems to the ones he faces in the Russian republic.  Chief Champion of Unity **********He has also become the chief champion of the union treaty, a document he negotiated with Mr. Gorbachev and eight other republic leaders that redistributes power from the center to the republics. The treaty was to have been signed by most major repbulics on Aug. 20, but was suspended by the government takeover last Monday. **********In his interview tonight, Mr. Yeltsin said he would now wait until Sept. 15 for the signing, to see which way the Ukraine goes, now that it has broken ranks -- together with the Baltic republics, Georgia, Moldavia and Armenia -- and declared its independence. **********The prospect of a defection by the Ukraine, the second largest republic in population with historic links to Russia, from even the loose bonds of the proposed union treaty poses problems for Russia, which could find itself alone in a union dominated by the Muslim republics of Central Asia. **********Mr. Yeltsin today also proposed in the television interview to cut short the session of the Supreme Soviet that opens on Monday, and to move quickly to convene a Congress of People's Deputies \"to solve all the problems at once -- both on the participation of the cabinet of ministers, on its replacements, on its structure, on new cadres etc.\"  Yeltsin Aides in Key Posts **********Of the four people named on Saturday to the interim committee that will be running the national economy, three were drawn from the Yeltsin camp -- including the chairman, Ivan Silayev, who is now the Russian Prime Minister, and Grigory Yavlinsky, the young economist who has drafted the most radical plan to date for the rescue of the Soviet economy. **********Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev have also agreed that the next Prime Minister will be nominated by the Russian republic, as well as the new Vice President, replacing former Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov and Vice president Gennadi Yanyev, who were both members of the eight-man junta. **********No Prime Minister has yet been named because, according to Mr. Voshanov, the first task is to redraw the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers itself, a group that includes more than 50 ministries and state committees representative of the old older. Mr. Voshanov predicted that this number would be cut drastically. **********\"We have to change the whole structure because in one week, some of these ministries will be gone,\" he said. \"The committee has to work out a new model, and then after the model, will come the appointments.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/14/business/business-digest-848791.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 622, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Companies **********Clark M.

Gorbachev has conceded that the Kremlin now controls little more than the military and research institutes, and that it is increasingly difficult to find enough revenue to keep paying them on time. **********He offered no details on the problem, which he mentioned in a two-day-old interview with Soviet news editors released today.

Inc. said today that the Federal appeals court in Denver had effectively blocked a plan by Sears, Roebuck & Company to offer Visa credit cards through a Utah savings and loan owned by Sears. **********The appellate court's ruling overturns a preliminary injunction that was issued against Visa in February by a Federal district court in Salt Lake City, Visa said. The injunction had blocked Visa's attempt to keep Sears from offering the cards. The matter will now to proceed to trial; no date has been set. **********Visa, an association of banks and savings units, has sought to keep nonbank companies like Sears from issuing Visa cards because the companies can offer no-fee cards, discounts on merchandise and other incentives that the banks cannot match. **********A.T.& T.'s Universal Visa card, for example, offers discounts on long-distance calls. Sears currently offers Discover, a no-fee card not affiliated with Visa or Visa's rival, Mastercard. **********\"We believe allowing Sears to issue Visa cards would not be in the best interests of the consumer, primarily because it would reduce competition between two brands, Visa and Discover,\" said David Brancoli, a spokesman for Visa, which is based in San Mateo, Calif. \"It would be like selling Big Macs at a Burger King.\" **********Mr. Brancoli said Visa learned of Sears's intentions when a card manufacturer informed the association that MountainWest Financial, a small Utah savings and loan, had placed an order for 1.5 million cards. MountainWest was a failed savings unit that Sears had purchased from the Resolution Trust Corporation, but Sears's ownership was not disclosed when MountainWest reapplied for membership in Visa, Mr. Brancoli said. **********After Visa subsequently blocked the issuance of those cards, Sears filed suit in Salt Lake City. The district court granted a preliminary injunction forcing Visa to approve the manufacture and delivery of the cards that MountainWest ordered. The appeals court's reversal of that ruling today means that Sears will not be able to issue Visa cards unless it prevails at trial. **********Sears had intended to offer the cards with the Prime Option logo, a registered trademark of Sears's Dean Witter subsidiary. Sears said today that it was disappointed that the court's decision would delay introduction of the Prime Option cards. **********\"Consumers want a no-fee Visa card with real value, like Prime Option,\" Philip J. Purcell, chairman and chief executive of the Dean Witter Financial Services Group, said in a statement.  Discover's Future Unclear **********Like the Sears Discover card, Prime Option would not carry a fee. But in contrast to the Discover, the Prime Option would carry the cachet and wide merchant acceptance of the Visa name. **********Sears said that it did not believe its Visa card would erode the market for Discover, which contributed about $117 million to Sears's profits last year. But analysts disagree. **********\"My thinking is they wanted to join Visa and phase out Discover,\" said H. Spencer Nilson, publisher of the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter for credit card issuers. **********When the Sears suit against Visa comes to trial, several issues will probably be raised. One is whether the Resolution Trust Corporation has the right to sell Visa membership as part of the assets of a thrift. Another is whether Visa has the right to create a bylaw, as it did in 1989, that excludes Sears and the American Express Company from issuing Visa cards. The trial is also likely to take up antitrust considerations, such as Visa's contention that Sears should not be able to issue competing cards. **********Following the success of the A.T.& T. card, Visa tightened the rules on operators of \"affinity programs,\" in which banks issue credit cards on behalf of organizations as diverse as the Sierra Club and American Airlines. The new rule banned any bank that issues affinity cards from giving more than 25 percent of its credit-card business to nonbank groups. **********A.T.& T. cards are issued by the Universal Bank in Columbus, Ga., which was specially created for that purpose by the Synovus Financial Corporation, a Columbus banking company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/10/business/dow-falls-17.66-to-below-3000-again.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1991-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 529, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Falls 17.66, to Below 3,000 Again", "print_headline": "Dow Falls 17.66, to Below 3,000 Again", "body_text": " **********The Dow Jones industrial average fell below the 3,000 level yesterday for the second time this week, closing at 2,996.20, down 17.66 points. **********Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was relatively low at 144.07 million shares, down from 163.9 million on Thursday.

Many of them have replaced Yemenis, Jordanians and Palestinians who were in effect forced to leave after their political leaders criticized Saudi Arabia's role in the coalition opposing Iraq. **********Sayed Kassem el-Masry, Egypt's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said in an interview that visas issued to Egyptian citizens since the Persian Gulf crisis began six months ago had roughly tripled, and that half of all new visas being issued to foreigners by the Saudi Government were to Egyptians. Egyptian and Saudi officials say about 684,000 Egyptians have been given visas to work here, and Riyadh is prepared to welcome many more for political and economic reasons. **********\"We're entering a new phase in which relations between our two countries have moved from normal and brotherly to even far closer,\" Mr. Masry said. \"Egypt and Saudi Arabia are becoming the pillars of the new Arab order.\" **********Egypt was among the first countries to support King Fahd's call for help in defending Saudi Arabia and freeing Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. Egypt sent some 45,000 soldiers and support staff here to fight under the Saudi command, a gesture deeply appreciated by the ruling Saud family. **********In return, Egypt has been well rewarded. Saudi Arabia has provided some $4.2 billion in direct and indirect aid to debt-ridden Egypt, one of the poorest Arab nations, with the Arab world's largest population. Remittances, or income from workers abroad, are one of Egypt's largest sources of hard currency. The departure of more than 1 million Egyptians from Iraq and Kuwait led to a decline of more than $1 billion in such crucial revenues last year. The migration of workers to Saudi Arabia is expected to offset the loss. **********In contrast to the welcome accorded the Egyptians, Arab workers from countries sympathetic to Iraq are being forced to leave as the Saudi Government has declined to renew their work permits. For instance, special residency and trade privileges extended to people from neighboring Yemen were revoked last fall, after the Yemeni Government harshly criticized Riyadh's decision to invite non-Islamic forces into the kingdom. **********Egyptians are now widely noticeable here, and are more often seen in the sensitive jobs once held by the other recently departed Arabs. For example, Saudia, the national airline, recently hired several new Egyptian pilots. A Tally of Egyptians **********According to Egyptian Government statistics, there are about 180,000 Egyptian farmers in the kingdom, 22,000 doctors and pharmacists, 16,000 engineers and 18,000 lawyers and related professionals. About 21,000 Egyptians hold administrative and clerical jobs; 150,000 are unskilled and 150,000 are skilled workers like plumbers and electricians. **********Saudi Arabia, like many countries in the gulf, is heavily dependent on Egyptians in teaching. About 44,000 Egyptians work in the schools, 13,000 of whom are women, who, unlike Saudi women, teach mainly in the villages. **********Mr. Masry said Egyptians were popular workers in Saudi Arabia because they are apolitical and deeply attached to their country. Unlike other Arabs who come to Arabia, he said, most do not want to stay here or become Saudi citizens. **********\"They don't care about politics or secularism,\" he asserted. \"For millennia, they have been tied to their soil. Their main goal is to improve their social and economic status and return home. And that makes the Saudis feel very comfortable about them.\" **********Despite the new-found enthusiasm in Saudi-Egyptian relations, historical and political tensions abound. Egypt crushed the first Saudi state in 1818, and as late as 1965, Egyptian planes bombed southern Saudi Arabia from bases in Yemen, when Egypt intervened in Yemen's civil war."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/04/world/credibility-gap-in-gulf-war.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 32, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Credibility Gap in Gulf War", "print_headline": "Credibility Gap in Gulf War", "body_text": " **********Signs of a credibility gap in the gulf war have appeared, but top officers seem eager to head off a worsening antagonism between the military and the press.

In spite of this questionable introduction, Mr. Ishii was quickly taken to meet the head of Nomura's sales department, Takehiko Matsuda, who personally handled his account.  A Memory Lapse **********Asked the name of the sokaiya, Mr. Tabuchi stirred a round of chuckles when he replied, \"I'm embarrassed, but up until yesterday I remembered his name, while today it does not seem to come to mind.\" **********No bombshells were dropped at today's testimony. But the disclosures added weight to suspicions that the scandals involved longstanding patterns of behavior in the Japanese stock market and not one-time ethical lapses. **********There was an air of drama because the hearings were the first at which sworn testimony had been taken since former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone testified during the Recruit influence-peddling scandal on May 25, 1989. In that episode, a number of top politicians were implicated, and Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita was forced to resign, underscoring how devastating the current series of scandals has been for the credibility of Japan's stock market and financial industry.  Following the Money Trail **********It was disclosed earlier that Nomura, the world's largest brokerage house, and Nikko, the third-largest, had each provided through affiliates more than $100 million in financing to Mr. Ishii. Part of the financing was provided by purchasing what they knew to be worthless memberships in a country club controlled by Mr. Ishii, who reportedly used the money in a share manipulation scheme involving the Tokyu Corporation, a large railroad and real estate concern. **********The Justice Ministry has said there is a criminal investigation under way on whether Nomura conspired with Mr. Ishii to manipulate Tokyu's share price. **********Mr. Tabuchi added that Nomura had acquired the worthless golf club memberships from Mr. Ishii's country club without even looking at the place, seemingly confirming suspicions that the transaction was intended to conceal an improper payment to the mob.  An Accusation Denied **********Mr. Tabuchi flatly denied manipulation had taken place, even though the price of Tokyu shares soared after Nomura issued a buy recommendation on the stock through its brokerage network last October. Before the recommendation was issued Nomura had helped Mr. Ishii acquire several million shares. **********The Finance Ministry has ruled that no securities firm can account for more than 30 percent of the trading in any individual stock. Mr. Tabuchi admitted in his testimony that Nomura had exceeded the limit in Tokyu for a few days last October, but said the firm had not broken the letter of the law, which prohibits exceeding 30 percent averaged over a month.  Visit to a Gangster's Home **********Takuya Iwasaki, who was forced to resign as Nikko's president as a result of the scandal, said Nikko had had dealings with Mr. Ishii since 1986. Nikko also gave him high-level service, handling his account out of its head office, Mr. Iwasaki said. He added that Nikko had no idea Mr. Ishii was a yakuza member -- that is, a member of an organized crime group -- until the summer of 1987, when a Nikko official visited him at his home, outside of Tokyo. **********\"Either in July or August an official in charge of Mr. Ishii called on his house in Yokosuka and reported that the atmosphere was very unusual,\" Mr. Iwasaki testified, drawing laughter from the chamber. **********Both executives said that the top executives of their firms had explicitly approved paying the improper compensation to cover market losses for a select group of clients. Both insisted that the compensation had been paid at the instigation of the brokerage houses, not the customers. The heads of the second- and fourth-largest securities firms in the world, Daiwa Securities and Yamaichi Securities, are scheduled to testify before the panel later.

He then acknowledged differences with Mr. Carlson, describing him as a \"strong manager,\" and adding, \"I am not a pantywaist myself.\" Employees there are now wearing \"I am not a pantywaist\" buttons, mocking Mr. Gelb. **********Senior Administration officials said that the White House found this and other incidents involving Mr. Gelb that had become public to be embarrassing and that this had contributed to the decision to remove him. **********One widely publicized incident concerned his request last year that the Federal Bureau of Investigation examine a sofa in his office because he suspected two employees of having used it for a tryst. No evidence was found. **********A second incident occurred on Jan. 17, when Mr. Gelb requested that the F.B.I. sweep his office for electronic listening devices. None were found. An aide said the F.B.I. action had been part of a Government-wide sweep. The F.B.I. subsequently said the sweep had been conducted only in Mr. Gelb's office and had been done in response to a single request. **********Neither Mr. Gelb's office nor Mr. Carlson's office had public comment on the White House plans for their future postings."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/15/world/confrontation-gulf-fighter-aircraft-american-pilots-anticipate-tough-but-brief.html": {"writer_name": "Malcolm Browne", "pub_date": "1991-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 779, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "American Pilots Anticipate Tough but Brief Battle", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: THE FIGHTER AIRCRAFT; American Pilots Anticipate Tough but Brief Battle", "body_text": " **********Despite their powerful advantage in numbers and equipment, American fighter pilots expect a difficult fight in the now seemingly inevitable war with Iraq. **********With the possible onset of hostilities only hours away, the air forces of the United States and its allies were making last-minute preparations today for an assault intended to smooth the way for ground forces. **********In the opening phase of the war, allied commanders are banking on the success of their air forces in destroying many key military objectives, including missile launchers, command centers and air bases. Commanders expect that this process might be completed in several days, but say nothing is certain. **********A key to the performance of the strike aircraft that will attack ground targets is the ability of allied fighter planes to keep Iraqi Air Force fighter planes at bay.  Allied Advantage in Aircraft **********A senior United States Air Force commander said that the allied fighter pilots and their planes will quickly achieve control of the skies. The allied fighter force outnumbers its Iraqi counterpart by at least two to one, and the disparity becomes even greater if older-model Iraqi planes are discounted. **********Pilots regard Iraq's French-built Mirage F-1 fighters, which are flown by Baghdad's best pilots, as the main threat. According to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, Iraq has about 30 Mirages, as well as about 30 Soviet-built MIG-29's, among the best fighters in the world. **********The United States Air Force has several hundred fighter aircraft in Saudi Arabia, many of them F-15's, which experts consider a match for any opponent. Depending on tactical decisions made by American commanders, hundreds of attack and fighter aircraft are available from the Marine Corps and the Navy, which has stationed three large aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf or the Arabian Sea, including the Midway, Saratoga and John F. Kennedy, and has three other carrier groups on the way or already on station. The Saudi, British and French fighter contingents contribute additional fighter planes. American Pilots Expect Losses **********Despite this overwhelming armada of combat aircraft, few American fighter pilots expect the allies to escape unscathed. **********\"In general, the advantages are all on our side,\" one said. \"But if a couple of our fighters suddenly found themselves up against 20 or 30 enemy fighters, even old MIG-21's, we certainly wouldn't get all 30 of them, and some of them would probably score hits on us.\" **********American pilots will try to attack their Iraqi foes with long-range radar-guided missiles without getting close enough to have to use short-range heat-seeking missiles or their 20-millimeter Gatling guns. **********\"We never want to be close enough that we can actually see our adversary,\" a pilot said. \"If we can see him, we're in his range.\"  Iraqi Planes Have Missiles **********But the Iraqi Air Force also has French- and Soviet-built radar-guided missiles, so Iraqi pilots do not necessarily need to come within sight of allied planes to be a threat. **********Despite the international composition of the air forces arrayed against Iraq, both attack aircraft and fighters are now well practiced in coordinating their actions, an officer said. **********For each mission, representatives of the air forces of all participating nations meet in committee to work out details of an \"air tasking order,\" he said, deciding on the combat roles of each unit, its targets, weapons and courses, the radio frequencies and recognition signals that will be used, and many other details. The Air Force jargon for this process is \"deconflicting.\" **********When American and allied forces began arriving here after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, one of the major military concerns was about the possibility of a chaotic breakdown in command and coordination between the various forces. Despite many initial difficulties, practice has smoothed out most potential problems, an officer said.  Coordination Problems for Iraq **********The officer said the Iraqis may have major coordination problems, with a strong likelihood that their missile crews could shoot down their own planes. **********\"They certainly did that during the war they fought with Iran,\" the officer said, \"and it's likely they would have the same problems here.\" **********Allied commanders here expect Iraq to fire their big ground-to-ground missiles at air bases and other targets, but key bases are well-protected by Patriot anti-missile missiles, an officer said. \"A few of the Iraqi Scud-B missiles might get through, but the Patriots should get most of them,\" a commander said. **********American officers note with satisfaction that Iraq faces the special problem of having to prepare for a war on three fronts, against Turkey, Israel and the joint forces in Saudi Arabia. \"His air force as well as his army will be spread pretty thin,\" the officer said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/03/world/official-and-18-others-die-in-sri-lanka-bombing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 498, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Official and 18 Others Die in Sri Lanka Bombing", "print_headline": "Official and 18 Others Die in Sri Lanka Bombing", "body_text": " **********A car bomb exploded today on a busy street and killed the head of the Government campaign against Tamil separatists along with at least 18 other people, officials and witnesses said.

While many refugees are pouring back into the allied-controlled area, the bulk of the Kurds who had fled to the eastern mountains are from Dohuk and its surroundings, and they fear to return to the city while any Iraqi security forces remain there. **********American field commanders, whose mission in Iraq is to coax the refugees out of Turkish territory and back to their homes, have recommended expanding the allied zone to include Dohuk.

The Defense Secretary, Cyril Ranatunge, says more than 950 guerrillas and about 180 troops have died since mid-March. **********The Tigers, who inexplicably resumed their war with Colombo in June 1990 after 14 months of peace and negotiations with President Ranasinghe Premadasa that left them in virtual control of large areas of the north, significantly eroded their support among the Tamils of the Jaffna Peninsula, the militants' base, when they resumed fighting. Tigers Called Fascists **********A recent report by the increasingly bold University Teachers for Human Rights at Jaffna University say the militants \"calculatedly left the Tamils at the mercy of enraged Sri Lankan forces.\" The teachers are the only group of Tamil intellectuals willing to attack the Tigers in strong language, calling them \"fascists\" for their heavy-handed treatment of people in their areas of control. **********The group says the Tigers want bodies for propaganda purposes abroad. The university teachers are asking that Tamils overseas stop contributing to the Tiger cause. They also ask international human rights organizations to discredit the claims of \"degenerate\" liberation groups. **********Taking advantage of Indian preoccupation with a national election and a relatively powerless caretaker Government in New Delhi, the Sri Lankan Army can hit the Tamil Tigers almost as hard as it wants without incurring Indian intervention. In 1987, a similar campaign against the Tamils led to Indian airdrops of supplies over Jaffna in violation of Sri Lankan airspace, and ultimately the introduction of an Indian peacekeeping force. **********India has more than 55 million Tamils in the state of Tamil Nadu, and political parties often make the plight of Sri Lankan Tamils into state or national issues.

The Tamil Tigers terrorized Muslims last year, forcing many to flee from the east and north. They form part of a displaced population of nearly 700,000. Up to 100,000 people more have fled abroad since fighting resumed last June. **********While the army presses its attacks on Tiger areas in the north, President Premadasa has reiterated his call for new talks, but has made it clear that this time he wants the elusive Tiger leader, Vellupillai Prabakaran, at the table. Talks in 1989 and 1990 were conducted through intermediaries.

But he delighted the Ukrainians by announcing that they would receive immediate title to a second church that sits just a few hundred yards from the disputed basilica. **********\"Both our nations have passed through so much bitterness and torment during the last few decades,\" the Pope said in a homily that appeared to have broader resonance in a region increasingly torn by inter-ethnic violence. \"May this experience also serve as absolution, soothing the memory of past conflicts, offenses and mutual distrust.\" **********\"Any attempt to revive the historical nationalisms and aversions would be against Christian identity and a glaring anachronism, unworthy of two great nations,\" he continued. \"Oh how fervently I wish that Catholics of both rites would love each other.\" **********Many of the Soviet pilgrims expressed hope that the Pope would soon play the same role in their drive for national independence as he had in his native Poland.  5,000 Travel From Lvov **********Jaroslaw Swatko, was among the 5,000 Ukrainians who traveled from Lvov to line the streets of Przemysl, which is only nine miles from the Soviet border.

Writers Who Seldom Wrote **********Some \"writers\" under the old system seldom wrote anything, and none had to worry much about how many books they sold. The future of subsidies for literary bureaucrats when Soviet publishing goes fully commercial, a day rapidly approaching, is another underlying issue. **********\"Things are approaching the point where every writer is going to have to answer the categorical question, 'Are you with us or them, for the reds or the whites?' \" Irina Strelkova said today in the weekly Literaturnaya Rossiya. **********The politics are increasingly vicious and personal. The conservatives, who include such well-known writers as Yuri Bondarev and Valentin Rasputin, accuse their foes of an illegal takeover of the Soviet writers' organization last month after the coup, and they have named the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko as the main organizer. **********Mr. Yevtushenko and his allies, in turn, accuse the other writers of taking public positions that had the effect of encouraging the coup plotters, who tried to use tanks and troops to overthrow President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********At the end of last month, Mr. Yevtushenko was elected vice president of the Soviet Writers' Union by members disgusted with the previous executives' failure to issue a statement condemning the coup while it was under way Aug. 19-21. **********He then pointed an accusing finger at the conservatives in the Russian union. \"We must not leave such people morally unpunished,\" he said, urging the police to seal the Russian Federation Writers' Union's neoclassical headquarters building on Komsomolsky Prospekt and seize the property for the forces of democracy. **********After a sit-in by the angry conservative writers prevented the militia from seizing the building, a Moscow City Hall official came by, apologized and called off the siege. In More Conciliatory Mood **********Now, in a somewhat more conciliatory mood, Mr. Yevtushenko and other liberal leaders of the Soviet Writers' Union have announced plans for an alternative Russian writers' organization, to be called the Union of Russian Writers, for those who do not want to be associated with the conservatives. **********\"Civil war in literature, like all civil wars, is unjust on both sides,\" said the announcement, published Wednesday in the daily newspaper Izvestia and signed by Mr. Yevtushenko and more than a score of other writers, including Fazil Iskander, Anatoly N. Rybakov and Robert Rozhdestvensky. **********\"It's the old struggle of Slavophiles versus modernizers,\" said Feliks F. Kuznetsov, who was thrown out of the leadership of the Soviet Writers' Union by the liberals last spring. **********But it is also a struggle for material advantage. \"The dachas we live in, the hospitals where we are treated and many other things are all provided to us by the Soviet Writers' Union Literary Fund,\" Mr. Rybakov said the other day in his summer cottage, a tranquil, winterized log cabin in the pine woods of the writers' colony of Peredelkino, at the western city limits of Moscow. **********Mr. Rybakov -- author of the novel \"Children of the Arbat,\" which was published here in 1987 at the beginning of an outpouring of Soviet literary depictions of the horrors of Stalinism -- did not let worries about his dacha keep him from issuing a condemnation of the coup on behalf of the Soviet Pen Center, of which he is honorary head, on the morning of Aug. 19. **********But now, what happens to the Soviet Writers' Union \"Litfond,\" the endowment that takes care of dachas and other writers' benefits, is one of the hottest political issues among writers. Those who do not have dachas think they should be privatized and rented to the highest bidder, or sold off. **********The authors of the proposal for a new Union of Russian Writers -- many of them, including Mr. Yevtushenko, comfortably occupying dachas in Peredelkino -- were careful to include a sentence saying, \"Membership in the Litfond and all benefits and services associated with it will be preserved.\" **********Standing in a brief interlude of sun between rain squalls outside the Gorizont movie theater during a break in the two-day Russian Federation Writers' Union congress, Mr. Kuznetsov said the days of the Soviet Writers' Union were clearly numbered. **********\"It's a general staff without any soldiers,\" he said, after proposing a \"Conference of Writers' Unions\" to try to bring some order to the chaos that would result if other Soviet republics form unions independent of the Soviet Writers' Union, as they have already started to do. **********Mr. Kuznetsov, as secretary of the Moscow organization of the Soviet Writers' Union in the 1970's, was in charge when it drove out such well-known \"Westernizers\" of the time as Vasily P.

He'd pull a newspaper clipping from his pocket and begin to read a spirited editorial denunciation of some political miscreant. After a few sentences, he'd stop, look around in mock astonishment and say: \"Why, do you know who they're talking about? They're talking about    me   .\" **********It's tempting to say I had a similar reaction when I read A. Michael Noll's \"The Failures of A.T.& T. Strategies\" (Forum, March 31). As he attacked the wisdom of our trying to acquire the NCR Corporation and accused us of lacking direction, he mischaracterized A.T.& T. as it is today and as it is developing for the future. **********A.T.& T.'s mission is broad and deep: to be the world leader in information technology -- a technology that inescapably involves the best of both computer and communications technology. **********A.T.& T. has a well-defined strategy for establishing leadership in this field: **********1) Maintaining leadership in its core businesses like network services (which Mr. Noll extols) and the manufacturing and sale of network telecommunications equipment (which he ignores). **********2) Establishing world leadership in networked computing, which is the technology driving the growth of electronic transactions. We expect such transactions, now running about 50 billion a year, to reach 200 billion annually by 1995. The critical enabler for satisfying this demand is the marriage of convenient user terminals like NCR's automatic teller machine computer systems and error-free communications networks. **********3) To firmly establish A.T.& T. as a truly global company. **********The merger with NCR would combine NCR's leadership in the hardware and software of electronic transactions with A.T.& T.'s expertise in the global networking of information. **********NCR's technology would benefit from the support of A.T.& T. Bell Laboratories, the world's leading research and development organization. A.T.& T.'s globalization drive would benefit from NCR's vast international presence and customer base. **********Mr. Noll apparently would have A.T.& T. stick to its telecommunications knitting, ignoring the fact that telecommunications and computing have been linked irrevocably for years. **********More disturbing, he seems to endorse the idea that economic growth is dependent almost exclusively on services, and that manufacturing should be left to others. This approach doesn't add up for America or for A.T.& T. In the new age of information technology, products and services are increasingly hard to separate. Consider: Is a cash machine, or supermarket point-of-sale terminal, a product or a service? **********Mr. Noll's implication that A.T.&T.'s \"premier network\" is not producing new information services is at odds with the facts. A.T.& T. has kept the United States network infrastructure the envy of the world. A.T.& T. has been putting more and more intelligence into its public switched network, available to large and small users at whatever level they wish and without the need for huge capital investments in private networks. **********To borrow a phrase, the company has done well by doing good. A.T.& T. had record earnings in 1989, and held them last year, despite a sliding economy, with the help of a 40 percent increase in international equipment sales. **********As Everett Dirksen also used to say: \"I'll sketch it for you in brief form.\" We have computers and communications; we have products as well as services. And, yes, we do have strategy and direction.

Request for a Resolution **********Republicans counterattcked. Senator Steven D. Symms of Idaho complained about \"handwringers,\" and said Mr. Bush had displayed \"great restraint.\" **********Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York said \"the issue is not the Constitution.\" Instead, he said, \"the issue is bottom-line American interest.\" He said the Senate should vote today to support Mr. Bush. **********In contrast to Thursday's sharp half-hour exchange before nearly all members of the Senate, today's speeches were given in a generally deserted Senate chamber and punctuated by repeated quorum calls awaiting the arrival of the next speechmaker. **********One Republican, Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, sided with the Democrats on the constitutional issue and with his fellow Republican senators on policy.

Tuccillo, the trade organization's chief economist, said that as the recovery takes hold, sales of existing homes \"should be healthy for the remainder of 1991 and robust in 1992.\" **********According to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the interest rate for 30-year conventional fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.47 percent in May, down nearly one percentage point from the same month in 1990. **********The median price of an existing home was $99,700, up 4.7 percent from the May 1990 price, but six-tenths of a percent below that of April. The median price means half of the homes cost more and half cost less. **********Sales in the Northeast, which rose 2.8 percent in April, slipped 1.9 percent in May to an annual rate of 530,000 units. The median price in the region was $143,600, 1.9 percent above that of May 1990.

But experts say the system itself does not appear in danger of collapse. **********The banks are suffering more from losses on bad loans than at any time in the last 50 years -- the amount sharply accelerating in the first nine months of last year. Federal regulators expect 180 banks to fail this year -- banks whose average size is much larger than those that failed in recent years. Nevertheless, the problems do not approach those of the early years of the Depression, when the collapse of 7,000 banks before the national bank holiday was declared in March 1933 helped shatter the economy. **********By contrast to the savings and loan industry, which is essentially broke, the banking industry earned a profit of $14.7 billion in the first nine months of 1990, despite the increase in loan losses. And to absorb future losses, the banks have a record $218.2 billion of capital and $52.3 billion of other reserves. Capital, in this sense, means stockholders' equity or, more simply, the difference between what a bank owns and what it owes.  A Large Bank's Fall **********The state of the banking system is now a matter of heightened public interest following the collapse in early January of the Bank of New England and several reports of losses and dividend cuts at other banks. The problems are typified by the troubled history of a little bank in White River Junction, Vt., for example, where the 1980's temptation to seek ever higher profits from real estate helped bring the institution to its knees -- or by a similar story in New Hampshire at a bank that had been in business since 1830. **********Attention is also being drawn to the system by the Administration's attempt to broaden it, by giving banks the powers to do business nationwide and to make it easier for them to enter the insurance and securities businesses. The proposals would not help solve a bank's immediate problems with bad loans, but they could eventually help make the banking industry more profitable, specialists say. **********\"We certainly don't have a banking crisis in the sense that the country as a whole has a problem,\" said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \"But in certain areas of the country there is real stress,\" he continued, adding that bank problems will worsen if the recession is more severe than he expects or if it lasts beyond midyear. **********The troubles among larger banks are clearly shown on the F.D.I.C.'s most recent list of banks that it sees as vulnerable to failure or requiring close supervision. At the end of 1990, that list, which is not publicly available, included 1,046 banks with $408.8 billion of assets, or 12.1 percent of the industry total. A year earlier, at the end of 1989, there were 1,109 banks on the problem list, but their assets were only 7.1 percent of the national total, or $235.5 billion. The list changes every quarter as the condition of some banks improves while other banks deteriorate or fail.   Stocks Down Sharply **********Among the nation's 10 largest banking companies, all continue to be rated as \"inherently sound\" with ratings of a middle grade or higher, according to Thomson Bankwatch, a bank rating firm based in New York City. But sharp declines in the stocks of those companies -- many are down more than 50 percent in the last 15 months -- are a reminder that investors and analysts see problems that the banking companies may not yet have acknowledged in their financial reports. **********Indeed, for 8 of the 10 largest banking companies, industry analysts estimate that losses on loans -- particularly risky loans for commercial real estate and leveraged buyouts -- are well in excess of the reserves set aside by the banks to cover those losses. **********Bankers dislike the private estimates of loan losses, because the losses for similar kinds of loans may vary widely from bank to bank. **********\"We make sure our reserves are consistent with the risk characteristics of our portfolio,\" said John F. Kooken, vice chairman at the Security Pacific Corporation, the nation's fifth-largest banking company, based in Los Angeles. \"There are a lot of checks and balances in the mechanism for setting reserves,\" he added, noting that the bank's loans are studied by outside auditors as well as banking regulators. Loan Troubles  Large Banks Cut Dividends **********Even if banks deny that loan losses are as severe as analysts estimate, they acknowledge that problems exist. Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Chemical Banking and Manufacturers Hanover have all cut their dividends in recent months, and others have reported large increases in their delinquent loans. **********Thomas Hanley, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said recent increases in loan problems among larger banks \"are especially alarming because they are showing up at the earliest stage of the recession but are already much greater than at the end of the 1981-82 recession.\" **********Financial statements filed with the F.D.I.C. by the banks on Sept. 30, the most recent available, show that through the first nine months of 1990, commercial banks in the United States charged off as a loss 1.36 percent of their outstanding loans, compared with only 56-hundredths of 1 percent in 1982, the last year of the most severe recession since World War II. **********Loans that were seriously delinquent equaled 2.65 percent of all bank assets on Sept. 30, up from 1.85 percent in 1982. In loans in this category, no payment has been made for 90 days or more or full payment is no longer expected. In a recession, when more borrowers default, the banking industry normally doubles its write-offs of bad loans; so analysts now expect losses to remain high for many months.  Problems Shift to the Northeast **********A New York Times analysis of the Sept. 30 data shows a geographic shifting of banking industry problems away from oil-producing states like Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana to the Northeastern region, where the troubles are rooted in declining real estate values. **********More than one in five Northeastern banks reported a loss, according to the September data, for the first nine months of 1990, compared with one in nine for the rest of the country. Many of the worst problems in that region have occurred at savings banks, including Goldome in Buffalo and several in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, that ventured outside their traditional business of collecting consumer deposits and making low-risk home loans and investments and into commercial real estate. **********The Times study of the financial reports filed by the nation's 12,926 banks identified 252 that were in weakened condition, either because of a low level of capital or unusually large amounts of seriously delinquent loans. Inclusion on these lists does not mean that all 252 banks are going to fail, but it is regarded as matter of serious concern.  Oil Collapse Jolted Southeast **********Most of the weakly capitalized banks are in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, where many banks are still suffering from losses in the late 80's, following the collapse of oil prices in 1986. Troubled banks in Massachusetts and Connecticut dominate the list of banks with large holdings of seriously delinquent loans. **********The F.D.I.C., whose list of \"problem\" banks has many more names on it than 252, has complete access to bank records and can examine the quality of individual loans. It does not publicly identify problem banks, though depositors may request an annual financial statement from their bank or may write to the F.D.I.C. to obtain a copy of quarterly reports filed by any bank with federally insured deposits. **********Measuring the health of banks depends mostly on the value of the loans they have made and how that value is figured. Since there is no stock exchange to determine the value of bank loans, their worth is always open to debate. **********If it is assumed that the loans would be sold immediately, their price would be sharply lower than their face amount and banks would realize large losses. An alternative, preferred by bankers, is to assume that the loans will not be sold, and that losses would be recognized only when a default occurred or became likely.  Realty Woes Banks Are Forced To Take Losses **********The steep decline in real estate markets in the last two years has led bank examiners to conclude that many bank loans backing those projects have also declined in value. They have forced banks to write off many loans as a loss and build their reserves to cover future losses. **********But in the last few weeks, in response to complaints that strict accounting practices were closing off the supply of new loans to the economy, regulators have shown signs of adopting easier accounting rules. These rules could reduce the losses and reserves required of banks. **********\"We don't want the environment bankers face to be more difficult than it has to be,\" said Robert L. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency. **********To measure whether a bank can withstand a siege of bad loans, analysts and regulators pay close attention to the bank's capital to absorb the losses. For many banks, the capital cushion is now thin. But the industry as a whole has more than $6.50 of capital for each $100 of assets, or more than double the minimum standard for financial safety set by regulators.  Two Key Ratios Studied **********Two important warning signs that analysts look for are the ratio of a bank's capital to assets and the ratio of bad loans to assets. Experience suggests that an average of at least 30 percent of banks with capital of less than 3 percent of assets will fail within two years, and that 60 percent with less than 1.5 percent will fail in that time. Warnings sound, too, when a bank has more than 8 percent of its assets in nonperforming loans. **********Texas still has more insolvent and weakly capitalized banks than any other state, but problems are abating there, with fewer banks reporting losses and delinquent loans declining. In the Northeast, despite its problems, relatively few banks have accumulated enough losses to push their capital below 3 percent. But the number of banks reporting losses is growing and their holdings of delinquent loans are rising faster than in any other region of the country.  Customer Losses Leading Concerns Look Elsewhere **********The temptation to plunge into commercial real estate lending was especially strong for many of the country's largest banks. They had been hurt when top-rated corporations, beginning in the 1960's, started to bypass American banks to get funds from foreign banks or the securities markets, where interest rates were lower. **********\"Twenty years ago we would have had major credit commitments and outstanding loans to companies like Du Pont and TRW,\" said Edward Brandon, chief executive at the National City Corporation, a Cleveland-based banking company that has been hurt in commercial real estate but remains profitable and well capitalized. Without those top-flight borrowers \"banks have been forced to seek other borrowers, which inevitably means making riskier loans.\" **********Still, bankers and analysts alike repeat that for all the unfavorable trends, the great majority of the nation's banks are faring well. A Stress on Growth **********A leading cause of bank problems, said James McCormick, president of the First Manhattan Consulting group, is \"a reliance on growth to cover up other failings, whether it is a high level of expenses, a recent acquisition that cost too much, or unprofitable operations.\" **********Because real estate loans carried higher interest rates than other business loans, they seemed attractive. Many banks increased their commitment to these loans by 20 percent or more from 1986 through 1989. **********\"The most seductive trap in banking is growth,\" said John G. Medlin Jr., chairman of the First Wachovia Corporation in Winston-Salem, N.C. \"It looks so good while it is happening, but the real costs do not become apparent until later.\" **********Mr. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, said many leading bank executives ignored warnings issued by his office as long ago as 1985 that standards for real estate loans were slipping. **********\"There are just too many bankers who forgot or ignored some fundamental precepts of the business,\" he said. \"They put too many of their eggs into the basket of commercial real estate, and now they are paying the price.\"  Insolvencies  Most Are in Texas And the Northeast **********The compilation of the Sept. 30 bank data shows the following: **********Twenty-five banks, with assets totaling nearly $13.5 billion, had the weakest capitalization in the country. Their losses had eaten away at capital to the point where they were insolvent and owed more to depositors and other creditors than the value of their \"hard\" assets, like loans and investments. Fourteen of the 25 have since closed. **********Texas accounted for 13 of the insolvent banks, reflecting in large part the economic problems that hit the state and the region after the 1986 fall in oil prices. Five banks in the Northeast are in that category, including three F.D.I.C.-insured savings banks that are the only ones on the list with more than $500 million of assets -- Goldome, with headquarters in Buffalo; the Maine Savings Bank of Portland, and the New Hampshire Savings Bank of Concord. **********The largest insolvent bank is Goldome, which has nearly $10.3 billion of assets. Under close scrutiny of regulators it has been steadily shrinking its business. It has sold 24 branches with $2.8 billion of deposits in the New York City area to the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation. **********Thomas A. Cooper, chairman of Goldome, said the negative capital position was not necessarily a death knell. \"Capital is extremely important, and regulators are right to demand that banks keep their financial condition strong,\" he said. But he noted that accounting practices show Goldome's weakness but \"do not reflect our strength, which is the value of our consumer business.\" **********By allowing Goldome to stay in business despite a lack of capital, Mr. Cooper said, regulators gave the bank time to cut expenses by 40 percent. He noted that the company returned to profitability in the last half of 1990. Insufficient Capital **********Another 166 banks, with assets totaling $55.8 billion, had capital equal to less than 3 percent of their assets, the minimum set by regulators. For 61 banks, capital was less than 1.5 percent of assets. **********While Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana account for 92 of the banks with capital below 3 percent, they are relatively small institutions, with only one having assets above $500 million. Nine of the 10 largest banks in Texas have either failed or been acquired in the last few years, leaving only the smaller banks with lingering problems. **********In the Northeast, which to the F.D.I.C. includes the District of Columbia, Maryland and the 10 states to the north, there are fewer undercapitalized banks, but they are much larger than those in Texas. The weakly capitalized banks from the region included 11 with more than $1 billion of assets, including the $13.2 billion Bank of New England, which was taken over last month by the F.D.I.C., and the $5.9 billion American Security Bank, a unit of MNC Financial, a Baltimore company that owns the Maryland National Bank. To raise cash and strengthen its bank units, MNC recently sold its credit card business. **********The largest savings banks reporting weak capital were also in the Northeast, and included the Meritor Savings Bank of Philadelphia, now known as the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, with $5.6 billion of assets, and the Dollar Dry Dock Bank of New York, with $4.6 billion. Both Meritor and Dollar Dry Dock have been selling branches and taking other measures to reduce expenses.  Bad Loans **********There were 118 banks, with total assets of $68.8 billion, that had more than 8 percent of their assets in nonperforming loans. The industry average for such loans on Sept. 30 was only 2.65 percent. But earnings reports for the fourth quarter of 1990, not yet compiled by Federal regulators, showed continued rapid increases in nonperforming assets in the Northeast and some evidence that California was beginning to experience the same problem as real estate prices there turned down. **********Eight percent is a red flag to regulators and analysts, warning that additional loan losses are likely. **********Northeastern states account for 68 of the banks with nonperforming loans above 8 percent. Two of the largest are the $9.3 billion Midlantic Bank in Newark and the $5.2 billion European American Bank in New York. Midlantic has been trying to improve its condition by reducing its size and selling assets, while European American has relied on a fresh capital investment by its European owners, led by ABN AMRO Holding of the Netherlands.  A Bank's Fall  Poor Management And Realty Losses **********The brief but troubled history of the Valley Bank in White River Junction, Vt., is an example of how the temptation of high profits from real estate lending and poor management can bring a bank to its knees. **********When Valley Bank was established in early 1987, there was still enough spark in the New England real estate market for the founders to expect to match the high profits and rapid growth of many other New England banks. **********\"There was great pressure to generate earnings, and in that process the principles of lending got put on a back burner,\" said Joseph J. Greco, who was named Valley Bank's president a month ago. \"The supply of credit for real estate deals from banks and savings banks far outstripped the demand. If you were the new bank on the block, like Valley was, you did not get the more sound, reputable businesses. You had to take the second tier.\" **********By Sept. 30, the costs of those policies were clear: heavy loan losses had reduced Valley's capital to only $508,000, or 1.23 percent of assets. With the real estate market still falling, Valley is stuck with 49 percent of its assets consisting of loans backed by commercial real estate projects.  Looking for Capital **********As recently as a decade ago, commercial real estate loans accounted for only 5.8 perent of bank assets, and many bankers refused to consider such loans at all. Or they would require personal guarantees from developers as well as a solid business plan, with tenants lined up before construction began. But such lending grew rapidly in the 80's and reached 11.9 percent of assets by last Sept. 30. At 2,836 banks, commercial real estate lending accounted for more than 15 percent of all assets. And at 123 banks, the figure reached 40 percent. **********\"In retropect, it was probably not the best time for this particular venture to have been started,\" Mr. Greco said. But now that the mistakes have been made, he added, the bank is trying to recover what it can from the bad loans \"and look everywhere for more capital.\" **********The rush to participate in the 80's real estate boom claimed victims far older and better established than Valley National. The New Hampshire Savings Bank in Concord, for example, was founded in 1830 as a mutual-type bank owned by its depositors. But in 1982 it converted to a shareholder-owned company and soon became an aggressive lender on real estate. Losses on bad loans wiped out the $58.6 million of capital the bank had at the end of 1988 and left it insolvent, owing $38.8 million more to depositors and creditors than the estimated value of its assets. **********Whatever else is done, most experts agree that the banks must return to sound lending practices, even if growth is sacrificed. In the best of times, the difference between healthy and weak banks is small. Operating on average with only about $6.50 of capital for every $100 of loans and investments, banks are extremely vulnerable to relatively small losses on loans, which can be enough to wipe out much of their capital. **********\"This is a business where you can be right 95 percent of the time, and still be in serious trouble,\" said Mr. Seidman of the F.D.I.C. **********Next: The bank run WHAT THE CHARTS AND LISTS SHOW **********The charts are based on balance sheets and income reports from 12,926 banks as of Sept. 30, 1990, the last period for which such data are available. All the banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. **********A computer-assisted search of those records identified banks that were insolvent, or had a small amount of capital relative to their size, or had a high amount of nonperforming loans. Banking experts regard low capital and large holdings of nonperforming loans as two key indicators of a troubled bank. **********Banks on the insolvent list were those with negative capital-to-asset ratios, meaning that the amounts they owed depositors and other creditors were greater than the value of their \"hard\" assets, like loans and investments. Eighteen of the 25 banks on this list have since closed. **********The Low Percentage of Capital to Assets list includes banks whose equity capital had shrunk to less than 3 percent of assets. Equity capital represents the amount that a bank's assets exceeds what it owes to depositors and other creditors.  Nonperforming Loans **********And the banks on the Nonperforming Loans list were those with more than 8 percent of their assets tied up in loans that are delinquent by 90 days or more, or so troubled that the bank does not expect repayment in full. **********The appearance of a bank on these lists does not mean it will fail. But bank regulators regard it as a clear sign of serious trouble when a bank's capital-to-assets ratio falls below 3 percent or when bad loans climb to more than 8 percent of assets. **********The chart covering the nation's 10 largest banking companies compares the amount of capital and reserves they reported on Sept. 30 with outside analysts' assessments of the losses banks are likely to suffer on their loans. Bankers count on the reserve for loan losses as a way of setting aside money to cover bad loans, but many analysts say those reserves are not enough to cover the losses that banks will actually face. **********For 8 of the 10 largest banking companies, the losses based on assumptions used by analysts exceeded the banks' reserves and left the institutions with less capital than their financial statements showed on Sept. 30. Two companies, J. P. Morgan & Company and the Bankers Trust New York Corporation, appeared to have reserves greater than losses assumed for their loan portfolios. Of course, the actual loss on those loans will vary widely from bank to bank, and could disappear for many loans if the economy and real estate markets improve.  Estimates of Losses **********Based on past experience, analysts assume the losses average 10 percent for loans to highly indebted companies; 20 percent for all kinds of commercial real estate; 50 percent for delinquent loans to less-developed countries; 25 percent for all other kinds of loans so delinquent that bankers call them nonperforming, and 1.5 percent for all other kinds of loans. Those losses are then subtracted from the company's loan-loss reserves and existing capital. **********The bankers counter by saying that the analysts' estimates are exaggerated. Even if all those losses materialized, they would probably occur over a period of time, during which banks could build up reserves from profits, the bankers say. Citibank officials add that the analysts' estimates are wrong because they do not recognize the full extent to which the bank company has already written off troubled loans."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/business/brooks-bros-is-revising-commissions.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1991-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 603, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brooks Bros.

Many have relationships with loyal consumers that go back many years. A Double-Edged Effect **********The new system raises the commission percentage paid to sales clerks who exceed certain goals, more directly linking higher salaries to the amount of merchandise they sell. But those who do not surpass the goal are effectively penalized with a lower salary. Another important part of the plan allows sales clerks for the first time to sell items in departments outside their own. **********\"What we've done is in effect lower the commission but create incentives which didn't exist before,\" said Edward Murphy, Brooks Brothers' executive vice president and chief operating officer. With a new base and a guaranteed wage, the sales clerks \"now can take more time to sell in other departments so that they can write up multiple sales,\" he added. **********The men's wear chain previously used a system common in retailing, in which sales clerks receive a flat commission based on a percentage of the price of the goods they sell. In Brooks Brothers' case it averaged 9 percent, regardless of how much an individual's sales increased. 500 Sales Clerks Affected **********The new policy affects 500 of the company's 1,500 sales clerks. They are paid a base hourly wage averaging about 75 percent of what they earned in 1989. **********Those who sell 75 percent or less of what they sold in 1989 will receive just the hourly rate. But if they exceed it, they will get an added commission for the sales above that base. And the percentage paid as commission rises along with the sales volume. **********For example, those who sell 85 percent of what they sold in 1989 will get a 5 percent commission on that increase. Above the 85 percent level, the commission will be 10 percent. **********The salary changes affect only sales clerks in stores that are not unionized among the total of 50 that Brooks Brothers operates in this country.

In the 16th and 17th centuries the city was ruled by Polish monarchs, but in 1701 it came under German control again, as the capital of the province of East Prussia.

The sad fact is that most engineers and scientists, let alone makers of industrial policy, have never had a course in statistics because it is still an arcane (and very dull) elective in this country. Reducing defects is all well and good, but it must be combined with knowing something about their significance and impact on product or process. The chart with the article, previously published by the International Business Machines Corporation, compares incommensurate errors and final results of errors and leads to the conclusion that tighter controls and measurements enhance quality, when, in many cases, they act to hinder development, innovation and design improvement which can have larger impact. Better products do not only come from fine tuning manufacturing yields so that you lose one good part in every million; they come from designs which are less sensitive and a process which has wider latitude.

Perhaps more than any other recent program, Quattro Pro proves that there is still plenty of life left in the DOS operating system. **********The Quattro Pro graphical interface is the most noticeable improvement in what many people already regarded as the best spreadsheet for personal computers made by the International Business Machines Corporation and compatible models. The true value of a spreadsheet is its ability to manipulate and consolidate numbers, and Quattro Pro does that as well as program. **********Certainly, Microsoft's Windows is a productive advance, replacing the character-based face of DOS with a mouse-driven system of pull-down menus, symbols and windows. Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., has sold more than two million copies of Windows, and its Excel 3.0 spreadsheet has become the standard that everyone, including Borland and the Lotus Development Corporation, is scrambling to meet. **********\"Let's face it, there are tens of millions of computers out there, and 90-plus percent of them are Intel-based PC's running DOS,\" said Frank J. Michnoff, director of desktop computer strategies for the Meta Group, a market research and consulting firm in Westport, Conn. He was referring to the many personal computers powered by microprocessors made by the Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif. \"Everyone is so focused on Windows and OS/2, they're forgetting that the old technology continues to progress as well,\" he said. \"I see more happening in the DOS market than ever before.\" **********Unlike Windows in general and Excel in particular, which requires a personal computer using a fast 80286 chip and several megabytes of memory, Quattro Pro will work on a personal computer with the less powerful 8088 chip and only 512 kilobytes of memory (the configuration of the old I.B.M. PC XT). Of course, Quattro Pro, like most spreadsheets, will work better with more processor power and memory. And an EGA or VGA monitor is required to take advantage of Quattro Pro's \"what you see is what you get\" graphics mode. That feature is popularly known as wysiwyg (pronounced wiz-ZEE-wig). **********Borland, based in Scotts Valley, Calif., is not alone in courting the millions of spreadsheet users in the DOS world. Lotus, whose 1-2-3 spreadsheet, popularized that form of software, is reported to be nearly ready to release an upgraded version of its low-end spreadsheet, to be called Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.3. (To confuse matters, Lotus is developing a raft of 1-2-3's, including a Windows version and a Macintosh version, and another DOS version called Release 3.1 Plus. It also makes a version for the OS/2 operating system.) Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.3 is said to have some impressive features of its own, including a built-in viewer function that lets the user actually look into spreadsheet files on a hard disk before loading them into memory, a trick first used in Lotus's Magellan program. **********On the surface, Quattro Pro could pass for a Windows program. Command buttons, which are operated by clicking a mouse, have a sculpted, three-dimensional look just like the ones on Excel. They even depress when they are clicked. **********Quattro Pro 3.0 allows users to see typefaces, sizes, colors and styles the way they will appear when the worksheet is printed -- a great benefit for people who use spreadsheets to create presentations and reports. **********A \"zoom\" command even lets an executive swoop in to look more closely at a particular table or area of a worksheet, or zoom back out to see the bigger picture. **********Under the hood, however, Quattro Pro lacks such advantages of Windows as advanced memory management or the ability to stay active on screen while the user works in another application. Nor does it have Excel's impressive object-linking and embedding technology, which ties together, for example, a chart within a spreadsheet to its original data source. But for looks, both on screen and on paper, Quattro Pro yields little ground to the fancier Windows programs. **********Other improvements include better printing performance on laser printers and a \"print to fit\" feature that can condense a spreadsheet to fit onto a single page. For those whose worksheets are too big to fit legibly on one page, Quattro Pro has a banner-printing feature as well, for printing sideways on continuous-form printers. **********Some executives forgo paper and use their spreadsheets for computer-based presentations. For them, Borland has added a number of jazzy features, including sound effects and slide-show transitions, which employ television tricks like fades, wipes, dissolves and spirals. The effects can be quite impressive, although some users may find it gauche to start a presentation with trumpet fanfare and conclude it with the sound of digitized cheering and applause. **********Borland also includes a \"Proview Power Pack\" that offers guidance on how to use these special effects to best advantage. The Power Pack comes with a selection of clip art that can be used to add emphasis to reports or 35-millimeter slides, a collection of digitized sound effects, special shortcuts called macros and templates that automate the production of many styles of graphs and charts and two Bitstream headline fonts to supplement the 18 fonts included with the spreadsheet itself. **********All these new features augment what was already a superior spreadsheet, and it is somewhat surprising that Borland released version 3.0 so soon after the last major upgrade, version 2.0, which was introduced last fall. **********\"It is very, very impressive that they were able to turn this around so quickly,\" said Louis Giglio, vice president and director of computer software and services research for Bear, Stearns & Company in New York. \"Version 2.0 shipped in October, and here it is tax time and they've already shipped a new version with impressive new features.\" **********Quattro Pro has a list price of $495. Owners of earlier versions of Quattro Pro can upgrade for $49.95 to $99.95, depending on which version they have. And Borland will sell the new version for $129.95 to anyone willing to switch from competing high-end spreadsheets, a tactic that has made significant inroads against Lotus's 1-2-3. The Proview Power Pack is included with the main software; it costs an additional $49.95 for those who are upgrading or switching from a rival. **********\"Some of Lotus's problems can be laid directly on Borland's doorstep,\" said Mr. Giglio. He said he expected the competition to heat up when Lotus, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., brings out its Windows version of 1-2-3 later this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/22/business/business-digest-599791.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 633, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Markets **********World financial markets did an about-face, rallying strongly as word spread from the Soviet Union that the coup had collapsed.

Others have been middle-ranking officers who staged four rebellions in as many years. **********While he has won convictions in almost every case, his problem has been insuring that the generals stay in prison. Since coming to office in mid-1989, President Carlos Saul Menem, arguing the need for national reconciliation, has granted pardons to almost all convicted military officials. **********But for now at least, Mr. Moreno Ocampo says, he sees the era of generals on trial winding down, and with it a diminishing in the threat of a military takeover that has cast a shadow over Argentina since its return to democracy in 1983. **********\"We prosecuted the generals who ordered the disappearances,\" he said in a recent interview in his cluttered office in the Government's Palace of Justice. \"We put them on trial for human rights abuses and made them face their accusers. We convicted the generals who started the war with Britain. But that era is over. The only thing left may be for the families to try to find some of the bodies of the disappeared.\"  Convictions Upheld **********On Monday, the 39-year-old prosecutor had a symbolic ending to his career as a thorn in the side of the military. Argentina's Federal Appeals Court upheld the convictions of 15 leaders of the rogue military unit called the Carapintadas, or Painted Faces, which staged a rebellion in December, two days before a visit by President Bush. **********It was the fourth uprising since 1987 by the Carapintadas, who get their name from the war paint they smear on their faces. In a day of violence, in which 600 soldiers commandeered tanks and took over government offices in downtown Buenos Aires, 21 people were killed and more than 200 wounded, raising once again the uneasy question whether after eight years of nonmilitary rule democracy was still only an experiment. **********But the response of both the military establishment and the civilian Government was surprisingly strong, with the army overpowering the rebels. **********Some officers called for the death penalty for the rebellion's leaders, and a military court promptly sentenced several to life in prison. The commanders appealed to the civilian courts, and Mr. Moreno Ocampo was called upon to insure that the sentences stuck. **********There are other signs that military experts use to argue that in the current political environment Argentina's history of military coups may be fading. The armed forces, through budget cuts, have been significantly reduced and are now poorly equipped. President Menem forced the air force to shut down its secret ballistic missile project in a display of executive authority. And public opinion polls show very little desire for a return to military rule. **********\"The symptoms of lack of discipline and disintegration are many,\" said Rosendo Fraga, a military analyst. \"And this has produced a noticeable wearing away of the pre-eminence of the Ministry of Defense and the four heads of the armed forces.\" **********Most important to Mr. Moreno was that the courts upheld the life sentence against the leader of the Carapintadas and mastermind of the last two uprisings, Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin. Despite the failure of the coup attempt, Colonel Seineldin has become a kind of folk hero among militant nationalist sectors of Argentine society, with graffiti appearing on many walls and kiosks around town saying, \"Seineldin is the people.\" **********A commander in the Falklands war, Colonel Seineldin has said his idols are Franco and Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, the former military leader of Paraguay. Though a Muslim by birth, he converted to Roman Catholicism. He and others among the rebellion's leaders hold daily Mass in their prison cells. **********The basic Carapintada philosophy is that the Argentine civilian Government has compromised its traditions by aligning itself with the United States, which it considers has supported Communism in the Soviet Union. Colonel Seineldin has asserted that the State Department is \"filled with Communists.\" **********Mr. Moreno Ocampo has argued that contrary to assertions by the Carapintadas that they were protesting poor pay and neglect, the December rebellion was a full-fledged coup attempt. **********But the Appeals Court did not agree. While it upheld the life sentence on Colonel Seineldin and stripped all the officers of their military rank, it reduced some of the sentences of the other officers. Mr. Moreno Ocampo cannot feel entirely at ease, given President Menem's record of pardoning previously convicted officers, even though he has promised that he will not pardon any of the convicted Carapintadas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/30/business/real-estate-2-big-projects-for-insurer-in-louisville.html": {"writer_name": "Rachael Kamuf", "pub_date": "1991-10-30", "snippet": "THE expansion needs of the Capital Holding Corporation, a big insurer, are driving two major construction projects in downtown Louisville; one will be the tallest building in Kentucky.\n\nThe insurer has formed a partnership with Gerald Hines Intere...", "word_count": 803, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Real Estate;\n2 Big Projects For Insurer In Louisville", "print_headline": "Real Estate;\n2 Big Projects For Insurer In Louisville", "body_text": " **********THE expansion needs of the Capital Holding Corporation, a big insurer, are driving two major construction projects in downtown Louisville; one will be the tallest building in Kentucky. **********The insurer has formed a partnership with Gerald Hines Interests of Houston and Kawasaki Steel America, a unit of the Kawasaki Corporation of Japan, to build a $110 million corporate headquarters with offices to rent out as well. **********Separately, the Louisville division of the Dallas-based Paragon Group is under contract to build a $35 million office complex that Capital Holding will lease for subsidiary operations. **********Jack McCabe, managing director of real estate investments at Capital Holding, said the space commitments were made because \"we are really busting at the seams.\" Capital is one of the top five publicly owned life insurers, with $16.7 billion in assets. **********The company's present 300,000-square-foot headquarters building, considered obsolete, is to be demolished when the new developments are completed early in 1993.

Baptist and Adventist schools were temporarily closed and then allowed to reopen only on the condition that teaching be in Spanish.

A Dispiriting Island Tour **********Today, Colombians admit they are embarrassed by the effect of the colonization campaign. In 1954, the island had only 7,000 people, largely fishermen and farmers. Today, this 10-square-mile island is crowded with 70,000 people, giving it one of the highest island population densities in the world. **********On a recent afternoon, members of the now English-speaking minority served as guides for what became a dispiriting island tour. **********\"This used to be one of our cemeteries,\" said Enrique Pusey, a Sons of the Soil leader, pointing to a lot now occupied by a tourist hotel and McPollo, a fried chicken joint. **********The coastal road passed other marks of Colombia's domination: a coconut processing cooperative that had been expropriated for a naval base; a mangrove swamp that was bulldozed to build vacation retreats for members of the Cali cocaine cartel, and the rocky skeleton of a two-mile beach in the native section of the island that had been dug up and trucked away for building materials. **********From the steeple of the First Baptist Church, a white clapboard structure built in the 19th century from imported Alabama pine, a visitor could see shantytowns filled with poor immigrants lured from Colombia's coastal cities. **********Although police harassment has subsided, the Sons of the Soil group still spreads its files among members' houses. **********At a recent closed-door meeting, a surprising amount of resentment toward \"the Spaniards\" flowed out on a river of Caribbean-accented English. **********One complained that English-language books, Bibles and magazines are routinely held up in customs, even though San Andres is a free port.

In the topsy-turvy world of southern Iraq, the United States Army is a discriminating captor. **********American troops, who are preparing to leave Iraq soon, carefully screen Iraqis at the checkpoint to make sure that would-be prisoners of war are not simply desperate refugees trying to get out of Iraq. **********\"They have to have proof for us to take them,\" explained Sgt. Maqsood Shah, a 28-year-old American soldier who was born in Afghanistan and is fluent in Arabic.  Intricate Escape Schemes **********American soldiers say some refugees are so desperate to get out of Iraq that they buy military passes to Basra on the black market and steal Iraqi military uniforms so they can pose as soldiers. **********Soldier or poseur, each day young Iraqi men walk away from the checkpoints here in allied-occupied Iraq, disappointed that they have not been led away by American military policemen for transport to prisoner-of-war camps in Saudi Arabia.

Over the weekend, the Third Armored Division took in 988 Iraqi prisoners of war in one day, three times the average in the days before the cease-fire terms took effect. American soldiers have continued to accept Iraqis who have turned themselves in as war prisoners despite the cease-fire and the emerging peace settlment.  Possible Saudi Asylum **********If an Iraqi soldier becomes a prisoner of war and is taken to Saudi Arabia, he is given an opportunity to seek asylum there under international law. American soldiers at the checkpoints here say some Iraqi soldiers are repeaters, who turn themselves in after being returned to Iraq from camps in Saudi Arabia. **********Unless an Iraqi becomes a war prisoner, his best chance to get out is probably to join the throngs of refugees at the camps in Safwan. But right now the refugee camps are \"something of a dead end,\" said Capt. Roland F. de Marcellus, 28 years old, of the Army's 404th Civil Affairs Company, a reserve unit from Trenton, N.J. **********The peace settlement to be administered by the United Nations has given the refugees in Safwan a measure of protection in the short run. Under terms of the settlement, Safwan is in the zone that is to be monitored by United Nations observers and troops. **********The area is tense despite the peace arrangements. Some of the refugees have threatened the Mayor and other local officials because they support the Government of Saddam Hussein. **********Many refugees say Mr. Hussein has planted spies in the camp and are afraid of what will happen when the Americans leave. The south of Iraq is the region dominated by Shiite Muslims, many of whom took part in the recent ill-fated revolt against Mr. Hussein's rule. Some have already died, and many others assume further reprisals are coming.  Indictment of U.S. Role **********The long-term future for the refugees is uncertain, and the United States has done little to reassure the refugees on this count. **********An Iraqi professor complained that the United States has not set up an effective system for processing requests for asylum. Requests are taken by officers and funneled up the chain of command. But it is not clear what, if anything, is done with them. And no State Department officials have come here to help deal with the refugee problem, Captain de Marcellus said. **********The captain said the refugees were told that it is \"highly unlikely that they will get asylum of any sort while we are here.\" **********\"Our goal is to give them an honest appraisal and let them make the decision,\" he added. \"They know what the risks are.\"  Outside the Future U.N. Zone **********A further problem is that many of the would-be refugees are outside the six-mile strip inside Iraqi territory to be occupied by United Nations forces. **********As a matter of policy, the Army is not arranging transportation for the refugees to Safwan, though exceptions are quietly made for high-ranking civilian officials who want to leave Iraq as well as Iraqis bearing important information about their country's military. **********The American concern is that the raising of such hopes would make Safwan a magnet for a huge number of Iraqis who would flee here. But even without American help, Iraqis continue to stream here in dilapidated buses and trucks, some hitchhiking along the highway to Safwan. **********\"It is not our policy\" to transport them, Captain de Marcellus said. \"That would reinforce the delusion that we could help them more than we can.

It reflects the growing interest in \"point-of-purchase advertising,\" in which products are promoted as customers approach them or examine them. **********\"This is a tremendous boon to retailers because it enables them to better understand the flow through the store and better merchandise products,\" said Robert L. McCann, executive vice president of Videocart. As the argues the case, the Videocart service \"is revealing very important marketing data.\" **********Asked about the new system one recent evening in the Pathmark here, Hank Rodriquez, 68, said, \"If your're looking for sales, the carts are great. Everybody thinks they're cool.\" **********Well, not everybody. **********\"They're fun for the kids and everything, but when I use them, I tend to ignore the screen,\" said Cecilia Pacheco, 24. \"I know what I'm going to buy when I come here. It's just a toy, but it's not a help to shop.\" **********Videocart began working on the system in 1986 when it was a unit of Information Resources Inc. of Chicago, a company that tracks retail sales. Videocart was spun off as a publicly traded company last October; its first annual report, issued this spring, showed a loss of $6.7 million for the fiscal year ended in March on revenues of $4.9 million. Its executives have not predicted when they expect the company to turn a profit. **********Videocart's technologies remain largely hidden from shoppers because infrared and FM radio signals control the system. The carts themselves look just like standard shopping carts, except for a 6-inch by 9-inch liquid crystal screen and computer perched on the right side of the handle. **********The unit appears similar to a laptop computer screen. Underneath is the computer itself, which has 1 megabyte of memory, about 800 kilobytes of which are programmable so advertisements and other information can easily be changed. The system has no audio capability, so customers receive information only by looking at the screen. A rechargeable battery under the cart supplies power. **********A satellite dish on the supermarket roof receives new advertisements and other data from Videocart headquarters in Chicago each week. The information is loaded into the cart computers each week. Immediate changes can be made through the FM radio channel that a central computer in the store uses to communicate with the carts. **********The system works like this: As a customer enters an aisle, the cart passes through infrared waves transmitted by the trigger that tell the cart where it is located. The computer begins to display a list of specials for products in the aisle. **********For example, as the shopper approaches the condiments section, a picture of Kraft salad dressing is shown, along with a pitch for the brand. At soft drinks, the screen displays an advertisement for Pepsi. **********The screen also displays messages inviting shoppers to press buttons on the computer in order to locate products and see a sample of recipes that use the brands they are examining. And the computer can display a map pinpointing the customer's location in the store. **********Videocart recently unveiled yet another feature: electronic coupons. When customers examine a particular brand, the computer tells them that they can save money on the product by pressing a button. If the customer agrees, the computer sends a message to the checkout counter so that if the product is scanned at the cash register, the coupon value is deducted from the bill. The computer keeps track and the discount is granted only to that particular customer if the product is bought. **********All this technology, of course, is not cheap. A system for a single store, including 150 to 200 shopping carts, is about $100,000, Mr. McCann said. Ordinary carts, purchased in bulk, cost about $100 each. **********The company's revenue stream is based on charging manufacturers $3 per thousand shoppers a week for each advertisement at each store. Mr. McCann said the company determines how much to charge each chain by weighing the size of the supermarket and how much visibility a particular supermarket can provide for the carts. The supermarket can also promote items on its own that the manufacturers are not paying a fee to advertise. **********Most supermarkets allow customers to choose between Videocarts and standard shopping carts. Giant Food of Washington, which is testing the carts at its store in Frederick, Md., has found that 55 to 60 percent of shoppers take the Videocarts, said Joanne Anderson, the chain's manager of data processing field support. **********At the Pathmark store here, which has been testing the system since March, customers also prefer the Videocarts and have reported few problems using them, said Frank Pagano, an assistant manager at the store. **********Mrs. Anderson of Giant Food said she had had a number of questions about the Videocarts before the chain began testing them in May. \"We were concerned about how to get the batteries recharged, how labor-intensive the system is, are the batteries safe, and whether the radio frequency would interfere with any other frequencies used in the store.\" **********But she said Giant has encountered few problems. **********\"Reaction from customers has been very positive,\" she said. \"I think they see it the way we want them to see it -- as an additional service from Giant.\" **********Still, Videocart will have to overcome resistance from shoppers who don't see grocery shopping as a pleasant experience. **********\"I'm very familiar with the layout for the store, so the carts are not very useful,\" said John K. Ryan, a 52-year-old lawyer. \"Given the choice, I avoid using them. From my vantage point, they contribute nothing that adds efficiency to the shopping experience.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/25/business/banker-cuts-bcci-ties.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Banker Cuts B.C.C.I.

But few economies appear poised to benefit as much as Japan's in the event of a brief war, or have the staying power to endure a long war with as little strain, a range of experts say. **********Japan has been criticized for contributing money but not personnel to help in the allied effort to force Iraq out of Kuwait, even though it is more dependent on Middle East oil than any other industrial country. Now some economists say that in the war's aftermath, Japan may enjoy the greatest economic boost, particularly if the risk of soaring oil prices is reduced.  A Difficult Transition **********This is not to say that Japan's economic forecast is entirely rosy. Even before the crisis began, Japan was in the midst of a difficult economic transition. Growth is slowing from its blistering pace of the last several years, a problem in a country that considers expansion of less than 3 percent a recession. The stock market plunged 40 percent last year as interest rates soared, corporate profits are falling, and many are predicting property prices will decline after big increases in the 1980's. The recession in the United States is also threatening to cut into Japanese exports. **********Most menacing, economists say, are the glaring weaknesses in Japan's financial sector: many fear that a sharp slide in Japan's real estate prices is posing a threat to banks, which have made hundreds of billions of dollars of loans with land as collateral. **********The mounting difficulties Japan faces sound similar, in fact, to those in the United States. But there is one huge difference: while America's policy makers are rapidly cutting interest rates and fighting to save banks, protect jobs and stave off an economic contraction, the Japanese Government has deliberately slowed the boom here by tightening its monetary policy and keeping interest rates high. **********\"The biggest possible cause of a recession in Japan is too tight a monetary policy by the Bank of Japan,\" said Takao Akabane, formerly the vice minister at the Economic Planning Agency. **********Overly easy monetary policies during the latter half of the 1980's, then a severe tightening in the last year, are responsible for the current precarious balance in the markets, economists say. **********It is a risky policy, to be sure, because the markets have already shown a tendency to spiral out of control when investors panic in the face of big price declines. But many analysts are confident that Japanese economic managers are skillful enough to succeed, barring a huge external shock. **********\"Our real fear is outside disturbances like the Persian Gulf, not internal forces,\" said Yoshihisa Kitai, chief economist at the Long Term Credit Bank. \"As for the internal factors, the Bank of Japan has chosen this tight monetary policy so it can avert a collapse if it wants to\" by trimming interest rates should the economy slow too much, he said. **********Moreover, because of its long-standing budgetary conservatism, Tokyo has the leeway to increase growth with higher Government spending, if that becomes necessary. Japan has already agreed with the United States to increase public investment and could accelerate this program. Revamping the Banking System **********Underlying the tight money is a broader policy goal that could affect Japan's financial system for years: the restructuring of the banking sector. The Finance Ministry wants to encourage smaller banks to merge with stronger institutions, forcing the long-protected institutions to be more competitive. **********It was reported Friday in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic daily, that the Finance Ministry had even created a special group within the deposit insurance system to handle mergers between small- and medium-sized banks. Ministry officials denied that such a mergers unit had been created, but the report was consistent with comments made publicly and privately by officials for months. **********Many worry that this approach may succeed in improving the profitability and innovativeness of a few Japanese banks, while weakening many others and perhaps causing a rash of bank failures because of tight money and a crash in the property market. Any failures or crashes -- which have never occurred in Japan -- could strain the Government's ability to engineer a controlled strengthening of the industry.  Unprepared for a Shock **********Susumu Saito, director of the Trilateral Institute, a research and advisory body, warned that few banks were really prepared for another shock to either the stock market, on which they are dependent for capital, or the property market, on which so many of their loans are based. \"Many of the banks are assuming that the worst is past,\" he said. **********But Mr. Akabane, the former Government economic planner, said: \"A severe economic situation would be an inviting time to restructure. The bureaucrats don't say this explicitly, but I think this is in their minds.\" **********The overall goal is to produce a financial sector that would match in strength the vibrant health of the industrial economy, which was strengthened considerably by Government policies of the last five years. Big corporations used the booming markets of the late 1980's to remove debt from their balance sheets and go on an unprecedented capital spending binge, sharply improving their efficiency. **********\"There is going to be a shakeout among the regional banks and tremendous pressure on the city banks,\" said Kenneth Courtis, chief economist here for Deutsche Bank. \"The Ministry of Finance clearly believes and says it will use this environment to restructure the sector. The trick is to accomplish this without causing a crash.\" **********What Japan calls a slowdown, of course, would be a solid year in the United States. The economy grew 5.4 percent in 1990, with unemployment slightly higher than 2 percent and inflation close to 3 percent. **********Officially, the Government is forecasting a 3.8 percent growth rate this year, as high interest rates begin to bite. The official discount rate for Government loans to banks has been jacked up to 6 percent, from 2.5 percent just 18 months ago. **********There have been a rash of real estate-induced bankruptices as a result, not to mention the collapse of stock prices last year. In December alone, the number of business failures rose 45 percent.  Few See Doom **********Some economists see growth of closer to 3 percent in 1991, but few accept the predictions of doom that have made headlines in recent weeks. **********\"The world has seriously mistaken what has happened in Japan,\" said Richard Koo, a senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute. \"The Bank of Japan is trying to slow the economy with every tool they have.

Yeltsin's campaign to wrest economic and political authority from the Kremlin. **********After months of conflicting claims by the central Government and the republics, with resulting confusion over ownership and control of natural resources and industries, the agreement on the mines represented the first sizable transfer of an important industry from the national Government to that of a republic. **********Before today's accord, Mr. Yeltsin, President of the Russian republic's Parliament and principal political rival of the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, had complained that Russia effectively controlled only 16 percent of its wealth.  Satisfying a Demand **********The transfer of control was a principal demand of strikers who have sharply reduced output at vital mines in Siberia. **********The Russian radio said the agreement covered more than half the coal mines in the Soviet Union, including primarily the Kuznetsk Basin in central Siberia, but also the Sakhalin Basin in the Far East and the Rostov mines near the Ukraine. The Soviet Union is the world's largest coal producer, and coal ranks as one of its primary sources of energy. **********Details of the transfer were not immediately known, except that regulation of the mines would pass from the Soviet Coal Industry Ministry to the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry. **********Mr. Yeltsin pledged to give the mines considerable economic autonomy, suggesting that instead of quotas and deliveries set by the central authorities, the mines would eventually negotiate direct agreements with customers. **********Coming immediately after a truce declared 10 days ago at a meeting between Mr. Gorbachev and the leaders of nine republics, including Mr. Yeltsin, the transfer seemed to foreshadow a new pattern of power sharing between Moscow and the 15 increasingly assertive republics that make up the union. **********Mr. Yeltsin told the Russian Parliament today that Deputy Prime Ministers Yuri Skokov of Russia and Vitaly Doguzhiyev of the Soviet Union had signed agreements on the transfer, which is to take effect Sunday. **********Mr. Yeltsin also announced today that he had reached agreement with Vladimir Kryuchkov, the chief of the K.G.B., to form a Russian version of the security and intelligence agency. Details of the division of responsibilities were not immediately known, but the agreement marked another step in the decentralization of power. **********The Russian Parliament also opened debate on the creation of an executive presidency, with elections scheduled June 12. Mr. Yeltsin is expected to win handily, though a lively race is shaping up with the declaration of candidacy by Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, the former Soviet Prime Minister.  Other Yeltsin Initiatives **********The Parliament session is also to consider a package of other measures that Mr. Yeltsin is seeking to enact, including creation of a constitutional court, perhaps the first step toward an independent judiciary in the Russian republic. **********The impending transfer of the coal mines was disclosed last week when Mr. Yeltsin traveled to the Kuznetsk Basin. The miners there, who have been striking since March 4, welcomed the idea but remained suspicious and decided to continue striking until the deal was concluded. **********They remained skeptical today. Aleksandr V. Smirnov, a member of the Novo-Kuznetsk City Strike Committee, said workers in the majority of mines pledged to continue striking \"until they see the first signs of implementation of the signed accords.\" It was expected, though, that the miners would quickly resume work once the signing is confirmed. **********There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, and Mr. Yeltsin avoided any gloating in his speech to the Russian Parliament, saying only that he was satisfied that the coal mines had remained in proper working condition through the two-month strike. His approach apparently reflected reluctance to antagonize Mr. Gorbachev or to further excite the touchy miners.  Gorbachev Resignation Demand **********Besides seeking higher pay and improved working conditions, the miners have political demands, including the resignation of Mr. Gorbachev and the delegation of more power to the republics, as well as the transfer of mines to Russian jurisdiction. **********The strike-plagued Kuznetsk Basin in Siberia is the second-largest producer of coal in the Soviet Union after the Donetsk Basin, which is situated mainly in the Ukraine; half the estimated 130 million tons produced in the Kuznetsk region is high-quality coking coal that feeds a huge metallurgical complex in Siberia. **********In assuming control of the Siberian coal industry, Mr. Yeltsin also assumed some enormous problems of that region, including antiquated mines and rundown cities. **********Today, Mr. Yeltsin told the Russian Parliament that if Mr. Gorbachev's intentions were \"truly serious, if this is not another attempt at political intrigue, this is the first important step on the way out of the crisis.\" **********After so many earlier false starts, many Soviet citizens have been reluctant to pin large hopes on the latest truce.  Indications of Seriousness **********But the Kremlin's agreement to transfer the mines to Russian control, and the low-key handling of the transfer by both sides, seemed to mark a serious effort to resolve the power struggle between Moscow and republic authorities. **********In a way, the Siberian miners thus became both the catalyst and the first beneficiary of the truce. **********Their strike was the first major workers' action to make political demands. The action began with a series of spontaneous walkouts, and ended with a majority of miners walking out and demanding Mr. Gorbachev's resignation. **********Mr. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Valentin S. Pavlov tried at first to ignore the strike, then to dramatize its effects, and finally to offer the miners a generous economic package, all to no effect. **********The strike thus became the symbol of distrust and displeasure with Mr. Gorbachev at a time he was seeking to introduce a crisis program."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/24/business/iraq-ruling-for-consarc.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 221, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iraq Ruling For Consarc", "print_headline": "Iraq Ruling For Consarc", "body_text": " **********A Federal judge upheld his $64.1 million award to a New Jersey concern that says Iraq breached a contract to buy industrial furnaces by maintaining they were meant for civilian rather than military use. **********Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin's order, issued Thursday, also allows the Consarc Corporation of Rancocas, N.J., to try to collect some of the money by asking that some Iraqi assets in this country be unfrozen. **********Judge Sporkin rejected the Bush Administration's argument that the award conflicts with United States economic sanctions imposed on Iraq.

But they can control air emission problems without consuming the chemicals used in scrubber systems or without the regeneration systems needed with activated carbon treatment. **********S. C. Johnson & Son Inc. uses a biofilter to treat emissions of pentane and butane that escape from its aerosol can filling operations in Racine, Wis. \"We lose from 30 to 100 tons from the aerosol filling line a year,\" said Timothy Lafond, the environmental manager at Johnson's Waxdale manufacturing plant. \"On average we get 90 percent-plus control efficiency\" from the biofilter, he said. The bacteria present in the soil break the relatively simple hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide and water, which are vented into the atmosphere. **********Since volatile organic compounds like pentane and butane contribute to low-altitude smog, emissions are being progressively restricted by Federal and state regulations. The Johnson filter has been in continuous operation since December 1988 with little maintenance other than watering in dry periods.  Key Ingredient Is Dirt **********Like most biofilters, the principal ingredient is dirt. Air from around the aerosol filling is collected and blown into a grid of perforated pipes laid in a bed of gravel. The gravel diffuses the air-solvent mix, which rises into the three-foot-deep dirt filter. **********In it, the hydrocarbon molecules are adsorbed on droplets of water and then broken down by microbes that obtain energy and elements necessary for their survival and growth in the process. The oxygen-rich atmosphere insures that the offensive compounds will be converted chemically to oxides before leaving the filter. **********The Johnson filter occupies an acre between two factory buildings. It is covered with grass and looks like an open field. The performance of the filter fluctuates with the seasons because it is based on living organisms. Mr. Lafond says that 99 percent of the hydrocarbons are destroyed in warm weather, but that the breakdown rate drops to 65 percent in severe cold as the bacteria become less active. **********Mr. Lafond said it was not necessary to develop special strains of bacteria to make a soil filter work. \"The bugs are already there,\" he added. But he said there was a \"learning curve\" when it was first used, as the bacteria adapted to feed on the hydrocarbons. \"We started at 30 to 40 percent efficiency and gradually took that up to over 90 percent,\" Mr. Lafond said, as the solvent-eating bacteria increased in number.  Looking for Green Grass **********Since moisture in an important part of the treatment process, the water content of the filter is monitored. \"If the grass is green, then we assume the water is O.K.,\" Mr. Lafond said. \"If it starts to turn brown, then we get concerned.\" Lawn sprinklers are used until the grass is green and lush again. **********Since the bacteria feed on the wastes they are treating, the filters can be operated for years with little attention. Maintenance is sometimes limited to cutting the grass. The one exception is in cases where the chemical products of the breakdown process tend to acidify. Many of the bacteria that best remove odor-causing compounds are sensitive to acidity of the soil. Once again, though, the solution is simple. **********For example, in Gainesville, Fla., a soil filter is used to remove hydrogen sulfide -- a toxic gas with a rotten-egg smell -- from a sewage treatment plant. Although the filter removes more than 99 percent of the offensive gas, according to Eric R. Allen, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Florida, the sulfur oxides produced by the breakup of hydrogen sulfide tend to combine with the moisture in the earth to form sulfuric acid. **********\"We have to add lime to offset the acidity,\" Professor Allen said.  'Very, Very Cheap' **********He said the low-tech nature of biofilters had made it difficult to convince engineers accustomed to chemical treatment systems of their value. But he said economics might increase their attractiveness. \"They are very, very cheap to operate,\" he said. **********A report produced by Geoffrey A. Kuter of International Process Systems, which uses biofilters to control odors from composting operations, indicated that the annual operating cost would be 44 percent less than a chemical scrubbing system and 75 percent less than activated carbon -- which is highly adsorbent because of its large surface area. **********One drawback is the amount of land required for a biofilter. Not every industrial site has an acre or more to set aside to treat emissions. \"If you have a lot of area, then you can use a biofilter,\" said Sam Cha, a chemist with TRC Environmental Engineering in East Hartford, Conn. \"But if you do not, they you would probably want a carbon system, because they are very compact.\" **********There are a variety of formulas for the composition of biofilters, depending on the compounds to be treated. Ordinary soil, compost and peat provide the microorganisms, and other materials, like volcanic ash, sand and bark, are used to make the pile porous.

Its new general manager has been at the company less than three months. And the waves of Italians and Greeks and other European immigrants who built pianos here for generations have been replaced with newer immigrants, many of whom do not stay as long. **********On the shop floor, young men, some with pony tails and tattoos, assemble black concert grand pianos while piano music wafts in from a radio in the corner. It is Bruce Springsteen's \"Blinded by the Light.\" **********If the workers are very much today, much of what they do would seem ripe for modernization. The company gives the impression of not having fully absorbed the concept of interchangeable parts, popularized by Eli Whitney in 1798. No  Standard Sizes **********For example, a computer-controlled woodworking tool is deliberately set to make parts slightly too big, so that a craftsman can later strip away unneeded wood. If the tool cut the wood to a standard size, said Sanford G. Woodard, the general manager, it would fit with others but not perfectly; the only way to do that is by hand. **********Rim-making, a procedure that is at the heart of Steinway technology, seems comically primitive. To make the U-shaped rim, six workers stack 18 wooden boards and carry them, like a long ladder, around the twisting confines of the factory. The boards are run through rollers like a washing-machine's mangle, to coat the sides with glue. A worker with a pot and a paintbrush applies more on spots the roller missed. **********Then the men wrestle the boards around a mold in the shape of a piano. They attach the straight side first. Then the men line up on the free end and push hard, forcing the boards around the curve. Later, they attach a block and tackle, to force the boards around the frame. The only deviation from muscle power is a power-driven torque wrench, used to tighten the bolts that hold the wood to the right tension. **********Production of rims could be automated, but the company builds them only three mornings a week, turning out only about 2,500 last year, a number that hardly justifies a major investment. Yamaha, known for its degree of automation, produces 200,000 pianos in some years. **********Other manufacturers' rims tend to de-laminate over time, the company says, which means the end of the piano. But Steinway rims, demonstrably, endure for more than a century. This is part of what allows them to be rebuilt so successfully. **********Once the frames are bent on the mold, they are left to age, said David A. Grossi, the national service manager, leading a tour recently. \"Sometimes the frame relaxes a quarter inch or an eighth of an inch, and assumes the shape it's going to have for its lifetime,\" Mr. Grossi said. \"We let it do that; it's part of a Steinway.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/11/business/the-media-business-new-restrictions-in-maxwell-case.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Prokesch", "pub_date": "1991-12-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1030, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Restrictions in Maxwell Case", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; New Restrictions in Maxwell Case", "body_text": " **********An American suspected of having played a central role in helping Robert Maxwell siphon off hundreds of millions of dollars from employee pension funds has been barred from leaving Britain, it was disclosed today. **********Larry Trachtenberg, who became a director of Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd. in September and resigned last week, was ordered by a judge not to leave the country. Mr. Trachtenberg was also an executive at London and Bishopsgate International Investment Management P.L.C., which is under investigation for its role in transferring pension funds. **********The disclosure came at a news conference held by Neil Cooper, a corporate-recovery expert whom an English judge appointed on Sunday night to take control of an investment-management firm owned by the Maxwell family, and by Margaret Cole, a lawyer assisting him. They have already begun to try to trace and secure the missing pension fund assets. **********The Bishopsgate firm is believed to be at the heart of the system masterminded by Mr. Maxwell to move $:763 million ($1.38 billion) from pension funds and two public companies controlled by the Maxwell family. **********\"He was obviously central,\" Mr. Cooper said of Mr. Trachtenberg. **********Investigators say they believe that Mr. Maxwell used the money in a desperate and ill-fated attempt to prop up his private companies. Last week, a month after his death, his two main private companies filed for the British equivalent of bankruptcy protection. Now, most of the Maxwell empire is expected to be sold off. **********The six Maxwell pension funds that had assets controlled by Bishopsgate should have assets worth about $:727 million ($1.31 billion), Mr. Cooper said. Mr. Maxwell is now believed to have taken about $:426 million ($769.6 million) from the funds. **********Mr. Cooper said about $:327 million was missing from the funds. **********Miss Cole said that success in tracing the assets was no guarantee that they would be retrieved because the financial institutions that now have them may be able to assert legal rights to them. **********Conflicts over ownership could arise, she said, because a Maxwell firm, possibly Bishopsgate, might have had title to the pension fund shares and sold them to others when Mr. Maxwell was said to have ordered the firm to raise cash. Now title to those shares may be legitimately held by other institutions. Giving Up a Passport **********The judge's order to Mr. Trachtenberg required him to surrender his passport until he had provided any information he might have on Bi shopsgate. **********The judge took the same action earlier this week against Mr. Maxwell's two sons, Kevin and Ian, and also froze up to $:450 million ($812.9 million) of Kevin Maxwell's personal assets. Kevin Maxwell is considered to have been more involved in efforts to transfer pension fund assets than his older brother. But early today, the judge decided to allow Kevin Maxwell to go to New York to work on the reorganization of The Daily News, which filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States last week. **********Kevin Maxwell had argued that his presence was urgently needed in New York to save The Daily News; the judge told him to return by Friday evening. Selling a House **********When he gets back, his four-story house in London's Chelsea section could be for sale. Mr. Maxwell and his wife, Pandora, have said they are putting it up for sale; estimates are that it could bring $1.6 million to $3.1 million. **********\"We have a mortgage like everyone else,\" Mrs. Maxwell said. \"Ob viously I am worried about the future. My husband doesn't have a job, so we are going to have to sell the house.\" **********The Maxwell family also decided that a New York memorial service for Mr. Maxwell that had been scheduled for Wednesday would be postponed. More than 600 people had been invited to the service scheduled for noon at the Park East Synagogue in Manhattan, according to John G. Campi, vice president of promotions and public relations at The Daily News. Notices of the postponement were sent out this week. **********One of the two big public companies controlled by the Maxwell family, Mirror Group Newspapers P.L.C., has already needed to raise money after Robert Maxwell took at least $:97 million ($175.2 million) from the company. A group of banks announced today that it had agreed in principle to give Mirror a short-term loan. **********As for Mr. Trachtenberg, the court ordered him to provide information on the investment firms. He has already been reported to have said that he was involved in transferring assets. But it is not clear that what he did was illegal: he may not have known that the assets were not going to be returned. **********A special team from Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte, the accounting firm, examined the Maxwell empire at the request of banks after Mr. Maxwell died, and Mr. Trachtenberg told them that he transferred shares from one of the Maxwell investment firms to Robert Maxwell's personal safe.  Role Is Questioned **********One person at a large pension fund in the Maxwell empire said Mr. Trachtenberg had dictated investment instructions to the pension funds before he had any role at the Bishopsgate firm. This official noted that as an executive of London and Bishopsgate, a separate firm that merely invested pension-fund money that Bishopsgate assigned to it, Mr. Trachtenberg should not have had that power. **********For this reason, pension fund officials had made Mr. Trachtenberg a Bishopsgate director in September.  \"Trachtenberg started to attempt to issue instructions in the name of Bi shopsgate, claiming to be so instructed by Robert Maxwell,\" the official said. \"It was agreed in those circumstances that he should be appointed a director so he had the responsibility and the liability.\" **********Although it is unclear whether Mr.  Trachtenberg did anything illegal, the transfer of the pension assets is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and by regulators. **********Mr. Trachtenberg, who had once been a lecturer at the London School of Economics, was co-managing director at London and Bishopsgate . **********Attempts to reach Mr. Trachtenberg were unsuccessful."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/18/business/california-battle-over-state-fund.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1991-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 781, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "California Battle Over State Fund", "print_headline": "California Battle Over State Fund", "body_text": " **********A furious political battle broke out in California today over the future of the state's huge public-employee pension fund, with the fund's leaders charging that Gov. Pete Wilson was trying to pack its board and squash its highly visible shareholder-rights campaign. **********The fight broke out after Governor Wilson, a Republican, proposed legislation over the weekend that would enable him to tap the fund for $1.6 billion to help close the state's $14.3 billion budget deficit. **********The legislation would also permit Mr. Wilson to abolish the current 13-member board of the California Public Employees Retirement System, or Calpers, as it is known, and replace it with a new nine-member board, five of whose members would be appointed by the Governor. The other four would be appointed by the Legislature. The Governor effectively appoints four members to the present board, or less than a third.  Wilson's Motives Questioned **********Calpers executives and representatives of workers and retirees charged today in response that the proposals were unconstitutional. They said the proposals were motivated largely by what they said was Governor Wilson's desire to win favor in the business community by silencing the pension fund's efforts to force large corporations to be more responsive to shareholders. **********\"You could clearly characterize this as an attempt at a hostile takeover,\" said Dale M. Hanson, chief executive of Calpers. **********An aide to Mr. Wilson called the fund's view of the situation \"garbage.\" Other state officials said the intent of the proposals was not nearly so nefarious as Mr. Hanson and his supporters had made it out to be. They said Governor Wilson was just seeking maximum flexibility to deal with the worst budget crisis in the state's history.  Vote Could Come This Week **********David J. Tirapelle, the state's director of personnel administration, said the Governor had developed the board proposal along with legislative leaders \"essentially to provide greater accountability to the taxpayer.\" The proposals are contained in two bills that could be voted on by the State Senate and Assembly this week. **********The state pays about $1 billion annually into the public pension fund, which has assets of $65 billion and is the largest in the country. **********Mr. Hanson has been at the forefront of a shareholder movement among large public pension plans, challenging corporations to explain poor performance, to hold down executive compensation and to appoint more board members with no ties to management. **********This year alone, Calpers has taken on the ITT Corporation, Sears, Roebuck & Company and the General Motors Corporation over various issues, generally winning at least compromise agreements that call for the companies to consult more closely with their shareholders. Mr. Hanson's efforts have consistently been backed by the fund's board, although some members have expressed reservations about pushing the issue too hard.  'Promise to Business' **********Mr. Hanson said in a telephone interview today that he believed at first that Mr. Wilson wanted to change the board out of concern that the current board would resist any efforts to tap its funds to close the budget deficit. **********\"We learned this weekend as we met with legislators,\" Mr. Hanson said, \"that that is not the purpose, that the Governor has made a promise to business that he will put a more compliant board in there so we will not be so active in corporate governance.\" **********The proposals also drew sharp criticism from Kathleen Brown, the State Treasurer, whose seat on the board would be eliminated. Ms. Brown, a Democrat, called the proposals \"a very inappropriate kind of power play\" by Mr. Wilson. **********\"Calpers has been in the leadership nationally, whether in trying to rein in executive compensation or in bringing more independent directors onto boards,\" Ms. Brown said. \"To introduce this takeover into the context of our state budget deliberations does a disservice to the budget process.\" **********It was unclear how much support Governor Wilson's proposals might have in the Legislature. Mr. Hanson said an initial tally showed that 27 of the 40 state senators supported the proposals, but he said that opposition from workers and retirees, among others, might change the situation. **********Ms. Brown said talks were under way in the Legislature that could bring some compromise at least on the issue of whether the state could tap pension fund money to close the deficit. She added that the situation was so fluid that it was difficult to say what the outcome might be. **********Mr. Hanson said pension officials had tried to make offers to state officials to help the state resolve the budget problem in a way that would not create problems of fiduciary responsibility for Calpers. But, he said, state officials, including Thomas Hayes, the director of the State Finance Department, had not responded to the offers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/02/business/bank-regulators-seeking-to-relax-accounting-rules.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1991-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1104, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANK REGULATORS SEEKING TO RELAX ACCOUNTING RULES", "print_headline": "BANK REGULATORS SEEKING TO RELAX ACCOUNTING RULES", "body_text": " **********With banks in many regions of the country shying away from making new loans, Federal banking and savings regulators moved to ease that logjam today by recommending a relaxation of the standards used by banks to put a value on their loans. **********Specifically, the regulators called for changes in the way banks evaluate commercial and real estate loans that are in trouble. The new accounting standards would enable banks to report greater profits on such loans, providing them with an incentive to extend credit to more borrowers. **********Many banks and savings and loans are in trouble, mainly because of loans that went sour in a troubled economy. As these troubles mounted, banks and customers started complaining that bank examiners, with the savings and loan fiasco fresh in their minds, were becoming too aggressive in scrutinizing loans. This in turn was said to compound the tightening of credit, particularly in New England, where the economy has quickly eroded. The Goal: Easier Credit **********Officials said the long-awaited measures were intended to counter these complaints and to make it easier for people and businesses to get loans. **********\"There is an atmosphere of fear in financial institutions out there that they are going to get whacked in the back of the head if they make any loan,\" said John E. Robson, Deputy Treasury Secretary and the senior Administration official coordinating the regulatory changes. \"That is clearly not the atmosphere you want to have.\" **********But critics said today's measures would eventually come back to haunt the industry and the Government because the changes dilute standards at a time when increasing numbers of large banks are failing or reporting lower earnings. They likened the proposal to the decisions in the 1980's to relax standards for savings institutions and to refrain from closing weak institutions. **********\"It's not as egregious a forbearance standard as the savings and loans, but it mirrors the excesses,\" said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa and a member of the House Banking Committee. \"It conveys the notion that toying with the books is legitimate, and therefore obviates the need for commercial banks either to raise more capital or shrink.\" **********Mr. Leach said the new standards would increase the likelihood of a taxpayer bailout of the Federal program that insures deposits at banks and would also have the effect of deferring \"the necessary consolidation of the industry.\" **********The guidelines clarify the way banks put a value on real estate loans and on their financing of transactions made with a large amount of debt. They also call for greater disclosure about loans on which the borrower has stopped paying interest. The changes have been urged by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. **********The guidelines were issued jointly today by the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. **********None of the proposals require legislative action, but the most significant one, involving the treatment of non-performing loans, is subject to final approval by the bank regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees accounting standards. That is expected to occur after the 45-day period set aside for comments from accountants and industry representatives.  Allowing Some Leeway **********The proposal would allow so-called loan-splitting, in which a troubled loan still paying some interest would be divided into good and bad parts instead of being entirely written off. Existing guidelines require banks to label the entire amount of such loans as \"nonperforming,\" which is the category for loans that are 90 days past due or are so troubled that the bank does not expect full repayment. **********As an example of a loan that should not be written off entirely, regulators today cited a homeowner who is delinquent on mortgage payments, but who promises to start making payments after 90 days and then does so. Currently, the bank would have to write off the entire loan but under the changes the bank would be able to recognize the interest payments. **********These are some of the other changes and guidelines: ***********Banks and savings associations would not have to put a value on real estate in a troubled market, reflecting the depressed price the property would bring if it was sold immediately. Rather, the value put on a house, apartment building or commercial property should reflect its market value over a longer period, which would give the bank the chance to benefit from an upturn in the market. ***********The definition of \"highly leveraged transactions,\" which include company buyouts or other broad changes that rely on a large amount of debt, would be loosened so that it would no longer include certain kinds of debt. Bankers and regulators keep track of such transactions to help judge an institution's soundness. ***********Weak banks would be encouraged to make loans to \"sound borrowers\" even though such loans would further dilute the bank's capital level, a formula that is generally viewed as an indicator of a bank's health. ***********Financial institutions would be encouraged to provide greater disclosure of the details of their entire loan portfolio. **********\"We hope that the actions taken today will encourage lenders to make prudent loans and assure that examiners perform their review in a balanced, sensible way,\" Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said, describing the measures as a \"sensible approach to the credit crunch.\" **********The pressure on regulators to act swiftly has been apparent for weeks. Senators and representatives from New England have threatened to oppose the Bush Adminstration's proposal to provide more financing for the savings and loan bailout until the Administration addressed the tightening of credit.  Quick Action Urged **********In a House Banking subcommittee hearing on Thursday, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d pursued an aggressive line of questioning and urged senior regulators to move quickly, even if it meant circumventing the normal process for changing the rules. Mr. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, suggested that the banks be permitted to ease accounting standards immediately, before the Securities and Exchange Commission formally acted, and then return to the old standards if the agency later objected. **********But that idea was quickly rejected by Richard C. Breeden, the chairman of the S.E.C., who said he could not \"throw the rules out the window,\" adding that 'the worst mistake made in the thrift disaster was the move to weaken accounting rules.\" **********On Wednesday, Mr. Breeden said that \"there is nothing inherently wrong\" with the idea of loan-splitting, but that he wanted the commission to be able to study the concept fully before aprroving it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/18/business/16-are-charged-in-computer-parts-scheme.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 355, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "16 Are Charged in Computer Parts Scheme", "print_headline": "16 Are Charged in Computer Parts Scheme", "body_text": " **********Federal authorities said that they had broken up a $6 million racketeering scheme that took discarded computer parts and illegally sold them. **********The Federal Bureau of Investigation announced indictments on Tuesday against 16 people in the scheme.

The ministry Dresser was working with was almost abolished. It found it had to negotiate with both Moscow and the republics, which are locked in a tense tug-of-war. And Dresser's state-owned joint-venture partner said it did not have the money to help build the factories.  'Situation Getting Prohibitive' **********\"Things have changed,\" said Raymond Cossette, coordinator of Soviet activities for Dresser, which says it has not given up. \"The situation in this country looks as if it's getting prohibitive.\" **********Other American companies have similar woes, and many corporate executives are considerably less enthusiastic than they were when plans for Soviet investment were formulated. After two years of negotiations, RJR Nabisco Inc. is still waiting to sign papers to produce cigarettes in Leningrad and crackers outside Moscow. The Colgate-Palmolive Company is mired in negotiations with the Ministry of Health to open a toothpaste plant this year in Kiev. **********\"The Soviet Union is a large market with a massive population of 280 million people, and obviously that represents a lot of teeth for us,\" said Edgar J. Field, group vice president for international business development at Colgate-Palmolive. Still Seeing Opportunities **********Many American companies are loath to drop their plans. They still see colossal opportunities, and America's corporate giants want to make sure they are not the last to arrive as one of the world's largest countries and consumer markets opens its economy to the outside world. **********Among the other American companies that continue to negotiate in the Soviet Union are Texaco, Chevron and Eastman Kodak. They hope to join companies that have already invested here, Pepsico, McDonald's, Johnson Wax and Combustion Engineering among them. **********Some American executives even privately support a drift to dictatorship, saying someone needs to take firm control of the chaotic situation. Still, they worry that the increasing power of old-guard Communists will slow, and perhaps threaten, the transition to a market economy. **********\"The fact that there may be some reactionary influences at work I don't think scares investors all that much,\" said Karl von der Heyden, chief financial officer for RJR Nabisco. \"The basic thrust is toward a more open society.\" Abundance of Horror Stories **********Every American in Moscow has a horror story or two about the difficulty and unpleasantness of living and working in the Soviet Union. Even though the McDonald's restaurant in Moscow had a contract to buy chopped meat for one ruble a pound, it is being forced to pay seven times that. Some American executives who come to explore prospects go away complaining about unappetizing meals that cost $75 and shabby $200-a-night rooms in hotels where 25-watt bulbs and prostitutes are part of the decor. **********Making investment less inviting are the K.G.B. officials who rail against Western executives for gathering what the K.G.B. contends is sensitive information about the Soviet Union. American companies are also often unsure whether they should negotiate with the national Government or individual republics. **********\"There's a lot of uncertainty about what can and cannot be done,\" Michael Adams, chief executive of the Young & Rubicam advertising agency office, said in an interview in his Moscow office. \"You have the Russian Federation saying, 'Come on down; let's make a deal,' and then you have the all-union government making fundamentally different policy. You don't know whether to scratch or wind your watch.\" **********For months, Mr. Adams has been searching for a respectable house or apartment. A Communist Party official who got wind of his quest invited him to look at a modest house at a riverside retreat for party functionaries. Mr. Adams inquired about the rent and was stunned: $12,500 a month. **********American investment in the Soviet Union is as varied as American industry. Chevron plans to drill for oil; McDonald's has opened the world's busiest restaurant, on Gorky Square; Price Waterhouse has a small accounting office; Tambrands makes sanitary napkins in the Ukraine; Combustion Engineering's joint venture makes process controls for oil refineries. **********Mark S. Vecchio, a Moscow-based lawyer with the firm of Coudert Brothers, said many American companies were attracted by the nation's immense natural resources and large proportion of highly skilled low-wage workers. But some companies invest without doing their homework, he said. 'Lots of Wishful Thinking' **********\"There is lots of wishful thinking about what is possible,\" he said. \"Some companies think, 'If there is such an immense consumer market, then all I have to do is come in and the Soviets will buy my product.' But they forget that the Soviet ruble is not convertible, which makes it hard for them to take out their profits.\" **********More than 2,000 joint ventures have been registered so far in the Soviet Union, but because of the bureaucratic thicket they must hack through, only about 500 are up and running. Of these, about 100 are losing money. **********Several of America's best-known companies have set up the American Trade Consortium, in which one member, Chevron, will in theory provide the hard currency for the others through its revenues from exploring and developing Soviet oilfields. All told, consortium members hope to invest more than $10 billion over the next dozen years. **********\"We wouldn't be here if we didn't think we could make a profit,\" said Mr. Giffen, president of the consortium and chairman of the Mercator Corporation, which is serving as its merchant bank. \"The trick is to have a profit level commensurate with the downside risk.\" Soviet Entrepreneur's View **********Andrei Stroyev, widely considered the Soviet Union's foremost entrepreneur, criticizes Americans for being far more hesitant than Europeans to invest here. **********\"American business thinks that the best solution is just to be careful and that waiting is better,\" Mr. Stroyev, a real estate developer, said. \"But I can't close my door because there are so many Germans, Swiss, Swedes, Austrians, Italians knocking.\" **********He is co-chairman of one of the few successful Soviet-American joint ventures. It is named Perestroika, and it specializes in real estate development. Its American partner is the Worsham Group, an Atlanta-based developer. **********The two-year-old venture renovates buildings and then rents offices to blue-chip companies, including Hoechst, Mitsubishi and Fiat. They pay their rents in hard currency, making the Worsham Group one of the few companies that can easily repatriate its profits. Service-Oriented Concerns Gain **********Many service-oriented companies have also been successful. Ernst & Young, Price Waterhouse and other large accounting firms rushed to open offices here, which help Western companies prospect for partners and analyze Soviet businesses and balance sheets. **********Advertising agencies do market research and public relations for Western companies. The law firms here, including Coudert Brothers and Baker & McKenzie, help draw up contracts and negotiate with Kafkaesque ministries. Manufacturers have a far tougher time. **********An aluminum company wanted to start a joint venture in Armenia, for example, but backed off when it learned that neighboring Azerbaijan had cut the rail lines.  McDonald's Talks Took 14 Years **********McDonald's had to weather 14 years of negotiations before opening one restaurant in Moscow. **********Although the rubles-only restaurant has generated little hard currency earnings, George Cohon, chairman of McDonald's Canada and vice chairman of McDonald's in Moscow, said the outlet was a huge success, with 50,000 customers a day and 1,200 workers. The company plans to open several more restaurants soon, including one that would sell hamburgers for hard currency. **********Looking out at the 90-minute-long line of shivering people, he said: \"Sure, it's a risk to be here now. But it might be a bigger risk to wait. I don't care what system there is in this country: people are going to continue flooding into this place.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/15/business/loss-could-force-businessland-into-bankruptcy.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1991-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 516, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Loss Could Force Businessland Into Bankruptcy", "print_headline": "Loss Could Force Businessland Into Bankruptcy", "body_text": " **********Businessland Inc., once considered the nation's premier retailer of personal computers, said today that it had been cut off by one of its key lenders and might have to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. **********The announcement came as the San Jose, Calif., retailer reported a net loss of $43 million for the third quarter, ended on March 31. The loss, its sixth consecutive quarterly deficit, put the company in violation of agreements with various creditors. **********Businessland said the ITT Financial Corporation had ceased to provide any more financing for Businessland's purchase of personal computers from Apple Computer Inc. and the Compaq Computer Corporation. Unless it can reach an accommodation with ITT Financial or figure out a new way to finance its inventory, Businessland \"will be unable to continue to conduct its current level of operations,\" the company said in a statement. **********The company said it is exploring alternatives, including a sale of the company or a restructuring, as well as a bankruptcy filing. It said it was in discussions with a possible buyer, but declined to identify it.  A Long Slide **********The announcement culminates a long slide for Businessland, which became the largest company-owned chain of computer stores but was unable to adjust to the intense price competition that has characterized computer retailing in recent years. **********\"Businessland is no longer viable as a continuing separate entity,\" said Seymour Merrin, a personal computer retailing consultant in Palo Alto, Calif., who has long been critical of the company. **********It is also likely to be the final blow to the credibility of the company's founder and chief executive, David A. Norman. As recently as last Friday, Businessland officials had vehemently denied that a Chapter 11 filing was being contemplated. They also denied that ITT Financial, a unit of the ITT Corporation of New York, had cut off the company's inventory financing. **********Industry executives say Businessland is hoping its computer suppliers will extend it credit, rather than see a major distributor of their machines go under. **********Businessland said it was in violation of its agreement with the I.B.M. Credit Corporation, which finances its inventory of personal computers from the International Business Machines Corporation, but that I.B.M. was continuing to make financing available. Businessland has long been considered a supporter of the I.B.M. personal computer. **********Industry executives say one company looking at buying Businessland is JWP Inc. of Purchase, N.Y. JWP had $2.8 billion in revenues in 1990. **********Other companies might also look. Mr. Merrin, the consultant, said Businessland would probably go into Chapter 11 before being bought, so the buyer would have some protection from the chain's existing creditors. **********Businessland's third-quarter loss was higher than expected on operations and included a restructuring charge of $17.7 million for closure of stores and work force reductions, and a $6 million reserve for settlement of a shareholders' lawsuit against the company. **********Revenues for the third quarter were $269.7 million, down 17 percent from $323.4 million a year earlier.

The computer maker, based in Dayton, Ohio, said on Sunday that it was willing to share confidential business information with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company to try to persuade the telecommunications giant to raise its $100-a-share bid, worth a total of $6.77 billion. **********A.T.& T.'s share price rose 12.5 cents yesterday on the Big Board, to $33. A.T.&T. Cancels Strategy Meeting **********A two-day meeting of 50 top A.T.& T. managers to discuss the company's long-term strategy, scheduled to begin yesterday, was canceled as the executives considered NCR's first encouraging response to nearly four months of overtures. The negotiations yesterday involved both A.T.& T.'s chairman, Robert E. Allen, and NCR's chairman, Charles E. Exley Jr. **********Jack B. Grubman, a telephone industry analyst at Paine Webber, said that NCR's willingness to start negotiating with A.T.& T. made a deal likely. \"It's sort of like a freight train,\" he said. \"It's hard to get going, but once it is, it's hard to stop.\" **********A.T.& T.'s big advantage lay in the possibility that it might win more than 80 percent of the vote at a special meeting of NCR shareholders on Thursday, which would enable it to replace NCR's board. A simple majority of the shares would enable A.T.& T. to replace a third of NCR's board.  Bid May Be Reduced **********A.T.& T. has said its $100-a-share bid will be reduced to the original level of $90 a share, or $6.09 billion, if it wins the vote on Thursday. **********NCR's main strength is its ability to make the deal quick and friendly if A.T.& T. is willing to raise its bid slightly. **********A merger would considerably expand A.T.& T.'s equipment businesses, which rival the company's long-distance services in annual sales though not in public recognition or profitability. A.T.& T. computer operations, which the company was allowed to start following the 1982 settlement of an antitrust case, accounted for less than 10 percent of the company's $37.29 billion in sales last year.

Liquidation of Capitalists **********Unlike its neighbors, Hungary, Poland, and even the former East Germany, Czechoslovakia under Communist rule allowed almost no private shops or businesses. **********During the worst Stalinist period of \"liquidation of the capitalist class\" during the 1950's, butchers, bakers and other small shopkeepers were sometimes sentenced to forced labor in uranium mines. Often, their sole offense was belonging to the \"enemy class.\" **********For decades stores were nothing more than the state-run retail distribution points of a stodgy command economy. Today most are old-fashioned, and badly in need of renovation. **********Moreover, although Czechoslovakia had one of the highest living standards in the Eastern bloc, the choice of retail goods is even now much more limited and less modern than in the West.  The Need? 'Prosperous Shops' **********At a first round of bidding for each store, only Czechoslovaks are allowed to take part, including anyone who was a citizen as far back as 1948. To reduce the chance of foreign investors using Czechoslovaks as fronts for buying prime shop space, new owners cannot sell to foreigners for two years. **********Any stores not sold are sent to a second auction, in which foreigners can bid. Officials say they are unworried by the prospects of an economic takeover by their far richer neighbors, the Germans and Austrians. **********\"Let them -- why not?\" said Mr. Jezek. \"What we need is prosperous shops. The customer doesn't care who the owner is.\" **********But Czechoslovaks appear to resent more the fact that under the Communist system, those who were able to accumulate the most money were black-market money changers, swindlers and higher-ranking Communist Party members who could exploit various connections.  Tense Bidding Wars **********But officials said that was an injustice the country had to live with. **********\"It's sure, there is dirty money here\" said Mr. Jezek. \"But the best method for cleaning the money is to let them invest it.\" **********After today's auctioning, officials said they were pleased with the enthusiastic degree of participation. Some of the seven fruit and vegitable stores and food markets were sold at more than 50 times the starting price. **********Several hundred spectators, who paid almost $2 for tickets to attend the proceedings at city hall, applauded the bidders as they pushed the prices up in tense bidding wars. **********Restitution Claims **********Officials say the biggest problem in auctioning off hundreds of thousands of stores is claims for restitution of the property from former owners. A first restitution law passed in the fall covers former owners whose small properties were confiscated by the Communists since 1955, in the \"final phase of the liquidation of the capitalist class.\" **********Those people have until the end of April to claim their property. A new law is expected soon, returning the larger properties taken in the first years after the Communists took power in 1948. **********Shops cannot be auctioned off \"when there is any doubt as to the ownership\" said Mr. Jezek. **********The new shop owners have no obligation to retain current shop employees. If they lose their jobs, the state organization that currently employs them must continue paying their wages for five months. Czechoslovakia has also instituted unemployment payments to give some protection to the growing number of jobless, as inefficient businesses begin closing.  'I'd Be Sorry to Lose My Job' **********\"I'm afraid,\" said Jaroslava Juzova, a saleswoman in a small mercery shop in the center of Prague. \"I'd be sorry to lose my job,\" Like all other stores, it too will be sold off soon. **********\"I think we'd be able to serve the customers better in a private shop\" she said. \"There'd be more variety of goods to offer.\" **********Larger businesses and factories will be sold after Parliament passes a special law on \"large privatization,\" expected shortly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/05/business/vehicle-sales-fell-5.1-in-1990.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1991-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1051, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Vehicle Sales Fell 5.1% in 1990", "print_headline": "Vehicle Sales Fell 5.1% in 1990", "body_text": " **********United States vehicle sales closed the year on a downbeat amid widespread expectations that the automotive industry's slump will probably continue well into 1991. Total sales in 1990 were the lowest since 1983. **********Retail sales of American-made cars and trucks fell 1.4 percent in the Dec. 21-30 period, capping a year in which sales were off 5.1 percent from 1989. The overall drop in the final 10 days was caused by a 15.5 percent decline in light-truck sales; car sales for the period were up 8.1 percent, for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.3 million, compared with 7.5 million last year.  Monthly Sales Also Down **********Car and truck sales were off 2.1 percent for all of December, to 962,767, from 983,330 last year. Car sales were up 1.8 percent, to 657,164, but light-truck sales dropped 9.5 percent, to 305,603. The monthly figures include all retail sales, of both American-made and imported vehicles. **********Sales of light trucks have been particularly weak in recent months. Light trucks are less fuel-efficient than cars, and many commercial buyers have scaled back truck purchases because of the weak economy. **********For the year, sales of imported and domestic vehicles reached 13,790,280 -- 9,338,911 cars and 4,451,369 trucks -- compared with a 1989 total of 14,489,530 -- 9,831,122 cars and 4,658,408 trucks. **********Beyond the decline of the last year, the question on the minds of many auto executives and analysts was how much longer the slump would continue. With consumer confidence low, personal debt high and fear of war pervasive, many think only a resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis will bring a rebound for the industry.  January 'Debacle' Expected **********\"January will be a debacle,\" predicted Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. \"I think within a couple of months of the situation in the Middle East's being resolved, we will begin to report year-over-year increases.\" **********Robert L. Rewey, vice president for sales for the Ford Motor Company's North American operations, said: \"Industry sales in 1990 were disappointing, with a weak economy and concerns about international uncertainties pulling auto sales down, especially in the final months of the year. Based on present economic forecasts, we expect industry sales weakness to continue in early 1991, with improvement as the year progresses.\" **********Ford's car and truck sales in 1990 were 3.63 million, a drop of 7.8 percent from 1989. **********But analysts said there was substantial pent-up demand for vehicles based on the age of the existing fleet. David Healy, automotive analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Inc., noted that sales had begun to pick up in the summer after a nine-month slump. **********The General Motors Corporation, the industry leader, posted a gain of eight-tenths of a percent in vehicle sales in late December. G.M.'s United States sales dropped 3.3 percent in 1990, to 4.97 million cars and trucks. But G.M. was able to increase its market share slightly from 1989, the only Big Three auto maker to do so. **********George C. Eads, the company's vice president of product planning and economics, said G.M. \"is well equipped to meet increasingly aggressive challengers in the U.S. automotive marketplace.\" **********The Chrysler Corporation's car and truck sales fell 4.1 percent in late December, compared with a year earlier. Car sales were up 17.1 percent, but truck sales were down 18.2 percent, reflecting the recent trends.   Honda Nudges Chrysler **********For the year, Chrysler's vehicle sales dropped 15.5 percent, to 1.69 million from 2 million in 1989. Chrysler barely nosed out the Honda Motor Company as the nation's No. 3 car maker, with 860,834 sales to Honda's 854,879. Chrysler's top-selling vehicle was its mini-van, sold under the Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth nameplates. **********The proportion of cars sold that were built in the United States increased in 1990, but more of those vehicles were built by foreign companies at \"transplant\" factories in the United States. Domestic cars accounted for 73.6 percent of cars sold, compared with 71.9 percent in 1989. But cars built at transplant factories accounted for 11.4 percent of sales, compared with 7.9 percent in 1989. **********The Big Three's share of the total American vehicle market declined to 69.9 percent in 1990, from 71.1 percent in 1989. The share of Japanese auto makers, including those with American operations, increased to 23.5 percent from 21.6 percent. Other imports declined to 6.6 percent of the market from 7.3 percent last year. **********While most car companies posted sales declines for the year, the top two Japanese auto makers -- the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Honda Motor Company -- were able to increase American sales as they relied more on vehicles built in the United States, which cost them less to build than those imported from Japan, primarily because of the yen's strength relative to the dollar. But the Nissan Motor Company posted a substantial decline for the year. **********\"Despite the apparent downward turn of the economy last year, sales of Toyota vehicles have never been better,\" said Pat Moran, president of Toyota's distribution company for the Southeastern United States. Mr. Moran said he expected \"sustained growth\" in 1991. **********Particularly hard hit in 1990 were several European auto makers, including Volvo, Saab and BMW. Sales of Audis dropped to 21,106 for the year from 21,283 in 1989, and \"quite frankly we don't see 1991 being any better,\" said Richard L. Mugg, the American executive in charge of Audi. Mr. Mugg said Audi's December results reflected some sales that were \"unquestionably pulled ahead from January to beat the impending luxury tax\" on vehicles costing more than $30,000.

ZEIEN, who took over as the chairman of the Gillette Company two months ago after Colman Mockler Jr. died of a heart attack at age 61, says his style may be different than Mr. Mockler's but his agenda is the same -- notably, to start turning a profit on Gillette's hot-selling Sensor shaving system. **********So far the market is giving him a vote of confidence. Gillette's stock rose $2.50 yesterday, to $74.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts and colleagues credit Mr. Mockler, who had planned to retire at the end of 1991 and had put a succession plan in place just months before his death, with setting Gillette on a solid course. **********But they note that Mr. Zeien, 60, who had been vice chairman of Gillette the last 10 years, had been running Gillette's main day-to-day activities. **********Mr. Zeien has made it clear that he plans to keep Gillette \"steady as she goes,\" which makes perfect sense to the financial community. Gillette is riding high in the consumer products industry with record revenues and profit increases in 1990 and continued strong growth expected, but Mr. Zeien does want to shore up the toiletries and cosmetics division, whose sales sagged in 1990. **********\"I expect a steady 18 percent growth in earnings over the next three years,\" said Jay Freedman, a senior vice president at Kidder, Peabody. \"The stock should be very strong this year.\" **********Andrew Shore, an analyst with Prudential Securities, predicted Gillette stock would be \"an upper $80-per-share stock in nine months.\" Gillette recently approved a 2-for-1 stock split, its third since 1986, and a 15 percent dividend increase to take effect on May 1. A company spokesman said that Gillette management wanted the stock to trade at $30 to $50 a share because it was more attractive to the small investor. **********\"Al Zeien won't change the strategy because it's working so well,\" Mr. Shore said. Indeed, Gillette's sales rose 14 percent in 1990, to $4.3 billion, and profits gained 29 percent, to $368 million, compared with $285 million in 1989. Although Gillette's new Sensor shaving system took the market by storm -- generating $200 million in sales and grabbing 9.2 percent of the domestic blades and razors market in its first year -- the company did not earn a penny from Sensor in 1990, Mr. Zeien said. **********The reason is that Gillette underestimated demand for Sensor, he said, and is still putting resources into increasing manufacturing capacity for the product, which could delay profitability. In addition, Gillette's Braun division underestimated the popularity in Europe and Japan of the new Flex Control pivoting head electric razor, delaying the introduction of the product in the United States. **********Analysts are not worried about the Sensor's lag in profitability, predicting that the shaving system will earn huge profits for Gillette for many years. They point to Gillette's Atra shaver, which has been profitible for more than a decade. \"Sensor will generate profits for several years,\" said Deepak Raj, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. \"People may be surprised at the extent of margin improvement in the blades and razors division.\" **********Gillette increased its market share in blades and razors to 36 percent in 1990 from 32 percent in 1989, Mr. Freedman said, far ahead of Schick, the No. 2 brand. Schick, which is owned by the Warner-Lambert Company, has 14 percent of the market. **********Mr. Zeien said he expected strong competition from Schick and would be shocked if Schick did not start producing a twin-blade cartridge to fit the Sensor handle. Gillette licensed its Sensor technology to Schick, but the agreement prevents Schick from selling such a blade until January 1992. **********Schick has promoted its own new Tracer shaver, but Mr. Shore pointed out, \"Schick lost 1.9 points of market share last year.\" He added, \"They need Tracer to be a successful product, but it shouldn't present much of a problem to Sensor.\" **********With the promise of long-term profits from Sensor and aggressive new marketing plans under way, including a big advertising campaign this year, Gillette is getting no criticism from analysts. Mr. Zeien's biggest challenge may be to decide where to spend the enormous cash flow Gillette is generating. He indicated that he intended to lower the company's $1 billion in long-term debt but will also continue capital expenditures aimed at increased manufacturing capacity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/10/business/patents-efforts-to-promote-sight-through-artificial-eye.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1991-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 221, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; Efforts to Promote Sight Through Artificial Eye", "print_headline": "Patents; Efforts to Promote Sight Through Artificial Eye", "body_text": " **********Researchers at the National Institutes of Health obtained a patent this week on a method for simulating nerve impulses to the brain that might someday allow people to see through an artificial eye or feel through an artificial limb. **********\"I have to say, right up front, that we don't know whether this works or not,\" said Barry J.

Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America. \"It will be hard to get the kind of recovery we have had in the past with just monetary policy.\" **********The Fed's job was clearly easier in the past, when the interest-sensitive industrial sector accounted for a larger share of overall production. **********Moreover, the central bank has usually not had to act as the sole pump primer. This time, huge budget deficits at the Federal, state and local levels have effectively removed government fiscal policy as an ally.  New Capital Requirements **********Currently, the Fed's job is further hampered by the new capital requirements that it placed on commercial banks. Meeting those new standards is a reason that banks have been unwilling to step up lending over the last 12 months or so. **********Even if new credit were readily available, it is questionable whether loan demand would be strong, given the exceptional increase in debt taken on by consumers and businesses during the 1980's, analysts said. **********Because of the new capital adequacy requirements, \"continually lowering rates and putting reserves into the banking system is not having the impact it formerly did and normally would,\" said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. **********And Jay N. Woodworth, senior domestic economist at the Bankers Trust Company, said, \"The slow death of the savings and loan industry and changes in the banking system make it more difficult for the Fed's usual policy levers to bring about changes in the growth rate of money, credit and of the economy.\"  Lower Federal Funds Rate **********Since August 1990, the Fed has reduced the overnight Federal funds rate, which it closely controls, by 2.5 percentage points, to 5.5 percent. And in recent weeks, the economy has been showing some sputtering signs of life, particularly in manufacturing industries. **********Since April, a month in which many analysts think the recession bottomed, industrial production has risen by 7.5 percent at an annual rate. **********But with personal income growth remaining weak, analysts question whether the rise in industrial activity during the last three months is sustainable. Car sales, they note, remain mired at close to recession lows. A failure by Detroit to move its new models in September and early October could lead to production cutbacks later in the fall. **********The view is not universal that the Fed's powers have been diminished by time and special circumstances. Indeed, some analysts say the sputtering recovery may be just what the Fed wants.  The Fed's Intention **********\"I still think the Fed has plenty of ability to affect the economy,\" said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. Seeking to curb a resurgence in inflation, \"the Fed has intentionally tried to promote a gradual recovery,\" Mr. Johnson said, adding, \"That intention is apparent in the relatively modest cuts in the funds rate that we have seen.\" **********Compared with the way the Fed has responded during previous recessions, the reduction of 2.5 percentage points in the Federal funds rate thus far is mild, Mr. Johnson said. **********\"Typically, the Fed has pushed very hard and driven the funds rate through the rate of inflation,\" Mr. Johnson said. **********Based on recent inflation readings, the Federal funds rate would need to drop by roughly 1.5 percentage points from its current level if the Fed were to revert to previous pattern. **********Few analysts are willing to say the Federal funds rate will actually decline by that much before a sustained recovery is in place. But most economists acknowledge that lower rates are needed.  Value of a Quarter-Point **********\"Four percent funds is a long ways from where we are now,\" Mr. Wood at Bank of America said. \"I would be surprised that the Fed would have to move that far to get the economy going again. But I don't think the next quarter-point cut in the funds rate, when it comes, will accomplish very much. The last quarter-point cut didn't get us anything.\" **********Debate about when the Fed will move to reduce rates again will probably come to a boil this week, because employment statistics, the key monthly reading on the economy, are scheduled to be released on Friday. **********In advance of the August figures, most analysts are forecasting that nonfarm payroll employment rose by about 50,000 last month, but that the unemployment rate inched higher from its 6.8 percent reading in July. **********\"The market is setting itself up for how the Fed is going to respond,\" said Steven Slifer, an executive vice president and financial market economist at Lehman Brothers. **********In Mr. Slifer's view, a report that showed payroll growth close to the consensus forecast would provide the Fed with enough incentive to ease monetary policy further. **********\"Everybody will be on pins and needles on Sept. 6,\" Mr. Fine said. \"That bothers me, but it also makes a lot of sense.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/13/business/business-people-appointment-at-commerce.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-09-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 183, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Appointment At Commerce", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Appointment At Commerce", "body_text": " **********President Bush announced today that he had appointed John A.

P. Morgan & Company, said. **********The number of banks tightening credit is declining, the Federal Reserve's latest survey of senior bank loan officers shows. The survey of 58 American and 18 foreign-owned banks, taken in mid-March, was issued yesterday. **********Just over a fifth of the banks surveyed said that they had imposed stiffer terms on business loans in the last six weeks, compared with a third in January and half last November.  Caution on Results **********Stiffer terms might be anything from lower credit limits and wider margins to higher collateral requirements. \"If there was a credit crunch, it looks like it has flattened out,\" said Anatole Balbach, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. **********The Federal Reserve's March survey was taken just six weeks after the previous survey, half the usual interval. \"That makes the results harder to interpret,\" cautioned Thomas F. Brady, who directed the poll. **********But there are other straws in the wind. After stagnating for months, the nation's money supply -- an indicator, if an imperfect one, of banks' ability to lend -- has been climbing rapidly again. Nearly every source of bank funds -- from large time deposits to money market deposits -- has been expanding this year. Indeed, the money supply has been growing at a 9.5 percent annual rate since early February, putting it in the Federal Reserve's upper target range.  Slide in Loans Slows **********\"That's presumably because the Federal Reserve lowered the Federal funds rate starting late last fall,\" Mr. Brown of J.P. Morgan said. \"If M-2 had continued to languish, one would have been increasingly concerned that credit problems were having a broad effect on the economy.\" M-2 consists of cash, savings and checking accounts, and small certificates of deposit. **********The slide in actual business lending has slowed. Commercial and industrial loans, which fell sharply in January, merely edged down in February. \"That typically signals the end of a recession,\" said Herbert L. Baer, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. **********T. Waite Rawls, vice chairman at the Continental Bank, said, \"Not a whole lot has changed, but if we get signs in the next couple of months that the recession ended with the war, things will loosen up some.\" **********Indeed, in the first quarter, many corporations took advantage of lower interest rates to refinance debt. They retired short-term bank debt and issued long-term bonds. Some economists interpreted the surge as a sign that plenty of money was available for business. **********Banks are not clamping down so much on consumers, either. According to the Federal Reserve's loan officer survey, half as many banks as in January reported that they were imposing stricter conditions on residential mortgages, and two reported that they were easing up. **********Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America reported that applications for mortgages had tripled since December and that more than a third of all mortgage applications were from homeowners who were refinancing existing mortgages. With mortgage rates lower than last year, many borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages are trying to switch to fixed-rate mortgages. **********Consider the recent experience of Banc One, the large regional bank with headquarters in Columbus, Ohio. Business lending is still off, as it has been since last year. But consumer loans have jumped 15 percent since the start of the year. \"The consumer is coming back,\" said John B. McCoy, the bank's chairman. \"That's a precursor of industry coming back.

I just want to be an ordinary person, free to do as I wish. I can't take everybody's compliments.\" **********Then one of China's most-powerful warlords, Mr. Zhang intervened to amend Chinese history in 1936, by kidnapping Chiang Kai-shek, the paramount national leader. Before releasing Chiang, Mr. Zhang made him promise to work with the Communists, instead of killing them, so that China could stand united to battle the Japanese troops that were steadily encroaching on eastern China as a prelude to World War II. **********The kidnapping, which took place in the city of Xian and is known as the Xian incident, transfixed the world at the time, and led to a period of uneasy cooperation between the Nationalist Government and the Communist rebels until the end of World War II. This long reprieve from attack helped the Communists recover their strength and positioned them to overrun all of China in 1949.  Under House Arrest **********If Mr. Zhang had fled with the Communists, he might have become a national leader after the revolution. Instead, he disavowed any personal ambition and on Dec. 25, 1936, he released Chiang and flew back with him to the capital, Nanjing. He was put under house arrest, and vanished for half a century. **********\"It was a rebellion and I had to take responsibility for it,\" said Mr. Zhang in explaining his decision to accept punishment. **********Last year, on his 90th birthday -- he is 89 by Western count, but traditional Chinese reckoning starts with a year at birth -- Mr. Zhang emerged in public for the first time since 1936, celebrating his birthday with admirers at a hotel. These days there no longer appear to be any restrictions on his movements, and he spoke freely in a 100-minute interview, the first ever in his home. **********Only one other time since the Xian incident has Mr. Zhang given an interview, to a Japanese television reporter at a hotel last year, and he emphasized his distaste for publicity. **********\"I'm frightened of all those reporters,\" he said with a laugh. But he remains a larger-than-life figure throughout the Chinese-speaking world. 'A Symbol of Chivalry **********\"To people of my generation, he's a semi-god,\" a Chinese university lecturer in his 30's said. \"He's a symbol of chivalry and righteousness, an example of someone who looked after the weak and fought for justice.\" **********The key to Mr. Zhang's popularity seems to be that his intervention was aimed purely at confronting a foreign enemy. Even those who deplore the Communist revolution admire his patriotic fervor against the Japanese. Mr. Zhang's willingness to accept half a century of isolation has only added to the legend. **********\"He doesn't support any party or any faction; he just loves this country and his countrymen,\" said his wife, Zhao Yidi, who is 70. Explaining his decision to kidnap Chiang, she added: \"It's simple: he was against the civil war. He didn't want to see his people killed.\" **********A gnarled man who speaks with a faint northeastern China accent, reflecting his boyhood home, Mr. Zhang abounds with energy and constantly bustles around his living room, searching for a newspaper article or book to make his point. His eyes gleam, he occasionally tells a joke, and his mind seems as clear as ever. **********Mr. Zhang is also known as the Young Marshal because his father, Zhang Zuolin, was called the Old Marshal. After the Old Marshal was assassinated by the Japanese in 1928, Mr. Zhang inherited an army of 200,000 soldiers. But it was only after he kicked his playboy image and a drug habit, and replaced them with a nationalist passion, that his reputation began to soar. A Friend of Chiang **********In all those years of house arrest, first on the mainland and then on Taiwan, Mr. Zhang maintained a remarkable mutual respect and friendship with the Chiang family. Chiang seems to have kept Mr. Zhang under house arrest only partly as punishment; a major reason also was the knowledge that Mr. Zhang could become a dangerous rival if he emerged in public. **********Mr. Zhang, a Baptist who became increasingly religious over the years, saw the Chiangs each Sunday when he worshiped with them at their family chapel. Chiang's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, personally selected the beautiful Government-owned house in which Mr. Zhang lives. **********The house is decorated with paintings and calligraphy honoring the Chiang family, all gifts from Chiang.

Although the nation's central Government called both declarations illegal, the authorities in Belgrade have so far taken no action against Croatia. **********The move to send the army back to its barracks, some of which are in Slovenia, and the rest of the cease-fire accord were negotiated with the help of the European Community. Those governments intervened on Friday, helping to broker a truce out of fear that Yugoslavia would be consumed by violence among its six feuding republics and two autonomous provinces.  Fighting Began Last Week **********The fighting began last Wednesday after Serbia, the largest of the nation's republics and the dominant force in the Yugoslav military, made clear that it would use force to hold the federation together and prevent Slovenia from setting up border checkpoints and taking other steps toward autonomy. **********Serbia is dominated by a reconstituted version of the Communist Party, which governed until the collapse of Communism in Eastern Euorpe. **********Much of the military high command is drawn from longtime Communist cadres. The Slovenian and Croatian leaderships that emerged after post-cold-war elections are more Western-leaning and intensely nationalistic. **********Croatia's succession effort has caused other tensions. Although the army has yet to act in the republic, Croatia's large Serbian minority has made it clear that it will fight the Croats to remain part of Yugoslavia. **********It is unclear to what extent the military remains under civilian control. On Sunday, the nation's Prime Minister, Ante Markovic, said the army's move to prevent Slovenia from seceding from Yugoslavia was undertaken without his knowledge or consent.  Warning From the Army **********In its statement today, the army high command said its units were in full combat readiness and that further harassment of its units by the Slovene militia would be met by military force. \"Any kind of threat will be responded to with a massive and vigorous strike,\" the statement said. \"Any fraud and treachery will be short-lived. This will be proved soon.\" **********In Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital, Slovenian leaders accused the army of planning another attack and said they were demanding that national army units in Slovenia surrender their weapons before they lifted blockades preventing the army's return to barracks. **********Tense standoffs between Slovenian and Yugoslav forces continued today around some barracks, and armored national army units, which rolled into the republic last week, destroying Slovenian barricades, were reported trapped in some parts of the republic. But in the last two days, there have been reports of only sporadic shooting. **********The army statement, released through the official news agency Tanyug, was all the more striking because it came after a meeting of the country's collective presidency, which along with the military is officially under the command of a Croatian, Stipe Mesic. It was after Mr. Mesic was officially granted his seat that the army was ordered back to its barracks. **********Rubbing salt in the army wounds, Mr. Mesic, warned today that army generals could be expected to be called to account for their actions in the fighting, which included bombing and strafing of civilian targets. **********Singling out the army chief of staff, Gen. Blagoje Adzic, a fiercely pro-Serbian officer, the President said, \"A number of generals will have to reassess their position on recent events, and particularly regarding the so-called war in Slovenia.\" **********Slovenia's President, Milan Kucan, said at a news conference in Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital, that the Yugoslav Army had called up 200,000 reserves from Serbia and the republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina. He cited Belgrade television as the source of this report. **********Evidence of the army's resolve to act appeared tonight when the state television in Belgrade announced that the army commander in chief in the Slovene region, Gen. Konrad Kolsek, a Slovene, had been replaced by a Serb, Gen. Zivota Avramovic. **********The cease-fire was one element of an agreement sealed late Sunday under the mediation of three European Community foreign ministers, after the Friday truce appeared to unravel.  Three-Month Moratorium **********In exchange for the troop withdrawal, Slovenia and Croatia agreed to a three-month moratorium on their independence declarations. For its part, Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest and most populous republic, agreed to drop resisting the election of Mr. Mesic as President, an election mandated by the Constitution, which requires that the presidency be rotated among the leaders of the six republics. **********Germany's Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, arrived in Belgrade today for a two-day visit to Yugoslavia to explore ways of helping the country out of its crisis by sending an observer mission under the auspices of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. But Mr. Genscher made it clear that this was intended to be a civilian mission. **********Mr. Genscher is scheduled to travel to Ljubljana on Tuesday for talks with Slovenian leaders before going to a meeting of the conference in Prague. **********But the army's action, which came after Mr. Genscher's meeting with Mr. Mesic and Prime Minister Markovic, cast doubt on the ability of the 35-nation process to help mediate here. At a news conference this evening, Mr. Genscher said Mr. Markovic asserted that he neither condoned nor knew of the preparations to use force last week to keep Slovenia in Yugoslavia. **********\"I was impressed by the declaration of the Prime Minister,\" Mr. Genscher said, \"that he bore no responsibility for this and had no knowledge of it.\" **********Western diplomats said the army appeared wounded and angry after its poor performance against Slovenia, in which its forces were severely defeated by the poorly equipped but highly motivated Slovenes. At least 69 people died and many more were wounded in the fighting. **********The Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, said today that European Community mediators had told him that at the conclusion of the three-month cooling-off period, his republic of 4.5 million would gain independence. **********\"If you abide by the agreements,\" Mr. Tudjman cited the European foreign ministers who mediated the accord as telling Croatians, \"you will be free in three months, in all respects.

Though the raw material is, for the most part, free, \"someone has to get it and purify it, which costs money,\" he explained. \"Basically we're supplying a product and selling it.\" **********The purpose of collecting and distributing blood is to use it and its constituent components to save lives. But the industry has increasingly come under attack, accused of violating Federal guidelines, thus adding to the spread of AIDS and hepatitis. In Congressional hearings last month, Federal officials charged that slipping safety standards, improper training of personnel, deteriorating equipment and the drive for revenues had imperiled the industry. **********The American Red Cross, the nation's largest blood supplier, was singled out for criticism. In the past year, the Red Cross has also been cited by the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the blood industry, for hundreds of violations of procedures. In contrast, only 10 percent of the independent blood centers were found to have similar violations. **********\"No single license-holder for blood has had the problems of the Red Cross,\" said Dr. Gerald V. Quinnan Jr., acting dean of the Center for Biological Evaluation and Research at the F.D.A. **********Responding to the criticism, Elizabeth Dole, the former Transportation Secretary who has been president of the Red Cross since February, argued that \"the blood supply is safer than ever.\" But she added that the Red Cross will be making major changes in the way it conducts its blood-banking and processing business.  The Players Giant Red Cross Has Image Problems **********Though most blood bank officials do not like to compare their product to other commodities -- potatoes, say, or oil -- there are some similarities. In contracting to supply domestic hospitals, blood banks operate in a very competitive market. Then too, like oil, blood can be refined into a variety of higher-priced products with market values fluctuating widely depending on world supply and demand. **********Since the 1960's, the banks have been separating blood into its components -- red cells, platelets and plasma -- in addition to selling it whole. This conserves and specializes the blood supply, as well as bringing in greater revenues. But industry officials acknowledge that breaking blood down into a variety of components increases the possibility of infection, since a single patient may get components from a variety of donors. **********Three nonprofit organizations dominate the $2 billion American market for whole blood. The industry leader is the Red Cross, which was founded by Clara Barton after the Civil War. Its 53 regional blood centers collect more than half of the nation's blood supply, or 6.5 million units a year. The Red Cross's blood services division last year had $741 million in revenues and $14 million in tax-exempt \"profits,\" meaning excesses of revenues over expenses. Total revenues raised for its relief services were about $945 million last year. **********The Red Cross's main rival is the American Association of Blood Banks, which includes members of the Council of Community Blood Centers as well as hospital blood centers. The association, founded in 1947 primarily to counteract the dominance of the Red Cross, acts sets uniform operational guidelines for its independent members. **********Community blood banks, which are not-for-profit organizations, operate like small businesses with a board of directors and president. Mr. Doddridge, head of a community center in St. Petersberg, Fla., as well as current president of the association, estimates that most independently licensed centers have revenues of $50,000 to $500,000 and retain 5 percent to 10 percent of revenues in not-for-profit excesses. **********\"You can't operate a blood bank in the red,\" Mr. Doddridge said. \"Whatever profit margin you have is put back into the business. That's why we stress that we are a service, collecting blood for the nation.\" **********In contrast to independent centers, which each have their own license from the F.D.A, the Red Cross has only one license. **********The Red Cross's venerable image, as well as its single license, was seriously threatened in 1988, when the agency closed its Washington blood center after it was discovered that 235 people who had received blood there tested positive for the AIDS virus. **********Mrs. Dole announced last month that under the new restructuring plan, all of its blood centers will be closed on a rotating basis over the next two years to insure that computer inventories and screening systems are uniform nationwide and that Federal regulations are being met. The restructuring effort is expected to cost $125 million. **********\"When a large organization like the Red Cross has problems, you have to look at the operating philosophy,\" said Robert W. Reilly, president of the American Blood Resources Association, a trade group representing about 50 companies that own and operate more than 400 blood plasma collection centers nationwide. \"Every product must be treated and handled in the same way.\"  The Components A Global Market For Blood Plasma **********A pint of whole blood fetches about $100, but broken into various components, might bring in $190, depending on the region in which it is sold. **********Plasma, valued for its relatively long shelf life, is what remains when the platelets and oxygen-carrying red cells are removed from blood. One can extract about $55 worth of it from a pint of whole blood. And it can be separated further -- into albumin, which is used to keep blood-vessel walls from collapsing after an injury; Factor VIII, a blood-clotting agent used by hemophiliacs, and immune globulins, which can be used to strengthen the human immune system against certain diseases. **********Collecting and further processing plasma is no easy matter. Commercial companies typically pay donors, because separating the plasma from the whole blood, which is done at the bedside, can take as long as three hours. That and further processing require a sizable investment in technology and training. As a result, only the largest nonprofit organizations -- often in collaboration with profit-making companies -- have entered the market for plasma products. **********Plasma is the fastest-growing segment of the blood-products industry. It is a global market which last year had revenues of about $2 billion, according to Jack M. Reasor, president of the Marketing Research Bureau of Laguna Beach, Calif., which studies plasma collection in 30 countries. Five international companies dominate the market. But the United States is the major producer of plasma, collecting more than 60 percent of the world's annual yield of 15 million liters. **********The industry leader for plasma products, with about 30 percent of the market, is the Armour Pharmaceutical Company of Bluebell, Penn., a subsidiary of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the big French Government-owned pharmaceutical company. **********Next is Hyland Therapeutics of Glendale, Calif., a subsidiary of Baxter International Inc., which has 25 percent. Cutter Laboratories, a subsidiary of Miles, which is in turn a division of Germany's Bayer A.G., has 15 percent of the market, followed by Alpha Therapeutic, a subsidiary of Japan's Green Cross Corporation, with 10 percent. **********The Red Cross took a bold step in 1978 by contracting to use the manufacturing facilities of Hyland, thus entering the commercial plasma market with its donated plasma supplies. That business, which now accounts for about half Hyland's output, brought the Red Cross roughly $100 million of tax-exempt revenues last year.  New Complexities The Technology In the Age of AIDS **********In the last decade, blood collection has become increasingly complex. Blood centers have added five tests since 1985 to screen for hepatitis and AIDS, and two more AIDS tests will be added by the Red Cross this fall. **********There is no single repository for blood donor data, but both commercial companies and nonprofit blood centers have purchased computer systems to track donors. And the American Blood Resources Association is setting up a nationwide donor referral registry, in which any center will be able to call an 800 number to find out, among other things, if a donor has tested positive for the AIDS virus. **********Perhaps the biggest challenge facing the blood industry is the tremendous capital that will be required in the next 10 years to build or upgrade facilities, conduct research, purchase new equipment and hire more staff to further safeguard the blood supply. **********Commercial companies have invested about $50 million in research for new blood products, and the Red Cross, $7 million. About a quarter of the independent blood centers have plans to expand or build new facilities at an average cost of $1 million per center, said Mr. Doddridge.  THE STORE-YOUR-OWN CONCEPT **********Until recent years, the medical establishment gave barely a thought to the idea of individuals stockpiling their own blood for future operations or emergencies. Then came the AIDS epidemic, and with it, increasingly urgent questions about the safety of the nation's blood supply. **********Not surprisingly, given the special storage requirements, the first autologous, or self-donating, American blood bank was started by a sperm bank. The Daxor Corporation, based in New York, which began freezing sperm at superlow temperatures for artificial insemination in 1971, has through a subsidiary, Idant, been freezing blood since 1985. **********\"I realized that we could do the same thing with blood that we were doing with sperm,\" said Dr. Joseph Feldschuh, who founded Daxor and is author of a book, \"Safe Blood,\" which, despite its title, argues that America's blood supply is unsafe. **********Conventional blood banks consider self-storage controversial. They worry that it could destroy the voluntary system of donating blood and that the costs are too high, said Donald Doddridge of the American Association of Blood Banks. **********Idant charges an initial testing and processing fee of $100. The blood is run through 30 tests, including ones for cholesterol and for glucose, to detect diabetes. It can be safely stored for 10 years or more, according to Dr. Felschuh. Storage charges vary, from $12 a month for a pint of fragile red cells to $8 for more resilient plasma. **********So far, Idant has attracted about 2,000 customers. But the company is not a moneymaker. \"It's not been a good investment,\" said Dr. Feldschuh. \"We have lost money since it was initiated and acceptance is slow.\" Twenty-five other autologous blood banks have already gone out of business."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/07/world/after-the-war-baghdad-iraq-closes-window-to-outside-world.html": {"writer_name": "Frank Prial", "pub_date": "1991-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 588, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iraq Closes Window to Outside World", "print_headline": "AFTER THE WAR: BAGHDAD; Iraq Closes Window to Outside World", "body_text": " **********Iraq's decision yesterday to expel Western correspondents from Baghdad closes one of the few remaining windows on life in the battered Iraqi capital. **********Iraqi officials there and in Amman, Jordan, where many foreign journalists obtained their Iraqi visas, said no more visas would be issued.

As one Indian scholar noted, \"In U.P., they were Kashmiris. In Kashmir, they were from U.P. And what they all wanted desperately was to be Indians.\"  Crossed Ethnic Boundaries **********Indira Gandhi, a Hindu, had married a Parsi. Her youngest son, Sanjay, who until his death in an airplane crash in 1980 was being groomed to follow her, had married a Sikh. Rajiv's own wife is Italian-born. **********In turn, the three generations had all sought mandates to rule over an India in which local and regional powers would be subordinated to the transcendent authority of their Congress Party, which as time went by became more dominated by themselves and their closest retainers. **********Of the three, it was Nehru who came closest to achieving that broad mandate. Under the tutelage and sponsorship of Mohandas K. Gandhi, Nehru led the Congress Party through its nonviolent struggles to liberty. As the country's first Prime Minister, he established and imposed a national vision of a secular state committed to democracy at home and nonalignment in its foreign policies. India, at least in some regions, became a modern, technological and even scientifically advanced country. **********In the process he was able to forge the Congress Party into a powerful national political machine that accumulated votes and transmitted patronage in virtually every part of the huge country, from the Muslims of Kashmir to the Bengalis in the southeast. **********When Nehru died in May 1964 after 17 years in office, he was followed as Prime Minister by Lal Bahadur Shastri, a loyal Nehru follower. When Mr. Shastri died a year and a half later, the leaders of the Congress Party chose Indira Gandhi. Collectively these locally powerful political bosses were known as \"the Syndicate.\" Their choice of Mrs. Gandhi, then a soft-spoken and seemingly shy woman who was not related to Mohandas K. Gandhi, was based on the assumption by many that they would be able to dominate her while she held the party together with her name. **********They and the rest of India soon learned how they had miscalculated. Systematically, she removed the Syndicate members one by one, leading some of them to form and join rival offshoots of the old Congress. The splits led to bitter political clashes in the 1971 parliamentary election, but Mrs. Gandhi's party won. **********Four years later, when the courts found Mrs. Gandhi guilty of electoral malpractice in those 1971 elections and barred her from holding electoral office, she declared a state of emergency. Her critics and rivals were arrested, political activity was suspended and the press was muzzled. **********At the time her younger son, Sanjay, was her chief lieutenant and apparent heir. Though unelected to any office, Sanjay led national campaigns including an aggressive and controversial drive for birth control in which some people were forcibly sterilized. Rajiv Gandhi, the older brother, avoided the limelight. Increasingly Under Attack **********Though the Supreme Court cleared Mrs. Gandhi of the charges in 1975, she was increasingly under attack at home and abroad for having abandoned a commitment to democracy. **********In the 1977 election, she was defeated and her family's political and personal fortunes plummeted. She and Sanjay were repeatedly charged with crimes growing out of the emergency, and accused of having grown rich through bribes. This span, lasting three and a half years, was the longest in which India was not led by a member of the family. **********It ended when Mrs. Gandhi's rivals, then in power, began tearing at each other. Their patchwork coalition dissolved and in January, 1980, Mrs. Gandhi was returned as Prime Minister. \"I won on my name,\" she said on the morning after her comeback. **********This time, her Government relied heavily on Sanjay Gandhi and the group of mostly young, mostly urban and well-to-do people he had assembled. That changed six months later when on June 23, Sanjay Gandhi was killed in the crash of his aerobatic biplane. **********Within weeks, Rajiv Gandhi, who had always shunned public life, was projected into active politics. He was summoned by his mother to prepare for what she viewed as his rightful place. In June 1981 he was elected to take over his brother's parliamentary district. Eight months later he was named General Secretary of the Congress Party. **********He found his closest advisers among the newly emerging middle class whose views of industrial and urban growth he endorsed. **********As his political education continued, the pressures that his grandfather warned could someday fragment India were growing more intense. In the south, local parties were gaining. In Kashmir, India's most Muslim state, there was a resurgence of separatism. And Sikhs' resentments grew sharply when in June 1984 Government troops invaded the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the Sikhs' holiest shrine, to dislodge an extremist sect. **********That October Indira Gandhi was assasinated by Sikh members of her personal guard. Rajiv Gandhi, who had never served in any Cabinet post, was sworn in as Prime Minister. **********In December 1984, Rajiv Gandhi, aided by a sympathy vote, led his party to the most sweeping victory in India's history. From that point, however, his popularity declined, as regional conflicts grew and local politicians sought greater shares of federal authority. **********In November 1989, Rajiv Gandhi and his party were defeated by a coalition led by V. P. Singh, one of the politicians who had left Mrs. Gandhi and her party. **********Now without Gandhis, that party seems leaderless. But given its role in the history of the nation and the great likelihood that it may gain from a large sympathy vote, many may rush to seek to claim leadership, among them people who felt estranged and left the party in recent years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/11/business/credit-markets-fear-of-political-moves-keeps-bond-rates-up.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1991-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 820, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fear of Political Moves Keeps Bond Rates Up", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Fear of Political Moves Keeps Bond Rates Up", "body_text": " **********A weak economy and a marked slowdown in inflation usually occasion falling long-term interest rates. **********Some credit market analysts say those factors could indeed be potent enough to induce bond yields to fall toward 7.75 percent within weeks. **********But improvement beyond that level seems unlikely, the analysts said, even if the Federal Reserve Board continues to push short-term interest rates lower. The reason: persistent fears about what Washington might do to insure a recovery. **********There is little argument that long-term rates have room to come down. Even though yields fell a bit last week, the spread between 30-year Treasury bonds and 2-year Treasury notes was more than 2.2 percentage points, an extraordinarily wide margin.  Several Worries **********Concern that the Fed is reinflating the economy through its measured reduction in short-term interest rates is one reason that the yield curve is so steep. **********But at the moment the greater worry seems to be that Congress and the Administration will come up with a fiscal-rescue package that will mainly succeed in expanding a Federal budget deficit that some economists now project will reach $400 billion in the current fiscal year. **********\"One of the things we have learned over the years is that you can't trust Congress on fiscal policy for more than a year at a time,\" said Steven A.

Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, is not likely to ease tensions or improve the market's efficiency. **********Mr. Markey sent dealers a list of requests for information on why the three-year notes were so poorly received.  Types of Information **********Information as to whether dealers had stayed away from the auction as a form of protest against new Treasury bidding regulations was deemed to be of particular interest. So, too, was information about contacts between primary dealers concerning the auction. **********The letter, which asked that the information be supplied by Friday, did not sit well with some primary dealers. **********\"A lot of people who don't understand the securities business are doing what they think is right to insure the integrity of the market,\" said the chief executive of one primary dealer, who insisted on not being identified. \"But in so doing they are risking complicating the lives of market participants to such a degree that results shown at the first two stages of the refunding may become commonplace.\" **********The request for information about who is talking to whom, and about what, \"won't make communication more frequent,\" the executive said, adding that such communication is highly important if a market is to function efficiently. **********\"A market which functioned extremely well is being tampered with,\" the Wall Street executive said.  Awaiting Statistics **********The bond markets will be closed today in observance of Veterans Day, and the focus for the rest of the week is expected to be on economic and inflation reports scheduled for later this week. Analysts expect the reports to confirm that the economy is extremely soft and that inflation is coming down. **********\"There can be little doubt that inflation is improving steadily,\" said Steven Slifer, executive vice president and financial market economist at Lehman Brothers. \"Industrial prices, which have been falling since the recession began in August 1990, hit a new low last week. And wage pressures continue to abate.\" **********Further confirmation will arrive in the form of very favorable figures on producer prices and consumer prices, Mr. Slifer said. **********According to his forecast, the Producer Price Index, due out on Wednesday, probably rose by just one-tenth of a percent in October. And consumer prices, which are expected to be released on Thursday, increased by only two-tenths of a percent, he said. **********Weak retail sales figures and a report on industrial production showing that factory output did not rebound sharply in October are also expected, bolstering the case that the economy remains weak. **********\"I am getting very fearful for the Christmas season,\" said Mr. Wood of Bank of America."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/12/business/apple-cutting-computer-price.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Apple Cutting Computer Price", "print_headline": "Apple Cutting Computer Price", "body_text": " **********Continuing its recent strategy of moving to increase market share by cutting profit margins, Apple Computer Inc. announced significant price reductions today on its mid-range and high-end Macintosh personal computers. **********The price cuts on the SE/30, IIci and IIfx modes range from 10 percent to 31 percent and are effective immediately.

That is about 10 times faster than has been possible in the past. **********The system that rapidly sends photographs is only one of many new products emerging now that technical experts have agreed on a standard method for condensing computer images for faster transmission and more economical storage. The method, which blends sophisticated software with powerful specialized chips, squeezes the series of zeroes and ones that represent computerized images into far fewer bits of information so that the data take much less time to send. The method permits the condensed data to be reconstructed after arriving at their destination with no visible loss in quality. **********Just as an internationally accepted standard for compressing facsimile images spawned mass production that drove down the price of facsimile machines, the internationally accepted standard for compressing the more complex images stored in computers is expected to encourage the introduction of a variety of inexpensive consumer products. They will feature high-resolution color images that can be stored, retrieved and manipulated. Such products include not only improved newsphoto transmission systems but also video telephones, facsimile machines, copiers and printers that will be able to send and edit images as simply as text, and television-computer hybrids that allow the viewer to edit images much as today's word processors edit text. **********\"The big shift is from today's analog television to digital images,\" said Andrew Lippman, associate director of the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass. \"Television is learning the language of the computer.\" **********A simple compression method is already used in high-speed facsimile transmission systems. Without compression it would take nearly an hour to transmit a simple 8 1/2-by-11-inch sheet of paper. But the internationally accepted Group III facsimile standard replaces blank lines with a short code that indicates that the line is empty. Other lines can be compressed by being encoded as lengths of black and white spaces. **********The new standard for compressing digital images is already in commercial use and will be formally released in March. It was developed by an international standards group known as the Joint Photographic Expert Group, or JPEG. Later this year a second standard for full-motion digital video will be defined by a parallel group, the Motion Picture Expert Group, or MPEG. The MPEG standard is expected to offer image compression in ratios exceeding 100 to 1, making it possible to store and retrieve more than an hour of video images on a single compact disk. How It Works **********The internationally accepted JPEG compression system works this way: A color image is converted into rows of dots, called pixels. each with a numerical value that represents brightness and color. The picture is then broken down into blocks, each 16 pixels by 16 pixels, and then reduced to 8 pixels by 8 by subtracting every other pixel. The software uses a formula that computes an average value for each block, permitting it to be represented with less data. Further steps subtract even more information from the image. To retrieve the data, the process is simply reversed to decompress the image. **********A specialized chip compresses and decompresses the images hundreds of times faster than is possible on a standard desktop computer. **********MPEG offers even greater compression by taking advantage of the fact that full-motion video is made up of a sequence of still images. Because many successive frames consist of large areas that are not changed -- like a blue sky background -- it is possible to reach far higher levels of compression. **********But the current MPEG standard will lack some of the flexibility of the JPEG standard, which treats each image separately and therefore makes editing easier. Some companies, like Supermac Technology in Sunnyvale, Calif., see JPEG as an ideal standard for creating full-motion digital editing systems that permit computers to capture television video and store and edit the images on large Winchester or erasable optical disks. Current video-editing systems permit users to capture only single images. 'A Huge Bottleneck' **********Sophisticated compression standards are necessary if the promise of high-resolution digital video is to be realized, industry executives say. **********\"There is a huge bottleneck to working with images as opposed to working with text,\" said Robert R. Tillman, president of Storm Technology, a Palo Alto, Calif., company making products that use JPEG. **********Consider the staggering storage requirements of a single color picture. A standard full-color digital image displayed on an I.B.M.-compatible computer requires about a million characters of computer text, or one megabyte, of storage capacity on the computer's disk. By contrast, the novel \"Moby Dick\" requires only 1.3 million characters. **********The problem is exponentially compounded for engineers hoping to display full-motion video on a computer screen. To display 30 frames each second -- the rate needed to achieve smooth motion -- two billion bytes of storage are needed for a single minute of video. **********The storage problem is even worse for color printing applications. Printing an 8 1/2-by-11-inch color picture at a resolution of 300 dots an inch, which is typical for an office laser printer, would require more than 25 million bytes of disk storage space. **********Today's standard office personal computers generally come equipped with hard disk drives that store 20 to 40 megabytes. That is adequate for most text-only computer applications, but too little for the new class of graphics and color-image programs. Licensing Agreement **********Last month the JPEG standard took a significant step toward broad acceptance for both specialized graphics and standard office applications when Adobe Systems Inc., publisher of the Postscript printer language, announced that it was licensing the JPEG compression software technology from Storm Technology. **********Postscript is a standard computer printer language widely used in the desktop and higher-quality publishing industries. After Adobe adds the JPEG software to a future version of its Postscript, it will greatly ease the burden of sending large computer files in the Postscript format to computer printers. **********Moreover, some computer companies like Next Inc. have begun to add to their machines chips built expressly to run the JPEG software. Next is using a custom JPEG processor made by C-Cube Inc. of San Jose, Calif. **********The JPEG standard permits the user to select the degree of compression, and therefore how close to the original the decompressed image will appear. **********At Sunday's Super Bowl, five newspapers, including The New York Times, will cooperate in using a system to digitize photos taken during the game. The pictures will then be run through the JPEG compression process and transmitted by modem to the newspaper offices. The new process will save two hours for newspapers on the East Coast, which will be closer to their production deadlines when the game is played, said Steven P. Schaffran, president of the Color Group, an Albany, Calif., company that is coordinating the process.  Making Digital Images Easier to Store and Send Digitized images take up an enormous amount of computer memory. A 4-by-5-inch photograph being prepared for newspaper publication takes up hundreds of thousands of bytes of information, making transmission slow and difficult. JPEG, a new standard for compressing digitized images, reduces the information in such photographs and keeps the loss of visual quality at a minimum. Photographs are composed of many tiny dots, called pixels. In a digitized color photograph, each pixel contains shade and brightness information, represented numerically. JPEG works by dividing the image into blocks of pixels, then assigning each block several numbers that describe its characteristics. This eliminates the need to process the image pixel by pixel. Some pixels are removed from a block to reduce the information it contains. The amount of data removed depends on the amount of compression desired. To further compress the image, each block is given a base value, shown here in the upper left hand corner by the letter B. All other pixels in the block are then assigned numbers that describe their shade and brightness in relations to the base value. In later steps, these values are simplified mathematically, but remain proportional. The loss of detail is minimal, because enough information about shade and brightness variations within the block is maintained."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/11/business/boston-bank-deadline-reset.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Boston Bank Deadline Reset", "print_headline": "Boston Bank Deadline Reset", "body_text": " **********The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said last week that it would give interested parties two more weeks to submit bids for the three banking units of the failed Bank of New England Corporation. **********The F.D.I.C. said on Friday that it had extended the deadline to March 29 because of the large number of requests from prospective buyers.

The plan for American economic recovery will have taken about five months by the time the President offers his promised growth proposals late in January. **********This contrast in timing defines the problem Mr. Bush faces as he tries to fulfill the international obligations that are central to his duties as President, while at the same time preparing for an election that could turn on domestic problems. **********By outlining a policy for dealing with the upheaval in the former Soviet Union, Mr. Bush could satisfy the first set of expectations and solidify his credentials as the leader of the much-proclaimed new world order, even if the plan seems unlikely to make much of a dent in the problems facing the Soviets. **********But in dealing with the Soviet crisis, Mr. Bush risks walking into the trap that has been so eagerly laid by the Democrats vying for their party's nomination and by challengers from his own party's right wing. **********For months, these critics have complained that Mr. Bush devotes too much attention to other countries' problems and not enough to America's. Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative who entered the Republican nomination race on Tuesday, has been lampooning the new world order as a betrayal of what he calls \"America First\" principles that ought to prevail when American workers are losing jobs to foreign competition. **********Republicans and Democrats, including Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, have suggested that even if the President is effective overseas, he has done a poor job of explaining himself at home. This image was only reinforced when the new Soviet policy was presented by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in a speech at Princeton University on Thursday, rather than by Mr. Bush himself in a nationally televised address. Trying to Blunt Criticism **********Administration officials said Mr. Bush's initiative on the Soviet Union had been inspired solely by that country's political and economic crisis, one far deeper and more immediate than American economic problems. But Mr. Baker seemed to be trying to inoculate Mr. Bush against campaign-year criticism as he outlined the new policy. **********By following the Administration's blueprint, he said, \"We can prevail over the fearful isolationism that threatens to return us to the failures of the 1920's and 1930's. We can prevail over political paralysis to forge a bipartisan consensus about what has to be done and then, united at home, we can join with our allies to form a new coalition.\" **********This fall, Mr. Bush has come under intense criticism, first for his unwillingness to consider economic growth measures and then for the deliberateness -- some say sluggishness -- with which he is developing such proposals. **********Now, he has moved with startling speed on yet another foreign policy challenge. His aides are confident this will reinforce his image of a President who can be trusted with the nation's security. They argue that Mr. Bush has freedom to act in foreign affairs that is denied him in negotiating on domestic issues with a Democratic-controlled Congress and that whatever the political climate at home, his diplomatic portfolio is simply too important to be slighted. Democrats' Bind **********Indeed, it has not been that long since Democrats were complaining that Mr. Bush was a passive spectator on the world stage, and the Administration's policy pronouncement left them in a double bind. It was unveiled as one of the Democratic Presidential contenders, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, was delivering a speech saying that Mr. Bush had not taken the lead on the Soviet crisis and suggesting actions that did not greatly diverge from Mr. Bush's plan. **********But other opponents on the right and the left quickly moved to further their assault on what they view as Mr. Bush's weakest electoral flank. **********\"The fact of the matter is that he has come up with an economic plan for the Soviet Union more than a month before we can even expect an economic plan for the United States,\" said Lorraine Voles, spokeswoman for Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who is running for the Democratic nomination. \"It's once again a sign of the President just ignoring the domestic dilemmas that this country is facing.\" **********Even those Democrats who have been pressing Mr. Bush to do more, not less, to aid the Soviet Union tried to chip away at Mr. Bush's grip on the foreign policy debate and to reinforce what even White House aides concede has been the President's difficulty in explaining himself to voters. Letter From Gephardt **********Mr. Gephardt said in a letter to Mr. Bush on Thursday that his \"modest measures are steps in the right direction but, given the enormity of the crisis, more explanations are needed and more actions may be necessary.\" **********Mr. Gephardt urged Mr. Bush to address the nation about his Soviet policy, and his office pointed out to reporters that some key elements of Mr. Bush's plan, including the idea of assembling industrialized nations to coordinate aid, were proposed by Mr. Gephardt nearly two years ago. **********Bush aides argued that it is in the direct economic interest of the United States to insure stability in the old Soviet Union. Bush Campaign's View **********Charles Black, Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, said: \"Throughout the campaign, we're going to have to repeat a message consistently that there is a threshold requirement for any President to manage national security and foreign relations.

His aides have yet to agree on any fix for the nation's economic problems, and it will take months to get any results. Beyond that, the Administration fundamentally believes the Government can and should be much more active in foreign affairs than on economic and social issues. **********There are also tactical considerations. **********\"If you don't have any good economic news, you can't just sit there and do nothing,\" said Lance Torrance, a Republican political strategist. \"You've got to show motion and that motion at the current time has to be on foreign affairs.

According to the participants in a lively seminar on the subject yesterday, the answer is a qualified yes. **********The seminar, held at the New York Helmsley Hotel in midtown Manhattan, pitted advocates of focus groups, surveys and advertising tests against disciples of the pure creative process. **********The more than 100 people who attended the event, sponsored by the New York council of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, heard panelists defend their opinions by invoking examples of campaigns that succeeded because -- or in spite -- of research. **********Joel Hochberg, president of domestic marketing for the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation and a former executive at agencies like DDB Needham Worldwide, warned against \"treating research as a distant relative: The only time you call is when you're in trouble.\" Rather, the self-described \"convert\" to research said, it can be useful \"as a guidance system.\" **********Mr. Hochberg showed the audience how the trailers, or coming attractions, for Fox's comedy hit \"Home Alone\" evolved through research. Though \"research isn't the reason why 'Home Alone' has become the third-largest grossing movie of all time,\" he said, it led to the creation of a trailer that would \"encourage kids to come back even more\" by humorously suggesting they see the film \"a million times.\" **********A colleague of Mr. Hochberg's, Andy Fessel, senior vice president of research and marketing for the Fox Broadcasting Company, discussed how audience research had enabled Fox to identify \"market opportunities\" -- the young adult viewers who had been turning off the Big Three television networks' fare -- and to target them with series like \"21 Jump Street\" and \"Beverly Hills 90210.\" **********Research has also been invaluable to Levi Strauss & Company, said Steve Goldstein, the director of consumer marketing for its menswear division, in \"giving men a new way to think about their clothing.\" That has been accomplished, he added, by the company's Dockers line of casual wear, which since its introduction five years ago has grown to have annual retail sales of an estimated $1.5 billion. **********Showing a series of television commercials for Dockers that Foote, Cone & Belding, San Francisco, has been producing since 1987, Mr. Goldstein outlined how research contributed to the creation of \"Dockers World, the mythical place where our Dockers consumer feels comfortable.\" **********The spots, in which Dockers-clad men engage in offhand chats about life, have been changed in response to data gathered from consumers, Mr. Goldstein said. Moments have been emphasized during which the actors in the spots display traits like being \"good friends, non-judgmental, non-competitive, successful, outgoing, easy to like,\" he added. **********Most outspoken at the seminar was Ed McCabe, chairman of McCabe & Company, who has created attention-getting campaigns for clients like Perdue Farms and Volvo. He made a sharp distinction between research -- \"Without great research, you can't make great advertising\" -- and testing, which he attacked as \"the idiocy that keeps greatness from happening.\" **********Referring to the process by which advertising is scrutinized by agencies before being released, he added, \"Testing is a crutch the one-eyed use to beat up the blind.\" **********Mr. McCabe showed a reel of his work, including a spot for Hebrew National hot dogs in which an actor portraying Uncle Sam is brought up short by the company's insistence on exceeding Federal regulations because its products are kosher and must \"answer to a higher authority.\" **********The spot \"tested not very well,\" Mr. McCabe said. \"I had to wrestle the client to the ground to ignore the testing and run the commercial anyway.\" **********Nineteen years later, he added, it is still running."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/13/world/after-the-war-refugees-in-south-beg-army-to-stay.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1991-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 367, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REFUGEES IN SOUTH BEG ARMY TO STAY", "print_headline": "AFTER THE WAR; REFUGEES IN SOUTH BEG ARMY TO STAY", "body_text": " **********More than 100 Iraqis held a peaceful demonstration at the main refugee camp here today, appealing to American forces to stay in southern Iraq. **********The heavily armed American troops in southern Iraq, who numbered about 90,000 last week, will be replaced with a United Nations observer force.

Yavlinsky, explained the painful slide during a wide-ranging, two-hour interview today. Mr. Yavlinsky had offered the assessment earlier in a confidential report to Western financial leaders in the hope of winning their support for his program of radical economic reform. **********Those leaders in the Group of Seven industrial nations agreed on Sunday to unprecedented support to help rebuild the Soviet economy on a free-market basis, but have not yet committed themselves firmly to monetary support. Shrinking Soviet Economy **********A copy of the report on the Soviet economy was obtained from Western officials, and it paints a devastating picture. **********A section of the report labeled \"Situation\" said the Soviet economy is expected to shrink by 13 percent this year, industrial production by 9 percent and farm production by about 11 percent, suggesting that the onetime Communist superpower is suffering a severe recession. **********But fiscal and monetary conditions appear even worse. Retail price inflation has reached a 96 percent annual rate and is accelerating, the report says. The central Government is expected to post a budget deficit this year of more than 120 billion rubles, and to suffer a deficit of at least 80 billion rubles more on expenditures that do not show up on the budget. Together, the Soviet republics are expected to have budget deficits that total 120 billion rubles. **********There is no longer any understandable way to translate ruble deficit into dollars or other Western currencies because stable exchange markets can no longer be sustained by Soviet authorities. But some sense of the magnitude of the deficits can be gained in the fact that few Soviet workers are paid more than 500 rubles a month. Scarce Hard Currency **********To finance the growing deficit, the Government is printing money. The report says the amount of cash in circulation increased by more than 15 billion rubles a month in the June-to-August period. **********Imports plummeted by 45 percent in the first eight months of the year from the corresponding period in 1990, in part because less earnings from hard currency have been available for purchases. Exports fell by 27 percent during that time, \"basically as a result of an overall decline in the production of energy,\" the report said. **********The Soviets have estimated their hard-currency debt at $70 billion, which is not considered an overly burdensome sum given the country's size and natural resources. But the decline in exports and the withdrawal of credit lines during the coup have left Moscow unable to pay as much as $5 billion in foreign debts coming due in the next three months. **********Mr. Yavlinsky explained that the sudden withdrawal of foreign deposits and credit lines to international banks after the coup was responsible in large part for slashing his country's access to the hard currency it needs for the payments. **********\"The real structural problem was the fall in our exports, but we could have gone on some time this way,\" he said. \"But you didn't hear us talking about this liquidity situation in May or June. It was the problem of the coup and the banks.\" 'Shopping for Money' **********Western countries are worried that a default on debt payments could disrupt trade and make it impossible for the Soviets to obtain the credits on which they are critically dependent. **********Mr. Yavlinsky said that although he had not come to Bangkok \"shopping for money,\" some kind of debt relief or short-term loans would probably be required to get the country through the winter. **********The Group of Seven -- consisting of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada -- said over the weekend that their deputy finance ministers would soon go to Moscow to consult with the Soviets on their economic problems and intended reforms. Mr. Yavlinsky said today that one of their principal tasks will be to determine the nature of any financial assistance needed to alleviate the immediate crisis and restore confidence in Soviet banks. **********\"The fundamental decision will be made in Moscow,\" he said. \"Sooner is better than later -- and maybe cheaper.\" Partnership With West **********Mr. Yavlinsky, 39 years old, an energetic man, insisted that he had sought something much more important in Bangkok than financial support. **********He said that Soviet leaders are seeking a partnership with the West to stabilize their economy, develop workable reform plans and, perhaps most important, persuade recalcitrant elements in the country that they need not fear the risks associated with change. **********Mr. Yavlinsky admitted that there was tremendous resistance in the Soviet Union to his plan. The pace of disintegration is rising at a time when he is trying to preserve certain central powers. **********But he said that the meetings in Bangkok had added momentum to the process that began with the meeting of the Group of Seven heads of state in London in June. The main difficulty, he said, was keeping ahead of the collapse of the Soviet economy. **********\"Time is not going into a refrigerator, you know,\" he said. \"Inflation is growing, production is falling. You can't stop this process.\" **********In the eyes of most Soviet citizens, the Western economic systems work, while the Soviet system does not. Thus, Mr. Yavlinsky said, they would have more confidence in something that Western leaders had endorsed. He received a strong endorsement from the Group of Seven on Sunday to take part in the reform process. **********But Mr. Yavlinsky expressed disappointment on one point. He said he had wanted to return to Moscow able to announce the date on which the Soviet Union would move from its current status as a special associate member of the International Monetary Fund, which is meeting here this week, and become a full member. **********The Western countries and Japan have only said that the Soviet Union is expected to join the lending institution soon. Membership would provide the country with a great deal of technical assistance as well as access to billions of dollars a year in loans. **********Some republics want to become independent and then simply abandon the debt. But Mr. Yavlinsky said the leaders of the industrial nations reaffirmed that it would be very difficult if not impossible for the republics to obtain new credit if they walked away from a bankrupted union. **********\"It was made clear that all the republics must pay the debt together,\" he said. \"There will be no new credits without paying the old ones, even to individual republics. I can now tell these people, 'I've spoken with the Western finance ministers and they told me how they will do these things. I know.' \" **********Mr. Yavlinsky emphasized that the Soviets had to resolve a range of problems on their own, particularly the treaty defining economic relations among the republics. **********\"I want to stress that this is not the traditional style of support, where you just say, 'I'm in a crisis, give me money,' \" he continued. \"This has a different character. That is what we are trying to explain. It is a deeper, long-term process that will create mutual understanding. If there is no understanding, there is no support.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/19/business/german-gains-in-privatizing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "German Gains In Privatizing", "print_headline": "German Gains In Privatizing", "body_text": " **********The Treuhandanstalt privatization agency, which has the assignment of selling off former state-owned enterprises in eastern Germany, has sold 1,000 of the 8,000 businesses, a board member was quoted today as saying. **********Birgit Breuel told the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung that the agency's work had so far been successful, with 500 more businesses expected to be sold soon, but she added that the pace of privatizations might slow. **********\"Not all companies that can survive can be sold,\" she was quoted as saying."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/14/world/after-the-war-syrian-leader-s-new-gamble-pursuing-power-as-arab-champion.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1991-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 750, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Syrian Leader's New Gamble: Pursuing Power as Arab Champion", "print_headline": "AFTER THE WAR; Syrian Leader's New Gamble: Pursuing Power as Arab Champion", "body_text": " **********Through a long and crisis-prone rule that has often resembled a poker marathon, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria has rarely blinked, always believing that the chips at game's end would vindicate the way he played the hands. **********The strategy has been the same from his move into Lebanon in 1976 to his backing for Iran in its war with Iraq to his support for the American-led coalition in the Persian Gulf war. All damaged his reputation as an Arab radical and were unpopular with his people, but ultimately succeeded in enriching the trove Mr. Assad most cherishes: regional power. **********In Damascus on Sunday, after unproductive negotiations with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, the Syrian leader seemed to be pursuing a strategy that gambled the outcome of Middle East peace efforts and his newly strengthened ties with the United States against the longer-term calculation that power and survival itself depend on advancing himself as an Arab champion untainted by compromise. **********Throughout the latest Middle East peace effort, Syrian officials had emphasized that they would not compromise on the basic demand: the return of all Arab lands occupied by Israel in 1967. To do so, in the Syrian view, would be to forfeit the political basis of the Government. And the Syrian leader apparently believes others will blink first.  On the Side of the Winners **********His seemingly unshakable belief that his policies will stand hindsight's scrutiny emerged in a speech he gave to Muslim clerics last month. **********\"Our stand seemed weird to some people for a certain period of time,\" he said, referring to the hostility with which many of his people greeted his decision last August to reverse decades of anti-Americanism and side with Washington in the war against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. **********But with the defeat of President Hussein by allied forces, Syria emerged on the side of the winners. \"The course of events,\" he told the clerics, \"has proved repeatedly that our stand was the correct and healthy one, exactly like our stand on Lebanon and the Iran-Iraq war. We did what we could according to our national interests.\" **********The stalemate with Washington possibly reflects a sense that this time the stakes are higher than ever, for, in this region's politics, any hint of softness toward Israel carries severe political and physical risk, as President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt discovered 10 years ago when he was assassinated after making peace with Israel. **********President Assad \"has not given away anything that would enable anyone to point a finger at him later,\" a regional diplomat said. Weeks ago, Syria's officially controlled newspapers began to harp on a familiar theme: if peace efforts break down, Israel is to blame because Arabs have proved flexible while Israel has been intransigent. **********Moreover, Syria has reportedly spent more than half of the $2 billion it got in aid from the gulf nations after the gulf crisis on new weapons, notably enhanced Scud-B long-range missiles capable of hitting Israel. \"The Syrians feel that Israel never gave anything to weaklings,\" an Arab diplomat said.  Several Games at Once **********The Syrian leader is also playing several games at the same time, all of them ultimately centering on the purported source of his political legitimacy: steadfastness in the Arab-Israeli dispute. **********In Lebanon, he is seeking to promote an Arab pact called the Taif accord, which, with United States support, acknowledges Syria's primacy there. Under the accord, Syria is committed to disbanding all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias in the country. But a Syrian official said Damascus did not wish to move against Palestinian and Iranian-backed militias while Israel still controlled its so-called security zone in southern Lebanon. **********In the maneuverings over an Arab-Israeli peace conference dispute, the Syrian leader has emerged as the most important Arab player by far. His decision to support Iran in its war with Iraq and then to back the Arab moderates against Baghdad in the gulf war has placed him in a position to bridge Iranian and Arab interests. **********None of Syria's maneuvers are uncomplicated. But a senior Western diplomat said that in virtually all of them \"he needs the United States\" because the demise of Soviet power has led him to a fundamental reappraisal of Syria's position. No longer can Syria play the role of a confrontational Soviet proxy in the Middle East. **********On all fronts, however, the Syrian leader is calculating that the United States needs him, for he alone controls something that determines whether there is peace or not: his cooperation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/25/world/war-gulf-press-gulf-good-cheney-s-press-curbs-are-loosened.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Berke", "pub_date": "1991-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 746, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "News from Gulf Is Good, and Cheney's Press Curbs Are Loosened", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: THE PRESS; News from Gulf Is Good, and Cheney's Press Curbs Are Loosened", "body_text": " **********The Pentagon's highly restrictive news policy announced by the Secretary of Defense last night was loosened today when allied field commanders came forward with glowing reports of early success in the war zone. **********But many American news executives contended that the curbs were the latest, and possibly most troubling, example of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's efforts to control the flow of information from Washington. **********More than two hours after the ground assault began, Mr. Cheney summoned reporters to the Pentagon on Saturday night to announce that to protect the troops, regular briefings in Washington and in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, would be suspended until further notice. **********\"Even the most innocent-sounding information,\" he declared, \"could be used directly against the men and women whose lives are on the line carrying out these operations.\" **********The policy changed this morning when Pentagon officials said the Secretary gave permission for the American commander in the gulf, General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, to deliver what was an upbeat briefing to reporters in Riyadh. **********\"Good news defeats a blackout,\" said Jonathan P. Wolman, Washington bureau chief of The Associated Press. \"The military apparently has a good story to tell, and they are abandoning their blackout to let it be told.\" **********Howell Raines, Washington editor of The New York Times, said the Pentagon, motivated by political concerns, was preventing the press from providing a more complete picture of the war. **********\"The Administration wants to use the legitimate theme of security, in some cases, to install a kind of blanket news management that we've never had in this century,\" he said. \"No one argues with legitimate security needs. There's a kernel of truth in Secretary Cheney's argument.\" But he said that Mr. Cheney had gone too far, noting that it was not until late tonight that the first photograph of a wounded American soldier was released. **********When the restrictions on coverage began, groups of reporters escorted to the war zone by military officers found that transmission of their dispatches, already subject to review by the officers, was being delayed. **********General Schwarzkopf's briefing, though it lacked detail, seemed to have had the effect of signaling to other officers in Riyadh and Washington that they could at least speak anonymously to reporters. As the day wore on, news organizations began to receive dispatches from pool reporters in the field, and the networks began to get war footage. **********Still, many editors and news executives expressed frustration with what they regarded as heavy-handed restrictions on reporting the ground assault in the name of troop security. General Schwarzkopf, for example, refused in his briefing to disclose an estimate of allied casualties, as is standard practice, saying only that they were \"remarkably light.\" **********Fred S.

That is unprecedented.\" Mr. Schmeisser added that he has found that \"when people cite security concerns, historically, 80 or 90 percent of the time, those concerns are used to keep embarrassing things from coming out.\" **********Paul K.

That offer had come from United Airlines, American Airlines and Trans World Airlines. **********The creditors' approval greatly improves the chances that Delta will end up with Pan Am's valuable routes to Europe and its Northeast Shuttle, which serves Boston, New York and Washington. The Pan Am assets would make Delta a much stronger competitor among international airlines.  Deal Long Sought **********Pan Am's management has long supported a deal with Delta, but its creditors had strongly opposed the Delta bid as recently as Friday. Pan Am is operating under protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, **********As a result of the truce, signed at 12:04 A.M. to the negotiators' robust applause, the creditors said they would join Pan Am's management in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan today in an effort to sell the new deal to Judge Cornelius Blackshear, whose approval is required. The Federal Transportation Department must also approve any transfer of Pan Am's routes to another airline. The Justice Department, which can oppose acquisitions on antitrust grounds, had blessed a Pan Am deal with Delta on Friday. **********\"We got a deal,\" an exuberant and tired Leon Marcus, the attorney for the creditors' committee, said late last night, moments before signing the agreement. \"We got a good deal.\" **********Besides providing $1.7 billion, the tentative deal promises to save the jobs of 13,500 Pan Am employees, out of a total of 17,300 workers. **********The agreement caps what had been a \"grueling weekend,\" as one adviser to the creditors put it, during which Pan Am's many suitors presented their deals to the creditors in a round-robin of one-upsmanship. **********With so many competing offers to choose from, the creditors were not shy about playing one suitor off of another to raise the bidding. For instance, after Carl C. Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines, agreed to absorb Pan Am's operating losses above $140 million between now and the time he would close a deal, Delta reluctantly agreed to do the same. While the creditors had found Delta's earlier proposals attractive in terms of a future stake in a reorganized Pan Am, the creditors had worried that the airline might run out of cash before it would even get to close the deal. The guarantee provided some reassurance. **********\"One of the principle reasons that Delta's revised proposal was acceptable is that it contained a stop-loss provision over $140 million, same as Carl's, and consequently it helped relieve any fears the creditors had that the transition would not take place,\" said Henry Miller, an investment banker at Prudential Securities who was advising the creditors. **********\"That cinched it,\" Mr. Marcus agreed.  Team of Bidders **********T.W.A. and American Airlines had teamed up in an effort to wrest Pan Am away from Delta, and Delta's ambitions were in the greatest danger of being disappointed yesterday when United Airlines scrapped its own bid and joined forces with T.W.A. and American. **********Bankers and lawyers who were at the meeting said United would have forsaken its longstanding desire to acquire all of Pan Am's Latin American routes and would have satisfied itself with about 20 landing slots at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York and three of Pan Am's four flights to Mexico City. American would have walked off with the shuttle, and T.W.A. would have taken what was left, primarily some of the Latin American routes and a lot of spare parts. **********The creditors committee immediately disclosed the three-way bid to Delta, which came back about five hours later with a far-richer offer that many bankers and lawyers said was designed to be \"pre-emptive\" and put an end to the bidding. **********\"Delta came back and gave in on every major point,\" Mr. Miller said.  Unlikely Suitor **********Mr. Icahn, who had been an unlikely suitor from the beginning because of T.W.A.'s own financial woes, conceded defeat gracefully, people at the meeting said, and even joked at his own expense. **********Neither Mr. Icahn nor officials of United could be reached late last night for comment. **********Under the revised deal, Delta has agreed to pay Pan Am's creditors roughly $621 million in cash and assume liabilities of $720 million. In addition, the creditors would receive 55 percent of the equity in a reorganized Pan Am, which they were valuing last night at about $456 million. **********In particular, Delta would pay $416 milion for the North Atlantic routes and the Northeast shuttle plus some additional spare parts, and would absorb 6,600 of Pan Am's existing employees to staff those businesses.

It's time we go on the offensive, instead of being always on the defensive.\" **********For instance, Mr. Snyder said he saw a \"need to develop, with the entire advertising industry, an effective educational program that will demonstrate to the American people the value they get from advertising.\" He added, \"We have a long way to go in that area.\" **********Such a program could counter skepticism about advertising among consumers, Mr. Snyder said, by describing the \"entertainment benefits and product information\" that advertising can provide. **********In the often-contentious relationship of advertising and government, Mr. Snyder is calling for \"a middle-road standard of regulation.\" The reassertion of authority on the Federal level, as typified by recent challenges to food-product labeling by the Food and Drug Administration, is \"very positive, over all,\" Mr. Snyder said, because \"the industry cannot afford to have 50 different standards\" imposed by 50 states. **********\"We have to have one national standard,\" Mr. Snyder said, \"and we can help develop that national policy by cooperating with the F.D.A.\" and the Federal Trade Commission. \"This is also an area where the industry needs to be pro-active,\" he added. **********Mr. Snyder joined the association in 1985 as senior vice president of government relations after a 16-year career at the F.T.C.

Washington is reluctant to send them back to a country whose elected leader was forcibly overthrown or to admit them and risk encouraging a new surge of Haitian boat people to head north. **********Before last month's coup, the Coast Guard routinely returned Haitians they intercepted sailing for the United States. But officials here said that since the coup this practice has been suspended and that recently apprehended boatloads of Haitians have been housed aboard the two ships -- some for as long as 10 days -- while Washington asks other Caribbean countries to offer them temporary sanctuary. **********United States officials say that although most of the boat people are economic, not political refugees, they are leery of repatriating Haitians because of the widespread political violence in that country since the Sept. 30 army coup that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Three hundred people are estimated to have died so far in coup-related violence. **********Officials say they are also concerned, however, that if Washington opens the doors to many of the 185 Haitians the Coast Guard says it has in its custody aboard the two 210-foot ships, thousands more Haitians might be encouraged to attempt the perilous ocean journey to the United States. Thousands Sent Back **********Since the treaty allowing the United States to repatriate Haitian boat people was signed 10 years ago , immigration officials said, more than 23,000 Haitians have been picked up at sea by the Coast Guard. Only 28 of them were able to convince their interrogators that they had grounds to claim political asylum and were thus allowed to enter the United States. **********\"Right now we are examining the situation to determine whether it would be advisable to return these people to Haiti,\" said a State Department official, who declined to comment on whether a third country was being sought to receive the Haitians already aboard United States ships. **********An official at another United States agency involved in the issue, however, confirmed that other Caribbean countries were being approached to serve as temporary hosts for Haitians until they can be returned home. **********\"The numbers are building up, the ships involved are building up, and this thing is coming to a boil,\" said the official, who asked not to be identified. \"They are looking for other countries.

The question is whether we have enough weight with some of these Caribbean islands to get them to take some of these people.\" 2 Nations Want No More **********The Dominican Republic and the Bahamas, the two countries closest to Haiti, already have large numbers of immigrants from that country, and officials said they would be unlikely to accept more. **********Asked how long the Coast Guard could maintain its holding pattern with the refugees it has picked up, a spokesman, Chief Petty Officer Luis Diaz, said: \"We don't know. We have never run into a situation like this of having so many Haitians or any other aliens aboard our cutters for so long.\" **********Officials said Haitians seeking to reach the United States might have received some encouragement from the news that 52 Haitians who reached southern Florida by boat shortly after the coup had not been quickly returned home as is usually the case. **********After Washington announced a stringent economic embargo against Haiti last week, the country's provisional Prime Minister, Jean-Jacques Honorat, warned in an interview that the United States should \"get ready to receive\" a wave of refugees. **********Advocates for Haitian immigration rights condemned the search for other countries that could receive boat people from Haiti and said they should be admitted temporarily into the United States. \"Nobody should be forcibly returned to Haiti under the current circumstances,\" said Jocelyn McCalla, director of the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees in New York."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/07/business/forum-japan-s-sleight-of-hand-in-trade-and-its-duty-to-us-auto-workers.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Renshaw", "pub_date": "1991-04-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 446, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan's Sleight of Hand in Trade . . .

Obviously, an even steeper decline has taken place at Detroit's Big Three. **********That means Detroit will have fewer employees to fund its retiree benefits obligations. That is especially troubling because American companies are now paying for health-care benefits of retired men and women who contributed to Detroit's prosperity years ago. This is a burden that Japanese transplant companies don't have to shoulder because almost none of their employees are old enough to be eligible for retirement. **********Skyrocketing health-care costs have made Detroit's burden a heavy one. In 1988 and 1989, the General Motors Corporation paid more than $1 billion in health-care costs for its retired employees. And the health-care retirement burden is almost certain to get worse as Detroit cuts middle management and strives to catch up with the Japanese in terms of automation. **********So where is the money for these retiree benefits obligations to come from? Taxpayers could end up bearing some of the burden. Remember the Chrysler Corporation bailout in 1979. If Chrysler had gone out of business, taxpayers would have had to absorb more than $1 billion in Federally insured pension benefits to the company's retired workers. **********In terms of health care, there is a way out: Congress could take a page from the Railroad Retirement Act of 1935. By that year, the increased use of cars and the effects of the Great Depression had slashed the number of railroad employees by more than 40 percent from the 1920's levels. Congress responded with an act implementing a system of retirement benefits for all railroad employees. The railroads and their employees were to be \"taxed\" uniformly to pay for those benefits. This act solved an important social problem -- rising unemployment coupled with the number of retired people with little income -- and helped to create a more level playing field for surviving railroads. **********In these treacherous times, the best way to finance a similar system for auto industry health-care benefits would be to levy a uniform sales tax on all motor vehicles and parts sold in this country, including imports. **********Taxing imported vehicles would prevent them from having an unfair cost advantage over Detroit's products and taxing parts would help to compensate for the fact that Japanese transplant companies -- by putting artificially high values on imported parts -- are able to largely avoid paying any corporate profit taxes to Washington. **********Detroit's Big Three, which are now badgering Washington for special protection, might add this to their agenda.

But in the first quarter of 1991, the funds roared back, recouping last year's losses and then some. **********The 86 junk-bond funds rose an average of 14.1 percent, and the leader, the Dean Witter High Yield Fund, rose 30.6 percent, while the corporate A-rated bond funds rose only 2.9 percent in the same period, according to Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks mutual funds. **********Investor interest in junk funds surged as their performance soared. Sales shot up in February, as more money moved into junk funds than moved out for the first time since August. March was even better; junk fund sales at T. Rowe Price, for one, doubled from February. In those two months, investors poured more cash into the junk fund than in any of the group's other 15 bond funds, said Steve Norwitz, a T. Rowe Price spokesman. **********What happened? The junk market began the year at rock bottom. At the end of 1989, most investors believed the banking industry was on the verge of collapse, and \"we couldn't give some of these bonds away,\" said Mark Vaselkiv, co-manager of the $673 million T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund. **********The doom-and-gloom attitude was reversed in the first quarter as many junk issuers strengthened their balance sheets. RJR Nabisco, a bellwether for the junk market, set the tone with a successful sale of common stock and debt to buy back high-interest bonds. **********Some analysts believe that the market has righted itself and that long-term investors can reap handsome yields from junk. Before 1989, \"the risks of junk were underrated,\" said Ken Gregory, a partner in Litman/Gregory, San Francisco-based investment advisers. \"Now, the risks are overrated.\" **********Looking ahead, some managers say the junk market will move away from its involvement in leveraged buyouts to its earlier purpose of financing growth companies and \"fallen angels\" -- companies struggling through hard times -- and refinancing going concerns that prefer to raise money through borrowing instead of selling stock. **********The market will return to \"what it was 5 or 10 years ago, when the high-yield market financed Turner Broadcasting and MCI,\" said Richard T. Shotte, who manages the $200 million American High-Yield Fund, sponsored by the Capital Research Group in Los Angeles. **********Moreover, many managers say the junk market is fairly valued now. While Treasury issues yield about 8 percent, the top-tier junk issues yield about 12 percent, a wide enough margin to compensate for defaults or bankruptcy losses in a diversified portfolio. **********The yields on the higher-quality junk funds will not be as spectacular as the yields of the more aggressive junk funds, of course. Most high-quality funds yield about 13 or 14 percent while aggressive funds can yield more than 20 percent. But the very high yields for the most aggressive funds reflect their exceptional riskiness and such funds could have sharp drops in price. **********Aggressive junk funds are very volatile. For example, the Dean Witter fund that was top-ranked in the first quarter of 1991 was the bottom-ranked fund of the 86 junk bond funds in 1990, when it lost 15.5 percent, compared with an average drop of 5.7 percent. **********Since there is no rating in a fund's prospectus, how can investors identify high-quality junk funds? Be wary of funds that buy many of the most speculative types of junk bonds, like zero-coupon bonds and pay-in-kind bonds, neither of which make regular interest payments. **********Look for funds that are well diversified -- say, 40 to 50 issues. But it is possible for a portfolio to be too diffuse. Mr. Gregory says funds holding hundreds of issues are diluting the quality of their managers' research. **********Next, look at the tenure of the fund manager. Many of today's junk managers, called in to fix their predecessors' mistakes, are relatively new. But there are some managers who have run funds for five years or more, demonstrating their ability to maneuver through the junk market. Mr. Gregory's favorite: William Veronda, who manages the Financial Bond Share High Yield Fund. **********Lori Lucas, an analyst with Morningstar Inc., Chicago-based mutual fund consultants, likes two relatively new funds. They are the Plymouth High-Yield Fund, sponsored by Fidelity Investments in Boston, and the American High-Yield Fund. **********Ms. Lucas also recommends Merrill Lynch High Income Fund and the Vanguard High-Yield Fund, which she says have always focused on total return as a matter of policy, even in the 1980's, when other funds sought high yield at the expense of principal. **********One final note: Funds' current-yields calculations are based on a yield-to-maturity formula required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This assumes all bonds will be paid off in full when they mature. For most portfolios, this assumption is probably incorrect. As a result, investors should discount the yields quoted by junk-bond funds. For instance, Mr. Veronda, the Financial Bond manager, estimates his fund's true yield is about 13 percent, not the 15 percent based on S.E.C. yield calculations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/20/business/company-news-hanson-discounts-ici-bid-rumor.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hanson Discounts I.C.I.

The accord comes a week after the Government acknowledged that it had misjudged the cost and difficulty of uniting eastern and western Germany, a process Mr. Kohl repeatedly assured Germans would not be paid for through higher taxes. 'Relatively Undamaging' **********Finance Minister Theodor Waigel said the tax increases were \"economically relatively undamaging\" and should impose no lasting burden on the economy.

Last week, Mr. Waigel said he expected Germany's gross national product to grow by 3.2 percent this year, after growing by 4.6 percent in 1990. **********Most of the revenue generated by the tax increases will probably be used to cope with the economic decline in eastern Germany, where unemployment is rising as unprofitable companies shut down and surviving businesses slash their work forces.

The proposals must first be approved by Mr. Kohl's Cabinet and then voted into law by Parliament, where the coalition has a large majority that makes approval almost certain. **********Economists said raising German taxes might benefit other nations by reducing the amount of money Bonn would need to borrow on the world's financial markets to pay for rebuilding eastern Germany. Lower German borrowing could take some of the upward pressure off the nation's currently high interest rates, thus helping the dollar and other currencies, which have been persistently weak against the mark in recent months. **********Opposition leaders and taxpayer groups quickly denounced the increases, saying they proved Mr. Kohl's promises were empty. **********Hans-Jochen Vogel, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party, said the tax increases were \"the greatest and most brazen deceptive maneuver since the beginning of the Federal Republic,\" in 1949. **********Armin Feit, president of the German Taxpayers Association, called the increases \"economically nonsensical, budgetarily unnecessary and politically impossible.\" He contended that Federal and state governments were overlooking possible budget cuts totaling $16 billion. **********The Kohl Government has earmarked more than $70 billion this year to pay for the reconstruction of eastern Germany's economy. The bulk of the funds have come from heavy borrowing on the capital markets, borrowing that is expected to raise the public-sector budget deficit to more than $100 billion this year from $73.3 billion last year. **********But the war and the difficulties that eastern European nations like Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland are experiencing in converting their economies to free-market principles have put additional and unexpected financial burdens on Germany. **********Bonn has pledged $10.6 billion to the allied effort in the Persian Gulf.

It will embrace 380 million Western European consumers from the Arctic Circle to the shores of the Mediterranean. **********The 12-nation European Community, now the world's largest trading bloc, and the 7-member European Free Trade Association concluded two years of tough negotiations at a make-or-break overnight session in Luxembourg early today. After compromising on nettlesome details like fishing and trucking rights, they agreed to form a new common market, to be known as the European Economic Area. **********That paved the way for several new countries to seek full membership in the European Community, which is rapidly moving toward social and political, as well as economic, integration.  'Important Trial Run' **********\"Now we are heading full speed toward the community,\" Sweden's Prime Minister, Carl Bildt, said today. Of the seven members of the Free Trade Association, Sweden and Austria have already applied to join, and Finland is expected to do so soon, while Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are still undecided. **********Jacques Delors, president of the community's executive commission, said today that the accord would serve as \"an important trial run\" for countries hoping to join the community and at the same time aiding the community's \"spiderlike strategy to organize the architecture of a Greater Europe.\" The community members are France, Britain, Ireland, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg and Italy. **********The agreement would allow for the free flow of most goods, service, capital and people among its 19 member nations and should go into effect just as a single regional market is formed by the European Community on Jan. 1, 1993. **********At the same time, it could mean tougher global competition for the United States and Japan, particularly in areas of trade that depend on negotiations between regional blocs, such as in agriculture, textiles and automobiles. **********The agreement is now subject to approval by each of the 19 national parliaments, some of which are still expected to hold lengthy debates about the merits of the accord. Switzerland is also required by its constitution to approve the accord by referendum. But the private sectors in many of the nations of the free trade association are particularly eager for greater access to the community's markets. **********European officials said that today's accord should also encourage community members to agree on the next economic and political stages of their own integration process when a year of difficult negotiations culminates in a summit meeting in Maastricht, the Netherlands, on Dec. 9 and 10. **********\"It increases the chances that the heads of government of the community members will agree on substantial progress in deepening cooperation within the European Community,\" Germany's Chancellery Minister, Rudolf Seiters, said today. **********Community members are hoping to work out a timetable to create a single regional currency and central bank, as well as to agree on mechanisms for reaching a common foreign and security policy to give the community a stronger political voice in world affairs. **********If the Maastricht meeting achieves these goals, even after today's agreement goes into effect, the community's higher level of economic and political unity will continue to give it a separate identity within the European Economic Area. In essence, the Luxembourg agreement involves acceptance by the seven members of the Free Trade Association of community trading, financial and labor rules. It will also require them to adopt community laws on consumer protection, company law, environmental protection, competition and social policy. **********In exchange, goods, workers, services and capital from the seven nations, which have a combined population of 40 million, will be given broad access to the community. Even now, with $220 billion in annual trade, the seven do 60 percent of their trade with community countries; 25 percent of community imports and exports are with the Free Trade Association. **********The talks were deadlocked for several months over demands for special arrangements by members of both blocs. Finally, early today, compromises were found in the three key areas of dispute -- fishing rights, trucking rights and special payments for poorer community members. **********The fishing dispute, which stemmed from the refusal of Iceland to open its fishing grounds to community members, was finally resolved when Norway allowed Spanish fishermen a larger quota of fish from Norwegian waters in exchange for gaining greater access for its own fishing products in the larger market. **********Poor community members had been demanding a larger contribution from Free Trade Association countries to a special regional development fund. The seven finally agreed to provide $1.8 billion in low-interest credits and $600 million in grants. **********The final dispute involved Austria's and Switzerland's environmental opposition to heavy truck traffic from community members. Under the compromise, Greece was offered a special quota, and the community agreed to reduce truck emissions by 60 percent over 12 years in Austria and to make greater use of railroads in Switzerland.  Farm Issues Postponed **********The two sides also decided to postpone integration in the highly sensitive area of farm products, principally because community members are still trying to revise their own Common Agricultural Policy so that the current round of world trade liberalization talks can resume. **********But the agreement also includes features that suggest the parties intend to go beyond formation of a common market. They will establish a court modeled after the community's European Court of Justice to settle disputes and, in an important step toward political cooperation, they will form a joint council of ministers. **********The move toward greater integration will be strengthened by Austria's and Sweden's negotiations to join the community. These talks are expected to start next year, with a view to completion by 1995. Negotiations with other applicants may take place at the same time. **********\"We hope today's agreement will make it easier for Norway and Finland to approach a decision on the question,\" Denmark's Foreign Minister, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, said. Norway's main parties disagree over community membership, but Finland's Prime Minister, Esko Aho, has signaled that Helsinki will apply next spring. **********Several of Eastern Europe's new democracies, notably Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, have also expressed hopes of eventual membership in the community, but they have been told this will only be possible when their economies are strong enough to compete with more developed nations. **********But Frans Andriessen, the community's commissioner in charge of external affairs, said today that the European Economic Area should nonetheless help Eastern Europe because \"we will be able to function even better and take our responsibility in the reforms taking place there.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/04/business/sallie-mae-sets-note-offering.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sallie Mae Sets Note Offering", "print_headline": "Sallie Mae Sets Note Offering", "body_text": " **********The Student Loan Marketing Association, known as Sallie Mae, is offering $200 million in floating-rate notes due April 17, 1995, through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company. **********Noncallable through maturity, the notes are priced at 100 to float at 60 basis points more than three-month Treasury bills.

However, Metropolitan Life said that it would offer to buy the bonds of other investors who are not covered by the settlement. **********Four bond issues are included in the settlement.

Now, by using programs based on a new Apple Computer software standard called Quicktime, which allows video and sound to be incorporated in Macintosh computers, he is developing his own presentations for friends to play back on their Macs. **********These creations are like music videos, but they are also \"interactive,\" allowing the computer user to cut among songs, movie scenes, animated graphics and excerpts from documentaries in response to whatever is on the screen at any moment. **********Easily prepared \"multimedia\" presentations like Mr. Bove's have long been a sacred goal for the personal computer industry, which is counting on this technology to re ignite its once-explosive growth. **********Quicktime will be a standard component in color Macintosh computers beginning early next year. Announced in June by Apple Computer Inc., it is a software extension to the Macintosh operating system that will appear in a range of new programs that add full-motion video, sound and computer animation to existing computer applications. **********This capability results from technological breakthroughs that have allowed video images to be digitally encoded, just as audio data are captured on compact disks, and then to be stored and manipulated electronically using techniques that \"compress\" the digital data. **********For example, by adding a standard \"movie\" file format for digitized video, Quicktime will permit users to place movie animations in word processing or database documents, accomplish simple video teleconferencing over standard dial-up phone lines and edit video images to play back later. **********\"It's a grass-roots tool,\" said Mr. Bove, who edits a computer newsletter from his home in Gualala, Calif., north of San Francisco. \"There has never been a technology that has been scaled down like this to the level of the individual.\" **********At the Comdex computer exhibition here last week, a number of consumer products companies, including Sony and Eastman Kodak, demonstrated new equipment designed to bridge the gap between videocassette cameras and recorders and personal computers. Sony displayed a new video-computer interface known as the V/Box that permits a Macintosh or an I.B.M. PC to control a number of different Sony video systems simultaneously. **********Apple is hoping Quicktime will lead to a burst of applications in this new video market, just as two of the Macintosh's original features -- the graphics-oriented screen display and the laser printer -- led to a trove of new programs, like Adobe Illustrator to create complex graphics and Aldus Pagemaker for professional-quality desktop publishing. **********But while the Cupertino-based computer maker had an advantage of several years in desktop publishing, it will not stake out such a large lead in the multimedia business. **********Microsoft has already developed a series of similiar extensions for Windows, its program that offers Macintosh-like graphics and mouse control for I.B.M. PC-compatible computers. At the Comdex show, Microsoft said it would make the extensions a standard part of the next version of its Windows program, due to be shipped early next year. **********In addition, the Tandy Corporation and other PC makers have announced specialized personal computers that are designed to support the new multimedia standards. **********According to Doug Camplejohn, Apple's product manager for Quicktime, the company's advantage is that there are several million Macintoshes that can now run Quicktime applications off the shelf. To run multimedia applications in the I.B.M. PC-compatible world, it is necessary either to purchase a specialized multimedia personal computer or to obtain an upgrade kit to run applications stored on CD-ROM. **********\"It's not clear yet who will win,\" said Rob Lippincott, director of product development for the Lotus Development Corporation's multimedia products group. \"But Apple appears to have the better design. It's a complete system rather than a set of extensions.\" **********It appears that International Business Machines is acknowledging the power of Apple's approach. Quicktime was apparently a key ingredient in the formation of one of the two joint ventures between I.B.M. and Apple that were announced last month. Apple has licensed Quicktime to the Kaleida venture to develop consumer-based multimedia applications. **********Quicktime consists of a series of components: a movie \"toolbox\" that provides users with ready-made software functions for creating, editing and playing back digitized movies on a computer screen; an image-compression manager to create a standard way of connecting movies and other kinds of data, and a \"component manager\" that offers a standard way of connecting peripheral devices like digitizer cards and cameras. **********Like other important projects at Apple, Quicktime began as an experiment, said Roger Heinen, Apple's vice president for system software. \"We were experimenting with digital signal processors, and a couple of engineers decided that they could do much of what we were trying to do in software,\" he said. **********As a result, Quicktime offers graphics capability even for the least powerful color Macintosh. Because of its modular design, it permits the addition of a variety of hardware-based image compression technologies, including industry standards developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and the Motion Picture Experts Group. **********The flexibility of the Quicktime standard was demonstrated last week when the New Video Corporation, based in Venice, Calif., introduced an add-in compression board for the Macintosh based on DVI, a compression technology that was originally developed for I.B.M.-compatible computers. **********A Macintosh without a compression hardware accelerator will generally be capable of playing movies only at 12 frames a second in a small window measuring 160 by 120 pixels, which are dot-sized \"picture elements.\" New Video's DVI card, however, will play movies with full stereo sound running at 30 frames a second on full screens up to 16 inches. **********But other breakthrough video applications do not need special compression technology. Farallon Inc., a telecommunications company in Emeryville, Calif., is developing a data-teleconferencing program based on Quicktime. **********Currently, Farallon publishes a Macintosh program called Timbuktu, which permits one PC to control and view programs running on a remote system via either an office network or over telephone lines. A future version of the program will include a video teleconferencing feature. Inexpensive cameras can be used to display a small image on the remote computer screen. **********The most widespread use of Quicktime is likely to be in digital video products that will permit editing of video and sound information as simply as text and other data are edited on personal computers. **********For example, Adobe Inc. is preparing to introduce Premier, a digital video system originally developed by Supermac Technology Inc. It includes a video capture, playback and compression system as well as a digital-video editor designed to work with Quicktime. Applied to video images, it enables a minute of digital video data to be reduced from about 1,700 megabytes of storage space to less than 85 megabytes. **********Systems like Adobe's will dramatically change the way video is used. Cutting, pasting and manipulating images in motion will become standard personal computer operations. **********For example, to demonstrate the power of Quicktime, Mr. Heinen had a video of himself riding a bicycle edited into the final sprint of the Tour de France. In the resulting video, Mr. Heinen won. **********\"What will happen when all of our video archives begin to go digital?\" asked Mr. Camplejohn. **********The challenge will be to explore the new medium and gain a better understanding of its potential, a process that has been repeated with other new media in the past. \"When television was invented, people were reading radio scripts in front of TV's,\" Mr. Camplejohn said. \"It will be interesting to see how people will take advantage of Quicktime.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/18/world/all-eyes-on-cuba-at-ibero-american-summit.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Uhlig", "pub_date": "1991-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 510, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "All Eyes on Cuba at Ibero-American Summit", "print_headline": "All Eyes on Cuba at Ibero-American Summit", "body_text": " **********Setting aside his domestic troubles for two days in the diplomatic limelight, President Fidel Castro of Cuba is to make a rare foreign appearance at an international summit conference here this week, seeking to shore up regional support for his Government. **********The first Ibero-American Summit Conference, which will bring together leaders from 21 Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries on Thursday and Friday, has been billed as an important new vehicle for regional cooperation and economic integration.

The Georgia-Pacific Corporation, the forest-products giant, waged a successful $5 billion battle for the Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation in 1990. And Groupe Schneider S.A. of France is still pursuing its hostile $78-a-share bid for the Square D Company. **********\"The fly-by-night operators who got into takeovers because the market bubbled have disappeared,\" said Joseph Flom, a partner with the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher & Flom. \"Now the companies that are well heeled are in the act. With A.T.&T. successful, a lot of other companies will say that it is respectable to do strategic hostile deals.\" **********Unlike the fast-paced 1980's, when a takeover offer was often merely the opening volley of a war among multiple bidders, no competitor to A.T.&T. ever emerged in the NCR fight. And the NCR Corporation was left without many of the defensive refinancing techniques common in recent years. **********The reason: the collapse in the junk bond market, which fed many huge takeovers in the 1980's. That, combined with the increasing capital problems of the nation's banks, has meant that only the best of the blue chips have access to the capital needed for a large buyout. **********Some loan routes \"have been closed off,\" said Samuel Hayes 3d, a professor of investment banking at Harvard. \"The opportunities for effecting the classic leveraged buyout restructuring is very unfavorable, with the well-capitalized companies now coming to the fore.\" **********In the NCR deal, those financial difficulties had significant meaning, even though no junk bond financing was involved. Potential competitors could not hope to have the access to capital that the telephone giant had. At the same time, NCR could not use the junk market to raise money to pay shareholders a large dividend as a counter to A.T.& T.'s offer. And those limitations give any corporate bidder much more certainty about how an offer might progress. **********\"In the 1990's, one of the things that we have seen is a lack of competition for the deals,\" said Arthur Fleischer, a partner with the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. And with the large defenses put in place by companies in the 1980's to limit their attractiveness, any takeover battle now is likely to resemble the five months of talks between A.T.& T. and NCR: drawn-out and frustrating. **********\"You will have the takeover serenade, which because of the 'poison pill' defenses will go on for months,\" Mr. Fleischer said. \"So the music will tend to get tedious.\" **********This is not the first time that the collapse of a market has brought the large strategic buyers out of the woodwork. Indeed, many lawyers, investment bankers and academics say that the small stream of strategic takeovers is a rerun of the early 1970's. **********In the years before then, from 1966 to 1969, the so-called conglomerateurs snapped up corporate properties in the largest takeover wave before the 1980's. In many deals, warrants and convertible securities -- derided at the time as \"funny money\" -- were used to get the money to pay the ever-increasing prices the companies were fetching. **********But a severe downturn of the stock market in 1970 and a rationing of credit by banks cut the conglomerateurs off from the financing for deals, putting takeovers on the back burner. After the shakeout, in 1973, well-capitalized companies, including International Nickel, International Paper, and others, came into the hostile-deal market, using their strong position to try strategic purchases. **********\"What you had in 1973 was the development of strategic acquisitions,\" said Mr. Flom, the lawyer. \"And that is exactly what we are seeing today. But now, the respectability quotient of making a hostile deal is higher than it was then, and with a company like A.T.& T. in a hostile deal, that respect is going to grow even more.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/14/business/company-news-travelers-cutback.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Travelers Cutback", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Travelers Cutback", "body_text": " **********The Travelers Corporation will eliminate 93 jobs and create 39 new ones over the next few months in a realignment of field offices, the company said.

That is usually what bankers do. Theodore H. Silbert, at 86 perhaps the country's oldest active banker, knows that. Bankers are supposed to loan money. But Ted Silbert is rattled easily. Which is why for quite a few years the bank he runs has clung furiously to so many of its dollars. **********Mr. Silbert is the chairman of Sterling Bancorp, which has as its principal business the Sterling National Bank & Trust Company of New York, one of the city's tiniest and more mysterious banks. In these parlous days for the banking business, it also appears to be one of the steadiest. It likes to call attention to its \"fortress\" balance sheet, constructed on being wary of giving anybody money. Featured in the window of its main office on 55th Street and Madison Avenue is a large poster bragging about how the bank has no leveraged buyout loans, how all but $312,000 of its real estate loans are current, and how the bad loans amount to a preposterously low one-seventh of 1 percent of all loans. **********\"We are an example of a place willing to sacrifice earnings for several years in order to build up a secure bank,\" Mr. Silbert said. **********A conservative strategy for a bank may seem just right -- especially when one thinks about how those banks that indulged in huge-risk lending in the 1980's have suffered. But depending on how the bank invests its money, it can also be damaging. During the 80's, Sterling planted a lot of money in short-term government securities, because it thought other banks were dangling loans at very low rates to risky customers. Interest rates shot up and, though the bank itself remained profitable, Sterling Bancorp wound up saddled with its first loss ever -- a $7.9 million deficit in 1989 -- partly a result of settling a long-running tax dispute. Had it lent the money instead, analysts figure the opposite might have happened. **********But a one-time loss beats a portfolio of delinquent mortgages. And now, with credit tight, Sterling is eager to make loans (though make sure your credit rating is impeccable). At a time when large and small banks are reeling from flawed loans and a sagging economy, the quirky Sterling finds itself in an unusual situation. In days of tight credit, it wants to lend money. And since a long-time core business of the bank has been funding bankrupt companies, it finds its expertise in that area could not be more timely. **********\"We would like to lend more money than we're lending,\" Mr. Silbert said. \"But we don't want to make bad loans. There are many applicants where the money would go down a sinkhole. We are in the very envious position of having money to lend and not having enough people to lend to.\" **********Finding good borrowers who want money, though, is not a cinch in this economy, and Sterling's growth strategy may not work as well as it anticipates. In the first quarter of this year, Sterling's earnings dropped more than 40 percent, largely, it says, because it couldn't find enough of the right borrowers. What's more, John Millman, the president of Sterling Bank, cautions that more of the bank's real estate loans may sour as the year proceeds. \"There is clearly more deterioration in the real estate industry,\" he said. Still, the bank remains sanguine that its fresh personnel will round up more business during the balance of the year. **********Jerome Fischer, an analyst at Value Line, expects the company's profits to roughly equal the $1.9 million it earned last year, despite a tough environment. Last year was a notable improvement over 1989 (since there weren't the sizable investment losses), but well shy of the $5.2 million profit in 1988. **********\"They should service the middle-market customers turned away from other banks,\" Mr. Fischer said. \"Sterling has a tremendous capital base that's not being fully utilized.\" **********Sterling is the very picture of an old-fashioned bank. It opened in the inauspicious year of 1929, when the events foreshadowing the Depression were proving especially bothersome to banking. The bank has just five branches, two in Queens and three in Manhattan. Capital totals about $86 million, a tiny fraction of the banking behemoths of Manhattan (though more than most of America's banks). **********In its earlier days, Sterling had many conventional individual depositors and lent heavily to the garment industry. But about 10 years ago, the bank became largely a \"wholesale\" institution. It caters to midsized businesses, but doesn't pursue individual depositors seeking auto loans and checking accounts. Nonetheless, Sterling does accept people with substantial net worths. If you want to bank at Sterling, it would be good to deposit at least $100,000. Your net worth ought to be in the neighborhood of $1 million to $5 million. **********Everything about Sterling and its relentlessly conservative strategy is an outgrowth of Theodore Silbert. He is a study in patience. \"Banking is like war,\" he said. \"You have to expect to get hit by shrapnel. But you don't want any fatal wounds.\" **********Despite his advanced age, Mr. Silbert can't restrain himself from presiding over the bank's major decisions. His years of experience, he points out, have instilled in him four precepts of management: \"You must organize, deputize, supervise -- and then you wind up doing it yourself.\" **********Capable of avuncular charm, Mr. Silbert has thin white hair, flinty eyes and a craggy face. His voice is like a rolling timpani. His age has not stolen his lucidity, and though he is still kinetic, he's slightly wobbly on his feet. He is also extremely well paid, earning $456,00 in cash and deferred compensation last year. **********On a soporific day, Mr. Silbert sat in a stiff-backed chair at the head of a long table to preside over the daily executive meeting. Each executive briefly addressed activities in his area, and Mr. Silbert had comments for everyone. There is no muffled reserve about him. The head of personnel reported on some recent hirings. \"Interesting,\" Mr. Silbert said. \"Five or six years ago, we did our planning about downsizing  [ as Sterling became more of a wholesale bank ] , and now we're hiring when everyone else is downsizing. I hope we know what we're doing.\" **********Another executive spoke about an involvement with a community organization. \"You better make sure they're not building a little bureaucracy with our and other banks' money,\" Mr. Silbert said. \"Check them out very carefully. There's a great opportunity for racketeers to start bleeding banks. Check them out.\" **********Midway through the meeting, the phone trilled; it was Mr. Silbert's wife. **********\"I can't talk to her now,\" Mr. Silbert said. \"I want to get through this meeting.\" **********The executive conveyed the message: \"She said she's at the airport.\" **********\"I know,\" Mr. Silbert said. \"I can't talk to her now. Later. Later.\" **********In essence, Mr. Silbert has structured his entire life to carefully husband money. He was born in 1904 in Boston. His parents were professional entertainers who worked in vaudeville and on radio. He never acquired a college degree, and in his early working days held a number of cashier and other odd jobs in and around the theater. **********But he didn't like the way his parents and other theater people frittered away money. Money would come in, and after the most temporary of residences, out it would go. \"I reacted violently against that,\" he says. \"What was more important to my parents was a round of applause than a good savings account.\" **********Banking struck him as the ideal profession to enter. His first real job was as a lending officer at the Broadway Bank in New York. In 1934, he founded his own factoring firm, the Standard Financial and Standard Factors Corporation (which would eventually become Sterling Bancorp) with $1,000. He paid himself $50 a week. In 1968, he bought Sterling National Bank, which then had $25.5 million in capital, and soon after changed the name of the parent company to Sterling Bancorp. **********The younger employees at Sterling don't like to talk too much about age, but age counts at Sterling. Mr. Silbert prefers to be counseled by people with experience. For instance, Ezra Denerstein, the vice chairman, is 72 years old. For some years, Mr. Silbert has liked to keep a coterie of consulting bankers and influential individuals, known as the Senior Citizens Advisory Committee, whose cumulative number of years in banking at any given time might be 300 or 400 years, enough to know what's what. Their main function is to offer advice and tutor younger bank employees who may be a mere 55 or 60 years old. **********To staff this senior citizens committee, Mr. Silbert has a standing offer to all retired bankers, and other older and wiser individuals, to sign up. At some junctures, the committee had six or seven members, but the very nature of its entrance requirement has an unfortunate thinning effect: participants keep passing away. At the moment, the committee consists only of Abraham Beame, the former New York mayor. **********Solid experience is a characteristic of Sterling's board of directors, too. Of the dozen members, only John Millman is embarrassingly young -- 48. The next youngest director is 60. Five of them are in their 80's. **********Recently, Mr. Silbert has given more thought to succession. Three youthful executives were recently hired: Leonard Rudolph, 42, from Bank Hapoalim, John Aloisio, 48, from Citibank and Gerald Levine, 39, from Manufacturers Hanover. Mr. Rudolph and Mr. Aloisio are middle-market specialists, while Mr. Levine is focusing on high net-worth individuals. \"These guys came from the banks that got Sterling into trouble by giving low rates,\" Mr. Millman says. \"Now they're helping us. The enemy is now ours.\" **********The trio is viewed as Sterling's future leaders. As Mr. Denerstein put it, \"Sooner or later Mr. Silbert and I will have to put an end to this. You've got to give the younger people a chance.\" STERLING STICKS ITS NECK OUT **********One of Sterling National Bank's core businesses is funding companies in bankruptcy. Theodore Silbert, Sterling's chairman, has been one of the pioneers of financing for companies operating under protection of the bankruptcy laws, an area known as debtor-in-possession financing. **********Last year, Sterling said its financing of hobbled companies rose 15 percent, accounting for about 10 percent of its business, and it anticipates similar growth this year. **********Such financing is not as risky as it sounds, if the loans are made to companies given a good chance of recovery, since the bank has the first call on assets after professionals like lawyers and accountants. \"It's as safe as Treasury securities,\" Mr. Silbert said. **********And it pays better. \"The fees are higher than normal because there are fewer players,\" says Louis Cappelli, who oversees this area for Sterling. **********So far, Sterling has helped companies like the Interstate Stores Corporation, Botany 500 Menswear, Seatrain Lines, Penn-Dixie Industries and the Lionel Corporation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/13/world/gulf-security-talks-stall-over-plan-for-saudi-army.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick Tyler", "pub_date": "1991-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1852, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gulf Security Talks Stall Over Plan for Saudi Army", "print_headline": "Gulf Security Talks Stall Over Plan for Saudi Army", "body_text": " **********WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 -- **********Seven months after the end of the war in the Persian Gulf, the United States negotiations with Saudi Arabia over a new security alliance for the vital oil-producing area are deadlocked by a dispute over the future size and strength of the Saudi armed forces, United States and allied officials say. **********For the first time, the Saudis want to supplement their sophisticated air defense system with an offensive army capable of large-scale, mobile warfare like that demonstrated by allied forces against Iraq earlier this year, those officials say. **********But such a transformation would require a huge infusion of American weaponry and training, a step that would alter the military balance in the Middle East and would lead to a bruising fight with Israel and its supporters in Congress, who already are reeling from a confrontation with the White House over loan guarantees. **********The officials say that while the Bush Administration is committed to insuring the Saudis' long-term security, it is not ready to invest the enormous political capital that would be needed to transform the Saudi armed forces. **********But the issue is being handled with delicacy because the Bush Administration is counting on the Saudis to play a visible role in promoting a Middle East peace conference and taking part in the multilateral talks with Israel after the opening of the conference. **********Since the end of the war, the United States has been trying to substantially increase its military presence in the Persian Gulf. Plan Was Scaled Back **********In April, the Pentagon sought support within the Bush Administration for a new security plan that included positioning, mostly in Saudi Arabia, a huge stockpile of American armor, enough to equip 150,000 soldiers fighting as a corps-level force of three divisions and a large logistical organization to move them, the same way NATO forces are structured in Europe. **********But that plan was scaled back dramatically in interagency meetings after the State Department argued that such an ambitious military undertaking would effectively turn Saudi Arabia into an American military base, an action that the conservative Muslim monarchy would oppose because it would undermine the country's own military ambitions and because it would incite a reaction of Arab nationalists and Islamic fundamentalists. **********Also, such a major step, other Administration officials argued, would draw significant opposition in Congress, where there have been increasingly loud calls for restraint in arms sales and support for the Middle East peace process. **********The Bush Administration and Saudi officials have sought to play down the dispute, and experts in United States-Saudi relations insist that the close wartime relations between Riyadh and Washington remain strong, with both sides committed to protecting Saudi Arabia's oil reserves and limiting the regional power of Iran and Iraq. **********But the officials say the postwar demands on both sides have put a significant strain on the countries' relationship and all but frozen the plan to provide credible deterrent forces on the Arabian peninsula. **********A reconstruction of American-Saudi security negotiations since the war, based on interviews with American and allied officials, indicates that: ***********Saudi Arabia has refused since June to accept Pentagon plans to place an American Army division worth of tanks and heavy weapons in Saudi Arabian depots without a commitment from Washington to produce a detailed survey of Saudi military needs that, in the Saudi view, should then pave the way for the transformation of the Saudi Army. ***********Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, has declined to meet with the State Department's chief negotiator on the issue, Richard A. Clarke, the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs. Saudi officials now perceive Mr. Clarke's negotiating strategy as one that would lock in a weapons-positioning agreement without making a specific commitment to upgrade Saudi ground forces. Mr. Clarke's efforts to meet with Saudi officials have been repeatedly rebuffed since June, and during a tour of Persian Gulf capitals later this month, he is planning to bypass Saudi Arabia. ***********Pentagon officials have been forced to defer their plan, announced in April, to put a \"forward headquarters element\" of the Central Command on shore in the gulf after Saudi officials expressed their concern that such a high-profile step would inflame sensitivities over a United States ground presence in the region. ***********Saudi officials have refused to enshrine any new defense cooperation agreement with Washington with a \"memorandum of understanding\" like the one Kuwait signed last month. Though the Saudis have said privately that they would undertake new military cooperation under certain conditions, their unwillingness to publicly acknowledge coordination with Washington after the war has added to the tone of ambivalence in the relationship. U.S. Focal Point: Weapons Stockpile **********Another element of confusion arose last month, when King Fahd removed the well-known Saudi war commander, Khalid bin Sultan, who was deeply involved in postwar planning for his Government. American and allied officials said Prince Khalid was retired by royal decree after he demanded a promotion to chief of staff of Saudi armed forces in a direct communication to the King, outside the chain of command that goes through Prince Khalid's father, the Minister of Defense. **********Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, returning from a tour of Arab capitals in the Persian Gulf in May, said he had reached general understandings with Saudi Arabia and other Arab governments about storing American military equipment in those countries, along with agreements to hold joint exercises. **********Mr. Cheney's initial postwar soundings paved the way for detailed negotiations by Mr. Clarke's State Department team. In four months of talks, the negotiations have produced some progress with the smaller Arab countries, including a formal defense cooperation accord signed with Kuwait. **********Even Saudi Arabia quickly agreed to provide more port access for the American Navy and more ground support for the American Air Force. But the centerpiece of the security plan first envisioned by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the allied commander during the war, was the deployment of a United States Army stockpile. **********On this critical issue, the negotiations have broken down. **********But an aide to Mr. Cheney confirmed this week that \"the Saudis have never given an answer\" to repeated American requests to create the strategic stockpile in three areas of guarded depot storage in Saudi Arabia. In a specific change in tone from Mr. Cheney's assessment in May, the spokesman said, \"I don't know that our expectations were ever very high over pre-positioning\" in Saudi Arabia. Riyadh's Goal: High-Tech Army **********A key indication of the emerging attitude was Saudi insistence that the Pentagon undertake a \"security review\" of Saudi ground forces that was promised by senior Bush Administration officials, including Mr. Cheney, shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. During the summer, the Pentagon sent a team headed by Maj. Gen. Dennis Malcor of the Army to Saudi Arabia and General Malcor's report was completed in draft form in August. **********The Pentagon's production of that study was said to have caught State Department officials by surprise and was regarded by Mr. Clarke as an attempt by the Pentagon and Saudi officials to possibly delay or forestall his negotiations. In one meeting described by two different officials, Mr. Clarke angrily demand a copy of the Pentagon study, but General Malcor refused to supply it until Mr. Cheney has approved the document, officials said. **********Mr. Clarke declined a request for an interview on the negotiations. **********Subsequently, the State Department drafted a formal diplomatic note to the Saudis requesting action on the weapons-placement negotiations, but the Pentagon has blocked the sending of the letter, officials said. **********Senior Bush Administration officials understand that the commitment sought by the Saudis to transform their military would require new and large-scale American arms sales to the monarchy, including M1-A2 Abrams tanks, Bradley armored fighting vehicles, tank-killing Apache helicopters and a score of battlefield weapons, communications and intelligence systems. **********It would also require beefing up the United States military training mission in Saudi Arabia to a full time staff of more than 1,000 people, one allied official said. **********For King Fahd and the Saudi royal family, the risks of delaying new security arrangements appear to be acceptable since the Saudis see no immediate threat from President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, at least no threat that the formidable American and Saudi air and naval forces still in the area cannot deal with. **********In an interview, the Saudi Ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar, said he had \"never seen the relationship healthier\" between Washington and Riyadh. **********But at the same time, Prince Bandar said the two countries would continue to pursue their interests, and he indicated that when those are in conflict, Saudi Arabia for now prefers a course of delay rather than confrontation. U.S.-Saudi Ties: Uncertain Future **********Paul D. Wolfowitz, the Pentagon's Undersecretary for Policy, declined to directly comment on the problems in the American-Saudi negotiations. **********\"We'd all like things to move faster,\" he said. \"But the most important thing is that they keep moving, and moving in the right direction and I think that's happening.\" **********The unresolved questions about the future of Saudi-American military cooperation erupted during September and threatened to abort or delay allied efforts to challenge Iraqi behavior. **********For months, the United States had pledged that before any new military action against Iraq launched from Saudi soil, the United States would re-deploy Patriot anti-missile batteries in the kingdom to protect Saudi cities from possible Scud missile retaliation. **********But in its haste to draw down American forces in Saudi Arabia, the United States military had disassembled and crated all of the Patriot batteries sent to Saudi Arabia during the war. **********Many of the crates had been loaded onto United States transport ships and could not be retrieved without weeks of searching. That forced Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to cut into the last reserve of Patriot forces in Europe and also forced American officials to haggle with the Saudis over whether one Patriot battalion could do the job (General Powell's position) or three battalions (the Saudi position). The compromise was two battalions. **********When Iraq objected to unfettered United Nations helicopter flights over its territory, President Bush authorized the deployment of attack helicopters and warplanes to Saudi Arabia to escort airborne U.N. teams hunting for secret weapons sites in Iraq. **********But officials insisted that the operation be spread out so as not to appear to be an exclusively Saudi-American military venture. They suggested setting up a support base in Kuwait or inside Iraq. **********Then President Bush shifted course. When General Powell suggested a course of punitive bombing raids against Iraq. Pentagon planning began to deploy 3,000 U.S. troops and up to 100 additional allied war planes to Saudi Arabia, but Saudi officials questioned the plan. **********During meetings last week involving Prince Bandar, Mr. Cheney, General Powell and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Saudi and American officials were said to have agreed to continue refining contingency plans to mount punitive raids against Iraq."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/29/business/fiat-owners-seek-diversity-in-bid-for-french-company.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1991-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 834, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fiat Owners Seek Diversity In Bid for French Company", "print_headline": "Fiat Owners Seek Diversity In Bid for French Company", "body_text": " **********In one of its biggest diversification moves outside of Italy, the Agnelli family, which controls the Fiat automobile group, began a takeover bid today for Exor S.A. That French holding company owns big stakes in Perrier, the bottled water company, and Chateau Margaux, the elite Bordeaux wine maker. **********In a communique today, officials of the Paris Bourse announced that an Agnelli holding company was offering $326 million for 1.36 million shares of Exor, which would raise the Agnellis' holdings to two-thirds of the Paris-based company. **********Earlier this year, Ifi International, the Agnellis' Luxembourg-based holding company that is making the bid, acquired a 21.8 percent stake in Exor. When the Mentzelopoulos family, which controls Exor, agreed this week to sell the Agnellis enough additional shares to raise their stake to more than 33 percent, the Agnellis were required by French stock exchange rules to make a tender offfer for a two-thirds stake. **********A senior Exor official said his company considered the Agnellis' offer a friendly one. **********Exor has a market capitalization of close to $1 billion. Its holdings include more than a dozen prime office buildings in Paris and a 3 percent stake in Banque Indosuez, the French investment banking empire. **********Exor controls 35 percent of the shares of Source Perrier S.A. and 40 percent of its voting rights. The chairman of Exor, Jacques Vincent, is also chairman of Perrier. **********With the bid, Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman of Fiat S.p.A., Italy's largest industrial group, gave his strongest signal yet that his family was expanding outside Italy and the auto industry. Revenue From Italy **********Paul Dionne, an analyst with Pasfin, a Milan-based stock brokerage, said the diversification made sense because some 60 percent of the Agnellis' automobile revenues come from Italy. **********Analysts said the Agnellis' moves were not surprising considering that Italy, which is plagued by deficits, faces rough economic times. Furthermore, it will soon eliminate its severely restrictive quotas on Japanese car imports. **********The announcement today was the second major development this week involving Italy's most powerful and most closely watched family. On Sunday, Mr. Agnelli, who is 70 years old, confirmed what had long been believed when he said his younger brother, Umberto, who is Fiat's vice chairman, would succeed him. The elder Agnelli did not specify a date for the change. **********According to the Paris Bourse, Ifint is offering 1,320 francs, or $240 a share, for Exor. That represents a premium of 23 percent over the price of 1,070 francs at which Exor was trading when it was suspended on Wednesday. In trading in Paris today, Exor shares closed at 1,302 francs. **********Several analysts said that the Agnellis' offer might face some antitrust scrutiny. Another Agnelli holding company, Ifil, owns a 5.8 percent stake in BSN, which is France's largest food company. BSN, the arch-rival of Perrier, markets Badoit and Evian mineral waters and has a larger share of France's bottled water market than Perrier. **********In addition, the Agnellis and BSN have formed a joint venture that has become the largest food company in Italy. That venture owns Ferrarelle, Italy's largest bottled water company, as well as extensive interests in cheese, pasta and beer. **********Pierre Martinet, an assistant to Exor's chairman, said that despite such links, BSN would have no say in how Perrier was run. **********Sylvain Massot, a food industry analyst for Morgan Stanley in London, saw no conflicts. \"My feeling is that as long as Perrier and BSN are run separately and remain competitors, there should be no antitrust problem,\" he said. **********Mr. Massot said the Agnelli offer seemed attractive because it offered a substantial premium over Exor's recent stock price. But he noted that the offer of 1,320 francs was well below the 2,000 francs Exor shares reached in 1990. **********Exor's stock has been hit hard by the depresssed Paris real estate market and the slump in Perrier stock, which resulted from the dive in Perrier sales after the discovery last year of benzene in its bottles. **********Some analysts suggested that the Agnellis' timing was shrewd, saying it was only a matter of time before Paris real estate prices and Perrier profits picked up. **********As for the Mentzelopoulos family, analysts said they reduced their 30 percent stake in Exor because they wanted to further diversify their holdings. **********Many analysts said the price of Exor's pieces far exceeded the $820 million capitalization it had before the Agnelli offer and the $992 million capitalization at today's closing stock price. **********One analyst said Exor's Perrier holdings were worth $730 million, its real estate holdings were worth $635 million, its Chateau Margaux holdings, $180 million, and its Indosuez shares, $164 million. **********As part of their diversification efforts, Agnelli-controlled companies have acquired a 6.4 percent stake in Saint Louis, a leading French food processing company, and a 6 percent stake in Alcatel-Alsthom, the giant French telecommunications and electric equipment company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/21/world/us-planning-1.5-billion-in-food-aid-to-soviet-peoples-through-moscow.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1991-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1235, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Planning $1.5 Billion in Food Aid To Soviet Peoples Through Moscow", "print_headline": "U.S. Planning $1.5 Billion in Food Aid To Soviet Peoples Through Moscow", "body_text": " **********Amid rising concern about possible hunger and civil unrest in the Soviet Union this winter, the Bush Administration announced today that it would send about $1.5 billion worth of food aid, most of which would be channeled through the central Government in Moscow. **********The announcement, which followed weeks of delay, included the first large-scale American shipments of free food to the Soviet Union in seven decades. **********The action is part of a broadening Western effort to help the Soviet Union. The United States has already given $2.5 billion worth of food credits in the last 11 months, almost all of which has been delivered. Japan, the European Community and individual Western European countries have made separate pledges of aid in recent months, but so far have delivered very little. **********All of these aid efforts are driven by concerns of food shortages and the possible collapse of new democratic institutions in the Soviet Union this winter. But these efforts are complicated by weakening economies and growing government budget deficits across much of the industrialized world, particularly in the United States. Farm States Back Aid **********The aid package announced today is distinct from discussions in Congress over whether to use $1 billion from the military budget to help the Soviet Union. The announcement today is linked only indirectly to negotiations in Moscow concerning ways to help the Soviet Union with its foreign debt, variously estimated at $60 billion to $100 billion. **********Congressional reaction today was divided on regional rather than party lines, with legislators from farm states favoring more aid and other legislators tending to worry that existing aid may already be excessive. **********Representative David R. Nagle, an Iowa Democrat on the Agriculture Committee, said in a telephone interview that the Administration's aid plan today was \"too little, too late\" and added, \"We haven't given them enough to get through a couple weeks.\" **********But Representative Charles E. Bennett, the Florida Democrat who is vice chairman of the Armed Services Committee, criticized the deal for not requiring the Soviet Union to barter or sell oil or other natural resources in exchange for food. \"The U.S. taxpayer shouldn't have to give a charitable gift if the Russians have the wherewithal,\" to buy the grain, Mr. Bennett said in a telephone interview. Rationing in St. Petersburg **********In another indication of Soviet food shortages, Anatoly Sobchak, the Mayor of St. Petersburg, announced today that all types of food would be rationed beginning on Dec. 15 because the city has been receiving only half the food it needs, Reuters reported from Moscow, citing local journalists. Some American officials have worried for weeks that urban areas will suffer first from hunger this winter because farmers are refusing to sell their crops for rapidly devaluing rubles. **********Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan told reporters at the White House today that the United States would guarantee $1.25 billion worth of commercial bank loans for the purchase of American grain, and would provide $165 million worth of free food, mainly through private voluntary organizations. **********The Agriculture Department is negotiating with the United Way, CARE, World Vision Relief and the Seventh-day Adventists to distribute the food, said a department official who insisted on anonymity. **********In addition, a much smaller but still undetermined amount of money will be used to build a model farm in the St. Petersburg area, construct model wholesale food markets near Moscow and Kiev, send American agricultural extension workers and provide credit guarantees for loans to private Soviet-American ventures in Soviet food processing and distribution, Mr. Madigan said. Helping U.S. Farmers **********The program will help American farmers and \"is aimed at alleviating food shortages and other dire humanitarian consequences in the Soviet Union this winter,\" Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said. Only the food grants and technical aid projects will result in direct outlays by the Federal Government, he pointed out. **********All of the credit guarantees will go to Vneshekonombank, the Soviet central bank for foreign trade. But each of the 12 remaining Soviet republics has also accepted responsibility for the debt's repayment if the central Government or the other republics are unable to do so, Mr. Madigan said. **********A detailed plan has been worked out for the amounts of food each republic will actually receive, Mr. Madigan added. The plan was intended to reassure conservatives who have warned that the central Government is not credit worthy and will use the threat of withholding food as a lever to compel the obedience from republics. **********These arrangements did not initially satisfy some conservative critics. **********\"This appears to be a thinly disguised scheme to continue U.S. taxpayer loan guarantees to a discredited Moscow center that is totally uncredit-worthy,\" said Roger W. Robinson Jr., who was the National Security Council's senior director for international economic affairs from 1982 to 1985. Issue of Credit Worthiness **********Federal law bars agricultural loan guarantees to countries that are not credit worthy. Mr. Madigan said that this rule was met by the agreement by the Soviet central Government, Vneshekonombank and the 12 republics to take responsibility for repayment. **********Some of the credit guarantees will only be available if the Soviet Union makes payments falling due soon on previous loans already guaranteed, Mr. Madigan said. **********The program announced today by Mr. Madigan calls for $500 million in credit guarantees to be made available immediately, followed by $250 million aid packages in February, March and April. **********A confidential Agriculture Department study has found that while the Soviet transportation system may be clogged with deliveries of European food in January and February, very little grain has been committed for delivery in December. Grain Shipment Scheduled **********The last grain from the most recent American assistance program, $1.5 billion in credit guarantees granted in June, is scheduled for shipment at the beginning of next month. If a new aid package had not been approved this week, some of this transportation capacity might have been wasted. **********Franklyn D. Holzman, professor emeritus of economics at Tufts University, said the Soviet Union had paid a small percentage of the cost of the food it received from the United States during World War II. The announcement today represents the first time that the United States Government has given free food to the Soviet Union since Herbert Hoover oversaw a $20 million program right after World War I, Mr. Holzman said. **********The bread lines and panic buying of food in the Soviet Union are the result of both production and distribution problems there, American officials say. Grain Production Drops **********The Agriculture Secretary said for the first time in Congressional testimony on Oct. 30 that while food distribution in the Soviet Union is a serious problem, a decline in grain production this year has also become a crucial factor in a substantial Soviet need for food imports this winter. **********Nearly two weeks later, on Nov. 12, the Agriculture Department reduced its estimate of this year's Soviet grain harvest to just 175 million metric tons. Last month the department estimated a crop of 185 million metric tons, and in August and September the prediction was 190 million metric tons. **********Soviet crops in recent years have been close to 200 million metric tons, while last year's near-record crop totaled 235 million metric tons."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/30/world/war-in-the-gulf-israel-israelis-say-their-patience-with-scud-attacks-is-thin.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1991-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 691, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: Israel; Israelis Say Their Patience With Scud Attacks Is Thin", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: Israel; Israelis Say Their Patience With Scud Attacks Is Thin", "body_text": " **********After several days of growing frustration over the slow pace of allied efforts to eliminate Iraq's Scud missile launchers, Israeli officials warned today that Israel may not wait much longer before it attacks. **********For the last 10 days, Israeli officials, heeding American calls for restraint, have said they would refrain from responding to the Iraqi missile attacks -- for the time being. But if the public statements of several senior officials over the last few days can be taken at face value, the Government's patience has about run out. **********An Israeli television interviewer offered a sentiment common among Israelis when he told Defense Minister Moshe Arens this eveniing: \"The Americans keep bombing launchers but haven't been terribly effective. Meanwhile, Americans are watching the Super Bowl, and Israelis are sitting in shelters and sealed rooms.\" **********Mr. Arens responded: \"The situation you described isn't going to continue -- not two months, and not a month. I simply estimate that a situation in which we'll be neutral or not active, and their ability to launch missiles against us isn't eliminated, it won't continue for a long time.\" Much of Nation Traumatized **********And in a meeting with a visiting French politician today, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is reported to have said that Israel wants to play an active role in the battle against Iraq but is constrained by limits imposed by the United States. Mr. Shamir said he hoped the limits would be lifted soon. **********Iraq has fired 26 missiles at Haifa or Tel Aviv on seven occasions over the last 12 days, killing four people and wounding nearly 200. More than 2,000 apartments have been seriously damaged or destroyed. Elementary schools remain closed because there are too few teachers to help children put on gas masks quickly when the missile alert sounds. **********Productivity in business and industry is off. Much of the nation is traumatized. For the first time, Israel is under attack and unable to respond. **********Some Israelis are beginning to blame the United States, and not just Iraq, because they believe Washington is preventing the Israeli Air Force from solving the missile problem. Confidence in Israeli Army **********As often happens here, Israelis seem to be of two minds about the United States. Most are grateful that the American military is aggressively attacking Israel's enemy, Saddam Hussein. But at the same time, Israelis have little respect for the American military while they maintain broad, and sometimes overblown, confidence in their army. **********A senior Government official said air force commanders had repeatedly told the Government's leaders during Cabinet meetings that they have the ability to seriously reduce or neutralize the Scud missile threat, if only they could be given the chance. **********Mr. Arens, in a meeting with American Jews visiting here this week, said Israel had precise information about where the Scud launchers are. But American and other allied leaders have repeatedly warned that Israel could seriously damage the anti-Iraq coalition if it decided to enter the war. **********In an American television interview on Sunday, Mr. Arens said, \"We think we could make a contribution to neutralizing that threat.\" But first, he said, \"we would have to arrive at a level of understanding and coordination with the U.S. and particularly with the U.S. Air Force operating in the area.\" Sharon Defies Shamir Order **********Asked if that meant Israel intended to act soon, Mr. Arens said that depended on whether the United States would agree. **********Trying to force the Government to speak in one voice, last week Mr. Shamir ordered all the ministers except Mr. Arens and Foreign Minister David Levy to keep their thoughts on the issue to themselves. **********That became too much for Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, who blurted out to reporters this morning that \"Israel is capable of stopping the attacks and can do it now.\" **********This evening, the former army chief of staff Mordechai Gur, now a senior Labor Party politician, said during a news conference that he thought Israel should carry out air strikes against the Iraqi missile launchers right away."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/21/business/l-two-cheers-for-consensus-370591.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two Cheers for Consensus", "print_headline": "Two Cheers for Consensus", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********Consensus management is a process for working through diversity towards a common objective.

But the decision, which would almost certainly worsen relations with Japan, was apparently put on hold later in the day after it was reported in the French press. **********The press accounts were based on statements made by Government officials on Thursday. But today, the Government of the new Prime Minister, Edith Cresson, who has long been a vocal critic of Japan, issued a statement saying it had not decided whether to bar the deal. It added that Mrs. Cresson's administration was studying the matter and would make a decision soon. **********The Government's apparent about-face from Thursday to Friday aroused speculation that Bull's chairman, Francis Lorentz, had threatened to resign unless the Government reconsidered its plan to bar the NEC deal, contending that such an action might violate longstanding accords between NEC and Bull. Change From Previous Stance **********The Prime Minister's move would reverse a decision by the former Industry Minister, Roger Fauroux, that would have allowed NEC to obtain a stake of up to 5 percent in Bull, a state-owned company that lost $1.2 billion last year. **********Le Monde, the Paris-based daily, and Les Echoes, a business journal, also reported that Mrs. Cresson wanted NEC to sell off its 15 percent stake in Bull HN, the corporate entity that owns Bull's international operations. NEC acquired that stake in 1987. **********As part of a corporate restructuring, Bull is planning to fold much of its international operations into the parent company. As part of that plan, NEC was going to swap its 15 percent stake in the international operations for a smaller stake in the parent company. Loss of Independence Feared **********Les Echoes wrote that Mrs. Cresson feared that NEC would nibble away at Bull's independence, slowly gaining a larger and larger share until it dominated the French enterprise. Mrs. Cresson and Bull executives have strongly criticized Britain's leading computer manufacturer, International Computers Ltd., for allowing itself to become dependent on Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer company. After obtaining technology from Fujitsu, International Computers last summer allowed Fujitsu to buy an 80 percent stake. **********Industry analysts said that if NEC was forced to divest itself of its stake in Bull's international operations, it would likely ask Bull to compensate it. But Bull is in severe financial difficulty after staggering losses last year. Indeed, the French Government is pumping $1 billion into Bull to help insure its survival and finance its research and development. **********The day after taking office, Mrs Cresson said: \"Europe has no response to the Japanese. I would love to see a response emerge.\" She added, \"It is inadmissible for Europe's defense and its industries to be totally dependent on the Japanese\" for electronics. Need for Technology Seen **********Some industry analysts say Bull needs sophisticated Japanese technology to remain competitive, but French officials say that could prove to be a trap in which Bull grows increasingly dependent on NEC and sees its in-house abilities atrophy. **********Computer experts said NEC would no doubt regard Mrs. Cresson's decision as a violation of previous agreements with the company. Complicating matters is the fact that NEC already makes Bull's largest mainframe computer. **********Seeking to become a more formidable competitor, Bull has in recent years acquired the computer businesses of Honeywell and of Zenith Electronics."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/04/business/company-news-ibm-of-britain-plans-to-cut-jobs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 137, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.B.M. of Britain Plans to Cut Jobs", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; I.B.M. of Britain Plans to Cut Jobs", "body_text": " **********The British unit of the International Business Machines Corporation plans to cut its work force by about 5 percent over the next two years as part of a strategic shift in its operations.

Gorbachev, which he said had begun at 12:19 P.M.

He said the Soviet President \"has certainly not been diminished by this at all.\" **********\"He will still be a force to be reckoned with,\" Mr. Bush told a group of reporters whom he called to his Walkers Point vacation home for his second news conference in less than two and a half hours. It capped a tumultuous day that began with restrained optimism after a phone call to Mr. Yeltsin and later included expressions of the President's \"delight.\" **********Before heading off for an afternoon round of golf in a chill drizzle, Mr. Bush reminded reporters of his \"respect for Gorbachev.\" **********Looking ahead, Mr. Bush said the vanquishing of the coup should change attitudes in the Soviet Union and abroad about the longevity of the reforms Mr. Gorbachev has undertaken. \"What will be filtered out will be the fear of a right-wing military takeover, because the people will see that the power of the people to stand up against this illegality is pretty good, pretty strong,\" Mr. Bush said. **********He also signaled that he might be more inclined to consider greater financial aid to Moscow in light of the events of the last few days. And his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said he believed that the vanquishing of the coup might also bolster public support for economic assistance to the Soviet Union and make American companies more willing to invest in that country.

Mr. Bush said he had told Mr. Gorbachev, \"as I've told Yeltsin, that we're ready to talk to the leaders of the republics and certainly we'll be ready to talk and deal with the President of the Soviet Union itself.\" **********While American officials said it was too early to draw sweeping conclusions, they suggested that the end of the coup could accelerate progress toward free-market policies, cement the Soviet Union's democratic reforms and radically alter the equation in the negotiations between Moscow and its constituent republics. **********An Administration official said the United States would have to walk a delicate line while Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev sort out their own relationship. 'A Very Courageous Individual' **********But Mr. Bush's admiration of Mr. Yeltsin was vividly apparent today. He referred to \"President Yeltsin\" repeatedly, and White House aides said Mr. Bush had been deeply affected by the televised scenes of Mr. Yeltsin's mounting a tank in Moscow to hurl his defiance at the Kremlin junta that seized power for three days. **********\"It leaves the world looking at him as a very courageous individual, duly elected by the people, standing firmly and courageously for democracy and freedom with enormous stature as a result of that,\" he said. **********Even Mr. Bush's response to a reporter who asked -- before Mr. Bush was able to speak to Mr. Gorbachev -- what message he would send to the Soviet President offered a subtle indication of the way the image of Mr. Yeltsin has changed in Mr. Bush's mind. **********Mr. Bush said: \"I would say: 'Stay with your principles. Stay with your reforms. Stay with your commitment to democratic process and constitutional law. Stand shoulder to shoulder with Yeltsin, as you have been, in seeing the evolution of democracy and perestroika and glasnost in the Soviet Union.' \" **********Mr. Bush said he was confident that there would not be a \"Gorbachev-versus-Yeltsin battle\" for power in the aftermath of the failed coup. \"I think he is properly and with feeling expressing himself in total support of Mr. Gorbachev,\" Mr. Bush said. **********A senior Administration official said Mr. Bush's attitude toward Mr. Yeltsin had undergone \"a fairly steady evolution ever since his first, ill-fated visit\" to the United States in 1989, when Mr. Bush refused to receive Mr. Yeltsin formally. White House aides recounted with some disdain the way Mr. Yeltsin simply turned up at the White House, refused to enter at first unless he saw Mr. Bush and then had to be cajoled into meeting with Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser. **********At the time, Mr. Yeltsin was an unelected politician and a prime irritant to Mr. Gorbachev, with whom Mr. Bush was doing important business. On Mr. Yeltsin's second visit, as President of the Russian republic, he was received in the Oval Office. **********\"His election impressed people here,\" the official said. **********He went on: \"Yeltsin was the first popularly elected leader of Russia in history and got an enormous mandate. People who are engaged in electoral politics themselves take that kind of thing very seriously.

The collapse of the high-yield \"junk bond\" market and problems throughout the capital markets steepened a decline in fees paid to investment banks to their lowest levels since 1984. **********For the year, corporations issued a record $315.9 billion in domestic securities, up 2.2 percent from the previous year's record of $309.1 billion, according to IDD Information Services, a New York research firm. **********The biggest underwriter for the third straight year was Merrill Lynch & Company. In 1988, Merrill moved past Salomon Brothers Inc., then the perennial leader in underwriting, and has been building a steady lead in the business ever since.  Merrill's Share at 17.6% **********Last year, Merrill underwrote $55.75 billion, taking 17.6 percent of the market, according to IDD. Goldman, Sachs & Company was second, underwriting $40.74 billion, for a 12.9 percent share through maintaining a strong focus on industrial issuers. Next came the First Boston Corporation and Salomon Brothers. The three firms that followed Merrill all lost market share last year. **********Despite the record number of issues, much of the capital was raised from debt securities. With the Dow Jones industrial average turning in one of its worst annual performances since 1981 and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait raising concerns among investors, new equity offerings fell. **********Indeed, 1990 was even worse for equity offerings than 1989, when the markets were unsettled by a 190-point plunge in the Dow. Common stock offerings fell last year to $19.2 billion, below the anemic amount of $23.2 billion in 1989, IDD said. Other equity securities, like convertible preferred securities, also experienced a drop in the amount issued.  Fewer First Offerings **********At the same time, the already poor market for initial public offerings became even worse. In 1990, only 209 such offerings took place, raising $10.1 billion, compared with 247 issues, raising $13.8 billion in the previous year. **********With less investor interest in the equity securities, virtually all types of debt securities increased sharply in their use to raise capital. One of the only exceptions was junk bonds, where the market collapsed early in the year. **********Moreover, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the market's biggest underwriter of junk bonds, sought bankruptcy protection last year. According to IDD, only $1.3 billion in junk bonds were issued in 1990, down by about 95 percent from the $24.8 billion raised the previous year. **********With the possibility of junk bond-financed takeovers more a memory than a threat, the appetite for investment-grade debt climbed. The issuance of such debt increased 15.5 percent last year, with corporations raising $286.2 billion, up from $247.6 billion in the previous year.  Asset-Backed Debt Up **********Among the biggest gainers in the debt market were asset-backed and mortgage-backed bonds. The asset-backed debt climbed to $40.4 billion in 1990, up 72 percent over the $23.4 billion raised in 1989. Debt backed by mortgages increased 20.7 percent, to $138.3 billion, up from the previous year's total of $114.6 billion. **********\"While 1990 was difficult, it was a good year for the new-issue debt business,\" said Edson Mitchell, managing director of Merrill's debt markets division. He added that at current rate levels he expected January to be \"a very active month for corporate issuance.\" **********One important factor that could stand in the way of corporations taking advantage of lower rates would be a flare-up of the tensions in the Middle East, the underwriters said. **********Fears of the events in the Persian Gulf led to a steep decline in the underwriting business in the fourth quarter of last year. The total amount of American corporate securities fell 14.7 percent in the fourth quarter, to $78.6 billion, compared with $92.1 billion in the 1989 period.  Fees Down 38.7% **********Despite the record amount of issuance, the fees garnered by Wall Street virtually collapsed in 1990. According to IDD, Wall Street firms disclosed fees of $1.9 billion, down 38.7 percent from the $3.1 billion in fees the previous year. The fee collapse largely resulted from the troubles in the junk bond market, where underwriting such securities had long been enormously profitable, as well as the troubles in the equity markets. The average fee earned on a transaction was $750,000, compared with $1 million in 1989, according to the Securities Data Company, a research firm. **********The leading firm in fees was Merrill Lynch, which disclosed $339.4 million last year, compared with $450.4 million in 1989. **********One surprise for the year was the performance of Kidder, Peabody & Company, which underwrote $21.43 billion in securities to place sixth and gain 6.8 percent of the market. That was up from $8.8 billion the firm issued in 1989, putting Kidder in 10th place, with 2.8 percent of the market. **********But despite the increase, Kidder disclosed only $40 million in fees, according to IDD, down from those the previous year of $48.2 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/16/business/credit-markets-notes-and-bonds-decline-in-price.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1991-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 653, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Notes and Bonds Decline in Price", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Notes and Bonds Decline in Price", "body_text": " **********The looming reality of war enveloped the credit markets yesterday, as prices of Treasury notes and bonds dipped after a report this afternoon that France had abandoned all hope that a peaceful resolution to the Persian Gulf crisis could be reached before midnight. **********A new French peace initiative had been mentioned on Monday and again yesterday morning.

Net earnings means self-employment income after the Keogh contribution. **********What makes the calculations particularly complicated for 1990 is a change in the self-employment taxes paid for Social Security and Medicare. In 1989, self-employed people paid at a 13.02 percent rate, giving them a break of two percentage points over the combined rate for employees and employers. For 1990, however, they must pay 15.3 percent, which matches the employee and employer contributions. Then they can deduct half of their self-employment tax, just as employers can deduct what they pay on behalf of employees. **********\"Some people may overlook the new self-employment tax deduction,\" Mr. Kess said, because it is on the front of the 1040, rather than on the Schedule C form for self-employment income, Schedule E for partnership income, or Schedule SE, which is used to calculate the self-employment tax. For 1990, the maximum deduction is $3,924.45 (half of 15.3 percent of the top wage base of $51,300).The important point is that the self-employment-tax deduction lowers the figure on which the Keogh contribution is based, so it too must be considered when calculating how much to contribute. **********\"People who fail to reduce self-employment income by the deduction for one-half of self-emplyment tax may overfund their Keoghs and be subject to penalty on excess contributions,\" Mr. Kess said. \"Then, too, if they attempt to correct the error by withdrawing the excess, they can incur a premature distribution penalty unless they are over age 59 1/2.\" **********Mr. Kess offered the following six-step worksheet for determining the allowable contribution for any type of Keogh plan, for those who do not also have salary income: **********1. Enter net profit from Schedule C, or in the case of partners, net self-employment earnings from Schedule K-1. **********2. If this figure equals or exceeds $55,550, subtract $3,924.45 from the amount in step 1. If it is less than $55,550, multiply the amount by 0.92935. **********3. Enter the nominal contribution percentage as a decimal (for instance, enter 0.25 for 25 percent). **********4. Multiply the amount in step 2 by the percentage in step 3. **********5. Add 1 to the percentage in step 3 (for instance, 0.25 plus 1, equaling 1.25). **********6. Divide the amount in step 4 by the amount in step 5. The result is the limit for a 1990 contribution. The rules will change for 1991 because of higher taxes. **********Joel S. Isaacson, a partner in Weber, Lipshie & Company, an accounting firm in New York, said people whose Keoghs were set up for the maximum allowed contribution could figure their 1990 amount in just one or two steps, depending on the type of Keogh plan they had. **********Contributions to a profit-sharing plan, which offers the flexibility to limit contributions in lean years, cannot exceed 15 percent of net self-employment income. For a money-purchase plan, to which contributions are required at a set percentage each year, the maximum is 25 percent. That is also the limit for a paired plan, which combines features of the two. **********Mr. Isaacson said those who earned less than $55,550 and had profit-sharing plans should multiply net income by 12.12191 percent. Above that amount, they should multiply earnings by 13.043 percent and subtract $512. For money-purchase plans, the percentage below $55,550 is 18.58704. Above, it is 20 percent of earnings less $785. **********In any case, the maximum allowed contribution is $30,000. **********Milton Pickman, a senior tax partner with Anchin, Block & Anchin, a New York accounting firm, says people who are employed but also have self-employment income often fail to realize that they are eligible for a Keogh plan, and thus do not set one up by Dec. 31. **********There is a way to recover, he noted. A simplified employee pension plan would allow these people to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Such a plan is essentially a large I.R.A. account, but it can be established, and contributions can be made, until the due date of the tax return.

But it takes the crucial first step of requiring the Commerce Department to identify the large array of underutilized Government frequencies that can be reassigned for commercial purposes. Support Grows **********Support for the measure, which passed the House last year but died in the Senate, appears to have increased significantly in recent months. The Senate Commerce Committee recently passed a similar measure, and House Democrats have succeeded in overcoming objections by Republicans. **********The Bush Administration, which opposed the measure last year out of concern over the national security implications of reassigning such a wide range of frequencies, now supports the general proposition. But it still contends that any legislation should require that new channels be allocated through an auction process to the highest bidder. House Democrats favor the use of comparative hearings, in which potential users would have to establish their relative merits over those of their rivals. **********But senior Republicans on the committee supported today's measure after Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee and a principal sponsor of the bill, committed himself to considering the entire process by which new frequencies should be allocated.  Move Called Crucial **********The new legislation would give the Secretary of Commerce two years to identify Government frequencies totaling 200 megahertz -- about four times the band width used by cellular telephone systems -- that can be allocated for new commercial uses. The Federal Communications Commission would then have 15 years to define the particular uses for each new frequency. **********To speed the development of technologies now ready for commercialization, the measure would also allow the Commerce Department to shift a much smaller group of frequencies within a year. **********Advocates of reassigning Government frequencies to commercial use contend that the move is crucial to the development of advanced communications technologies. \"This is a truth that to most people is self-evident,\" Mr. Markey said. If the legislation is not adopted, he said, American companies will lose the lead to those in Europe and Japan that have been quicker to set aside frequencies for these new technologies. \"Instead of blaming others, we'll be left pointing our fingers back at ourselves,\" he said. **********Assuming that the legislation can survive objections from the Administration, however, the process of reassigning frequencies will remain difficult and divisive. **********The Pentagon, the Department of Energy and the intelligence agencies, which are all significant communications users, have resisted giving up any of the frequencies they now control. Those objections are certain to make specific decisions by the Commerce Department difficult. **********The assignment of the new frequencies is likely to be slow and full of disputes as well. In the past, the F.C.C. has allocated frequencies through either comparative hearings, which often lead to long regulatory and legal battles, or, in the case of cellular telephone franchises, by lotteries. Although lotteries are quicker than comparative hearings, many critics have complained that lotteries merely lead to applications from speculators who resell the licenses that they win. **********Supporters of auctions contend that they are inherently more rational, in part because bidders will place a price on frequencies that comes closer than any other method to reflecting the commercial importance for different uses.

Push for Consumption **********Economic policy makers hope that lower rates will lead consumers to borrow and spend more and give the economy the jolt it needs to move cleanly out of recession. New data released today showed a sharp drop in retail sales and only a modest rise in prices in August.  [ Page 35. ] **********The Federal Reserve's actions had been so widely anticipated in the financial markets in light of recent economic data that stock prices fell, apparently reflecting the adage that traders buy on rumor and sell on fact. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 2,985.69, down 22.14 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent. Bond prices were off slightly.  [ Page 38. ] Action May Not Be Enough **********Many economists said the steps taken today might prove insufficient to stimulate an economy that is having trouble getting past the recession that began in mid-1990. In general, the recession was not nearly so deep as the one in the early 1980's. But the economy barely grew in the year before this latest recession began, and even if, as most economists now believe, the recession is over, the economy is virtually at a standstill. **********\"I sense a growing anxiety about the strength of this economic recovery,\" said Norman Robertson, chief economist of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. \"In many ways, the recovery is indistinguishable from the recession.\" **********Someone familiar with the thinking on the Federal Reserve Board said the central bank acted today in large part because of figures that came out on Thursday showing that the nation's money supply by the most common measurement fell last week. Growth in money this year is now below the Federal Reserve's target range. **********In addition, the data on retail sales reinforced the economic weakness recorded in other recent statistics like those on employment, automobile production and housing construction. **********And the policy makers apparently felt that the modest rise in consumer prices indicated that inflation was under control. The main argument against reducing rates is that doing so might lead to worse inflation. Timing the Fed's Action **********Another reason the Fed may have moved today is that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is going to Moscow next week to discuss economic reform with Soviet leaders, and the discount rate would not have been reduced in his absence. **********The Bush Administration, which has been pressing for lower rates to make the economy stronger as the Presidential election year approaches, expressed pleasure. \"It's good news,\" said Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman. \"I don't think there's any doubt we're coming out of the recession.\" **********Most Democrats were less upbeat. Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, chairman of the Banking Committee, said that the Federal Reserve's decision was long overdue and that \"its strategy of small, slow steps has not worked.\" **********The Federal Reserve Board met early this morning and announced shortly after 9 A.M. that it had voted, 4 to 0, to cut the discount rate to 5 percent, the lowest rate since February 1973. One Federal Reserve governor, Edward W. Kelley Jr., did not vote because he was out of the country, and two seats on the seven-seat board are vacant. Large Purchases of Securities **********Later in the morning, the Federal Reserve bought large quantities of Government securities to indicate that it wanted to reduce the Federal funds rate to 5 1/4 percent, the lowest since 1977. **********No sooner had the discount rate cut been announced than the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company in New York, the nation's fourth-largest bank, announced that it was reducing its prime rate to 8 percent from 8 1/2 percent. Other banks quickly followed suit. This means that interest rates may fall soon on mortgages, auto loans and other consumer borrowing, even though they have been slow to do so up to now. **********The spread between the rates the Federal Reserve controls and the prime rate is unusually large, as it has been for a few years. This shows that banks are reluctant to lend money and are wary about taking risks in light of the many bad loans made in the 1980's. Spread Between the Rates **********In the spring of 1987, the last time the prime rate was as low as 8 percent, the Federal funds rate was 6 1/4 percent and the discount rate 5 1/2 percent. In 1973, when the discount rate was last at 5 percent, the prime rate was 6 percent. **********This was the third time this year the discount rate has been cut and the sixth time the Federal funds rate has been reduced. The Federal Reserve has been steadily driving rates down since 1989, when the Federal funds rate was nearly 10 percent and the discount rate 7 percent. The prime rate reached 11 1/2 percent in early 1989. **********The Federal Reserve Board issued this official statement this morning: \"Action was taken in light of weakness in the money and credit aggregates, the improving inflation environment and concerns about the ongoing strength of the economic expansion. The reduction, in part, realigns the discount rate with market interest rates.\" Concern About Money Supply **********Mr. Greenspan has told Congress that he is extremely concerned about the slow growth in money supply. The only way the money supply will rise is if banks lend more money. **********The Federal Reserve's target for growth in M-2, which is primarily cash, checking, savings and money market accounts and small certificates of deposit and is the most common gauge of the money supply, is 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent for the year. Growth is running below that range now. Last week, M-2 fell by $9.7 billion. **********Michael J. Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, said he was especially pleased by the Federal Reserve's action today because it indicated a desire to move the money supply into the middle of the target range. **********Some economists believe the Federal Reserve is placing too much emphasis on M-2. For example, Albert M. Wojnilower, a senior economist at First Boston Corporation in New York, said that it was an unreliable figure and that he was disappointed the central bank cited it in its official statement about the rate cut. Embarrassing to the Fed **********But other economists said the inability of Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues to keep the money supply within such a large range was embarrassing. **********What worries some experts is that the Federal Reserve may not be able to reinvigorate the economy singlehanded, and there are no other arrows in the quiver. **********An expected budget deficit of well over $300 billion next year means that Federal taxes are not likely to be cut or spending increased, normal steps when the economy is weak. State and local governments, which must operate on balanced budgets, are doing exactly the opposite, raising taxes and cutting spending, a drag on the recovery. **********\"The open question is whether what happened today is too little, too late,\" said Robert H. Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New York. \"We just don't know the answer yet.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/05/business/business-technology-putting-pollen-to-good-use-the-delivery-of-drugs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 255, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business Technology; Putting Pollen to Good Use: The Delivery of Drugs", "print_headline": "Business Technology; Putting Pollen to Good Use: The Delivery of Drugs", "body_text": " **********At this time of year, few allergy sufferers need any reminder of pollen's ability to enter the body.

Both sides regularly passed messages to each other through intermediaries in exchanges that at times approached a dialogue. **********The subjects discussed ranged from assurances that American planes would not bomb Shiite Muslim shrines in Iraq to Iranian queries on flights over its territory, Administration officials say. **********In an interview with Arab journalists on Friday, President Bush said the United States harbors no animosity toward Iran and indeed seeks better relations. He added that he did not think that the Iranians should \"be treated forever as enemies\" by the six rich Arab countries that make up the Gulf Cooperation Council. **********Administration officials read with interest remarks by Mr. Rafsanjani on Friday urging President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to submit to the will of his people and step down. But they noted that he did not call for creation of an Islamic government like his own. Domestic Audience in Mind **********The American officials said they thought the remarks were intended for a domestic audience, designed to deflect criticism from militants who have urged direct involvement in the overthrow of Mr. Hussein. **********During the gulf conflict, Administration officials consistently portrayed Iran as a responsible country that would not take Iraq's side. They repeatedly stated that they believed Iran's assurances that it would not violate the embargo against Iraq, that it would not return more than 120 Iraqi planes sent to Iran during the war and that it would not get directly involved in Shiite revolts in southern Iraq. **********The status of the planes is still unclear. Hassan Habibi, Iran's First Vice President, said in Ankara today that Iran would not use the Iraqi planes as part of his country's $900 billion reparations claim against Iraq for the Iran-Iraq war. But he did not say whether or when the planes would be returned. **********In a Congressional hearing on Feb. 6, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d praised Iran for its conduct during the crisis and called it \"a major power in the gulf\" that could play an important role in \"building a reinforced network of new and strengthened security ties\" in the region.  Significant Bid for Talks **********Mr. Rafsanjani's attempt last month to mediate between the United States and Iraq at the height of hostilities was more than a vague peace proposal. It was also an offer to open direct political talks with Washington, for the first time without a list of conditions. **********For the moment, Washington and Teheran have very different visions of what postwar regional security means. Iran has always demanded an American pledge not to interfere in the region's affairs. Its leaders, across the political spectrum, have demanded that the allies pull their forces from the gulf as soon as possible. **********In recent weeks American officials have stressed the need to incorporate Iran into any political structure for the region, but they envision no military role for Iran in a postwar security structure. \"We do not want to see Iranian troops stationed in Kuwait,\" a senior Administration official said. **********The Americans also want Iran to use its influence over terrorist groups it supports in Lebanon that are still holding American hostages. However, these groups have taken a harsh line against American military intervention in the region and say they will not release the hostages."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/16/world/israel-refuses-to-match-syrian-position-on-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1991-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 658, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel Refuses to Match Syrian Position on Talks", "print_headline": "Israel Refuses to Match Syrian Position on Talks", "body_text": " **********The Israeli Government announced today that it would not offer any concessions to match those made by Syria on the issue of a regional peace conference when Secretary of State James A.

Trickery Masked by Rhetoric? **********In fact, senior officials said they were worried that President Hafez al-Assad's letter was not a concession at all, but a trick intended to insure that Israel would take the blame if the American initiative failed. **********The general tone of the official remarks this afternoon suggested that the Government's intent was to debunk the view that the Syrian response was positive or important. **********Officials said they had not seen the text. But Defense Minister Moshe Arens, the senior minister closest to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, suggested that any Syrian concessions would have no effect on Israel's point of view. **********\"The Syrians can put on the table whatever they want, and we will put on the table whatever we consider the proper thing to do,\" he said.  Moment of Truth **********An Israeli newspaper said in an editorial today that \"this is the moment of truth for Shamir's Government\" because \"it will be called upon to make compromises after it has already drawn its red lines.\" **********Shimon Peres, leader of the Labor Party, also took that approach. **********\"The Israeli Government always said it wanted the Syrians in,\" he said. \"And now they will have to deal with this or appear as the only rejectionist on the scene.\" **********President Bush sent letters to the Israeli and Syrian Governments last month asking both to accept compromises on the format for a regional peace conference. Specifically, Mr. Bush asked both Governments to allow the conference to reconvene periodically, if all parties agreed to that. And he asked Israel and Syria to allow a United Nations observer to sit in on the conference with no power to interfere. **********Almost immediately Israel rejected both requests. In the weeks since then, Israeli officials have berated Syria for taking so long to respond. **********Now that it seems as if Syria has accepted Mr. Bush's proposed compromises, Israeli officials are arguing that any response that does not accept unreserved, direct negotiations with Israel is no concession at all. Based on that assumption, the Government can argue that it need not respond with any concessions of its own. **********\"I don't understand why the Syrian answer is being described as positive,\" the Economics and Planning Minister, David Magen, said. \"In a long letter he tried to create the impression of a positive answer. But in my opinion he said no to the American initiative and to the Israeli appeal to hold direct negotiations.\" **********Mr. Arens offered a similar view. \"I haven't seen the letter,\" he said. \"But if the Syrians have indeed expressed a willingness to sit down and negotiate directly on a peace treaty with Israel, then this is a very positive development.\"  'The Initiative Was Ours' **********Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was even more direct, saying a Syrian response to questions from the United States was essentially irrelevant. **********\"We have proposed a peace initiative,\" he said. \"President Bush asked some questions about it, and we answered them as well. But the initiative was ours, not the Americans'. Syria has given answers to Bush's letter, not to the Israeli initiative.\" **********Foreign Minister David Levy criticized the others in the Government who responded skeptically to the letter before they had seen it. He said they were speaking only for themselves.

'Clear Messages to the Iraqis' **********Asked to interpret Mr. Baker's remarks, an Administration policy maker said: \"Don't read that we are going to war tomorrow, but do read that we are not going to tolerate them trying to hide their nuclear capabilities. We now have a very good idea of what they still have. We got most of it in the war, but not all of it. What you are hearing now are some very clear messages to the Iraqis that we will not tolerate their keeping this stuff, and we have established a pretty good track record with them of doing what we say.\" **********After a meeting at the State Department, Mr. Baker went out of his way to make sure that reporters got the ominous message, so that it would be quickly relayed to Baghdad. \"Stay tuned,\" he said. **********Speaking of Iraq's refusal to permit a United Nations team into a military base suspected of being the storage point for enriched uranium, an essential ingredient for any nuclear weapon, Mr. Baker added with uncharacteristic emotion: \"This is a very serious matter.

But wherever the line is drawn, between Memorial Day and Labor Day, Friday is viewed by many companies as a quasi-holiday -- at least when it comes to dress codes. **********\"On summer Fridays, people who normally look neat and corporate show up for work in shorts, sundresses and sandals,\" said Elizabeth Beier, a senior editor with the Putnam Berkley Group, a New York book publisher.  \"It's like everybody wants to start the weekend a little bit sooner.\" **********While the phenomenon is most common in \"creative\" fields like publishing, advertising and retailing, other industries are increasingly permitting casual clothes -- and behavior -- on Friday. \"Companies are finding that when people dress down, it breaks down status hierarchies,\" said Douglass Lind, president of the Trisource Group, a New York executive consulting firm. **********But not everywhere. Many top executives do not indulge in the same privilege they extend to employees. Although several divisions of the International Business Machines Corporation are permitted casual clothes on Fridays, John Akers, the company's chief executive, seldom deviates from his standard uniform. At American Express's Travel Related Services, colleagues can't recall seeing Edwin Cooperman, who runs the unit, attired informally. And Ms. Beier said of her boss, Phyllis Grann, the chief executive of Putnam Berkley: \"I don't think our president ever relaxes her dress standards. She has to retain her dignity.\" **********Still, signs of the looser dress code abound, even though some skeptics raise eyebrows about the whole idea. \"It's an attempt to create a notion of equality among people at different levels in an organization,\" said Abraham Zaleznik, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \"It's an episodic ritual of power reduction which can be insidious.\" **********If anything, Dr. Zaleznik thinks, casual clothes are a distraction. \"When people come to work in shorts, their concentration is reduced,\" he said. \"They're more likely to hang out and schmooze.\" **********Other management experts suggest that dressing down represents a ritual of relaxation -- rather than actual relaxation. \"It's a purely symbolic gesture,\" said Allan Cox, an executive consultant in Chicago. \"It makes people think the boss has a little heart, that he's willing to humanize the workplace. But it doesn't make employees less efficient or productive.\" **********While many people readily relinquish neckties or heels, not all do. \"I wear loafers on Friday instead of wingtips,\" admitted Robert Parker, chief financial officer for the New York advertising agency Della Femina McNamee. \"That's about as far as I go.\" **********In Mr. Parker's view, \"casual\" means a blazer and slacks, not a T-shirt and jeans.  \"Friday looks different from Thursday here, but it shouldn't look like Saturday,\" he said. **********There are a few industries where casual clothes would raise eyebrows -- even for an hour or two. One investment banker at Morgan Stanley recalls working with a female partner on a Friday who was leaving at 10:30 A.M. on Friday for a weekend sojourn. \"She was only going to be in the office for half the morning, but she wore a suit anyway,\" the investment banker said. **********There's a reason for this, according to Mr.  Lind. \"In an industry like investment banking, clothes send important signals. If power dressing is key, and you don't have your suspenders on, what have you got?\" **********At smaller investment banking boutiques, however, informal attire is often allowed -- even encouraged. Liz Kelly, an associate with the New York-based firm of Scully Brothers Foss & Wight, favors brighter colors in the summer, and occasionally sports slacks on Friday. However, she noted, \"I keep a black dress in the office in case a client comes by.\" **********The abbrieviated summer hours traditionally associated with advertising have migrated to other businesses. At some corporations, it's hard to figure out who's around on Friday. **********Take Time Warner, the communications and entertainment giant. Employees with the Book of the Month Club, Home Box Office and the magazines can take Friday afternoons off -- but employees with the movies and records units and the corporate office can't. Those with summer hours aren't necessarily in sync. Some are dismissed at 1:00 P.M., others at 3:00 P.M. **********\"The rules relate to the nature of the different divisions,\" said Edward I. Adler, a Time Warner spokesman. **********Even when summer hours are offered, they aren't always observed. At Unilever, the New York-based arm of the Dutch consumer products company, employees may take a half-day off anytime during the week -- providing they work an additional 45 minutes the remaining days. Yet only about 50 percent of Unilever employees leave early.  \"Some departments frown on it,\" said Mary Hernandez, a company spokeswoman. \"It might be O.K. in marketing, but not in manufacturing.\" **********Due to the recession, some companies have lengthened -- or abandoned -- their summer hours. At Della Femina McNamee, employees may take five Fridays off, down from 10 a few years ago. And they must take whole days, not half days. **********\"We think this is the best way,\" said Mr. Parker. \"It means everybody doesn't mentally wind down at 11 o'clock and check out for the weekend.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/18/business/economic-scene-north-american-currency-links.html": {"writer_name": "Sylvia Nasar", "pub_date": "1991-12-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 822, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; North American Currency Links?", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; North American Currency Links?", "body_text": " **********SHOULD the United States, Mexico and Canada, follow Europe's lead and move toward a North American currency area as well as a freer regional trade zone? **********The question is not on any official agendas. But the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Mexican central bank are quietly studying coordination to dampen swings in the peso-dollar rate. Some hard-pressed Canadian exporters are urging the Canadians to peg the Canadian dollar to the United States dollar. And the former Federal Reserve chairman, Paul A. Volcker, recently predicted that \"in five years, you will find a fixed exchange rate among the peso, the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar.\" **********Harvey Rosenblum, research director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said: \"You don't have to go all the way to a single currency to get some of the advantages. A tacit agreement to keep rates within a narrow band, absolutely fixed rates, or a single currency are all degrees of the same thing.\" **********Since its economy is by far the biggest of the three, the United States would probably feel fewer effects of currency linkage than Mexico or Canada. **********With steadier exchange rates, importers and exporters would face fewer problems, less uncertainty and lower business costs. Mr. Rosenblum compares bumpy exchange rates to pothole-strewn highways: \"You can haul the goods, but it's a lot tougher.\" **********Predictable exchange rates could also increase investor confidence, helping to broaden financial markets and bring in more investment -- particularly in Mexico where the perennial worry remains the risk of a sudden flight from the peso. \"Economists always say that you can hedge,\" said Richard Cooper, an economist at the Kennedy School. \"But you can't hedge an investment with a 10-year life.\" **********Stable exchange rates could also help defuse a potential backlash against freer trade from business and unions by minimizing large swings in currencies. **********Finally, linking currencies \"puts pressure on high-inflation countries to mend their ways,\" said Robert Gay, an economist at Morgan Stanley. In Mexico, inflation has been running at 20 percent, multiples of the 3.5 percent in the United States. **********The peso was, in fact, linked to the United States dollar during the 1950's and 60's -- \"a remarkable period of growth and stability and open capital markets in Mexico,\" as Mr. Volcker put it. **********Few economists would deny that these benefits may accrue. But many believe that the economic case for giving up floating rates and edging toward a North American currency area is much weaker than in Europe -- quite apart from the fact that the merest whisper of economic integration raises hackles in Canada and Mexico. The biggest drawback to monetary unions is the loss of sovereignty. **********\"Currency alignment means giving up your economic policy,\" said Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University. Defending a fixed exchange rate can mean adopting exactly the opposite monetary policy than the one that domestic conditions call for. **********\"The one market of Western Europe and that of North America are very different entities,\" said David Laidler, an economist at the C.D. Howe Institute, a Canadian think tank. \"To put it simply, the one European market is part of a broader political union and the one North American market shows no signs of developing in such a direction.\" **********And it's far too soon to predict how free-trade agreements will evolve. The free-trade area in the agreement between the United States and Canada will not be completed until 1999 and the agreement with Mexico is not a sure thing. Further, said Miguel Mancera, president of the Banco de Mexico, \"Currency areas are not essential to free-trade zones' good performance nor are the benefits of such unions self-evident.\" **********The potential cost saving from going, say, to a single currency are probably much smaller here than in Europe. There are only three currencies in North America, not 12; the United States and Mexico depend less on foreign trade, and, in any case, business can always be conducted in United States dollars. The existing system of floating rates has also worked much better in North America than in Europe. Flexible currencies have helped the region adjust relatively quickly to shocks -- a big surge or plunge in world oil prices. **********In any case, there is no compelling evidence that trade liberalization requires fixed exchange rates. \"Central bankers always want to fix things,\" said Sir Alan Walters, vice chairman of the AIG Trading Corporation and a former economic adviser to Margaret Thatcher. \"It makes them feel more important.\" The lack of a currency union has not prevented Canada and the United States from trading more than any other two nations. **********At an international economics meeting in August, several Mexican and Canadian economists made elaborate arguments against a North American monetary union. **********\"It may be politically suicidal, and economically premature to say anything else,\" Mr. Volcker commented at the meeting. \"But I also have the feel that they doth protest too much.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/26/business/loss-at-bank-of-boston.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Loss at Bank of Boston", "print_headline": "Loss at Bank of Boston", "body_text": " **********The Bank of Boston Corporation said today that it lost $49 million in the last three months but was nearing profitability by reducing its bad real estate loans.

If Israel retaliated, the United States delegation said, that might lead to a fracturing of the American-led coalition in the Persian Gulf, one of Saddam Hussein's goals in attacking Israel. **********For the United States, Israel remains a sort of wild card, one that can endanger the grand but delicate international alliance carefully assembled and maintained over the last five months. **********While some Arab countries, notably Egypt, have said that Israel has the right to retaliate if attacked, others have taken a different view. On Saturday, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, indicated that Syria would reassess its role in the anti-Iraq alliance if Israel got involved, even to retaliate after an Iraqi attack.  Syria as a Political Asset **********\"In this case,\" Mr. Sharaa said, \"it is meant to reshuffle the cards, and therefore Israel should not intervene. Syria cannot accept an Israeli intervention in this crisis.\" **********If Syria withdrew from the coalition, that would have little effect on the military situation, since it is far from certain that the Syrians would participate in an offensive in any case.

It is up to Israel to decide how to respond if attacked, the Prime Minister answered. **********\"That is the way it has been, and that is the way it will be,\" Mr. Shamir said.  Israelis 'Will Respond' **********After the Cabinet meeting, a senior aide to Mr. Shamir, Health Minister Ehud Olmert, added: \"When, how, in what form, how fast, where -- all those are questions we will answer at the proper time. But on the issue of whether we will respond, we will, and I don't think it could be otherwise.\" **********Israel has promised the United States that it will not carry out any pre-emptive attacks against Iraq, a favored Israeli tactic when threatened in the past.

The USF&G Corporation of Baltimore, with major losses in its real estate and \"junk bond\" portfolios, said earlier this month that it would reduce its work force by 2,800 people, or 25 percent, in 1991. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company said it would offer early retirement to 4,000 of its 9,000 New York employees, and that 1,000 were expected to accept.  Other Recent Layoffs **********Others announced staff reductions in the previous months: The Aetna Life and Casualty Company is cutting 2,600 employees, or roughly 5.5 percent of its domestic work force; the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, 757 employees, or 11.7 percent of its total, and the Travelers Corporation, 1,000 employees, or 3 percent percent of its total. The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company has reportedly had heavy layoffs too, but declines to comment. **********Except for USF&G, the percentages of workers involved are not huge; together, the cutbacks amount to less than 1 percent of the 2.1 million people who, according to the Labor Department, worked in insurance as of Dec. 31. Many of the cuts came as companies left unprofitable insurance lines, like Aetna's decision to stop writing individual health policies. To the extent that these policies will be issued by others, the jobs eliminated by Aetna will be made up elsewhere. **********Nonetheless, the latest layoffs are the most severe that many in the industry remember. While they have cut their staffs before, the biggest insurers have long been known as benevolent parents, where most held onto their jobs in good times or bad. Insurers could get away with consistent staffing regardless of business volume because many were mutuals, owned by policyholders, not by investors. One insurer, Metropolitan Life, still gives employees a free hot lunch every day. **********Lately, returns in many insurance lines have worsened so much that even the most protective of insurers have begun to wield the ax. **********\"For years, insurers viewed themselves as having a wider, statesmanlike position in America,\" said Sean Mooney, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a New York trade group. \"They would wage expensive campaigns against drunk driving and auto theft even if they hurt profits. Now that is changing. More and more, people running insurance companies are saying, 'This is a business, and it has got to be run for the bottom line.' \" **********Behind the work-force reductions lies the toughest business environment insurers have faced in years. **********For life insurers, fierce competition from investment firms has made it much harder to win money-management business from pension funds. Lower prices for real estate and junk bonds have cut deeply into life insurers' investment returns. **********Property-and-casualty insurers, meanwhile, have been grappling with a fourth year of depressed premium levels for commercial liability policies. They face a continually expanding legal definition of liability. Many business liability insurers say they never dreamed of having to pay for pollution cleanup, an area of coverage that courts are often forcing them to provide. **********Auto insurance lines have their own problems, among them rate rollbacks by the states and soaring jury awards and medical costs. **********All this has taken a toll. According to the A.M. Best Company, a research firm based in Oldwick, N.J., property-and-casualty insurers reported an average return on shareholders' investment of 6.7 percent in 1990 -- up from 6.1 percent in 1989 but still well below what investment professionals say the insurers should be earning given their risks. **********Life insurers' returns were much better -- about 13 percent in 1989, by A.M. Best's most recent figure -- but still below the 17 percent to 20 percent that top-performing companies in other sectors generate. Industry experts say that life insurance returns fell sharply last year under the weight of junk bond defaults and continued weakness in real estate. **********All sides agree that the job reductions are needed to lift insurer returns, but not about whether the companies are cutting fat or muscle. Most consumer groups and some analysts have long said that many of the country's biggest insurers could stand a diet. **********\"Most of these companies have not been very efficient,\" said Gloria Vogel, who follows the industry for Bear, Stearns & Company. \"Among property-and-casualty companies, 30 percent of every premium dollar goes to expense.\" **********George G. C. Parker, who teaches about financial institutions at the Stanford Business School, says that many insurers became complacent. With the large amount of capital and the knowledge of regulations required to enter the industry, Professor Parker said, \"insurers could afford to be a little sloppy in productivity and still earn a decent return.\" **********But Mr. Mooney of the Insurance Information Institute said that insurers' expense-to-revenue ratio was no worse than that of other industries. Banks spend about 30 percent of their interest income on overhead, department stores 35 percent and specialty stores 38.6 percent. More Layoffs Loom **********Alan Levin, the senior insurance specialist at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said that despite some seemingly high costs -- like agent's commissions equal to 15 percent of a policy's first-year premium -- the insurers are actually efficient. \"There just are not that many excess people,\" he said. **********Most industry experts say that more layoff announcements loom, if only because the reductions announced so far will not allow the insurers to produce a more respectable 15 percent return on shareholders' money. Any savings will benefit insurance shareholders in the form of higher profits. Higher profits, in turn, will benefit policyholders in terms of the companies' ability to pay claims. **********But not all analysts believe that cutting jobs is the most sensible approach to improving returns. Most insurers continue to lose money on the insurance side of their business, profiting only by earnings on investments. **********\"I find it amusing that in hard times the insurers focus on reducing overhead,\" said Michael Smith, the insurance analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"They accept the fact that the expense that represents 75 percent of their outlays -- namely, claims payments -- cannot be controlled.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/13/world/after-the-war-kurds-frozen-in-place-at-iran-s-frontier.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Wines", "pub_date": "1991-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 908, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kurds Frozen in Place at Iran's Frontier", "print_headline": "AFTER THE WAR; Kurds Frozen in Place at Iran's Frontier", "body_text": " **********Down a vast treeless bowl, high in northern Iran's mountains, an endless river of Kurdish exiles now seems almost frozen in place, by icy weather that has killed scores, by gas shortages that have immobilized hundreds of cars and vans, by stiff military security that has made passage to warmth and food on the plateau below a slow and agonizing process. **********The Iranian officials said 8,000 vehicles and 150,000 refugees fleeing Iraq and Saddam Hussein's army have traveled the mountain pass to Iran in the last eight days. Today, Iran's army was mounting a dogged effort to feed and shelter the hungry, half-clothed horde still making the trek. **********Convoys of Government trucks carried apples, cakes, biscuits and water to refugees trapped in the pass. A rusting orange shipping container doubled as pharmacy and transfer point for ambulances ferrying the sick to doctors in the town of Pyranshahr below.  Hobbling Throngs **********But the officials said hundreds of thousands were waiting to enter. For at least five miles, until the two-lane mountain road wound along the pass into Iraq's snowy peaks, the tarmac was clotted with vehicles and hobbling throngs of people. Refugees said it stretched for 40 more miles, past the Iraqi town of Diana, but there was no way to verify the assertion. **********During a Government-sponsored visit of several hours for reporters today, only a trickle of cars, vans and walking refugees made it through the five-mile no man's land separating Iraq's border and the Iranian checkpoint in the hills of Pyranshahr, **********It is uncertain why the parade, which officials say averaged 20,000 daily, had slowed. Pyranshahr's Mayor, Ahman Ziai, said the influx of refugees itself had disrupted relief efforts. \"Some people are in such a hurry to enter they block the road,\" he said.  Search for Weapons **********But some refugees said the pace has been slowed by the Iranian military's insistence that each vehicle obtain a pass before entering Iran. Military guards subjected each Kurdish man to a hand search for weapons. The columns were halted by the convoys of relief trucks, which blocked off the road a few yards from the Iraqi border as they maneuvered to unload supplies. **********\"Tell them the Government has to let us cross by car,\" said a Kurdish refugee from Erbil, a doctor who gave his name as Ibrahim. If cars are not given free passage, he said, the exodus could be blocked for two months more. **********The refugees have few days to spare. Mr. Ziai said they were being pelted nightly by snow and rain. Ten to 20 die daily along the road, he said, and 300 to 400 more have perished in his town. **********Kurds in the pass told stories of babies and old men dying of disease and exposure, and of fresh graves dug along the highway by grieving parents. Dr. Ibrahim said he had seen 10 dead babies and had treated his own 18-month-old daughter for gastroenteritis. **********Almost all the refugees said they had fled homes in Erbil, Kirkuk, Diana and Sulaimaniya in the last two weeks as the Iraqi Army snuffed out a rebellion by Kurds seeking autonomy in Iraq. **********Infants and toddlers make up much of the tide of refugees. In near-freezing weather braced by teeth-chattering winds, some of the youngsters and their mothers walked in mud without shoes or gloves. Many wore threadbare jackets. Those children who were not crying appeared numbed by the cold. **********To cope, the Kurds have converted their slow-moving column into a sort of long, narrow city. Trucks and cars alike carry bundles of brush, and huge scorched areas testify to bonfires lit nightly for the many who are not lucky enough to sleep in a vehicle. **********Today, walkers bathed muddy feet in streams of snowmelt that ran from the 1,800-foot mountains guarding each side of the mile-high pass. Iranian soldiers shooed youngsters from the hills, off the highway, which some refugees said were planted with land mines in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. **********Vehicle owners left their families to walk to Pyranshahr, where they bought jerrycans and gasoline and then retraced the several-mile path up the mountains to their stalled cars. Aid Called Too Little **********Several agreed today that they could walk to Iran with their families far more quickly than if they stayed with their cars, awaiting a military pass. But they said the vehicles offered shelter, heaters, and an investment with which to stake a new life in Iran. **********Iranian military officials said most of the refugees were being moved outside the traditionally Kurdish area of Iran and into two cities, Khoi and Maragheh, each 140 miles from the mountain pass. They said Pyranshahr lacked housing and food for them. **********Mr. Ziai, echoing leaders in Teheran, chided the outside world for its lack of assistance. Only a single planeload of seven tons of supplies from France had landed in his region. \"The foreign aid is not going to help,\" the 31-year-old Mayor said. \"It's a small amount.\" **********The Kurds in turn expressed gratitude for the stacks of yellow Iranian apples and boxes of sweet cakes that soldiers tossed from trucks, and which refugees carried to the far reaches of their column. Few of the exiles expected to return to Iraq any time soon. **********\"They won't go back to their country until Saddam Hussein goes down,\" an Government interpreter quoted several as saying. \"They say there isn't such a system as his anywhere.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/22/world/salvadoran-far-right-leader-ill-with-cancer.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1991-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 763, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Salvadoran Far-Right Leader Ill With Cancer", "print_headline": "Salvadoran Far-Right Leader Ill With Cancer", "body_text": " **********Roberto d'Aubuisson, the far-right leader accused of death-squad involvement in the early 1980's, who went on to build the dominant political party in El Salvador, is fighting what associates say is terminal cancer. **********The passing of Mr. d'Aubuisson, a hard-smoking, hard-drinking man with the style and image of a tough guy, would be likely to throw Salvadoran politics into disarray and could create confusion in the peace negotiations under way between the Government of President Alfredo Cristiani and leftist insurgents. **********The illness of the 48-year-old Mr. d'Aubuisson has been known since early this year, but until recent days neither he nor associates would confirm the seriousness of it. **********\"It is a malignant tumor,\" Armando Calderon Sol, president of Mr. d'Aubuisson's party, said at a news conference today, Reuters reported. Mr. Calderon described the illness as \"mortal.\" **********A foreign diplomat said recently, \"Everybody in his party now speaks of him in the past tense.\" Two Growths Removed **********Politicians and diplomats in touch with Mr. d'Aubuisson's circle say that two malignant growths have been removed from his tongue since early this year and that cancerous growths have since spread to his throat and shoulder. **********He has been making frequent trips to Houston for radiation therapy. **********Mr. d'Aubuisson, a former Salvadoran Army intelligence officer once known for rough treatment of captured leftists, was thrown out of the army after reformist officers took power from a traditional military Government in October 1979, when the current civil war was threatening to explode. **********But after the new governing junta's agrarian reform and bank nationalizations angered the richest families in the country, Mr. d'Aubuisson began organizing an alliance of those families and dissident army officers who thought the junta was sympathetic to the growing guerrilla movement. **********The d'Aubuisson alliance was nearly as antagonistic to the Christian Democratic Party of Jose Napoleon Duarte, who eventually joined the junta, as it was to the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. **********In the wave of political killings that erupted in 1980 -- by most estimates, 10,000 people died that year in political violence -- Mr. d'Aubuisson and those around him were alleged to be responsible for several of the best-known cases.  Archbishop Assassinated **********One was the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero as he said Mass in a hospital chapel in 1980. There is strong circumstantial evidence linking people close to Mr. d'Aubuisson to the killing, but no charges were ever filed. He always vehemently denied the public accusations that Mr. Duarte made against him in the years before his own death from cancer in 1990. **********In 1982, Mr. d'Aubuisson organized a political party, the Nationalist Republican Alliance, known as Arena, and surprised his critics and opponents by finding strong popular support, even among the rural poor whom the guerrillas often claim to speak for. **********One of his campaign slogans was to equate the Christian Democrats, who were then dominant, to a watermelon: green on the outside and red on the inside. **********Since then, Mr. d'Aubuisson has been a leading figure in the Legislative Assembly, and in 1989 he saw his handpicked candidate, Mr. Cristiani, elected President. **********In recent years Mr. d'Aubuisson has come to be viewed as an astute politician in a country with few of those. He has developed a willingness to compromise, say members of other parties. **********One of his recent notable actions was to support the nomination and election of Ruben Zamora, formerly a member of the guerrillas' political organization, to be a vice president of the Assembly.  Concern About Power Struggle **********There is concern among other political leaders that Mr. d'Aubuisson's death would set off a power struggle among younger members of his party eager to earn their machismo ratings. **********\"What worries some of us is the new generation of young men who haven't matured,\" said a diplomat, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. \"They might want to revert to his early '80's mantle.\" **********The same diplomat said Mr. d'Aubuisson had supported the peace talks under way with guerrilla leaders, and even from his sickbed in Houston had intervened several times in recent months to persuade the most hard-line members of his party to go along with various parts of the proposed accords. **********\"His death would throw a new ingredient into a process where trust is important,\" the diplomat said. **********\"Besides the uncertainty it will create for this Government,\" he added, \"the guerrillas as well will feel the loss of Roberto d'Aubuisson. They need him to keep stability on the right during the peace talks, but also because with him gone they will no longer have the devil figure that they need to justify their own recalcitrance.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/25/business/tool-orders-fell-32.4-in-january.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1991-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 516, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tool Orders Fell 32.4% in January", "print_headline": "Tool Orders Fell 32.4% in January", "body_text": " **********New orders for American-made machine tools plunged 32.4 percent in January from an unusually high level in December, according to a report to be released today by the industry's trade association. **********Industry analysts said that in addition to being skewed by the year-end surge in orders, the sharp decline stemmed from the weak demand that is typical in the winter months. **********The level of orders for new machine tools fell to $199.9 million in January, from the December level of $295.8 million, according to the Association for Manufacturing Technology. The December figure was the highest monthly level of 1990. **********The level of orders in January was virtually unchanged from that of January 1990. 'Orders Remained Firm' **********\"At first glance, January orders look low when compared to the robust December figure,\" said Albert W. Moore, president of the association, which is based in McLean, Va. \"But take a look at January a year ago, and you see a nearly identical first-of-the-year total.

The strength of tool orders generally reflects the strength of industrial production, and economists consider patterns of machine tool sales to be important indicators of capital spending by manufacturers. **********Machine tool orders had risen 43.7 percent in December. Analysts attributed that big jump to increased demand from auto makers as they began to produce redesigned engines and other auto parts.  A Very Strong December **********\"The January decline does not mean too much because December was inordinately strong as a result of new designs being released in Detroit,\" said William G. Copeland, president of Copeland Economic Group, an economic consulting firm in Stamford, Conn. \"Also, there was so much uncertainty in the marketplace due to expectations about the war in the Persian Gulf, which caused people to hold off on their purchase of new machine tools. People wanted to wait to see how the economy would shape up.\" **********Orders from foreign customers were particularly strong last year, as the depressed value of the United States dollar made the prices of American machine tools very attractive in overseas markets. **********In recent months, machine tool industry executives have said that demand has increased from an array of industries. And they have predicted that American companies will spend more this year to improve their manufacturing operations. Orders for Metal-Cutting Tools **********Orders for metal-cutting tools, which include boring mills and lathes, dropped 27 percent in January from the December level. Compared with January of last year, new orders for metal-cutting tools were down 7.9 percent.

Blum, for 25 years a Washington lawyer, Senate investigator and doggedly liberal Democratic muckraker, uncovered early signs of wrongdoing by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1988. He was serving a two-year stint as chief investigator for Senator John F. Kerry's Foreign Relations subcommittee. **********Back at the subcommittee early this month, this time as a witness at televised hearings on fraud and corruption at B.C.C.I., Mr. Blum unleashed an accusation that propelled him and the Massachusetts Democrat onto the evening news: the Bush Administration had soft-pedaled its criminal inquiry into B.C.C.I. despite abundant evidence of misdeeds by the bank. More Recent Charges **********Only recently, Mr. Blum made virtually identical charges against Senator Kerry's chief patron, Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. **********The Los Angeles Times reported in March that Mr. Blum \"believes that lobbying and financial contributions\" to Senators Pell and Kerry by Clark M. Clifford, the Democratic Party insider now enmeshed in the B.C.C.I. scandal, \"may have cost him his job\" as chief investigator for the Kerry subcommittee. Days later, a Boston Herald article quoted Mr. Blum as calling Senator Pell a \"clunker\" who was \"utterly hostile\" to the B.C.C.I. inquiry. **********In a long interview last week, Mr. Blum denied making the accusation, said that The Los Angeles Times had misstated his suspicions, and asserted that The Boston Herald had misquoted him. (\"I didn't call him a clunker.\") Besides, he said, he does not believe Senator Pell can be swayed by political money. **********But in the next breath, Mr. Blum added: Senator Pell has \"forgotten the role of the Foreign Relations Committee\" as a watchdog over the White House, and that the panel could use more \"crockery breakers\" like Mr. Blum himself. **********The episode speaks volumes. Friends call the 50-year-old Mr. Blum the original gumshoe -- a tenacious, moralistic crusader who produces charges of high-level corruption like a grinding wheel throws off sparks. Critics -- and a few friends -- say his accusations sometimes land with about the same accuracy and too often burn innocent bystanders. **********Mr. Blum does have an acute sense of drama. In his testimony this month, he hinted that his inquiries had led B.C.C.I. to wage a smear campaign against him, to tail him with a private detective and to tap his telephone. **********Ultimately, he said, he was warned by law-enforcement friends that his life was in danger. \"I thought under the circumstances the risk was worth it,\" Mr. Blum testified, deadpan. **********What is unique about Mr. Blum is that he was not joking. **********\"Jack had, and he clearly retains, what is an increasingly rare commodity in Washington these days: moral outrage,\" said one admirer, Karin Lissakers, a lecturer in political science at Columbia University who worked with Mr. Blum in the Senate in the 1970's. \"He was a    very    good investigator.\" **********Mr. Blum was a Roman candle of allegations at the witness table when he testified: the Central Intelligence Agency's covert war in Afghanistan had been corrupted by B.C.C.I.-related arms thievery; B.C.C.I. had been the \"original banker\" to Oliver North's secret arms enterprise; the Federal Reserve had a secret list of American officials whom B.C.C.I. had paid off; the World Bank and Latin American leaders were enmeshed in the bank's web of deceit. **********Senate aides say that proof of some of those and other charges is in hand and only awaits the proper moment to be revealed. But the Federal Reserve has since denied that it has a list, and Iran-contra records show that a Geneva concern, not B.C.C.I., had set up and ran the finances of Mr. North's arms network. **********And the Senate Intelligence Committee aide who monitored the C.I.A.'s Afghan program in the 1980's, David Holliday, said he had investigated Mr. Blum's charges of corruption and found them baseless. **********\"It's very easy to make those kinds of broad, sweeping accusatory statements and then let them bounce around with nothing to back it up or support it,\" he said. \"It's another matter when people who make those kinds of statements are pinned down to come up with hard evidence.\" **********Said Mr. Blum: \"I heard this from ex-B.C.C.I. employees. God bless him if he's found otherwise. But that's not what I'm being told.\"  Aflame Over Injustice **********Now a lawyer in private practice, Mr. Blum has been out of the Congressional investigative detective business for years. But he says he has been besieged by calls from clients and old colleagues about his B.C.C.I. detective work and he still comes across in person as a man aflame over the world's injustice and more than a little impatient with those who fail to do something about it. **********He rails against the White House (\"I'd like to meet the guy there who made the calculated decision that this number of people should die from crack and heroin so we could have a victory in Central America.\"), the Justice Department (\"They used every tool at their disposal to slow us down.\") and the Senate under George Bush's thumb. (\"Here are subpoena rights that Congress has, a central part of the constitutional process, that have been allowed to atrophy.\") **********Mr. Blum's colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee have virtually nothing to say publicly about his work from 1987 to 1989 for Senator Kerry's Subcommitte on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations. \"On the record, Jack Blum was on the mark about B.C.C.I. as an investigator,\" one former supervisor, Jonathan M. Winer, said in a brief interview. Starting Off in Journalism **********Mr. Blum got his start as an investigator by founding a crusading newspaper near Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He sold it after he concluded that local journalism was financially too demanding, too objective and too toothless. He went to law school and landed at the Federal Communications Commission. **********Within months, Mr. Blum said, he had roiled the agency. When the newspaper columnist Jack Anderson heard of his complaints about waste and rubber-stamp renewal of broadcasting licenses and printed them -- and his name -- Mr. Blum says he began to feel unwelcome. **********He went to the Senate, where he spent seven years on a Judiciary subcommittee in an unsuccessful legislative crusade to break up the major oil companies and other locuses of corporate power before moving on to a Foriegn Relations panel and an investigation into the influence of multinational corporations on American foreign policy. **********There, he hit his stride, staging some of the splashiest hearings of the 1970's: on the ITT Corporation's efforts to rig national elections in Chile, the Lockheed Corporation's bribery of Japanese and Middle Eastern officials, big oil companies' attempts to shape American policy in the Middle East, and Arab nations' \"recycling\" of oil profits through international banks. **********\"It was a somewhat innocent time, when the bounders and crooks were just beginning to take root,\" he said. Private Law Practice **********He tired of the growing rigidity and pomposity of the Senate, he said, and entered private law practice in 1976, helping small gasoline marketers in battles with big oil companies. On the side, he advised a liberal research organization, the International Center for Development Policy, on third world issues. **********By the mid-1980's, he was helping the center investigate Mr. North's secret role in the contras' war in Nicaragua. Senator Kerry, also pursuing Mr. North, hired Mr. Blum in 1987 to head a broad inquiry into whether the White House had winked at drug-dealing by anti-Communist allies in Central America like Manuel Noriega. **********The reliability of some of that inquiry's less reputable witnesses became an object of nagging doubt, then hot dispute, said several Senate aides who spoke on condition of anonymity. But on the other fruits of the investigation -- the B.C.C.I. scandal -- no one disputes Mr. Blum's investigative nose.  A Convincing Interview **********An interview with a retired B.C.C.I. official left Mr. Blum convinced that the bank was involved in criminal activities and that it secretly controlled American financial instututions, including the biggest banking company in Washington, where Mr. Clifford, the Washington lawyer, was chairman. **********Mr. Blum relayed those suspicions to the Justice Department, which won a delay in Mr. Blum's subpoenas, arguing that they threatened the department's own investigations of B.C.C.I., of General Noriega and of drug-money laundering. **********Eventually, the material was produced, but it fell far short of Mr. Blum's expectations. **********\"My unhappiness became acute when we got to the end and it was clear there was a rush to get the investigation off the premises,\" said Mr. Blum, whose contract with the Senate panel expired in April 1989. But he insisted that it was not his impatience with Senators Pell and Kerry, but with the Justice Department, that then led him to go directly to Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, and lay out his case against B.C.C.I. **********\"He said that for various reasons the Senate was not going to be able to go forward and do an investigation,\" Mike Cherkasky, head of Mr. Morgenthau's investigative division, said in a telephone interview. Indictments Won in July **********Mr. Blum had left Senator Kerry a memo detailing the allegations against B.C.C.I.. The subcommittee pursued the case until Mr. Morgenthau won indictments in July. **********When Senator Kerry held his own televised hearings on the scandal this month, his first act was to thank Senator Pell \"for the consistent support that he has provided me.\" **********Then he summoned Mr. Blum to testify about his investigation of the bank. **********\"When they can produce more than I've produced,\" Mr. Blum said last week of his critics, \"then let 'em talk.\" A large part of his job, he says, is to draw attention to wrongdoing, and he does not pretend that each jot or tittle of his complaints is entirely accurate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/27/world/fight-over-water-rights-in-india-threatens-government-coalition.html": {"writer_name": "Sanjoy Hazarika", "pub_date": "1991-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 455, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fight Over Water Rights in India Threatens Government Coalition", "print_headline": "Fight Over Water Rights in India Threatens Government Coalition", "body_text": " **********A dispute over river water-sharing between two southern Indian states erupted into a bitter confrontation today, shaking the minority Government of Prime Minister P.

The water is needed to irrigate dry farmland in the delta of the Cauvery, which flows from its headwaters in Karnataka to the Bay of Bengal. More than 60,000 farming families are affected, one lawmaker said. Lawmakers Threaten to Quit **********P. N. Narayanan, a leader of the Tamil party that governs Tamil Nadu, said, \"The rights of the Tamils are more important than anything else, including this Government.\" **********Last month, the party, the All-India Anna Dravidra Muthera Kaghazam, allied with Congress to win a major victory in the Tamil Nadu elections. Today, 11 lawmakers from the regional group threatened to quit their seats, a move that would reduce pro-Congress strength to less than 230 in the 511-member ruling house of Parliament. Congress lawmakers from the state met Prime Minister Rao to demand tough action against Chief Minister S. Bangarappa. **********Congress and regional party legislators stormed out of the upper house of Parliament demanding the central Government's immediate intervention. Mr. Rao scheduled a visit to Tamil Nadu on Saturday to tackle the problem. **********Karnataka has denounced a judicial panel's recent interim award on water sharing and passed a law on Thursday night to protect the state's interests. **********The waters of the Cauvery, one of India's major rivers, have been troubled by disputes for decades although a 50-year agreement between the two neighboring states was concluded during British rule in 1924. That accord ended in 1974 and since then the two sides have resisted each other's demands for more water in tortuous legal and political battles. **********A tribunal, set up by New Delhi and agreed to by both disputing governments, was empowered to settle the dispute.

TAKES STEPS TO COMBAT ABUSES ON '900' NUMBERS", "body_text": " **********The Federal Communications Commission proposed rules today aimed at preventing fraud and deceit by companies that provide information and services through \"900\" telephone lines. **********There are \"900\" numbers that provide everything from stock quotations and sports scores to titillating sexual messages. They are among the fastest-growing segments of the telephone industry and are expected to generate revenues of more than $1 billion this year. But they have also garnered thousands of complaints from consumers who say they were misled about what they received and what they had to pay. **********Typically, advertisements are run to encourage people to obtain information by calling a number beginning with \"900.\" The calls cost anywhere from less than a dollar to more than $50, and charges are incurred as soon as a customer dials the number. Hang-Up Option Sought **********Under the new proposal, providers of \"900\" services would be required to introduce each call with an explanation of the prices and the services. The customer would then have a brief period to hang up without being charged for the call. **********The commission will accept comments from the public over the next several months and is expected to issue a final order before the end of the year. **********Representives of \"900\" services quickly protested the plan, saying the preamble would prompt many people to hang up without good reason, would annoy customers and would unnecessarily hamper the business. \"If you've got criminals and crooks breaking the law, throw the bums in jail, but don't throw the baby out with the bath water,\" said Bruce J. Fogel, chairman of Phone Programs Inc., of New York City, which provides sports and a variety of information on \"900\" lines throughout the country.  Proposal Called Reasonable **********But George Vinall, director of regulatory and external affairs for Telesphere Communications Inc., a long-distance carrier that relays the calls for many \"900\" companies, said, \"Based on what was in the commission's press announcement, I thought what they are proposing was eminently reasonable.\" **********The proposal would also require local telephone companies to allow customers to block all access to \"900\" numbers in their homes. The provision is a response to complaints by parents who say that their children rack up huge bills by calling such numbers without understanding the costs involved. The measure is not opposed by the industry, which does not consider it to be as onerous as the preamble proposal, **********The F.C.C. proposal would also require companies providing \"900\" service to instruct children in the preamble to hang up if they have not received parental permission to make the call. **********Finally, local telephone companies would not be allowed to cut off telephone service to customers who refuse to pay their \"900\" bills. The charges for such calls are automatically listed on a customer's local telephone bill, and the amounts collected are then distributed to the information providers. **********The F.C.C. has jurisdiction over interstate calls, like those usually made on \"900\" lines. Local pay-per-call services, mostly on lines with \"976\" and \"540\" prefixes which provide similar information as that offered on the national \"900\" numbers, are not under the commission's jurisdiction but are regulated by state utilities. **********The commission also asked for comment today on similar rules for \"700\" party lines, which allow many people to participate in group conversations and often involve interstate calls. And it also sought comment on the possibility of restricting computerized marketing systems that dial numbers automatically and play long sales pitches.  Many Legitimate Services **********To be sure, most of the new \"900\" services are entirely legitimate, and recognizing that, the commissioners emphasized that they did not want to put the industry out of business with overly burdensome rules. Yet the F.C.C.'s action reflects a growing concern among Government officials and in Congress about abuses by pay-per-call services. **********The Federal Trade Commission, which has authority over deceptive and fraudulent marketing practices, has sued to stop operations at four companies since last July, accusing them of deceptive practices in connection with using pay-per-call services to tout job listings and gold credit cards. Officials say more investigations are under way. Congress, meanwhile, is weighing legislation that would impose restraints similar to those proposed by the F.C.C., as well as some additional ones. **********In one of the F.T.C. cases, the agency charged that Transworld Courier Service Inc. of Roswell, Ga., ran newspaper ads offering construction jobs and listing a toll-free number for applicants. The civil suit contended that callers were then instructed to call \"900\" numbers without being told they would be charged $18 a call. In one case, F.T.C. officials said, a person made repeated calls, running up a bill of $180. The F.T.C. won a temporary court order freezing the company's assets and ordering it to stop such practices, but the litigation is still in progress. No one answered calls to Transworld. **********In another case, the F.T.C. said that two Baltimore companies, First Capital Financial Inc. and Midas Financial, had advertised on television and in newspapers that people who called a special number would get gold credit cards similar to those offered by American Express or Mastercard. The call itself cost $49.95, and callers received a card that could be used to buy goods only from catalogues distributed by the two companies. The F.T.C. also won court orders to freeze the firms' assets and stop those activities. Phone listings could not be found today for either company. **********Members of Congress are weighing legislation that would include the F.C.C. proposals and several other provisions. A bill sponsored by Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee, would require the long-distance companies that relay calls for \"900\" services to review the advertising content of messages being relayed. Another provision would place a price cap on \"900\" services directed at children."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/04/business/key-rates-685591.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/24/business/mutual-funds-the-allure-of-dull-little-stocks.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1991-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 768, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mutual Funds; The Allure of 'Dull' Little Stocks", "print_headline": "Mutual Funds; The Allure of 'Dull' Little Stocks", "body_text": " **********Their cluttered offices are just a few steps from Central Park, in the heart of Manhattan, but their true address could be Main Street, U.S.A. Listen to how money managers Chuck Royce and Tom Ebright describe their favorite stocks. Mr. Ebright: \"Not sexy, not exciting, real Middle America.\" Mr. Royce: \"We don't own anything that ends with 'tech.' \" **********Funds that specialize in small companies usually buy stocks that are, well, sexy and exciting and often end with \"tech.\" But at the $125 million Royce Value Trust, the $150 million Royce Fund and the managers' flagship $500 million Pennsylvania Mutual Fund, small \"dull\" companies are the gist of things. **********The two managers depart from another small-company tradition, too. They keep a tight lid on risk -- and that makes them a good bet for risk-averse investors who nevertheless want to tap into the long-awaited small-company rally that began last month. **********\"They're not gunslingers; they buy cheap, high-quality companies, which explains why they do well in the long term,\" said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., a Chicago-based mutual fund consulting firm. **********How has this contrarian approach worked? Very badly in 1990, when Pennsylvania Mutual dropped 11.5 percent, compared with a 10.8 percent drop in all small-company funds, according to Morningstar. But superbly over time: The fund has a one-and-a-half percentage-point edge over its peers for the five years ended Dec. 31, 1990. Over 10 years, it had an average annual return of 13.6 percent, compared with 7.1 percent for all small-company funds and 10.7 percent for all stock funds. **********Part of the dismal 1990 performance was a result of the fund's huge portfolio, several hundred stocks divided among various industries and companies, a division meant to lower risk. The fund's biggest holding equals less than 1 percent of its assets, a philosophy at odds with most small-company funds, which tend to make big bets, hoping for big returns, by owning fewer stocks. **********Another part comes from Pennsylvania Mutual's lack of high-flying stocks, especially in last year's winning biotech sector, combined with the general slump in small-company stocks. **********\"Tech\" stocks are favorites of most small-company funds, which usually are run by managers who -- unlike the Royce-Ebright duo -- fall into the growth or emerging growth camps. Small companies that develop new products or services can experience explosive growth because they start from such a small base. On the other hand, these investments are very volatile and can fall as hard as they rise. **********Mr. Royce, who is 51 years old, and Mr. Ebright, 46, are value managers who look for discrepancies between a company's worth and its market price. \"When we do our analysis, we focus on how much we can lose, not on how much money we can make,\" Mr. Royce said. Their dream holding, he said, is \"a small company in a basic industry, growing 10 percent annually, that looks dowdy because it's very financially conservative.\" **********As Mr. Ebright put it, \"We buy companies with low leverage and excess cash flow. And to lower risk, we stick with lesser-known companies and avoid the high-traffic stocks, which have large institutional ownership and are very volatile.\" **********Clearly, they have a long-term view. Their average holding period is four or five years, among the longest in the industry, and they have owned one stock, the Block Drug Company, of Jersey City, N.J., for 15 years. Block, whose main products are Poli-Grip and Dentu-Grip, over-the-counter dental products, is a low-cost producer with high margins and low expenses. **********Another favorite: Farmer Brothers, a Torrance, Calif.-based distributor of coffee and spices with the dominant market share of institutional coffee sales on the West Coast.  The two managers also like the Pittsburgh-based Mine Safety Appliances Company, which started out manufacturing safety goggles, then expanded to hard hats and air-quality monitoring devices. As workplace safety became more of an issue, the company's market grew, Mr. Ebright says. **********International Aluminum, of Monterey, Calif., which makes aluminum-extruded products like window frames and storefronts, is another pick.

Nobody is suggesting, said Dan Halperin, an Israeli consultant in Tel Aviv, that \"lifting the boycott today will have a major impact tomorrow.\" **********And while an Israeli business group said this week that the boycott has cost Israel more than $36 billion since 1948, some Government officials, like Amnon Neubach, the Israeli economic counselor in Washington, say they are not sure that the Arab ban has hurt Israel measurably. **********Egypt and Saudi Arabia had proposed ending the 43-year-old economic boycott of Israel if Israel freezes further settlements in the West Bank. Israel has rejected that proposal, but if the talk about peace produces any agreements with Syria and Jordan, the boycott could start to come down. **********The Arab ban covers all direct trade with Israel, dealings with most companies that do business with Israel, as well as with firms that buy or sell to, or invest in, companies that do business with Israel.  Boom Not Expected **********Economists, investment experts and executives, including Mr. Bruno and Mr. Halperin, argue that, in time, ending the boycott could lift confidence among foreign investors, stimulate more service ventures, and improve the prospects for Palestinian exporters in the West Bank and in Gaza. **********To be sure, economists are not predicting an Israeli export boom in the region. Most Israeli exports -- diamonds, electronics, pharmaceuticals -- are geared to upscale markets in Europe and the United States, not to neighbors like Jordan or Syria whose living standards are roughly one-tenth of Israel's. **********Trade between Israel and Egypt, except for oil, remains negligable more than a decade after Egypt broke ranks with other Arab nations and dropped out of the boycott. Besides, the most eager buyers and sellers on either side of the Israeli-Arab divide are already finding ways to make hundreds of millions of dollars worth of transactions regardless. **********The biggest benefit for the Israeli economy, said Walter P. Stern, a New York investment adviser, is likely to be an intangible one, greater investor confidence. The end of the boycott would be \"a long term signal of Israel's re-entry into the world as a legitimate place to trade and invest.\" 'Psychological Barriers' **********Jean Abi Nader of the United States Arab Chamber of Commerce said, \"It would lift psychological barriers to companies that want to do business in both markets.\" **********Multinationals that have refrained from making investments in Israel -- especially Japanese, Korean and French firms -- may take a second look, Israeli economists say. With a few exceptions like I.B.M. and Motorola, foreign direct investment is small. **********\"You would see the involvement in Israel of more multinational companies, especially in industries where you don't see them at all,\" said Dan Halperin an Israeli consultant in Tel Aviv. \"It will also become easier for Israeli firms to buy knowhow from international companies.\" **********What is more, Israel's credit rating could get a welcome boost, Mr. Bruno said. Lenders, he said, would likely be less reluctant to risk their funds. Israel is struggling to create jobs for hundreds of thousands of new Soviet immigrants and is looking to the rest of the world to supply some of the needed investment.  High-Skilled Labor Advantage **********Consumers in Saudi Arabia or Syria may not be about to start stocking up on Israeli brands for which there are easy substitutes, economists say. But, Israeli services, from computer programming and insurance to medical services and tourism and agricultural may find a more ready reception. **********\"Israel has a comparative advantage in services because of its high skilled labor,\" said Leonardo Liederman, an economist at Tel Aviv University. With the influx of Soviet doctors, engineers and scientists, such services are apt to become even more affordable and abundant. **********The total volume of imports and exports could swell by $1 billion if the boycott ends, said Haim Ben-Shahar, professor of economist at Tel Aviv University. Total trade last year was about $37 billion. **********Surprisingly, some of the biggest winners of a cease-fire in the Arab economic war against Israel could be Palestinians in the Gaza and West Bank. Small businesses there produce things that Arab neighbors can afford to buy -- fruit, vegetables, olive oil, cut stone, clothing and shoes. **********\"These are natural traders,\" said Howard Rosen, an economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. \"The boycott hurt Palestinian trade much more than Israel's.\" **********Palestininas now find their exports to Arab countries blocked for a variety of reasons related to the boycott, like relying on Israeli ports, using inputs made in Israel or being required by the Israeli Government to sell produce through Israeli cooperatives. **********\"I could imagine an export boom,\" said Peter Gubser, president of Near East Refugee Aid. \"You'd see a lot of products with some Israeli inputs going out under a West Bank label.\" **********A spurt in export-related production on the West Bank and in Gaza would be blessing because, due to the Palestinian uprising as well as the Soviet immigrant wave, unemployment among Palestinians is rising."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/06/business/company-news-blue-cross-offer-to-great-republic.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Blue Cross Offer To Great Republic", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Blue Cross Offer To Great Republic", "body_text": " **********Blue Cross of California said it was negotiating to offer health insurance to 25,000 policyholders of the Great Republic Insurance Company, the troubled insurer that was seized by state regulators this week.

Schaeffer, a director of Ernst & Young who addressed the New York Chapter of the International Association for Financial Planning, examined the performance of different assets from 1971 through 1990. **********In that 20 years inflation ran at an annual rate of 6.26 percent, he said, while the compound annual return of Treasury bills was 7.66 percent, long-term Government bonds 8.71 percent, stocks as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index 11.15 percent and gold 12.44 percent. The gold figures, of course, were skewed in the 1970's when the dollar was no longer tied to the gold standard, and gold subsequently surged; in the 1980's it lost 3.98 percent in value. **********\"A client seeing this may just decide, 'I should put all my money in the stock market,' \" he said. But that could be the wrong decision because of the market's volatility. The market could well be down just when the investor needed the money. **********The way to iron out that volatility is to diversify, putting money in assets that hold their own during economic cycles when stocks are being pummeled. Using charts and numbers from Ibbotson Associates, Mr. Schaeffer said a portfolio that was split into 20 percent Treasury bills, 28 percent long-term Government bonds, 47 percent stocks and 5 percent gold would have yielded 10.39 percent over the 20 years. At the same time, its volatility, as measured by standard deviation, would have been 9.26 percent, compared with 16.13 percent for the stock portfolio. **********Every $1,000 invested in the diversified portfolio would have grown to $7,221, while every $1,000 in a pure stock portfolio would have grown to $8,283. By reducing my return 14 percent, I've reduced volatility 43 percent,\" he said. **********That particular asset mix is not a formula for everyone. Mr. Schaeffer advised investment professionals to allocate assets for individuals after assessing their risk tolerance, investment objectives and profiling such personal characteristics as age and stage in career, liquidity requirements, size of portfolio, annual cash flow and tax bracket. **********Many people, fearful of the risk of losing money in the stock market, retreat to the perceived safety of Treasury bills or money-market funds, he noted, overlooking the risk of inflation. After taxes, \"history suggests that Treasury bills will not outperform inflation,\" he said. **********The way to prevent the real value of holdings from being eroded by inflation, he said, is to accept other risks -- market, business, interest-rate, credit and liquidity risks -- and to balance one against the other by careful asset allocation, using technologies available today. **********After Mr. Schaeffer's talk, four investment professionals discussed asset allocation. **********Martin Jaffe, senior vice president and chief operating officer of Wood, Struthers & Winthrop, the investment management subsidiary of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said, \"Today it is cheaper to have an individual manager than a mutual fund.\" **********An individually managed portfolio can be sensitive to the investor's corporate holdings and tax situation, he said, and importantly for fixed-income investments, a direct holding provides the protection of maturity not present in funds. **********Dick Rubenstein, representing the Oppenheimer Asset Allocation Fund, described the sophisticated strategies a large fund is able to use. These include interest rate futures and derivative securities to control risk and investments in international markets for diversification and the potential of higher returns, like those now enjoyed by Canadian bonds. **********\"You have to discipline yourself to buy when it's bad and lighten up when it's good,\" he said, \"because the mrket is a discount mechanism -- not looking at what's going on but where it's going.\" **********Lewis J.

That has made it harder to use stolen credit cards and other devices to tap into phone company lines directly without authorization. **********In search of easier targets, intruders have shifted their focus to office systems known as PBX's, which stands for private branch exchanges. **********\"It is by far the largest segment of communications fraud,\" said Rami Abuhamdeh, an independent consultant and until recently executive director of the Communications Fraud Control Association in McLean, Va. \"You have all this equipment just waiting to answer your calls, and it is being run by people who are not in the business of securing telecommunications.\" **********While there are no precise measures of how widespread the new problem is, scores of corporations and other organizations have fallen victim to such crime in the last several years. The Mitsubishi International Corporation reported losing $430,000 last summer, mostly from calls to Egypt and Pakistan. The Procter & Gamble Company lost $300,000 in l988. The New York City Human Resources Administration lost $529,000 in l987. And the Secret Service, which investigates such telephone crime, says it is now receiving three to four formal complaints every week, and is adding more telephone specialists. Carrier Backed by F.C.C. **********Some victims have tried to make the phone companies or the equipment makers shoulder the costs, but they have had little success. In its only ruling on the issue thus far, the Federal Communications Commission decided in May that the long-distance carrier was entitled to collect the bill for illegal calls from the company that was victimized. **********In the closely watched Mitsubishi case filed in June, the company sued the American Telephone and Telegraph Company for $10 million in the Federal District Court in Manhattan, arguing that not only had it made the equipment through which outsiders entered Mitsubishi's phone system, but that A.T.& T., the maker of the switching equipment, had also been paid to maintain the equipment.  Financially Overwhelming **********For smaller companies, with fewer resources than Mitsubishi, the problems can be financially overwhelming. For example, the WRL Group, a small software development company in Arlington, Va., found itself charged for 5,470 calls it did not make this spring after it installed a toll-free \"800\" telephone number and a voice mail recording system machine to receive incoming calls. Within three weeks, the intruders had run up a bill of $106,776. to U S Sprint, a United Telecommunications unit. **********WRL's customers had barely begun to use the new numbers before the phones took on a life of their own. Hundreds of calls suddenly started pouring in, mostly from the New York metropolitan area. Instead of trying to reach the company, however, callers essentially hijacked the phone line and made outbound long-distance calls to Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Colombia. Even more surprising to experts, they had managed to log 129,315 minutes of talking time over one line -- a seemingly impossible feat, because it equaled an average of roughly three calls going out simultaneously every minute of the day. **********\"My average bill is around $500,\" William Rogers, WRL's president, said in bewilderment. \"If this is real, very simply, my company will have to declare bankruptcy.\"  Used by Pirate Companies **********Phone service theft was once used mostly by computer hackers to make long-distance calls without paying for them. But such techniques are increasingly being used to operate pirate telephone companies. The pirate operations charge customers $5, $10 or $20 apiece to make calls anywhere in the world. **********These \"call-sell\" operations, as Government officials refer to them, are run from public telephone booths and from individual apartments. The greatest concentration is in the New York metropolitan area. In many cases, authorities say, the telephone bandits market their stolen long-distance service to low-income immigrants who want to call home cheaply. Drug dealers, interested in concealing their international calls, are also believed to be big customers. **********In the past, long-distance carriers bore most of the cost, since the thefts were attributed to weaknesses in their networks. But now, the phone companies are arguing that the customers should be liable for the cost of the calls, because they failed to take proper security precautions on their equipment. **********The basic principles of breaking into PBX switches and voice mail systems are well-known to experts. Often, the intruders begin by searching for toll-free \"800\" numbers that are connected to a company's automated call-routing system. In many cases, they use high-speed dialing devices that can test hundreds of numbers automatically.  Access Codes Figured Out **********Once the intruders locate a PBX or voice mail system, they proceed to figure out the access codes that will allow them to obtain outbound long-distance lines. In many systems, the principal target for hackers is the feature that is intended to allow employees to obtain a long-distance line from outside the office. The appeal of this feature is that calling a company's own PBX is cheaper than using telephone credit cards. **********Voice mail systems, which act like sophisticated answering machines for an entire office, have other weaknesses. Experts say even those that are not intended to provide remote access can be manipulated to offer outside lines. In some cases, the machines give the caller a momentary dial tone as it forwards calls to an outside number. Experienced hackers can seize the line in that moment and hold onto it to make endless numbers of calls. **********Experts in communications security say it is hard to track down the principal culprits once theft occurs, but that it is usually preventable. \"A lot of times, companies go out and buy systems without understanding them,\" said Paul DeMatteis, a former security consultant who is now director of Telecommunications Security/Special Projects for the New York City Human Resource Administration. \"Any large corporation, I think you can say, has problems. They don't all admit to it, but they've got problems.\"  Tighter Security Urged **********To combat unauthorized access, the long-distance carriers and equipment manufacturers have been urging corporate customers to tighten their security in a number of ways. They can increase the number of digits in access codes, program their computers to block calls to places where the company has no business and shut down the remote-access feature at nights or on weekends. In addition, the companies can monitor their daily traffic to spot unusual surges of activity. **********Some consultants urge companies to install devices that will verify outsiders' locations by calling them back before giving them outgoing lines. **********\"We don't have control over the customer's PBX,\" said Robert Fox, assistant vice president of corporate security at U S Sprint. \"We can't listen in on a customer's calls. We have to carry all that traffic.\" **********Nevertheless, the last several years have produced a thriving market in \"hot\" \"800\" numbers, access codes and how-to tips on the weaknesses of different systems.  Weaknesses Described **********Consumertronics, a mail order company in Alamogordo, N.M., sells brochures for $29 that describe the general principles of voice mail hacking and the particular weaknesses of different models. Included in the brochure is a list of \"800\" numbers along with the kind of voice mail systems to which they are connected. **********\"It's for educational purposes,\" said the company's owner, John Williams, adding that he accepts Mastercard and Visa. Similar insights can be obtained from 2600 Magazine, a quarterly publication devoted to telephone hacking that is published in Middle Island, L.I. **********But the Mitsubishi case against A.T.& T. suggests that even sophisticated users can be victims. Because Mitsubishi had a maintenance contract with A.T.& T., it says, A.T.& T. kept a representative on its site at all times. Mitsubishi contends that unauthorized intruders began blocking legitimate access to the remote-access feature in early July, but A.T.& T. executives thought the problems stemmed from other sources. The suspicion of unauthorized intruders did not appear until later that month, Mitsubishi said, when the New York Telephone Company, a Nynex Corporation unit, warned Mitsubishi officials about the possibility.  '99 Percent Preventable' **********A.T.& T. officials have not responded in detail to the suit, though the company continues to insist that the customer is responsible for setting up proper security procedures. \"We believe that PBX fraud is 99 percent preventable with proper system administration,\" said Jim McGann, an A.T.& T. spokesman. **********Meanwhile, the incident involving Mr. Rogers' small company, the WRL Group, in Virginia, raises the question of whether all of the problem is inside corporate computer systems, or whether phone thieves may also be manipulating computers operated by the local telephone company. In theory, the company's single line should not have been able to carry what amounted to three calls at the same time. But the company was also using Centrex, a call-routing service offered by all the Bell telephone companies, which works much like an office PBX. **********Stephen Clark, a communications consultant hired by Mr. Rogers, argues that the unauthorized callers may have been able to manipulate the Centrex computer to free the office line once the telephone company had established a connection to the long-distance carrier. \"What I'm saying is that in this particular case, someone had to access their computers,\" Mr. Clark said. \"It's the only logical explanation.\" **********Executives at the Bell Atlantic Corporation said they did not believe their system was to blame. A more likely situation, they said, was that the victims employed several lines that might have been linked in ways they did not fully understand. **********\"There simply cannot be a single outgoing line that routes multiple calls at once,\" said Kenneth Pitt, a Bell Atlantic spokesman. \"What they think they have, what they're supposed to have and what they do have may not be the same thing.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/05/business/bankers-expected-to-stay-hesitant-to-lend-for-years.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1991-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1562, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANKERS EXPECTED TO STAY HESITANT TO LEND FOR YEARS", "print_headline": "BANKERS EXPECTED TO STAY HESITANT TO LEND FOR YEARS", "body_text": " **********Just as the bank failures in the Depression years bred a generation of conservative bankers, the new banking crisis is creating a cautiousness among lenders that bankers themselves say may slow the flow of loans long after the recession ends. **********Many factors affect a bank's willingness to lend, from the health of the bank to the size of its underlying capital base. But none are as important as the mindset of the bankers themselves. And there is widespread evidence that that mindset has changed in a way that may transform banking for months or years to come. **********There has been a trauma, and that trauma will make bankers cautious for a period of time,\" said Robert Hawkins, president of the Southern Commercial Bank of St. Louis. Wary of Loose Lending **********The caution in banking circles represents a shift away from the free-lending approach of the heady 1980's and a return to more traditional banking standards. **********What had loosened banking standards was partly deregulation, and partly the increased tendency of the most creditworthy corporations to borrow directly from the credit markets, bypassing the banks. Pressed for business, the banks looked elsewhere for customers, competing to make higher-risk loans, including many in real estate -- a strategy that cost the banks dearly in loan defaults. **********The new caution among lenders showed up repeatedly in 25 interviews with bankers, corporate finance officers and Government officials. It is a caution that goes far beyond the credit tightening of the last year that the banks have often attributed to Government regulators. Even Big Banks Change **********Even large, healthy banks say they are changing their ways. \"In all types of lending, the price -- the interest rate -- is not only higher, but the terms of the transactions are becoming tougher and will remain so,\" said Lewis Coleman, vice chairman of the Bank of America in San Francisco. **********For consumers, the new caution shows itself in such things as slightly higher rates on bank credit cards -- they have already risen by nearly a percentage point in the last year, to an average of 19.6 percent -- smaller lines of credit and a growing reluctance to issue new credit cards to people who already hold one or two others. **********\"They are target marketing to those with higher incomes and good credit records,\" said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America. \"In terms of ZIP codes, instead of mailing down 80 percent of the income ladder, as they used to do, they mail down 50 percent or 40 percent.\" **********Lenders are also requiring higher incomes from home buyers seeking mortgages, and often larger down payments. They are declaring that any borrower, consumer or corporate, will have to show higher levels of income in the 1990's to qualify for loans than in the 1980's. And bankers increasingly are putting limits on how much they will lend to even the most creditworthy corporations. **********\"If someone wants $50 million from us, they have a tough sell on their hands,\" said Jerry Jordan, chief economist at the First Interstate Bank Corporation in California, where lending officers once could make such loans without higher management's approval. \"We are trying to limit how much exposure we have to any borrower.\" Outgrowing Fear **********How long might this caution last? The estimates run from two or three years to the end of the decade. \"Once there are enough new faces in banking who did not experience the current crisis, lending will ease up again,\" said Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow and banking specialist at the Brookings Institution. **********Many experts argue that not only the nation's banks, but also two other major sources of loans, insurance companies and private finance companies, are simply returning to the lending standards that prevailed before the 1980's -- forced into doing so by the numerous loan defaults that threaten the survival of many banks. As Mr. Coleman put it, \"I am making loans today with a feeling of deja vu.\" Low Inflation a Factor **********The earlier cutback in lending had largely been a result of Government rules that in effect limited lending at banks with insufficient capital or labeled as risky many loans that in the 1980's went unchallenged by bank regulators. **********These obstacles still exist. But other forces are also kicking in to prolong the lending cutback, chief among them the defensive reaction to the trauma of bad loans and bank failures. The failures have occurred in a more concentrated fashion than at any time since the Great Depression. **********Low inflation, expected to endure well into the decade, is also playing a major role, especially in real estate lending. Property is not appreciating the way it did in the late 70's and early 80's. High inflation made real estate loans low risks and masked any mistakes a lender might have made in granting the loans. Now weaker prices have often made homes and machinery worth less than the loans floated a year or two ago to purchase them. **********The greater care in lending probably will dampen the economic recovery, once it materializes, because of less credit for corporate operations and consumer spending. For the longer term, the result is likely to be weaker economic growth in the early 1990's than in the 1980's. Growth of Debt Reduced **********The credit shortage has already helped to reduce the growth of all outstanding debt in the United States, except that owed by the Federal Government and the lenders themselves, to an annual rate of less than 4 percent, according to Federal Reserve data. That is less than half the growth rate for debt in the late 1980's. **********The slowdown is partly a result of the scramble by many banks to raise cash to reimburse depositors whose money has been lent out and lost in unrepaid loans. Citibank is engaged in this scramble, and the experience is changing its long-term lending standards, said Michael Callen, a senior executive in corporate lending. \"The mistake the banks made in the 1980's was to move downscale and lend to less creditworthy companies,\" he said. \"The banks were not recognizing the level of risks and appropriately pricing for it.\" **********To recognize the risks, Citibank has increased interest rates for many commercial loans, with some companies whose credit ratings are of less than top quality paying two to four percentage points more than the bank once offered, Mr. Callen said. **********Such caution is similarly in vogue for healthy lenders. Many institutions, for example, are trying to keep down the levels of unpaid debt on bank credit cards, in part by trying to issue the cards to higher-income people likely to pay their bills every month, said Diane Casey, executive director of the Independent Bankers Association, which represents 10,000 midsized banks. \"You try to issue cards to people who don't really need them,\" she said. **********Similarly, General Electric Capital, a healthy lending company whose activities include financing charge-card operations for retailers like Montgomery Ward, is monitoring income levels of card holders and limiting credit to low-income households, said James A. Park, G.E. Capital's senior vice president of finance. **********Many banks are no longer lending out as big a proportion of their deposits as they did in the 1980's, a cutback that allows them to be more selective. Deposits instead are often invested in Government securities. First Interstate is in this category, and so is Southern Commercial in St. Louis. Southern Commercial once lent 90 percent of its deposits, which total $180 million today. Now the proportion is 80 percent. **********\"We don't have the loan demand today and even if we did, I would be nervous about getting back up to that level,\" said Mr. Hawkins, who is also president-elect of the Independent Bankers Association. The 'Club Loan' **********The multibillion-dollar bank loan, once common for corporate takeovers and huge commercial real estate projects, is also more difficult to obtain, although big sums can still be raised by creditworthy companies through new bond issues.  In the 1980's, a major bank would underwrite a multibillion-dollar loan and then quickly syndicate it, selling off shares to other institutions. Now the syndicated loan has become what Mr. Coleman of Bank of America describes as the \"club loan.\" **********\"The banks all sit down with the borrower and decide how much each will take, before the loan is made,\" Mr. Coleman said. And the amounts involved are much smaller. In the late 80's, there were syndicated loans put together in excess of $5 billion, and now the top is about $2 billion, he said. **********Even the nation's most creditworthy companies, among them the Colgate-Palmolive Corporation, are feeling the pinch. They often raise money on their own, by selling i.o.u.'s known as commercial paper, which currently total more than $550 billion. **********Colgate-Palmolive's i.o.u.'s are in such demand that the consumer products giant is paying less than 6 percent interest annually on $100 million in borrowings, said Brian Heidtke, the company's treasurer. By comparison, the banking industry's prime rate for loans to good corporate customers is 8.5 percent and many companies say they now have to pay above that level. **********But any corporation, no matter how creditworthy, traditionally lines up a bank guarantee to assure holders of commercial paper that they will be repaid should disaster strike the company. Lately the banks are making these guarantees more expensive and publicly warning that they will not pay off under certain conditions. Mr. Heidtke, for example, says that when Colgate-Palmolive renews its current $460 million standby credit, the nearly $600,000 annual fee will probably double."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/16/business/media-business-advertising-addenda-nynex-unit-chooses-3-finalists-for-account.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nynex Unit Chooses 3 As Finalists for Account", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Nynex Unit Chooses 3 As Finalists for Account", "body_text": " **********Nynex Mobile Communications, Orangeburg, N.Y., has selected Amil Gargano & Partners, Ammirati & Puris Inc. and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, all of New York, as finalists for its $8 million to $10 million account, an advertising executive who insisted on anonymity said yesterday. **********The three agencies were chosen over five others in the review: Lohmeyer Simpson Communications Inc., Morristown, N.J., one of three incumbent agencies; Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc., Boston and New York; Grey Advertising Inc., New York; Lintas New York, and Ogilvy & Mather, New York. **********A winner is expected to be named later this month."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/13/world/strauss-will-give-up-4-million-in-salary-to-take-post-in-moscow.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1991-07-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 794, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Strauss Will Give Up $4 Million In Salary to Take Post in Moscow", "print_headline": "Strauss Will Give Up $4 Million In Salary to Take Post in Moscow", "body_text": " **********Robert S. Strauss will take a pay cut of more than $4 million and step down from seven corporate boards on his confirmation as the next United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union, according to a financial statement that he recently filed with the Government. **********Mr. Strauss's financial disclosure statement, which was made public this week and reported today in The Washington Post, details what is already widely known: the 72-year-old lawyer is a power broker of abundant wealth and envious political and corporate connections. It shows that as advertised the Soviets will be receiving a consummate capitalist, and one that as anticipated has some potentially awkward connections. **********Emerging from the disclosure statement is a portrait of a lawyer whose clients include the solid citizens and the high flyers of Wall Street (Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Goldman, Sachs and Company, Forstmann Little & Company, Morgan Stanley Group Inc.), the glitziest of Hollywood (MCA Inc., the Motion Picture Association of America), the biggest of corporate America (Northrop, Westinghouse Electric Corporation and Pepsico) and several Japanese powerhouses (Fujitsu, Matsushita Electric Industrial Company). **********\"It is impossible to determine with any precision all of the clients for which I have personally rendered more than $5,000 in services during the reported period,\" Mr. Strauss said in an attachment to the disclosure statement, because unlike all the other lawyers in his firm, he does not bill by the hour. In consultation with his partners, Mr. Strauss listed 30 companies -- from American Airlines to the Xerox Corporation -- that they could identify \"to the best of our recollection.\" Oil and Gas Investments **********His investments range from a wide array of oil and gas interests, stock in many of the nation's largest corporations, and a stable of racehorses in which he is a partner with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. **********The disclosure statement also makes clear that Mr. Strauss could be in an awkward position when he goes to Moscow because of his close connections to corporations and business executives with long ties to the Soviet Union. Among the companies in which Mr. Strauss has substantial stock holdings and companies on whose board he has served are Pepsico and the Archer-Daniels-Midland Corporation, the large agricultural exporter. Both are among the largest American companies with business ties to Moscow. **********In a letter attached to his disclosure statement, Mr. Strauss said that he would sell his Pepsico and Archer Daniels stock, which he values at more than $1.5 million, and that he is \"sensitive to the need to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.\" **********Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman of Archer-Daniels, and Mr. Strauss are old friends. With the help of Mr. Andreas, Mr. Strauss obtained a cooperative apartment at the Seaview Hotel in Bal Harbour, Fla. Mr. Andreas, one of the founders and officers of the cooperative, also helped obtain apartments for Senator Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader; Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the former Speaker, and Howard H. Baker Jr., former Senate Republican leader.  At Least $13 Million in Holdings **********But left unsaid is how hospitable Mr. Strauss will be toward executives and old friends, like Donald M. Kendall of Pepsico and Mr. Andreas when they visit Moscow. In the past, they have received the royal treatment from the American Embassy. **********Mr. Strauss's letter, which was sent to the State Department, also said that his oil and gas investments would preclude him from \"any official matter that has or could have a direct and predictable effect on the price of domestic oil or gas.\" **********Mr. Strauss said in a brief interview this afternoon that \"it would be inappropriate\" to discuss how he will handle visits to the Soviet Union from the companies that he has represented or served. **********The disclosure statement lists assets and income in general categories of value, making it impossible to precisely calculate Mr. Strauss's worth. At a minimum, Mr. Strauss holds investments and assets that he values at more than $13 million and earned more than $2.5 million in the last 18 months in income outside his law practice. **********Mr. Strauss also said that as senior partner at Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, he received $4.5 million in the last 18 months. When he leaves the firm to go to Moscow, he will receive a severance package of $1.4 million. **********The Ambassador's salary is $115,300. **********Mr. Strauss said in his disclosure statement that he would put many of his assets in a blind trust and that he would remove himself from any Government business having to do with his investments until the trust was set up. He listed more than 40 companies in which he has investments that would be put in the trust, including RJR Nabisco, Xerox and Reader's Digest."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/30/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-006591.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 82, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Saks Fifth Avenue, New York, a division of Investcorp, Bahrain, to Margeotes Fertitta & Weiss Inc., New York, for the creative portion of its advertising account.

Nelson of Raleigh, N.C., could bring suit against the Saudi Government for what he says was a severe beating during his 1984 imprisonment.  Letter to Baker From Saudi **********Two weeks after the ruling and just after the end of the Persian Gulf war, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador in Washington, wrote a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d seeking his help in the case. The department and lawyers for the Saudi Government have acknowledged the existence of the letter but declined to release it, saying it is a confidential diplomatic communication. The embassy followed up with other letters and telephone calls, department officials said. **********Last week, the Bush Administration formally entered the case of Scott Nelson v. Saudi Arabia, asking the three-judge panel to reconsider its February decision or, alternatively, to have the case heard before the entire 11-member court. **********Mr. Nelson, who is 37 years old, said that Saudi officials beat him on the knees with a rod until his bones cracked and tortured him further by beating the soles of his feet.

Even before the gulf war, American diplomats had been especially cautious in dealing with the Riyadh Government's concerns. **********In 1988, for example, the State Department recalled the Ambassador, Hume A. Horan, because some Saudi leaders were not comfortable with him. \"It's not easy to get along with kings,\" a State Department official explained at the time. **********Professor D'Amato said Mr. Nelson was \"tortured for doing his job.\" Mr. Nelson was hired in the United States to monitor safety systems at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh and contends that he was arrested and tortured because he embarrassed hospital officials by reporting faulty seals on oxygen valves. Saudi Denial **********Saudi Embassy officials deny that Mr. Nelson was ever mistreated during his 39-day confinement.

But President Corazon C. Aquino effectively extended the American lease by calling for a national referendum on the base's future. **********In a vote of 12 to 11, the Senate adopted a motion to spurn the new treaty, which would allow thousands of American troops to remain at the base for another 10 years. The current treaty on Subic Bay, the largest American military installation in the Philippines, expires today. **********\"The treaty is defeated,\" the Senate President, Jovito R. Salonga, announced in a solemn tone after the vote was taken this morning in a show of hands. The decision was greeted with applause and tears in the chamber.  Anger Over Compensation **********The 11 senators who voted in favor of the new treaty were 5 short of the two-thirds majority needed for ratification. **********The vote reflected a view among many senators that the compensation package offered by the United States was too small and, more broadly, that it was time to end an American military presence that began when the United States acquired the Philippines by winning the Spanish-American war. **********In voting to spurn the new treaty, Senator Agapito Aquino, brother-in-law of the President and younger brother of her slain husband, Benigno S. Aquino, described the decision as \"the dawn of our nation's birth.\"  Ending an 'Adolescence' **********\"It is a vote for a truly sovereign and independent Philippine nation,\" he told colleagues in a speech on the Senate floor. \"It is a vote to end a political adolescence tied to the purse strings of America -- a crippling dependence.\" **********But Mrs. Aquino's call for a referendum under the terms of the Philippine Constitution has the effect of extending the deadline for an American departure by at least several months, and quite possibly for several years. **********Invoking the rallying cry of \"people power\" that she used with such success in ousting President Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1986, Mrs. Aquino proposed in a televised address Sunday night that \"we take the issue directly to the people.\" **********\"Once again people power is being called upon,\" Mrs. Aquino said. \"As in 1986, we seek the direct expression of the sovereign will of the Filipino people. Now, as in the past, every one of us must participate in an exercise that gives added substance to the democracy we have established.\" **********The referendum could not be held until late this year or in 1992. Mrs. Aquino's move is expected to set off a series of time-consuming court challenges by lawmakers and others who assert that the Constitution permits voters to overrule a vote by the Senate on a regular law, but not on a treaty.  U.S. Stand Called Flexible **********While the Bush Administration indicated last week that it would start an immediate and irrevocable withdrawal from Subic if the Philippine Senate vetoed the 10-year treaty, Western diplomats said in recent days that the American position was actually far more flexible, and that American troops would probably remain at the base until after a referendum. Interim arrangements for compensation to the Philippines were unclear. **********The base, home to more than 7,000 Americans -- servicemen and women and civilian workers -- is a major refueling and repair station for the United States Seventh Fleet. **********While its strategic value has declined with the end of the cold war, Bush Administration officials say that replicating the functions of Subic Bay at installations elsewhere in the Pacific would cost several billion dollars. **********Clark Air Base, a sister American installation on the central Philippine island of Luzon, was abandoned this year after it was smothered by volcanic ash released by nearby Mount Pinatubo.  Possible Election Issue **********Beyond its implications for Philippine-American relations, Mrs. Aquino's call for a referendum on the future of Subic Bay will doubtless have a broad effect on domestic politics. **********She may well have created the principal issue in next May's general election, including the vote to pick her successor: whether the United States should be allowed to continue to place troops and weapons, including nuclear weapons, on the soil of a former colony that in many ways has yet to emerge from the American shadow. President Aquino has insisted that she will not seek re-election when her six-year term expires next year. **********The new 10-year base agreement rejected today had been hammered out this summer between the Bush Administration and the Manila Government. **********. Washington offered $203 million a year in compensation, far less than was originally sought by Manila. Some of the Philippine lawmakers had demanded that the treaty be renegotiated. **********Mrs. Aquino, aware of opinion polls showing that an overwhelming majority of Filipinos support the treaty, is refusing to acquiesce in the Senate's rejection of it. The Philippine military also strongly favors the treaty. **********At stake are the jobs of tens of thousands of Filipinos who work at the base or in related jobs, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars that the Subic Bay installation injects into the strapped Philippine economy each year. **********Acknowledging on Sunday night that Senate rejection of the base agreement was \"likely,\" Mrs. Aquino said that she would invoke a section of the Constitution that gives voters the right to overturn legislative decisions in a national referendum. **********Under the Constitution, the signatures of 10 percent of the nation's voters, or about three million Filipinos, are needed on petitions authorizing a referendum. **********Many senators disagree with Mrs. Aquino on the question of whether a treaty vote in the Senate, as opposed to the Senate's vote on a regular law, can be overturned by referendum. **********The constitutional differences will probably have to be sorted out in the Philippine Supreme Court, a process that could take several months. It could even delay a referendum until after the general election in May, when new senators, including some who may be more receptive to a base treaty with the United States, will be selected.                    --------------------       U.S. Supports a Referendum **********WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 (Special to The New York Times) -- American officials welcomed the effort by President Aquino today to win approval of the base treaty through a referendum. **********Richard H. Solomon, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said in an interview, \"We support her efforts.\" **********Exactly when the current agreement ends is, from the American perspective, a complicated question.

Dhows still ply the waters, and three dozen mosques, one dating to 1370, are well attended. The muezzin's cry echoes at dawn through stone alleys wide enough for donkeys but too narrow for cars. The only vehicle on this island of 20,000 people belongs to the District Commissioner. **********A few impositions from the West have blended in. Inexpensive boarding houses attract budget travelers, but not too many of them. The beach boys who man the dhows grow plaits and peroxide their tips in memory of Bob Marley. But the reggae music is kept discreetly low. **********But now, some longtime residents say that the character of Lamu, a slower-paced version of Zanzibar, the Tanzanian island to the south, is threatened. Suddenly, two new hotels have appeared on the waterfront. By most standards they are modest buildings of three stories and reflect Swahili architecture with traditional styled arches and whitewashed exteriors. **********But what rankles the local residents is an apparent flouting of zoning procedures and the effect of beach tourists on the integrity of their Islamic traditions that demand no alcohol and modesty in dress. Lamu women are clad in head-to-toe black Islamic dress, known here as buibui. **********\"Building such a hotel in front of this Islamic village where beer and other vices will be peddled is an insult to the local people,\" said Philip Katana, conservator of the Lamu Museum and one of the chief critics of the Sheik Ya Shella Hotel. **********\"There is a real conflict between the different values of the locals and the visitors,\" he said. \"The young people get tempted, that's what people are complaining about.\" **********As Mr. Katana talked near the shore of Shella beach, where the new hotel juts out onto the sand, a fisherman gently advised a young European sunbather to drape something around her nearly nude body. **********Beyond the brash culture that the new Sheik Ya Shella Hotel, with its bargain-priced beer, represents, its construction across a broad swath of beachfront interferes with daily commerce by obstructing the landing area of local boatmen. Wary of Strangers **********Ali Omar, a fisherman, said he used to bring his catch to the sands where the hotel now stands and other boatmen brought coral stones used for construction. **********\"We have nothing against foreigners,\" Mr. Omar said. \"For years we have welcomed them. But now we are becoming wary of strangers who come here pretending to be innocent only to realize they are looking for ways to grab a plot of land.\" **********A second hotel -- named, to the annoyance of the local residents, Paradise Hotel -- has just been completed on the waterfront in the center of the town. Mr. Katana said the building was too big and out of proportion for the size of the land. **********For historic reasons, Mr. Katana said, it is important to preserve Lamu in as natural state as possible. It is the most authentic of three extant Swahili towns designated as national monuments by the Kenyan Government, he said. The other two are the old stone town of Kenya's chief port city, Mombasa, and Pate, a small collection of dwellings on Pate Island, to the north of Lamu. Ancient Mud Mosques **********Indeed, Mr. Katana said he believed that Lamu is one of the best examples of the Swahili culture along the entire Swahili coast that stretches from war-ravaged Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, in the north, to Mozambique, in the south. **********\"There's no other culture in Kenya that we know of that goes back as far as the Swahili culture,\" Mr. Katana said. \"And this is one of the superior cultures -- the fact they came up with towns, shows that.\" **********On nearby Pate Island, at a place called Shanga, archaeologists have found evidence of mud mosques dating back to the eighth century, Mr. Katana said. Lamu is thought to have existed by 1300, with the remnants of a settlement now buried under sand dunes at the south end of Lamu town. **********In the early 1800's, the Sultan of Oman conquered Lamu, had an imposing fort built that still stands in the center of the town and used the island as a foothold from which to take Zanzibar. The Omani Sultans stayed in power until the British declared Kenya a protectorate in 1895.

Technicians' Approval **********As in many unsullied places across the world where possible profits suddenly loom, the construction of the Sheik Ya Shella Hotel was approved by the \"politicians instead of the technicians,\" Mr. Katana said. **********To curb the temptations offered to elected politicians by potential developers, the Kenyan Government has agreed to set up a new planning commission of technical civil servants through which all such proposals must pass, the curator said. **********\"In any case, there is a lot of free beach land along the coast and on nearby Manda Island which is ideal for hotels and which would not hurt anyone,\" Mr. Katana said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/01/world/angola-and-rebels-sign-pact-ending-16-year-war.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1991-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Angola and Rebels Sign Pact Ending 16-Year War", "print_headline": "Angola and Rebels Sign Pact Ending 16-Year War", "body_text": " **********The Government of Angola and the rebel faction that it has battled for 16 years signed a long-awaited peace agreement today aimed at ending civil war and preparing the ravaged southern African nation for free elections and democracy. **********An official cease-fire went into effect after the accord was signed here tonight by Angola's President, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, and Jonas Savimbi, the longtime leader of the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita. An informal truce declared by the two sides on May 15 appears largely to be holding. **********Mr. dos Santos's Government until recent years espoused Marxism and received support from the Soviet Union, while the Unita rebels took their aid and their cue from Washington and South Africa. **********The signing today fits in with continuing Soviet-American efforts to resolve regional rivalries -- United States and Soviet officials were on hand today -- and it comes as the civil war in Ethiopia, at times a focus of East-West dispute, has reached a pivotal moment. **********Under the Angolan accord, which was initialed by negotiators here on May 1, the two sides agreed to build a unified armed force, to strive for political pluralism and a market economy, and to work together until free elections are held in the second half of 1992. **********The signing ceremony, at the Portuguese Foreign Ministry, was the climax of a year of negotiations in which the United States and the Soviet Union pressed the two sides to end a war that has taken an estimated 300,000 lives. Portugal, which ruled colonial Angola until 1975, acted as a mediator in the talks. **********Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who witnessed the signing along with Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh of the Soviet Union, described it as another product of the new cooperation between Washington and Moscow. **********But the cease-fire also became possible because the warring factions apparently reached the conclusion that neither side could win on the battlefield. While the Government controls the capital, Luanda, as well as the coast and the oil-producing areas, the rebels occupy much of the arid south and east of Angola. **********Sitting between the once bitterly hostile leaders of the two Angolan forces, Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva of Portugal said, \"Today there are no losers and only one winner: the Angolan people.\" If the accord is respected, he added, Angolans can at last look forward to economic development and better living conditions.  Peace and Democracy **********Congratulating the two sides for ending the fighting, Mr. Baker said: \"Once adversaries in war, you now stand together as partners in peace. You have the opportunity to show the world that a multiparty democracy can be built where before there was only destruction and distrust.\" **********For many of Angola's nearly nine million people, the accord may in fact mean the first peace they have known. Before the civil war erupted on the eve of independence in November 1975, the country had experienced years of guerrilla warfare led by nationalists demanding freedom from Portugal. **********\"After 30 years of pain, deprivation and struggle, the Angolan people are now able to face the future with confidence and optimism,\" President dos Santos said today, declaring that peace in Angola could also help end the civil war in Mozambique and apartheid in South Africa. **********Under the agreement, a small United Nations observer force will monitor the cease-fire during preparations for international-supervised elections, to be held between Sept. 1 and Nov. 30, 1992. The force is expected to number 440 military and police officers and 175 civilians.  A Single Army **********The Luanda Government and Unita have further agreed to create a single 50,000-member armed force. Portugal, Britain and France are to help build the new army, while Washington and Moscow have pledged to stop sending in weapons. **********Under an earlier agreement, Cuban troops completed their withdrawal from Angola last week, five weeks ahead of schedule, after playing a major role in sustaining the Luanda Government since 1975. At one point, as many as 50,000 Cuban soldiers and advisers were involved in the war against the rebels. **********Under that same agreement, signed in December 1988, South Africa ended its support for Unita in 1989, and in 1990 it granted independence to Namibia, from which its forces had mounted frequent attacks into Angola dating back to 1975. **********In Angola, the governing party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, set the stage for the move to democracy when it dropped its commitment to Marxism in March. Since then, the formation of new political parties has been permitted.  Rivalry Will Move to Ballot **********The main contest for the presidency next year seems likely to pit Mr. dos Santos against Mr. Savimbi. Announcing plans to return to Luanda early in July to start preparing his campaign, the 56-year-old Unita leader said he would recognize Mr. dos Santos as President of Angola until the elections. **********While the peace accord thrashed out during seven negotiating sessions is detailed, much remains to be worked out by a commission in which the United States, the Soviet Union and Portugal will take part as observers. **********Some constitutional reforms toward a market economy have already been adopted. But more may be needed, particularly if Angola is to attract the foreign investment and credits it will need to rebuild its war-wrecked economy and develop its resources of oil, diamonds, gold and farm products. **********An electoral law to establish both the date and rules for next year's voting, including the length of presidential terms, will require negotiation among all political groups. Unita is pressing for the elections to be held in September 1992, before the rainy season starts.  Provision of Troops **********The two sides have agreed that each will provide half the new 40,000-member army, but because Unita has only ground troops, the Government will supply all 6,000 members of the air force and 4,000 members of the navy. Guarantees of the armed forces' political neutrality must still be worked out. **********Perhaps the biggest threat to the peace accord is the deep distrust that continues to divide the governing party and Unita. They are not only separated by ideology, but by tribal allegiance. Nonetheless, President dos Santos and Mr. Savimbi pledged to carry out today's accord to the letter. **********Mr. Baker said that while the agreement would not be easy to carry out, the United States would help by providing relief aid to all Angolans and by lending expertise to the electoral process. **********Turning to the Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh, Mr. Baker expressed thanks for Moscow's cooperation \"in resolving yet another issue that once deeply divided our countries but that now unites us in common purpose.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/11/business/the-media-business-live-entertainment-seeks-merger-with-carolco-pictures.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1991-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 343, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Live Entertainment Seeks Merger With Carolco Pictures", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Live Entertainment Seeks Merger With Carolco Pictures", "body_text": " **********Live Entertainment Inc., a home video distributor, said today that it wanted to negotiate a merger with Carolco Pictures Inc., which already owns 54 percent of the company. **********Live Entertainment said it had formed a committee of outside directors not affiliated with Carolco to negotiate a transaction, but it did not propose a price or any other details.

Both shot missiles, the western site firing at Israel and the southern site at Saudi Arabia. **********\"There's a pretty good correlation,\" said Paul Knight, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. \"Evening or early-night cloud cover seems to correspond with the likelihood of an attack.\" **********Fred Gadomski, another Penn meteorologist, added, \"There's a high degree of correlation.\"  At Height of Rainy Season **********If correct, the weather link could provide early warning of increased risk of attack for nations subject to Iraq's barrage.

Baghdad, for instance, is covered by some clouds about 50 percent of the time on average. Meteorologists say the battlefield has been swept by several weather systems since the war began, producing intermittent periods of rain and cloudiness. **********After the initial allied attack, Iraq first struck back on the evening of Jan. 17 and 18 by firing several missiles at Israel and Saudi Arabia. Mr. Knight said low clouds covered both southern and western Iraq at the time. The skies then cleared partly, with the next evening bringing a lighter attack against Israel. Then, on the evening of Jan. 19 and 20, there were no launchings as skies cleared over the battle zone. **********But a new weather disturbance moved into the region. On the evening of last Sunday and early Monday, Iraq launched its biggest barrage against Saudi Arabia, some 10 missiles in all, correlating with what Mr. Knight called low clouds in southern Iraq.  Using Clouds as Cover **********Military experts say the Iraqis appear to be using the clouds as cover to make the mobile Scud launchers harder to find. Their period of vulnerability is greatest right after a missile firing. American early-warning satellites can spot the missile's fiery plume, allowing ground controllers to calculate the launcher's location. Moreover, military radars in the region can track the missile and aid the extrapolation process. Allied aircraft then hunt for the launcher, which usually starts moving right after firing. **********\"They're hiding,\" said John E. Pike, head of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists, a private group based in Washington. **********Military experts say the clouds have no operational effect on Scud missiles or the capabilities of American early-warning satellites.

It is an often-funny but ultimately sad drama that was released at the beginning of the summer movie season, when audiences normally flock to lighter comedies and action films. **********Not only does the film lack a well-known male star, but it was produced and distributed by the MGM-Pathe Communications Company, which is under so much financial pressure that the film's release was delayed from late March because the studio apparently could not spend the money needed to market the film. **********Gregory Morrison, the studio's president of marketing, said MGM-Pathe spent about $8.5 million to preview the film and release it. He estimated that his competitors spent well in excess of $12 million each to promote their films. **********MGM-Pathe's problems are so great that this film, no matter how well it does, cannot turn the studio around. **********Still, Mr. Morrison said, \"it will put us on solid footing, and it will certainly boost morale.\" **********And, he added, \"It's good for our customers to show that there is life in the lion. It's a good launching pad for us.\" **********Even two mega-hits like \"Silence of the Lambs\" and \"Dances With Wolves\" could not save Orion Pictures from a financial overhaul brought on by its mountain of debt. **********In its first week, \"Thelma and Louise\" took in $7.7 million at the box office. That is less than \"Hudson Hawk,\" for example, an action film that stars Bruce Willis and brought in $8.5 million at the box office. But per theater, \"Thelma and Louise\" did better.  1 Percent More Business **********More important, Mr. Friedberg said yesterday, \"Thelma and Louise\" did 1 percent more business on Friday and Saturday of this weekend that it had on the previous weekend at the same number of theaters. **********It had been expected to do less business yesterday than on the previous Sunday, which was part of a holiday weekend. In contrast, \"Backdraft,\" the action film about firefighters that is directed by Ron Howard and stars Robert DeNiro and Kurt Russell, was down 18 percent from the previous weekend's two-day opening. Another industry executive noted yesterday that \"Hudson Hawk\" was down 43 percent, a disastrous drop. In general, even hit films do not do as well the second weekend as the first. **********Studio executives said \"Thelma and Louise\" was probably the fourth-highest grossing film of the weekend, after \"Backdraft,\" \"Soap Dish\" and \"What About Bob?\"  Heavy Competition **********To prove itself a real hit, the movie faces heavy competition from coming releases. Over the weekend, Paramount's \"Soap Dish\" opened strongly. And theater owners appear to have an embarrassment of riches. **********The early word on Columbia Pictures' \"City Slickers,\" with Billy Crystal, is very good. And Warner Brothers' \"Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves,\" with Kevin Costner, is scheduled to open June 14. Theater owners say the only uncertainty is how big a hit it will be, given Mr. Costner's attractiveness to an older audience and the story's overall appeal. **********Despite all the publicity surrounding its rumored budget of well over $70 million, Carolco's \"Terminator II: Judgment Day,\" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is also expected to do well. **********Whether \"Thelma and Louise\" will hold its own, particularly in the more suburban and rural markets, remains to be seen.  International Appeal **********One of the advantages that \"Terminator II\" and \"Backdraft\" both have is their international appeal because they are action movies with stories that are not inherently American. \"Thelma and Louise,\" with its depiction of two women on their own, could well be a harder sell overseas, despite the fact the film was well-received at the Cannes Film Festival. **********But for now, MGM-Pathe is focusing on the American market. Mr. Morrison said the studio was advertising heavily on cable television, with spots on network television as well. **********Initially, the company was aimed its advertising at women. But having succeeded in luring that audience, \"it is turning the dial slightly more toward men,\" Mr. Morrison said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/29/business/kohlberg-kravis-rouses-itself.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1991-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1360, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kohlberg, Kravis Rouses Itself", "print_headline": "Kohlberg, Kravis Rouses Itself", "body_text": " **********After almost two years of struggling with its previous investments as the \"junk bond\" market collapsed, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the giant buyout firm that became a corporate titan in the 1980's, appears to be back on a roll. **********In one week, the firm, which has not made a large purchase in two years, began to snap up corporate properties again. It backed the bid that won Federal approval to buy the assets of the Bank of New England. And K-III Holdings, a company controlled by Kohlberg, Kravis, agreed to buy nine publications from Rupert Murdoch's debt-laden News Corporation for $650 million. **********The deals are vastly different from the firm's well-worn leveraged buyout formula. Kohlberg, Kravis became known in the 80's for breakups -- selling pieces of a company to reduce the mountains of debt used in the purchase. But in the 90's, it is turning to \"build-ups,\" in which it enlarges existing companies by acquiring assets. A Consistent Philosophy **********In both the Bank of New England and Murdoch deals, Kohlberg, Kravis used its own capital to purchase the assets of troubled companies. The firm is injecting $283 million into the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc., a financial services company, for the purchase of the Bank of New England assets. To support the Murdoch deal, it is expected to make another investment in K-III, a company formed by three former executives of the publisher Macmillan Inc. with backing from Kohlberg, Kravis. **********\"The two deals are very similar in philosophy,\" said one executive with ties to Kohlberg, Kravis. \"It is an investment of their funds' capital in a program of building up a business.\" **********The strategy is again putting Kohlberg, Kravis at the front of some high-profile deals. But even some investors with the firm say they do not believe the approach will enable the company to regain the fantastic returns on investments -- as much as 63 percent on an annualized basis on its first 16 deals -- it enjoyed in the mid-80's. **********The new deals are far smaller than the firm's mega-transactions, like the $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. -- which, with financing expenses, ultimately cost Kohlberg, Kravis $32 billion -- negotiated in late 1988 and early 1989. But the deals signal that Kohlberg, Kravis is ready to start reaching into its deep pockets again. And the two new deals show that the firm is continuing to rely on borrowed money. **********In large part, the switch from selling assets after a leveraged buyout to buying assets from troubled companies reflects the current condition of the economy, investment managers and Wall Street professionals say. **********\"I think building companies now makes extraordinary sense,\" said Scott Sperling, a partner at the Harvard Management Company, which runs the endowment fund for the university and is an investor with Kohlberg, Kravis. The buyout firm \"has the ability to buy low,\" he said. \"Backing a superior management team to acquire those sorts of pieces I think is a brilliant way of approaching the business.\" Built From Scratch **********From its beginnings in 1976, Kohlberg, Kravis used leveraged buyouts to rise from next to nothing -- it had just $3 million to invest in 1976 -- to control an empire that includes RJR Nabisco, supermarket chains, like Stop and Shop and Safeway Inc., and Duracell International Inc. Since its inception, the firm has acquired 36 companies at a cost of about $65 billion. **********The debt-driven buyout helped make the firm's founders extremely wealthy. Henry R. Kravis, George R. Roberts and their former partner, Jerome Kohlberg Jr., who left in 1987 over what partners said was his concern about the size of the firm's deals, are each estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. At the same time, Mr. Kravis assumed a prominent role in New York society, particularly since his marriage in 1985 to Carolyne Roehm, a fashion designer. Mr. Roberts, who is Mr. Kravis's cousin, works out of the firm's San Francisco office and tends to shun publicity. **********In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors buys a company, often in cooperation with top managers, and pays for it mostly with borrowed money. In theory, the new owners begin cutting away at excess, dismissing unneeded employees and selling operations that have little to do with the core business. The company is then resold for a handsome profit. Tapping Pools of Capital **********Kohlberg, Kravis raised the equity used in the buyouts by selling its investment skills to institutional investors and money managers. Since 1978, the firm has tapped its investors' capital pools six times for the formation of different buyout funds, and recently went back to investors to replenish the fund collected in 1987. The firm says it manages the money of more than 70 institutions. **********In past years, when the firm put in only about 10 percent equity, it greatly increased the potential return for itself and its investors through the high degree of leverage. Now, with banks less willing to lend for highly leveraged transactions and the junk bond market essentially unavailable for raising large amounts of capital, Kohlberg, Kravis expects that the equity portion of deals could rise as high as 30 percent. **********With more capital required for leveraged buyouts, the firm is exploring other investment strategies, company documents and Wall Street executives indicate.  Using a Minority Stake **********Kohlberg, Kravis has also adopted a so-called \"toehold\" approach to investing, in which it takes a minority stake in a publicly held company and uses its own investment as a signal of its confidence in the concern. The best known of those is its 9.9 percent holding in First Interstate Bancorp. **********At the same time, Kohlberg, Kravis has been dipping into the capital markets to shore up the balance sheets of companies it bought in leveraged buyouts. Indeed, this month, Kohlberg, Kravis turned to the stock and bond markets six times, raising money for Safeway, Autozone Inc. and RJR Nabisco. A stock offering for Duracell International is awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Firm's High Fees **********The firm's investors are now wondering if the changes in investment strategy will be able to bring them returns close to those in the 80's, enough to justify paying the firm's high fees. Under the fee structure, Kohlberg, Kravis charges a 1.5 percent annual fee for managing the money invested with it, as well as investment banking fees, divestiture fees, consulting fees and a smattering of other charges. **********On its four largest deals, the firm is estimated to have charged its limited partners $240 million up front. And on top of that, the firm gets to keep 20 percent of any capital gains from an investment. **********Some limited partners in past Kohlberg, Kravis ventures voiced objections when the firm began seeking $1 billion to $2 billion to replenish the $5.6 billion buyout fund that the firm raised in 1987. The investors wanted Kohlberg, Kravis to cut its fees and change the method by which the firm treats gains and losses of companies in its portfolio.  Protected Profits **********Kohlberg, Kravis treats each company in its portfolio separately, giving itself 20 percent of the profits of every company that does well, while only taking 1 percent of the losses for the poor performers. The firm can profit even if the limited partners do not. **********\"They make a lot of money whether or not I as a limited partner make money,\" said Mr. Sperling of Harvard, who has not decided whether he will invest in the new Kohlberg, Kravis fund. \"We want them to make money, but only after we make money.\" **********Some institutional investors are finding that by using the asset-investing strategy by themselves they are able to produce returns equal to those from Kohlberg, Kravis when their costs of investing in the firm are considered. And that is leading them to stay out of this round of money raising. **********But despite the grumbling, Kohlberg, Kravis's track record is still bringing in the institutional investors. **********\"I don't blame them for sticking to their guns on the fee issue,\" the manager of another fund that still invests with the firm said. \"If I could get the money on those terms, I wouldn't change things either.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/30/business/company-news-a-store-on-fifth-avenue-will-be-totally-french.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1991-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1008, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Store on Fifth Avenue Will Be 'Totally French'", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; A Store on Fifth Avenue Will Be 'Totally French'", "body_text": " **********With such formidable competitors as Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman and Henri Bendel ensconced nearby, the Galeries Lafayette fashion store opening in midtown Manhattan this fall plans an aggressively French merchandising strategy to differentiate itself from its American rivals. **********\"It will be totally French,\" Georges Meyer, Galeries Lafayette's chairman and chief executive, said of the store, which opens in September on West 57th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues. \"Not French as Americans might expect a French store to be, but truly French in merchandise, assortments, presentation and floor organization.\" **********In making their first extensive remarks about merchandising since announcing plans for their first American store, Mr. Meyer and other Galeries Lafayette executives acknowledged that they were taking a calculated risk. Opening a new and unfamiliar store during a severe retailing slump means they will have to make an extra effort to create the niche the store needs to succeed. **********Some retailing experts already question whether being French will be enough for Galeries Lafayette to compete with existing high-profile, high-fashion stores in New York. Others said they were not sure shoppers would even notice much of a French difference.  Mix-and-Match Instincts **********But Mr. Meyer and Eugenia Ulasewicz, a former Bloomingdale's executive who is now president of Galeries Lafayette USA, said they were confident that shoppers would like the difference. **********For example, Ms. Ulasewicz said, the new store will offer blouses and skirts from many different designers or suppliers. That will let customers give full range to their mix-and-match instincts. American stores tend to concentrate on selling what their managers consider matching or complementary clothes, often made by the same company. **********And because French women \"use a lot of accessories,\" Ms. Ulasewicz said, there will be several varied in-store boutiques, most featuring French designer scarves, handbags, gloves and jewelry. But, also in the French manner, these accessories will be displayed much more openly. Scarves, for example, will hang from wall clips, rather than lie flat on a glass showcase. **********While stores like Saks have somewhat similar displays, they are usually more limited and not designed as the major sales focus. **********Galeries Lafayette executives have already said that in a sharp departure from operations of their 20 stores in Western Europe and Singapore, the Manhattan store will sell only women's clothing and accessories. The others also carry men's or children's clothes. **********There will be only French designer labels, no Americans featured in the store, Ms. Ulasewicz said. But about 30 percent of Galeries private-label goods will be made by American suppliers, she said. **********Some of the French designers with their own boutiques and own salespeople in the store will be Sonia Rykiel, accessories; Gaultier Juniors, junior apparel, and Claudie Pierlot, sportswear. **********Still, Norman Matthews, a former president of Federated Department Stores and now a consultant, cautioned that Galeries might find it difficult to break into the local market. **********\"This is a very tough and thin market for retailing, especially for stores with higher price lines,\" Mr. Matthews said. \"Galeries will be hard pressed to develop a niche amid the confluence of Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Henri Bendel and a Barneys New York store to come. So it will take extraordinary merchandise assortments and fine customer service to convince affluent customers that the new store is the first place to shop.\" **********Mr. Meyer, in his first interview in New York since the company announced it would take over the space that formerly held Bonwit Teller's flagship store, said the decision to sell only women's clothing had come about partly because of the size of the store, on the Fifth Avenue side in Trump Tower. It has 80,000 square feet, half of which will be selling space, which is not be enough to \"appropriately\" accommodate anything other than women's apparel, he said. **********Another reason is simply pragmatic strategy. \"We are hoping for first-year sales of about $40 million,\" Mr. Meyer said. \"That means that we should get about $1,000 a square foot of selling space, which we can achieve more through the higher turnover in women's wear than in other types of clothes.\" **********Or, put another way, since Saks and Bergdorf do sell men's and children's wear and are much larger stores, Galeries had to select goods with the highest sales potential. **********Galeries, which will employ about 200 people, is starting off with one plus. Its 25-year lease with Donald J. Trump, owner of Trump Tower, gave the French store one year rent free. That time is being used to prepare the store for the September opening, when rental payments will begin. Ms. Ulasewicz declined to say how much rent the company would be paying. \"It is quite high, but the fine location is worth it,\" she said. **********Ms. Ulasewicz said the store would carry three main types of clothes: \"better, bridge and designer.\" In the first group, a jacket-skirt combination would retail from $400 to $700; in the \"bridge,\" a trade term meaning clothes in between \"better\" and designer, the same ensemble would sell from $800 to $900. Designer clothes would start at $1,000. **********But the new store will not offer any haute couture, or \"top of the line\" clothes, in the belief that the United States market will not support very high-priced fashions in great volume. **********\"I recently hired a team of buyers from different kinds of American stores to provide a variety of backgrounds,\" Ms. Ulasewicz said. \"When we go to the market, we will be able to buy French clothes for a variety of people that our buyers have sold goods to for years. So we feel that we can then apply our knowledge of the American market to the designer and other clothes available from France.\" **********To find out whether American women would be interested in shopping at a store selling nothing but French clothes, the company conducted a survey last October of 3,000 shoppers and visitors at Trump Tower. **********\"We happily found that many of them knew of us by reputation,\" Mr. Meyer said, \"and others knew us by having been in Paris.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/08/business/hopeful-sign-in-canada.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hopeful Sign in Canada", "print_headline": "Hopeful Sign in Canada", "body_text": " **********Canada's unemployment rate rose slightly last month from the April level, but Government economists said an increase in the country's manufacturing and construction sector was a sign that the economy was improving.

She would take over the wheel so he could crawl into the back of the cab and sleep. \"The only time we weren't running was to load, gas up and eat,\" she recalled. **********The grueling pace -- averaging about 5,000 miles a week -- would go on for weeks in an effort to meet expenses and a $2,200 monthly payment on their new $80,000 Kenworth truck. \"If you could make your truck payment and live, that was a lot,\" he recalled. **********The Johnsons have done better than live. Formed in October 1988, their trucking company, Buffalo Express, has grown to five trucks and six drivers, with further expansion insight. \"Sometimes I could use 10 more trucks\" Mr. Johnson said as he sat on the couch on one of his rare days at their ranch-style house in a suburb of Pittsburgh. **********Unlike airlines, which rarely see new competitors, trucking firms are joined every year by thousands of new start-ups like Buffalo Express, thanks to deregulation. The number of trucking companies has grown from 18,045 in 1980, when trucking rates were deregulated, to 45,791 in 1990. **********In part, their proliferation has to do with the low cost of entry. All an entrepreneur needs to get started is a truck and the proper authority from the Interstate Commerce Commission, compared to the tens of millions of dollars a new airline needs for gates, landing slots and planes, even before it has to cope with the vicious price wars typical of the industry. **********But the ease of entry has also driven up trucking's failure rates, as operators with too little experience or business sense rushed in -- and were edged out nearly as fast. About 13,000 companies have gone out of business since 1980. The failure rate peaked in 1986, when more than 200 of every 10,000 companies went under, compared with the pre-deregulation rate of about 50 per 10,000. The rate has since fallen to below 150 for every 10,000 companies. **********\"One of the great American liberties is the right to fail economically,\" said Tom Donohue, the president of the American Trucking Association. **********The survivors, however, may be in for tougher times as large shippers reduce the number of trucking companies they use, in an effort to simplify billing and shipping. **********With foreign competition increasing and the recession dragging on, many companies recently have re-examined the costs of inventory and transportation. Many decided they were willing to pay higher rates in return for the reliability and more sophisticated handling that larger and established carriers offer. **********Procter & Gamble, for example, has set a goal of cutting down to 35 trucking companies by 1992, from 350. \"This is happening all over the place,\" Mr. Donohue said, and it will tend to make it tougher for the smaller companies to make it. **********The trucking industry is divided into two main classes. \"Less than truckload\" carriers, who make up about a third of the business, haul small shipments from many points to large regional terminals and then truck the freight to destinations all over the country. Dominated by a handful of large companies -- including Yellow Freight System, Roadway Services and Consolidated Freightways -- this segment's high costs for building terminals and large networks have prevented any newcomers from entering. **********The remaining two thirds of the industry consists of \"full truckload\" long hauls, usually between a single sender and a single receiver. This part of the industry is fragmented into thousands of carriers, although a few companies, including Schneider National Inc., and J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc., have taken advantage of deregulation and expanded to become dominant players. **********Upstarts like Buffalo Express concentrate on this segment. For the Johnsons, the path to success was long and arduous. It was also filled with lucky breaks that came from having made personal contacts with key customers who gave them the critical initial business. **********For years Mr. Johnson, who still has some of the self-mocking humor of the North Dakota farm country where he grew up, drove his truck for other companies. Generally he paid them commissions of 18 to 25 percent for supplying him with loads. Many years, he made barely enough to cover his expenses, he recalled. **********The couple were married in 1983 and began to share the burdens. The children of both their previous marriages were grown. She is 54 and he is 45. **********\"He's got more miles and I've got more years,\" she quipped. **********After their marriage, Mr. Johnson taught his wife how to drive a big rig, and they joined the increasing number of husband and wife teams that now drive many of the nation's trucks. **********By working together and running day after day, they managed to save enough money to buy a new truck in 1987, trading in a 10-year-old Peterbilt for a Kenworth. But like other owner-operators, they still generally paid companies to supply them with loads. **********\"We were still paying $25,000 to $30,000 a year to be tied to a company to get the loads,\" Mrs. Johnson recalled. **********For some six to ten weeks at a time they would drive most of the day -- up to 22 hours. They spent so little time in their apartment in Fargo, N. D., that they gave it up and put their furniture in storage. **********\"We were just paying the rent for nothing,\" Mrs. Johnson said. \"I was on the road for six years when we did not have a home. Home was where my truck was.\" **********After they gave up their apartment, they spent their rare days off mostly watching television and reading at motels in truck stops. Mrs. Johnson also knitted. \"I kept myself occupied,\" she said. **********He bore the brunt of the driving. \"I was really not that good a driver but good enough to stay between the ditches so he could get some sleep for a few hours,\" she recalled. **********Being confined to the cramped quarters of a tractor cab often strained the relationship, but the Johnsonskept on trucking. **********There were also periods when they were down to a few dollars after they made their truck payment and other expenses. Once, when an attempt to find a load of potatoes to haul from Billings, Mont., had failed, they were down to $2 while driving through Nevada. They decided to turn off at Las Vegas and cash in a coupon that gave them $295 in money to gamble, which Mr. Johnson turned into $340 by playing the slot machines -- enough to hold them over until they got paid for a haul. **********Their hard work enabled them to pay off the first truck in three years. **********The Johnsons also became regulars hauling for Pinnacle Food of Pittsburgh. While most shippers deal with truck drivers largely by phone, the dispatchers at Pinnacle made an effort to get to know them personally. One day in 1988 Mr. Johnson mustered the nerve to ask one of the dispatchers whether he could deal with him directly rather than through a trucking company to which he had to pay an 18 percent commission. **********When he was given a \"yes,\" he scrambled to get authority from the Interstate Commerce Commission. Like any new trucking company, the Johnsons had to get authority from every state in which they wanted to operate, and affix what is called a \"Bingo\" stamp to their truck as proof. They also had to get a stamp proving that they were paying each state's fuel tax for trucks. Mrs. Johnson calculated the total cost of the fees involved at about $1,500 each year. **********To start, they got temporary authority from the I.C.C., good for seven days at a cost of $1,200. But they did not have fuel tax stickers required to operate in every state they wished. **********Boldly, they drove without all the required stickers and got them as quickly as they could, holding their breath every time they had to pass through scales in states where they did not have the sticker. \"We were like outlaws,\" Mrs. Johnson recalled. **********Within four months, they had all their permits and could haul without fear. **********By May of the following year, they had landed another regular customer, a produce wholesaler in Pittsburgh. They decided to hire an owner operator who now paid them the 18 percent commission to get loads. **********But eventually Mr. Johnson decided he could get more reliable work by hiring his own drivers as employees. It was not an easy decision, because finding good drivers is hard even for large companies that offer good wages and benefits. Many employees do not want to put up with the long hours, the extended periods away from home and the loneliness of trucking. New drivers often leave for the same reasons. But Mr. Johnson felt he had no choice. \"We have dedicated freight,\" he said. \"We handle it or we lose it.\" **********The Johnsons hope that the training and personal touch they offer will help them keep employees. **********By 1990, the Johnsons had bought three more trucks with $270,000 in financing, given by a bank on the strength of their credit standing and the prospects of steady business from two major customers. **********Those two companies have sent other customers their way. But their new prosperity has not changed the Johnsons' frugal lifestyle. She still takes in sewing to make extra money and he is still working long hours for weeks at a time. **********On Mondays, he loads on the West Coast for delivery on Thursdays in Pittsburgh. He then loads again on Thursday nights to deliver on Sunday nights on the West Coast. Mr. Johnson had hoped that being his own boss would relax his schedule. But he must still answer to his customers. **********\"You always get a boss,\" he said with resignation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/20/world/volcano-s-ash-dismays-filipinos-and-americans.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1991-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 892, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Volcano's Ash Dismays Filipinos and Americans", "print_headline": "Volcano's Ash Dismays Filipinos and Americans", "body_text": " **********On both sides of the heavy steel gate that separates this city from Subic Bay Naval Station, the sprawling American naval base, there was a shared sense of hopelessness today. **********Five days after Mount Pinatubo covered much of this coastal region with layer upon layer of volcanic ash and sand, which has been turned into a quagmire by the constant rains, the situation had only worsened. **********There was only intermittent electricity today, little running water and a sense of concern about the future. **********There is talk by officials here and in Washington that the cleanup costs from the volcano, 35 miles northwest of Subic, may be so great and the future of the base so precarious that the United States may have to make some hard decisions on whether to keep Subic and the American-run Clark Air Base.

Countries like Egypt and Syria, which belong to the anti-Iraq coalition, blame President Saddam Hussein for the civilian deaths, accusing him of leading his own people to slaughter by refusing to withdraw his troops from Kuwait. **********No group was more outraged by the American action that Palestinians.

It is the heart of the ruler in Baghdad, who could put an end to this if only feelings of pain could touch his heart.\" **********Egypt's President, Hosni Mubarak, also attacked Mr. Hussein personally, saying, \"It is inconceivable for a ruler to make propaganda hay from the corpses of his citizens.\" **********The deaths in Baghdad were totally ignored by some Saudi Arabian newspapers and scantly covered by others.

Attacks Called Deliberate **********There was virtually universal agreement in the district that American bombers were deliberately going after civilians and that the targets included Jordanians trying to flee the war. On Wednesday, refugees crossing into Jordan from Iraq reported that 30 Jordanian civilians on the road from Baghdad, including four children, had been burned to death on Saturday when their bus came under an allied air attack. **********\"The Americans knew these were civilian targets,\" said Mahmoud Daoud, a 34-year-old civil engineer. \"American has failed in its military campaign. It has not stopped the Iraqi military. So now it is hitting civilian targets.\" **********The Jordanian Government, denouncing the bombing in Baghdad as a \"horrible massacre,\" declared three days of national mourning and ordered that flags fly at half-staff on official buildings. Across the capital, people also draped black flags from lampposts. **********King Hussein, who last week abandoned his previously professed neutrality in the war to side with Iraq, demanded that the United Nations Security Council order an immediate cease-fire and send an investigating team to Baghdad. United Nations resolutions authorizing force to remove Iraq from Kuwait were being used, the King said, to \"wage a war of systematic destruction against Iraq\" that constituted a \"flagrant and callous violation of humanitarian law.\" March on Embassy Blocked **********On Wednesday night, police officers turned away about 1,000 Jordanians who had tried to march on the United States Embassy in Amman. But apparently in an attempt to defuse rising tensions, the Government imposed no such restraints today. **********Hundreds of protesters stood outside the embassy's main entrance, where at one point they hurled stones and clumps of dirt scooped up from plant beds. Some of them then marched to the nearby Egyptian Embassy, where they broke several windows. In another part of the city, demonstrators also broke windows at a building that houses United Nations organizations. **********None of these protests led to injuries. But on Wednesday night, a German student in his early 20's was stabbed in the chest by a Jordanian man who was described by the authorities as emotionally overwrought after watching televised images of the Baghdad disaster. The police said he had attacked the first foreigner he saw, thinking he was an American. **********The victim was said by the German Embassy to be in fair condition at a military hospital.

But specialists in oil fires said this does not necessarily imply major damage to the wells. That, they say, depends on the state of the \"Christmas tree,\" the cluster of valves on top of the well. **********\"If they set a fire on the Christmas tree, and leave a valve that's workable, you just turn it off,\" said Danny Clayton, a senior firefighter with Red Adair Co., Inc., of Houston. Referring to Saddam Hussein, Mr. Clayton said, \"If he's doing this just to make a smokescreen, there may be no damage to some of the wells.\" **********If there are no workable valves, he said, a crew must excavate around the well until it comes to intact casing, and then put a new top on the well -- something like installing a new faucet on the end of a broken pipe while water is flowing out. The fire must be extinguished first, however. Small fires can be put out with water; firefighters use dynamite on larger ones to burn off the available oxygen. **********A major fire can take a team of six men about two weeks of work to extinguish, Mr. Clayton said. His company can dispatch two such teams, and he put the worldwide total at eight teams, raising the possibility that extinguishing all the fires would take weeks.  Relative Efficiency **********Prewar Kuwait used just 365 wells, in which oil was propelled to the surface by natural pressure, to produce 1.6 million barrels of oil a day, or about 4,400 barrels per well. By contrast, the United States produces about four and a half times as much oil, but has about 600,000 wells, with an average production of 12 barrels a day. **********Kuwaiti exile authorities have for months been buying goods and contracting for services in order to begin exploiting the country's oil reserves as soon as possible after the Iraqis leave. **********\"Our goal is to provide relief to the population inside and restore production,\" said Fawzi al-Sultan, a Kuwaiti who headed the Kuwait Emergency Relief Program until the end of last year. A team in Houston has been buying wellheads, pumps and other spare equipment, he said. **********Crude-oil exports will resume within months, he said, \"even with a scorched-earth policy.\" But rebuilding the refineries would take much longer, he acknowledged. **********Some other experts are less optimistic, noting that before oil shipments reach meaningful levels, pipelines, pumping stations and terminals must be rebuilt. Reconstruction of ports and roads may also be required. Much Rebuilding to Do **********Another problem in restoring Kuwait's oil industry may be rebuilding the country's basic services and installations. **********\"You've got to produce housing or get trailers in,\" said Ken Miller, editorial director of OPEC Listener, an oil-analysis service, who formerly lived in Kuwait. \"You have to get water, food, communications, everything.\" **********Mr. Sultan minimized this problem. Major contractors, he said, \"go in self-sufficent. They're all used to it.\" After two or three weeks to open the harbor and airports, he said, productive work could begin. **********Even with working wells, the critical factor may be the loading terminal, other experts say. \"We bombed the terminal to start with, they damaged it, and we bombed it again,\" Mr. Miller said. \"The oil wells are no good without the infrastructure.\" **********John J. Healey, of Ebasco, an architect-engineering concern, said that the Kuwaiti export installations were among the largest and most modern in the world. \"Everything's big and everything's expensive,\" he said. **********For the near term, Kuwaiti oil exports are not essential to the world market, with production from other countries having more than made up for oil from Kuwait and Iraq. **********Kuwait's prewar capacity was estimated by specialists at 2.4 million barrels per day; its quota from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was 1.5 million barrels per day. **********Kuwait was also a major exporter of refined oil products, and its refineries were among the most advanced in the world.

It filed an offering this week to go public, hoping to raise as much as $46 million. The bulk of the cash is likely to go to Odyssey Partners, which will maintain control of the company through a complex transaction. **********It is Odyssey's role that seems likely to provide the principal selling point for the stock, which is tentatively priced at $11 to $13 a share and is expected to be sold next month. \"Essentially, the only way this deal works for them is if going forward, it works for everyone,\" said Wilbur Ross, an investment banker at Rothschild Inc. who represented the bondholders in the restructuring last year. **********At the same time, potential buyers will be watching with care for signs of a revival in the fashion industry. Most of Forstmann's annual sales come from orders placed between December and April, so the investors are being asked to buy shares without a firm indication of just how good, or bad, orders will be in 1992. **********The saga of Forstmann, which until 1986 was a subsidiary of J. P. Stevens, provides a capsule summary of what went wrong with many leveraged buyouts in the late 1980's, even those involving sophisticated investors. The first leveraged buyout, in 1986, was a success that culminated in a public stock offering in the summer of 1987. But the public overpaid then, and the stock price had plunged by the time the second leveraged buyout was done, in late 1988. **********That buyout was sponsored by Odyssey, a group formed by Jack Nash and Leon Levy, who gained fame and fortune running Oppenheimer & Company, the brokerage firm. Odyssey has compiled an impressive record in other deals, but so far it has been forced to throw good money after bad to protect its stake in Forstmann. Odyssey officials declined to be interviewed yesterday. **********The 1988 buyout price turned out to be too high, so last year it was time for the first restructuring. Odyssey put in more money, and bondholders agreed to a temporary reduction in interest payments. In all, Odyssey has sunk $13 million into Forstmann stock. When the current transactions are done, that stock could be worth only a few dollars. **********Odyssey also brought in new management last year, headed by Christopher L. Schaller, who had been a top exectutive at West Point-Pepperell. The new management's strategy is to emphasize fabrics for high-fashion women's apparel, which have relatively high margins, and move away from low-margin sales for military uniforms. Losses narrowed in the fiscal year ended October, despite a write-down of inventory. **********\"The environment for companies like Forstmann has turned out to be quite inhospitable,\" Mr. Ross said. \"Notwithstanding that, they came through pretty well.\" **********If Odyssey makes a profit on Forstmann, it will come from its most recent plunge, which apparently came this year. With Forstmann's bonds trading at deep discounts, Odyssey bought $46 million face value of its bonds. It has not disclosed how much it paid in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but Mr. Ross said he had heard the average price was about 58 cents for each dollar of face value, or a total of about $27 million. **********Under the latest restructuring, Odyssey has agreed to exchange its bonds for a combination of 58 cents in cash, and 42 cents in stock, for each dollar of face value. Those shares may be the only ones it owns effectively, since the value of the old shares may plunge to almost nothing. Whether that happens depends on the value of the initial public offering. Under the complicated formula, if the new shares go for $11 each, the old shares will be exchanged for so few new shares that their value will be wiped out for practical purposes. But if the price is higher, the old shares will retain some value. **********Aside from Odyssey, the largest existing shareholders, whose investments may be wiped out, are two California financial institutions that went broke largely because of their investments in junk bonds, Executive Life and Columbia Savings and Loan. **********Bondholders other than Odyssey have about $54 million in bonds, and they will be offered the same exchange, with the company planning to take a maximum of $50 million in bonds from all holders, including Odyssey. **********The expectation is that few other bonds will be tendered, largely because the shares to be given to bondholders will be restricted -- they cannot be traded for two years. Richard Byrne and Michael Cherry, bond analysts at Merrill Lynch, said they believed that the outstanding bonds, which leaped from around 70 cents on the dollar to above 80 cents on news of the offering, were likely to trade at or near par, if the stock offering was a success. Most bond holders will choose to keep the bonds, they added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/30/world/conflict-in-yugoslavia-yugoslavia-s-army-issues-ultimatum-to-rebel-republic.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1991-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "YUGOSLAVIA'S ARMY ISSUES ULTIMATUM TO REBEL REPUBLIC", "print_headline": "CONFLICT IN YUGOSLAVIA; YUGOSLAVIA'S ARMY ISSUES ULTIMATUM TO REBEL REPUBLIC", "body_text": " **********The Yugoslav Army issued an ultimatum today to Slovenia, saying that it would take \"decisive military action\" unless the secessionist republic agreed to an unconditional cease-fire, gave up control of all border posts and ended its cutoff of essential supplies to the army. **********The ultimatum came amid scattered skirmishes after the collapse of an accord mediated by three foreign ministers of the European Community to end three days of fighting between the national army and local militias in the breakaway republic. **********A senior national military officer, Col.

Veljko Kadijevic, told Croatia that it faced stern military action if it continued to challenge the authority of the central Government. **********But in the face of the alarming use of force in northern Slovenia, the present threat appeared to exceed in seriousness any that have preceeded it. **********Diplomatic observers said the move in the army appeared to reflect both frustration in the command, whose forces have been outnumbered and harassed in carrying out their mission in Slovenia, and a high degree of independence from civilian control. **********\"They are wounded, angry and not subjected to even a minimum of civilian control,\" a senior Western diplomat said. **********The army threat came after a day in which it became increasingly clear that the agreement mediated by the European Community foreign ministers from Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands was fast unraveling. Terms of the Agreement **********Under the terms of that agreement, Croatia and Slovenia agreed to suspend their moves toward independence. In exchange, the army agreed to return its units to their barracks and Serbia, the largest and most populous of the Yugoslav republics, agreed to drop its reservations to the appointment of a Croatian leader, Stipe Mesic, as chairman of the nation's collective presidency. **********Serbia's refusal to accept Mr. Mesic for the rotating chairmanship in voting in May was one factor that led to the fighting. **********A meeting of the eight-member collective presidency that had been called for Saturday to elect Mr. Mesic never materialized.  And Slovenia and Croatia, which both issued independence declarations on Tuesday, after months of pressing in vain for a looser federation of Yugoslav states. gave little indication that they were willing to halt carrying out steps toward independence. **********The federal Government responded by sending troops and tanks into Slovenia, attacking border posts, roadblocks and Slovenia's main airport. **********Dozens of casualties have been reported in Slovenia, while clashes in Croatia between Croats and ethnic Serbs have resulted in a handful of deaths. **********Slovenian officials said Saturday that in the three days of fighting, 20 soldiers of the Yugoslav Army were killed, plus 8 from the Slovenian side and 12 civilians. They said that among the wounded were 50 Yugoslav soldiers, 30 Slovenian militiamen and five federal police officers. **********On Friday the federal army said 10 of its soldiers had been killed in clashes. **********The Slovenian President, Milan Kucan, said at a news conference Saturday that he had been termed a traitor for agreeing to suspend the republic's efforts to secede, and that he could not be sure whether the Slovenian Parliament would approve the terms of the agreement. But he reaffirmed his support for independence, declaring, \"There is no drawing back from what the Parliament adopted.\" **********Slovenian officials Saturday reported continuing efforts by the federal army to seize control of border crossing points, and there were reports of continuing movements of troops and tanks in the frontier region. There were no signs that army troops were returning to their barracks, as the truce required. Unprovoked Firing Charged **********In Belgrade, Defense Ministry officials conceded that troops had not yet begun their withdrawal, but they said that was because many units were still coming under fire from Slovenian militias without provocation. **********Despite initial euphoria at the accord, the head of the European Community mediation group, Foreign Minister Jacques Poos of Luxembourg, described the situation in Yugoslavia as \"still dangerous.\" **********An official in Belgrade described the situation in Croatia, where there were reports of scattered violence, as \"very tense.\" **********Belgrade television, which tends to be pro-Serbian, reported attacks Saturday night by radical Croatian separatists in the villages of Mirkovci and Osjek, Serbian strongholds. **********The immediate concern of the leaderships, however, was continued skirmishing at Slovenian posts along the borders with Italy and Austria. **********The fiercest fighting since the cease-fire was declared Friday night appeared to have been at Skofije, a border crossing to Italy, where according to the Belgrade television reports one person was dead and three wounded."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/03/world/confrontation-gulf-washington-work-hot-spots-like-gulf-he-s-baker-s-cool-hand.html": {"writer_name": "Clifford Krauss", "pub_date": "1991-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1721, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Hot Spots Like Gulf, He's Baker's Cool Hand", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: WASHINGTON AT WORK; In Hot Spots Like Gulf, He's Baker's Cool Hand", "body_text": " **********\"Perhaps you should leave through the back door,\" Robert M. Kimmitt suggested after he scanned the note his secretary had slipped him. The State Department's third-ranking official had inadvertently left a European ambassador waiting outside his office for nearly half an hour and, a stickler for protocol, he did not want to appear to be favoring a journalist over an ambassador. **********Such long political antennae and stealth have been hallmarks of Mr. Kimmitt's fast career climb, keeping him close to the center of the action, but far, his critics say, from the fallout if things go wrong. **********In the 14 years since his father, Stanley Kimmitt, then the Secretary of the Senate, helped him get a summer job at the National Security Council, he has managed to serve in the Ford, Carter and Reagan White Houses. In 1990 and the Persian Gulf crisis, he came into his own.  Quietness Is Appreciated **********Now Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, he is point man for Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in the day-to-day handling of the gulf crisis. He oversees diplomacy at the United Nations, gathers and filters military, intelligence and political information from various advisers and experts, and coordinates policy with the White House and the Defense Department. In a capital where officials often equate power with the frequency their name pops up in the press, he does his work quietly. That is a skill Mr. Baker especially appreciates in his aides. **********A West Point graduate, decorated Vietnam War veteran and seasoned player of the bureaucracy, Mr. Kimmitt projects discipline, austerity and thoroughness, and honors rank. **********\"I've always felt that the best way that one can serve in public service is to maintain as low a profile as possible and keep your boss out front where the proper focus belongs,\" he said. \"I respect the senior-subordinate relationship, just as Secretary Baker does in his relationship with President Bush.\" **********Mr. Kimmitt's understanding of relationships works several ways. One of a handful of aides in the tight circle of political professionals who came with Mr. Baker from the Treasury Department and the White House, Mr. Kimmitt is more popular than some of the others with the State Department's career officers, many of whom have found their customary influence and access blocked. Filling his personal staff with members of the Foreign Service, he has reached out through the department for advice.  For Baker, a 'Capable Hand' **********Mr. Kimmitt is \"helping me tremendously\" on the gulf crisis, Mr. Baker said. \"He has a military background and when you are dealing with military issues that really helps. Bob is a guy who has a wealth of experience. He has served the nation extraordinarily well. He is an extremely thoughtful and capable hand.\" **********Margaret D. Tutwiler, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, who watches over Mr. Baker's public relations, said: \"Secretary Baker depends on Bob. Bob is very valuable to him. He is someone you can rely on.\" **********Before Iraq, Mr. Kimmitt was involved in a number of the Administration's more difficult but not necessarily most flashy foreign policy problems, including how to bring peaceful reform in South Africa and how to resolve the civil wars in Afghanistan and Cambodia. **********All his quiet deference notwithstanding, Mr. Kimmitt never lets you forget that even before his role blossomed with the gulf crisis, it was he who was Jim Baker's Baker. **********\"Management of a crisis is complex, it is tiring, but it is not necessarily the most difficult task that I undertake,\" Mr. Kimmitt said. \"Anytime I need to see the Secretary or to give him recommendations, that is done and done instantly.\" **********\"The most difficult thing is policy formulation and implementation when you are trying to keep many different policy balls in the air. How do we get a cease-fire in Angola? How do we avoid tensions on the subcontinent? How do we continue to advance the prospects of democracy in this hemisphere, particularly in Panama and Nicaragua?\" **********Mr. Kimmitt's colleagues characterize him as a mainstream Republican, a conservative not particularly driven by ideology whose advice on tactics and Congress is his greatest contribution. His attitude toward disputes with Capitol Hill reinforces that characterization. When Congress views a particular policy in a different way, he said, the Administration must be ready to compromise without retreating from principle. \"My feeling is you take what you can get and then march forward again,\" he said. **********As for Congressional criticism that he and others in the State Department should have foreseen the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and warned Iraq against it, he strongly disagrees. In an argument that critics find disingenuous, he says that Washington sent plenty of signals, but that the international response was weak.  The Unseen Hand **********Last summer, Mr. Kimmitt sensed a Congressional rebellion brewing against the Administration's diplomatic backing of a guerrilla coalition in Cambodia that included the Khmer Rouge. **********Persuading Mr. Baker not only to distance Washington from the Khmer Rouge but also to open talks with Vietnam and Cambodia, he achieved the most far-reaching change in United States Indochina policy in at least a decade without even notifying Richard H. Solomon, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and a proponent of the old policy. When the new policy began to lead to breakthroughs in regional peace talks, Mr. Kimmitt let Mr. Solomon take the credit. **********Asked about his being shut out of the decision to change policy, Mr. Solomon said: \"I don't want to get into the game of who-whom. I happened to be in Paris at the time.\" **********\"One of Mr. Kimmitt's alluring qualities is his discretion,\" said Richard Allen, who as national security adviser in the early 1980's was Mr. Kimmitt's supervisor. \"People who are discreet and without their own agendas are hard to find in Government. He was the kind of fellow in which you can confide.\" **********But a reputation for discretion can have a downside. Mr. Kimmitt was one of only two people from the Carter White House whom Mr. Allen kept on at the National Security Council, a fact that has stimulated much speculation around Washington that Mr. Kimmitt might have been the official who passed on a Carter strategy book to the Reagan campaign in time for the televised debate between the two candidates. Former Representative Donald Albosta, a Michigan Democrat who led a House investigation into the matter, said he now wishes his aides had interviewed Mr. Kimmitt. **********\"Why would Baker and everyone cuddle up to him after the campaign unless they wanted to cover up perhaps?\" Mr. Albosta asked.  The Iran-Contra Scandal **********That speculation was fanned by allegations made privately by several former Reagan White House officials that Mr. Kimmitt, who was executive secretary to the National Security Council from 1983 to 1985, passed Mr. Baker, then White House chief of staff, classified foreign policy papers when other senior Reagan White House officials were trying to keep him out of policy discussions. **********Mr. Kimmitt flatly denies passing White House documents to any unauthorized people. He also says he had no involvement in the Iran-contra scandal. His signature was found on one document made public during the trial of Oliver L. North, indicating he had some knowledge of Reagan Administration attempts to persuade Honduras to aid the contras when Congress had prohibited military assistance. **********Mr. Kimmitt \"must have known a fair amount or he was incompetent,\" Michael A. Ledeen, who was a consultant to the National Security Council in the Reagan Administration, said of the affair. \"His name never came up because he got out in time.\" **********Mr. Kimmitt said he had no particular recollection of the document he signed. \"Obviously if I had seen or heard something that I thought was out of bounds, I would have raised that with McFarlane or Poindexter,\" he said. **********Mr. Baker took Mr. Kimmitt with him to the Treasury Department in 1985 and then on to the Bush campaign, where he was charged with screening vice presidential candidates. The Questioning of Quayle **********Published accounts have said Mr. Kimmitt questioned Mr. Quayle about his military record and asked if there was anything in his past that could be embarrassing. Press reports that Mr. Quayle's father had helped him gain entrance to the National Guard, a popular and legal way to avoid service in Vietnam, later caused the campaign embarrassment. (The Vice President's office has repeatedly said that there were a number of vacancies in the National Guard unit in which Mr. Quayle served, and therefore he did not need his father's help to gain entrance.) **********Asked now if he questioned Mr. Quayle about his National Guard service, Mr. Kimmitt replied: \"This will sound evasive but it is not. I felt and still do feel that I had a lawyer-client relationship with candidate Bush. As a result, I have never disclosed either to whom I spoke or what I asked of those people.\" **********In recent weeks, Mr. Kimmitt has battled with Central Intelligence Agency officials who would like to unleash the guerrillas in Afghanistan in one last effort to defeat the Soviet-backed Government of President Najibullah. Mr. Baker wants to work closely with Moscow to coax the rebels and the Najibullah regime into democratic elections. **********\"If they have a problem at the agency it is with me carrying out a policy that has been set down by the Secretary and reaffirmed by the President during the June summit,\" Mr. Kimmitt said. \"So I have no hesitation in saying that their problem is not with me but with the senior leadership of this department and this Government. I think they are just bucking policy.\" ROBERT MICHAEL KIMMITT Born: Dec. 19, 1947 Hometown: Arlington, Va.

Brady. Still, it also underscored the political tensions involved in the hearings on B.C.C.I. conducted today by the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and international operations. Big Point of Contention **********The question of whether the Treasury Department, the Justice Department and the Federal Reserve Board ignored warnings that B.C.C.I. was engaged in criminal activities and was the secret owner of First American Bankshares Inc., a company with strong political connections, has emerged in recent days as a big point of contention between the Administration and critics in Congress and elsewhere. **********Senator John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat and subcommittee chairman, has been criticizing the Government and pressing for answers as to why the Government knew so much about B.C.C.I.'s potentially criminal tendencies, yet appeared to have ignored the evidence. Mr. von Rabb was one of several witnesses during a day of accusation and official denial that produced the following accounts: ***********Officials of the Federal Reserve said the bank was never informed that the Central Intelligence Agency knew at least five years ago that B.C.C.I. illegally controlled First American Bankshares, Washington's largest banking company. ***********The State Department said it learned in 1986 through the intelligence community that the organization of a leading terrorist, Abu Nidal, used a B.C.C.I. branch in Europe for commercial transactions. In his written testimony, A. Peter Burleigh, the department's coordinator for counterterrorism, said that information was used to disrupt Abu Nidal's commercial activities in an international effort. A number of countries, including East Germany and Poland under Communist governments, were approached as part of the effort with requests that they close down businesses in their countries that were working with Abu Nidal. ***********Jack Blum, a former investigator for the subcommittee, testified that he had been told by a former bank official that B.C.C.I. worked with \"about 3,000 high-net-worth criminal clients,\" and that the rest of the bank's apparently legitimate banking activity was set up to shroud its business with those clients. ***********According to an affidavit introduced at the hearing, a former B.C.C.I. official who had been subpoened in 1988 to testify before the subcommittee told an undercover Customs agent that he had been advised by Clark M. Clifford, who represented B.C.C.I., to get transferred to Paris to slow down Senator Kerry's investigation. Robert S. Bennett, a lawyer for Mr. Clifford, the chairman of First American, did not return a call for comment last night.  Reports of Weapons Deals **********The hearing also brought out a number of allegations about the bank's involvement in illicit activities and weapons deals. These included statements that B.C.C.I. had been involved in financing a shipment of Scud missles to Syria and had assisted Pakistan in its efforts to obtain triggers for nuclear weapons. **********In his statements, Mr. von Raab said that he had been \"eased out\" of responsibility for a 1988 Customs investigation of money-laundering at B.C.C.I. in Florida, and that sensitive documents had been kept from him by order of officials with the Treasury Department just as the inquiry was reaching its peak. **********\"I was told I was not to have information from the B.C.C.I. case,\" Mr. von Raab said, \"They felt I was overzealous in my drug enforcement efforts, and they were uncomfortable with the way I worked with Congress and the press to push cases.\" **********He asserted this as part of his contention that the Government had been \"lackadaisical\" in its prosecution of criminal cases against the bank, which was indicted in 1988 for money-laundering at a Tampa, Fla., branch office. The bank pleaded guilty in 1990 and forfeited $14 million. Plea-Bargain Agreement **********More important, the plea-bargain arrangement included an agreement that the Justice Department could not prosecute B.C.C.I. for any illegal activities that the Government was aware of at the time. The deal formally entered in the Federal District Court in Tampa in 1990. **********At the time, the Justice Department had possession of tape recordings, made by undercover Federal agents, in which B.C.C.I. officials openly claimed to control First American Bank and could rely on the influence of its chairman, Mr. Clifford, a prominent Washington lawyer and Democratic presidential adviser. **********Mr. von Raab's criticism was a footnote to a long history of clashes with Mr. Brady and criticism of the Administration's drug enforcement efforts. Upon leaving his job in 1989, Mr. von Raab wrote an emotional letter to President Bush, warning him that that the Treasury Department, the State Department and the Justice Department did not have the zeal to fight a war on drugs. **********But today, the Treasury Department replied with unusual bluntness. Desiree Tucker-Sorini, a spokeswoman for the department, confirmed that Mr. von Raab had been precluded from seeing classified information in the B.C.C.I. investigation after a Federal prosecutor in the case complained that there had been leaks of sensitive documents that could jeapordize the case. Limited Distribution **********\"The decision was made at that point to limit the classified information to the very pure definition of who needs to know,\" Ms. Tucker-Sorini said. \"From then on, there was a limited distribution solely to the people investigating the case. No information was withheld from the people working on the cases.\" **********In response to the former Customs Commissioner's criticism that Federal prosecutors had allowed B.C.C.I. to escape serious penalties, Doug Tillett, a Justice Department spokesman, said that Mr. von Raab never made his objections known, and that the deal had been supported by others who brought the case against the bank in Tampa. **********But Mr. von Raab said much of the support developed as a result of the team of Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations firms hired by B.C.C.I. during its legal troubles. He said that after the bank was indicted for money-laundering, it was able to plead guilty and forfeit only $14 million -- relatively modest for a global bank with $20 billion in assets -- partly because of the \"influence team working up and down the Eastern seaboard\" on behalf of the bank. **********That team, he said, included Mr. Clifford and Patton, Boggs & Blow, a Washington law firm with close ties to the Democratic Party, as well as Hill & Knowlton, the public relations firm headed by Robert Gray and Frank Mankiewicz, both of whom had successful political careers before entering the public relations business. **********Robert S. Mueller 3d, who has headed the department's criminal division since last September, said none of the bank's lawyers had ever approached senior officials with the Justice Department on behalf of B.C.C.I. or First American. Mr. Mueller's predecessor, Edward S. G. Dennis, said in an interview that he could recall no contact with the bank's representatives. **********Mr. Mankiewicz, the vice chairman of Hill & Knowlton, also disputed Mr. von Raab's testimony, calling it \"incredibly irresponsible and false.\" In a statement, Mr. Mankiewicz said no one at his firm, including Mr. Gray, had ever contacted anyone in the Administration or in Congress about B.C.C.I.                    --------------------       Peruvian Official Resigns **********LIMA, Peru, Aug. 1 (Reuters) -- A Peruvian representative at the World Bank, a former official of Peru's central bank who also once worked for the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, resigned today. **********\"Mr. Brian Jensen, who worked in B.C.C.I., has been in the post of alternative assistant in the World Bank,\" Peru's Economy Minister, Carlos Bolona, said at a news conference at the Government palace. \"Mr. Jensen is definitely no longer in this post.\" **********Mr. Bolona said Jensen's relationship to B.C.C.I. \"was the factor that determined his resignation.\" He did not say, however, that Mr. Jensen had been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with B.C.C.I. **********\"We are trying to determine responsibilities,\" Mr. Bolona said. **********Mr. Jensen, who is also a former official of Peru's central bank, could not be reached for comment. **********Peru's Attorney General has opened an investigation into possible wrongdoing by former central bank officials in connection with B.C.C.I., which was seized by regulators in several countries last month amid allegations of widespread fraud. Earlier this week, the Manhattan district attorney's office accused two former Peruvian central bank officials of accepting bribes from B.C.C.I. in return for deposits. **********Peru's President, Alberto Fujimori, has said his Government would take strong action if it found crimes had been committed in connection with B.C.C.I. **********Mr. Jensen was general manager of Peru's central bank in 1984 when the bank approved the opening of a B.C.C.I. branch in Lima. The branch never opened, however. Mr. Jensen was employed by B.C.C.I. when Peru placed the reserves in the bank in 1986, during the administration of former President Alan Garcia. **********Juan Candela, who was central bank chief at the time the decision was made to deposit the reserves, said, \"I do not know of any action that Mr. Jensen may have made on behalf of Peru.\" **********Mr. Candela said he was not aware of any bribes or commissions in connection with the deposits. He said the decision to place the reserves with B.C.C.I. was made after the bank offered Peru a $60 million credit line on the condition that Peru place $200 million dollars in the bank. **********\"There were very few banks that were willing to lend money to Peru at that time,\" Mr. Candela said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/16/business/the-media-business-childrens-music-lures-the-recording-giants.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1991-12-16", "snippet": "With his pleasant tenor, gentle manner and sophisticated arrangements, Raffi, a Canadian singer-songwriter, is the Bruce Springsteen of the under-10 set, selling more than six million records over the years.\n\nIt is far from clear who is the childr...", "word_count": 931, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;\nChildren's Music Lures The Recording Giants", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;\nChildren's Music Lures The Recording Giants", "body_text": " **********With his pleasant tenor, gentle manner and sophisticated arrangements, Raffi, a Canadian singer-songwriter, is the Bruce Springsteen of the under-10 set, selling more than six million records over the years. **********It is far from clear who is the children's Madonna or MC Hammer or U2, but the success of Raffi and others is leading a number of big entertainment companies into the rapidly growing business of children's music. **********Sales increased last year by more than 50 percent, to $300 million, and while that is only a fraction of the $7.5 billion music business, some executives believe it will be one of the hot areas for growth. Conglomerates Expand **********Responding in part to a new baby boom, Time Warner Inc. and the Sony Corporation this year joined other entertainment conglomerates in the children's music business. **********Last year, MCA Inc. acquired the recording rights to Raffi and his library of albums. So although Raffi recently said he would no longer record children's music, MCA still has his existing hits. **********\"There are going to be a lot more success stories coming out of this,\" said Geoff Bywater, senior vice president of marketing at MCA Records, who oversees children's music. \"People going into the business know there is business to be had.\" **********Until the recent boom, only two big companies, the Walt Disney Company and A & M Records, which previously handled Raffi, competed in the market. Additionally, there are perhaps 200 small independent record labels, many operating out of performers' homes. For them, selling 10,000 copies is an achievment. The Dynamics Change **********But with the arrival of other big labels, which have both marketing prowess and large national distribution networks, the dynamics of the industry are changing. **********Most children's records had once been sold mainly in specialty shops instead of music stores. Now, more albums are being delivered to record and chain stores, increasing the chances of producing big-selling albums like Raffi's \"Singable Songs for the Very Young,\" which has sold a million copies since 1984. **********\"As an independent label, it's a lot harder to get into the chain stores,\" said Debbie Block, who runs Round River Records in Seekonk, Mass., which recently signed a marketing agreement with A & M for the label's premier artist, Bill Harley. **********The giant of the industry is Disney, which recently reinforced its dominance by selling nearly three million copies of \"The Little Mermaid\" and, in just a month, more than 700,000 copies of \"Beauty and the Beast.\" Demographic Factors **********Disney is expanding its operations by moving beyond records tied to animated characters or soundtracks. It is recording artists like Parachute Express, a Southern California trio who gained attention by performing the music heard at Gymboree toddler exercise centers. **********The explosive growth of children's music is tied to several demographic and industry trends. Until this year, the number of births in the United States was increasing by more than 100,000 every year since 1987. **********Parents who grew up in the rock-and-roll era are eager to share their musical interests with their children, executives say. Because both parents often work, they also have the disposable income to spend on records. **********\"I've always subscribed it to yuppie guilt,\" said David Lovald, sales manager at Silo-Alcazar Inc., a distributor of children's music in Waterbury, Vt. \"You have two working parents looking for quality entertainment for their children that doesn't involve being glued to the TV.\" **********Executives say the Raffi phenomenon made the music industry recognize that quality children's performers could sell more than a few thousand copies if they appeal to adult tastes as well. **********\"In the past, music was produced for the kids to be enjoyed by themselves,\" said Mark Jaffe, vice president at Disney Records. \"But now parents are wanting to interact with them, so the music has to be very contemporary.\" **********As the industry grows, it is learning how to sell children's music to the mass market. Unlike the mainstream record business, there is no radio airplay to generate buying demand. **********Instead, sales build very slowly as parents learn of children's albums from friends and shops where salespeople know the music and play it for customers. And children's music can remain popular for years. **********\"This forces us to be more creative marketers,\" said Tom McPartland, vice president of legal and business affairs at the Bertlesmann Music Group, which is considering entering the children's concert business to promote its growing roster of children's artists. **********Sony, which set up Sony Kids' Music this year, is contemplating such marketing ideas as sample tapes of its artists, like Tom Chapin and Tom Paxton, that would be included with tape players it sells for children.Some Skepticism **********There remains some skepticism in the industry as to whether the market is big enough to accommodate all the expansion. **********\"There is a lot of arrogance at the major labels, where they think their money can buy whatever they want,\" said Leib Ostrow, the co-founder and chairman of Music for Little People, a Redway, Calif., children's catalogue and record company. **********Still, Mr. Ostrow recently sold 49 percent of his company to Time Warner's Warner Brothers Records division.

Yeltsin of Russia that Mikhail S. Gorbachev plans to resign on Wednesday, President Bush has reluctantly reached the conclusion that his friend and political ally clung to power too long and dulled the luster of his achievements, Administration officials said today. **********The officials said Mr. Bush decided in October, when he met with Mr. Gorbachev for the last time in Madrid, that the Soviet leader had lost the struggle for power with Mr. Yeltsin and had simply not yet acknowledged that to himself. **********But Mr. Bush, who supported Mr. Gorbachev with what seemed like single-minded dedication for three tumultuous years, still refused to turn his back on a fellow head of state, a stance that was reinforced by a lingering ambivalence in the Administration about Mr. Yeltsin. **********In this context, the idea that the Administration concluded long ago that Mr. Gorbachev was finished politically only served to underscore what some officials and outside critics have said for some time: that Mr. Bush's loyalty produced a distorted policy of propping up the Soviet Government beyond the point at which it was in the best interests of the United States. Once a 'Drugstore Cowboy' **********The story of relations between Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush is one of initial skepticism overtaken by pragmatic politics and personal ties. In May 1989, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, dismissed Mr. Gorbachev as a \"drugstore cowboy\" whose promise to halt arms shipments to Nicaragua could not be believed. **********By the end of that year, after the first Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting in Malta, Mr. Bush viewed Mr. Gorbachev as a promising diplomatic counterpart. By the time of the attempted hard-line coup in August, he considered him not only an ally in war and peacemaking in the Middle East but also a friend. **********Mr. Bush still retains his personal fondness and professional respect for Mr. Gorbachev and believes that he made possible the upheaval that led to the crumbling of Communist power in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, officials said. **********Out of deference to Mr. Gorbachev, the White House made no official comment today about the impending resignation. Mr. Bush, who is expected either to issue a written statement or to comment personally on the event on Wednesday, is certain to offer a positive overall assessment of Mr. Gorbachev's tenure. **********Still, many American officials were left with a sense that a great moment in history had somehow been diminished by the way Mr. Gorbachev was dragged from the world stage instead of making a grand exit.  Word From Yeltsin Monday **********Officials said Mr. Yeltsin told Mr. Bush in a telephone conversation on Monday that Mr. Gorbachev would resign on Wednesday. They said that freed the United States to let it be known that Washington would recognize the 12 remaining Soviet republics as independent states and move into a new era of relations after weeks of frustrating uncertainty. **********Administration officials said there was a strong feeling here that the departure of Mr. Gorbachev was long overdue and that he had lost his sense of timing, his personal force and his grasp of Soviet political realities. **********Mr. Bush's critics say he has been too slow to reach that conclusion. But Administration officials said today that the President and his advisers began moving toward that judgment when Mr. Gorbachev returned to Moscow in August after the coup attempt and tried to save the Communist Party from certain destruction. **********Then in October, at the meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in Madrid, Mr. Bush was left with the strong impression that his friend's time had passed, officials said. he concluded a joint news conference with Mr. Gorbachev in Madrid by patting him on the small of the back as they walked off the stage and muttering, \"You're the master.\" **********But officials said that that was merely a gesture of friendship and loyalty and that by far the stronger impression the Americans took home from Madrid was hearing word that the Soviet delegation could not afford to pay its hotel bill and that the Spanish Government was picking up the tab. Gorbachev's 'Preplexed Look' **********\"Gorbachev had this perplexed look that he couldn't believe what was happening,\" an official said. \"His old strength was gone, and what surprised a lot of us was there were all these historic events going on and this guy was going around talking about himself, totally out of touch.\" **********Some Administration officials now believe that, as one put it, Mr. Gorbachev \"waited too long.\" **********\"The problem is that he's leaving at a level that's a lot lower than he would have had a month ago,\" an official said. \"He's taken away from his own currency and cost himself a bit of his place in history by letting events pass him by. It's sad to see a man of such stature and historical importance misjudge events that way.\" **********Despite the President's reported judgment in October that Mr. Gorbachev's days were numbered, the Administration avoided any action that would have undermined him. This was, they said, a result partly of what one official called \"the President's strong attachment to Gorbachev personally\" and partly of a fundamental division among American officials about how to proceed. **********Some, like Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, urged Mr. Bush to side with the republics and abandon the center, while others, like Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, took the opposite view. Arms Worries Are Central **********For one thing, with uncertainty over who would control Soviet nuclear weapons a central factor in American decision-making, these officials argued that a central Government was the most reliable guarantor of atomic security. **********Some officials also mistrusted Mr. Yeltsin, who had at first impressed Mr. Bush and his top officials by the way he faced down the attempted coup against Mr. Gorbachev in August and then dismayed them by his offhand treatment of the Soviet President after the coup was smashed. **********\"For a long time, the solution to concerns about Yeltsin and security-related fears about the Soviet Union falling apart was to prop up Gorbachev,\" an official said today, acknowledging that the United States had only been slightly quicker than Mr. Gorbachev himself to conclude that the Soviet Union would disintegrate. **********\"Eventually, disintegration became an inevitability, and our policy changed to reflect it,\" the official said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/28/business/fed-eases-bank-rule.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 50, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fed Eases Bank Rule", "print_headline": "Fed Eases Bank Rule", "body_text": " **********The board of governors of the Federal Reserve Board voted today to liberalize regulation K, which governs international bank operations.

Kaunda's authoritarian leadership to the democratically elected Government of Frederick Chiluba is likely to send shock waves into Africa's long-entrenched regimes and embolden opposition groups, international election observers here say. **********They say the victory of Mr. Chiluba, leader of this country's labor union congress, and his new-born opposition party against Mr. Kaunda, one of Africa's \"big men,\" should hasten Africa's \"second independence\" -- the end of the end of the post-colonial autocrats who rule their countries as personal kingdoms. **********Now that an African country has achieved the political pluralism that Western aid donors have been seeking, the United States plans to provide inducements to others to follow Zambia's example, Assistant Secretary of State Herman J. Cohen said over the weekend. Pressure on Old-Timers **********Few predict the lightning transformations that swept Eastern Europe in 1989. But the optimists believe that the example set here will put pressure on all the old-time leaders, one of whom, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, the 86-year-old President of the Ivory Coast, took office in 1960. **********Former President Jimmy Carter, who headed an election-monitoring group here, said, \"It will be much more difficult for the oppressors to keep their people oppressed.\" **********Others were not so sanguine. An African ambassador who watched the elections here as part of a delegation from the Organization of African Unity was more cautious. \"Some of the strongmen could react with fear and dig their heels in,\" he said. Several African ambassadors representing their countries in Zambia were \"outraged,\" he said, that the O.A.U. had given credence to the elections by sending a delegation. Vary From Country to Country **********Thus, the impact of the Zambian elections will vary from country to country on this continent, depending on the status of opposition groups, the character of the governments and the personality of individual leaders. **********In the Sudan, for example, where a military dictatorship dominated by Islamic fundamentalists is in charge, it will be difficult for the Zambian result to even register. One of the Sudanese military leaders recently called multiparty democracy as alien to Africa as a \"three-piece suit in the desert.\" **********In West Africa, movements toward democratization already taking place through national conferences that bring together governments and opposition groups, may get bolder, the international observers said here. **********But the Zambian experience, they said, will reverberate most acutely in East and Central Africa. There, former British colonies like Zambia, formerly Northern Rhodesia, inherited institutions -- a judiciary, a press and professional organizations -- that had not been entirely eroded and could be used by an opposition, said Richard Joseph, a professor of political science at the Carter Center of Emory University in Atlanta.  Looking to History **********Mr. Joseph cited Kenya, headed by President Daniel arap Moi, and Zimbabwe, now a one-party state that has been led since full independence in 1980 by President Robert Mugabe. \"Moi and Mugabe are going to have to take a look and decide: 'Do I want to be a Kaunda or a Mobutu in the historical record?' \" **********Mr. Kaunda will be remembered, Mr. Joseph said, as having led his country to independence and then having agreed to multiparty democracy. By contrast, he predicted, President Mobutu Seke Seso of Zaire, who resists power sharing as his country seems to disintegrate, will go down as a dictator who ruined his land. **********Mr. Carter expressed hope that in Kenya the Zambian experience would infuse the opposition with more courage to stand up to coercion. **********While few doubt that there will now be increased calls in Kenya for elections, Kenyans and other Africans say it may take time for the pressure to mount on either President Moi or President Mugabe as it did on Mr. Kaunda. The former Zambian President, apparently feeling little choice, legalized political party activity last December after food riots and an attempted coup. Mr. Moi has categorically refused to allow the formation of opposition parties and threatened to crush demonstrators \"like rats.\"  Economic Advantage **********Mr. Moi has the relative advantage in Kenya of a stronger economy. Mr. Chiluba conceded in an interview that his campaign was helped by conditions in Zambia -- a lively labor movement and almost universal economic despair -- that did not exist in Kenya. **********On the diplomatic front, the Zambian elections may have a vital effect: It will be harder for the British Government, the main foreign backer of Mr. Moi, to maintain its public silence about his conduct. **********A British Conservative legislator, Anna Nicholson, here as an election observer, said she planned to raise the contrast between Zambia and Kenya in Parliament this week. \"I think it's time we came out in the open for multiparty democracy,\" she said. \"I think it is a disgrace that Moi has been able to get away with it for so long.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/31/business/rite-aid-seeks-to-buy-revco-as-salomon-settles-lawsuit.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1991-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 558, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rite Aid Seeks to Buy Revco As Salomon Settles Lawsuit", "print_headline": "Rite Aid Seeks to Buy Revco As Salomon Settles Lawsuit", "body_text": " **********Two broad steps were taken yesterday to clean up the tattered trail left in the botched 1986 leveraged buyout of Revco D.S. The Rite Aid Corporation, a competing drugstore chain, offered to buy the bankrupt Revco, even as the architect of the buyout, Salomon Brothers, agreed to pay $29.7 million to settle a lawsuit from some of the investors in it. **********The offer by Rite Aid, the nation's largest drugstore chain, intensifies a battle for control of Revco that has been waged since the Ohio-based drugstore chain filed for bankruptcy in 1988. **********Under the Rite Aid plan, about $440 million in cash would be paid to Revco's senior creditors. In addition, the company would assume certain liabilities and distribute seven million shares of Rite Aid common stock to most of the junior creditors to settle other claims against Revco. **********The plan, which was put together by Rite Aid and five holders of Revco securities, is the only one submitted to the bankruptcy court that provides for payment of cash and publicly traded securities to settle claims by Revco's creditors. **********If accepted, the deal would greatly expand Rite Aid, which is based in Shiremanstown, Pa. The company operates 2,439 drugstores. Revco, which operated more than 2,000 drugstores in 30 states in 1986, has sold many of them during bankruptcy, and now owns 1,100 stores with about $2.5 billion in annual revenues. **********\"We think now is the best of times to come into this process, because all of the other plans that have been produced didn't have any cash or had very little cash,\" said Martin Grass, president of Rite Aid. \"We are hopeful that other creditors will be joining us over the next few weeks.\" **********Revco officials declined comment on the plan late yesterday. \"We have heard that a plan was filed late this afternoon, but we have not seen it and don't know anything about it,\" a Revco spokeswoman said. **********Last week, Revco rejected a bid from another competitor, the Jack Eckerd Corporation. Eckerd proposed taking over Revco by issuing nearly $970 million in debt and $200 million in stock to buy Revco and retire its debt. **********Revco is pursuing its own plan of reorganization with three groups of creditors. **********Salomon's decision to settle closes the books on an embarrassing chapter in the firm's history, as it continues to deal with a much larger problem, the Treasury market scandal. **********Under its settlement, Salomon will pay $29.75 million to buyers of more than $800 million in securities that were used to finance the Revco buyout. Salomon, which said it still denied the allegations against it, was accused in the suit of failing to review the buyout properly and not disclosing the drugstore chain's financial troubles to investors. **********Salomon has reached a separate settlement with Revco as part of its reorganization plan. The firm has agreed to pay $9.5 million and assign any securities it may receive in the reorganization to Revco. That agreement settled charges that Salomon's deal left Revco essentially insolvent the day the buyout closed, leading to a claim known as fraudulent conveyance. **********The bid for the company and the settlement are added factors in what has evolved into one of the most complex bankruptcies stemming from the wave of mergers in the 1980's.

The Baring negotiations were said to have begun, however, after Baring approached Dillon to express the firm's interest in a possible deal. **********Under preliminary terms, Baring would purchase about 40 percent of the company from Travelers, which would also retain 40 percent. The rest of the firm's stake would be held by its partners. **********While one executive said that the deal was still in tentative stages, others said it was further along. The negotiations \"appear to be pretty close\" to a conclusion, one executive with knowledge of the situation said. **********A spokesman for Dillon declined comment. Peter Baring, chairman of Barings, P.L.C., said, \"I've got no comment at this time.\" **********Travelers' Financial Troubles **********Travelers has had financial troubles, because of a rising default rate in its mortgage portfolio and other real estate woes, and has been interested in selling a stake in Dillon to raise capital, even though the move would decrease its stake in one of its most successful investments. **********Travelers purchased Dillon, Read in 1986, at a price of $157.5 million, with an additional $67.5 million in employment contracts. That purchase price, about three times book value, is not expected to be matched in a deal with the venerable British firm. Negotiations were said to be more in the range of one to one and a half times the firm's book value. **********\"Travelers would like to see some of its money back, and is the driving force behind this deal,\" one Wall Street executive said. \"It is a very elegant solution.\" **********A deal with Baring would give Dillon a greater influence in the international investment banking business. But it would also raise questions about how Dillon's current international business would mesh with that of Baring. Similar deals, like the one in the 1970's that resulted in the business venture between Credit Suisse and the First Boston Corporation, struggled with difficulty in keeping both operations in business, until the two were made subsidiaries of a new holding company in recent years. **********If successful, the Dillon deal would unite two of the oldest financial firms in the world. Dillon, Read saw its beginnings in 1832, as the firm of Carpenter & Vermilye. Baring Brothers is a descendant of John and Francis Baring & Company, founded in London in 1762 as an agent for the Baring family's wool and dye business in Exeter. The Barings were originally North Germans who settled in Exeter in the early 18th century. **********In 1818, the infuence of its founding family was so great that it led the Duc de Richelieu to proclaim: \"There are six great powers in Europe: England, France, Prussia, Austria, Russia and the Baring Brothers.\" **********The Baring family also extended its influence into the United States, becoming in the 19th century the foreign bankers most trusted by the United States Government. **********That influence began to wane following what has been named the great Baring panic of 1890, when concerns rose about the solvency of the company after it made a series of bad investments. Throughout the 20th century, the company kept itself relatively small, despite tremendous growth elsewhere in the banking and investment world. **********Dillon also avoided excessive growth. The firm was unscathed by the tumult on Wall Street in recent years, primarily because it did not join the huge rush of firms that built up beyond the demand for financial services. **********The deal would be the third major change in ownership of Dillon, Read in a little more than a decade. In April 1981, a controlling interest of the firm was purchased by the Bechtel Corporation.

His colleague Michael P. Schulhof, the head of the company's music and film businesses in New York, had told a reporter that Sony planned to make a digital tape recorder based on technology developed by rival Philips N.V. of the Netherlands. **********Such product decisions are the province of the hardware group, which is based in Park Ridge, N.J. And Mr. Sommer said in a recent interview that Sony has still not decided on such an introduction. \"Maybe we both would have preferred that he hadn't made that comment,\" Mr. Sommer said. **********Mr. Schulhof, one of three non-Japanese on Sony's board, said he was commenting as a top Sony officer rather than as its ranking \"software\" executive. Yet it is not the first time people in hardware have felt upstaged by the music and film group, which is seen as the linchpin for Sony's growth as the electronics business matures. Ill will and jealous rivalries have been building between Sony's mainstay electronics group and its less profitable but flashier new sisters since Sony acquired the movie and record businesses in the late 1980's. **********\"The software side has made a number of announcements that have caused a lot of concern on the hardware side,\" said David Lachenbruch, editorial director of Television Digest, a newsletter in New York, and a long-time chronicler of Sony. \"My gut feeling is that there is a lot of disagreement and even rancor. It is very uncustomary for Sony, which has always had its act together.\" **********Tension between corporate groups can be healthy, even desirable. But at Sony, it threatens to undermine the synergies -- cross-marketing and coordinated product introductions -- that caused the company to link the businesses in the first place. Like a host of media companies from Time Warner Inc. to Paramount Communications Inc., Sony spent billions of dollars in the late 80's on the belief that one plus one would add up to three. Convinced of the benefits of producing film, video and music software and the hardware -- from VCR's to stereos -- to play it on, Sony paid $2 billion for CBS Records Inc. in 1988 and bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. the next year for $3.4 billion, plus the assumption of $1.5 billion in debt. Never again would something like the Betamax machine languish for want of products. **********Now, to keep from being eaten alive by its debt, Sony needs double-digit annual growth from its movie business, renamed Sony Pictures Entertainment last week. In fact, it is said to be planning to raise up to $3 billion in the United States and Japanese stock markets to pay down debt and finance entertainment operation. \"Both wheels on the cart have to move at the same pace for synergy to work,\" said Darrel E. Whitten, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Tokyo. \"If one of the wheels develops a flat, you have your worst nightmare.\" **********Some analysts already dismiss synergy as the leveraging of the 90's -- another fad dreamed up by investment bankers. But at Sony, the successful blending of software and hardware will take time, says Masaaki Morita, the brother of Sony chairman Akio Morita and the ranking Sony executive in the United States, the company's single largest market. As Mr. Sommer says, \"If you don't know how to think in 20-year terms, your company dies.\" **********It would be a mistake to bet against Sony, which had worldwide sales of $25.6 billion in the year ended in March, nearly half of them coming from the businesses headed by Mr. Sommer and Mr. Schulhof. With products like the Walkman and the compact disk, Sony has shown a knack for designing irresistible products. Only Coca-Cola has a more potent brand name, according to Landor Associates, a research firm based in San Francisco. **********Sony executives say it has already seen the results of synergy. Mr. Schulhof said young Japanese consumers were so thrilled by Sony's link to a glamorous American entertainment company like CBS Records, now called Sony Music, that sales of its audio gear rose sharply in Japan after the acquisition. \"It had a direct impact,\" said Mr. Schulhof. \"It was measurable and it was financial.\" **********Yet some early opportunities for cooperation between software and hardware have produced more conflicts than results. \"Synergy is a viable notion, but it can get stretched,\" said David J. Londoner, an entertainment industry analyst with Wertheim Schroeder in New York. \"The classic example of it not working is digital audio tape.\" **********The digital audio tape (DAT) machine allows music lovers to make hiss-free digital-quality recordings on tape. Despite Sony's single-handed efforts to sell the virtues of the technology, DAT has suffered from a lack of support from the music industry. Fearing widespread copying, record companies have refused to release hits on the format. Sony Music released a few classical recording on digital tape, but otherwise refused to break ranks with the music industry. \"Synergy does not mean coercion,\" Mr. Schulhof said. **********While he would have liked more support for the digital tape players, Mr. Sommer said he understands the position of his software colleagues. \"Sony is a company that does not want to have consensus on everything,\" he said. \"If Mickey does not want to support DAT, fine. I'm not going to kill him for that.\" **********The music companies softened considerably to digital recording last month, after the electronics makers agreed to pay them royalties for sales lost to digital home recording. Electronics makers like Sony, Philips and Matsushita were more receptive to the idea now that many of them own record companies. \"The landscape has changed,\" Mr. Schulhof conceded. **********While Sony executives maintain that there will be no forced synergy, there is a danger that artists working for the company's entertainment businesses will object to supporting other Sony ventures. Such a conflict appears to have surfaced with the director Steven Spielberg and \"Hook,\" Columbia Pictures' star-studded updating of the Peter Pan story, starring Julia Roberts, Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman. **********Set for release in December, \"Hook\" is viewed by Sony as a test case for the many ties-ins possible with a single movie. Executives envision promotions of the \"see the movie, win a Walkman\" variety, as well as with other companies. But outside marketing people working with Sony and Mr. Spielberg said the director was uncomfortable with the planned deluge of promotion, fearing the commercialism would cheapen the movie and jeopardize his chance of winning critical awards. Executives working for Mr. Spielberg deny any such concern and say they are happy with the arrangement. **********The internal combat has become particularly intense as the company prepares to introduce for Christmas a handheld reference device called the Data Discman, which relies on outside development of disks containing electronic encyclopedias and other reference works. Accustomed to cutting quick deals with software publishers, with little worry about making money from the software, Sony hardware executives complain that the company's software executives have alienated outside software producers. **********Some outside software publishers say that hardware executives relish the prospect of a conspicuous failure by the software side. \"I have been surprised by the intensity of the criticism from the hardware side,\" said one executive who insisted on anonymity. **********Peter Black, president of Xiphias, a Los Angeles production company that has signed a contract to develop material for Data Discman, said the tension is understandable. \"The hardware guys represent the cash cow, the business that is in its maturity,\" he said. \"They resent the new guys.\" **********Electronic products account for about 80 percent of Sony, with movies and music kicking in the remaining 20 percent. Operating income breaks down similarly, with the hardware side bringing in $1.76 billion to entertainment's $329 million. **********Mr. Schulhof said that eventually the entertainment business will contribute as much operating income as electronics, although he admitted such parity is years away. Mr. Whitten of Prudential Securities pegs growth of the music and entertainment business at about 15 percent per year, compared with 4 or 5 percent growth for consumer electronics over the next few years. **********Without such growth, Mr. Whitten said, Columbia's debt could drag down earnings. Sony is thought to have overpaid for Columbia Pictures and has kept spending lavishly on it. \"Columbia Pictures was an expensive transaction,\" Mr. Schulhof acknowledged. **********Asked if Sony was comfortable with the level of investment in the movie business, Mr. Morita said, \" 'Comfortable' is a very delicate word. Once we get the return on the investment, we will be comfortable.\" **********But some analysts doubt Sony will ever recoup its investment. \"There is a disaster waiting to happen called Columbia Pictures,\" said Emanuel Gerard, an analyst with Gerard, Klauer, Mattison in New York. \"I don't think Sony knows how to deal with this. They ought to be scared.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/17/business/business-digest-915591.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 658, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Companies **********Federal Express will order up to 75 cargo planes from Airbus in a $6 billion deal, Airbus officials said.

Industry Shrinking Faster **********The merger also signals a quickening in the pace of the banking industry's shrinkage -- a process that many analysts said was just beginning to get under way in New York City. While analysts think that Citicorp still has a lot of cost savings it can gain from simply streamlining its own operations, others looked to banking companies like Chase Manhattan, Marine Midland Banks and Bank of New York as potential merger candidates. **********New York has long been home to some of the nation's largest and most prominent banking organizations. But a combination of soured loans to third world countries, greater competition for bread-and-butter corporate lending, and newcomers invading their turf from regional cities and abroad have made these titans' futures precarious. **********Many banking analysts and economists viewed yesterday's merger announcement as just the beginning of a wave of consolidation. Indeed, Deputy Mayor Sally Hernandez-Pinero said yesterday that at a Gracie Mansion breakfast earlier this year, top bankers were in universal agreement that there would be more than one mega-merger before the year was out. **********\"I was shocked,\" said Ms. Hernandez-Pinero, who nonetheless admitted to being impressed that two such stalwarts in an industry known for its conservatism would finally decide to take such a painful step to insure their long-term survival.  Another Blow to City's Jobs **********A new round of layoffs in the banking industry will hit the city just as the well-publicized contraction on Wall Street seems finally to be abating. Although the banking and brokerage industries have each lost about 10,000 jobs in the last 12 months, the pace of those losses in the brokerage industry has slowed to a monthly rate of about several hundred in recent months, while those in the banking industry are running at about 1,000 a month. **********\"The banking industry's job losses will continue into the next year,\" said Rae D. Rosen, senior economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. She said she expected the local recession to continue into 1992, with the economy showing no sign of growth until 1993 or 1994. **********Coming on top of the 6,300 pink slips that were recently handed out to city employees, and the several thousand jobs that are expected to be cut from the Pan Am Corporation, this latest announcement is certainly not good news for the city.  Calls to Governor and Mayor **********In recognition of how important this development is to the local economy, John F. McGillicuddy, the chairman of Manufacturers Hanover, called Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York early yesterday, while Chemical's chairman, Walter V. Shipley, called Mayor David N. Dinkins. The response, Mr. McGillicuddy said, was not surprising. **********\"No politician likes to hear about job cuts,\" he said at a news conference later in the day. **********The merger is expected to result in the loss of about 6,200 jobs, 95 percent of them in New York City. Those figures could be reduced still further, depending on the rate of attrition at the two banks over the coming months. **********Although some senior-level jobs are likely to be lost because of the consolidation of overlapping administrative functions, most of the cuts are expected to come from the banks' clerical ranks and back-office workers. And that could have important social consequences.  Minorities and Women Affected **********\"Over half of the jobs in banks are clerical, and in the past they have provided a significant source of upward mobility for minority employees, and especially women,\" said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. **********Aside from the job losses, New Yorkers will likely notice the closing or sale of 70 bank branches, which will be concentrated in Manhattan, especially downtown. There will be no closings of Chemical's branches in New Jersey or Texas. **********Bank executives yesterday gave no specifics on which branches in New York City would be closed, and little detail about what criteria they would use, although they gave assurances that no neighborhood would be left bereft. The New York State Superintendent of Banks, Derrick D. Cephas, who has been on the job for one week, said that his department would have some contribution to the final decision-making process. **********He noted that the closing of a branch that was next door to another branch would not matter, but that if there were only one branch in a neighborhood, \"we would certainly take a different view,\" he said.  First and Third in Serving City **********According to a list prepared by the Department of Finance that ranks how well banks do in serving city neighborhoods, Chemical Bank was in first place and Manufacturers Hanover third. **********Both banks have also been active in philanthropic efforts that benefit the city: Manufacturers Hanover with its sponsorship of the New York City Marathon and corporate challenge races, and Chemical with its sponsorship of the Metropolitan Opera's concerts in Central Park and other outdoor venues. A spokesman for Chemical said those commitments would not change. **********The outlook is less bright, however, for the real estate market. The closing or sale of bank branches will put more pressure on the market for sublet retail space, which is already weak. In the 53 square blocks that make up the Grand Central business district, for instance, the vacancy rate for retail space is higher than 11 percent.  Effect on the Office Market **********Chemical's announcement that it intended to vacate its executive offices at 277 Park Avenue, at 48th Street, which it has leased until mid-1994, and to move into Manufacturers Hanover's headquarters across the avenue will also hurt the office market. **********Chemical currently leases about 750,000 square feet in its Park Avenue offices, and real estate specialists said the sudden arrival on the market of that much premium office space would hurt landlords with space available in less attractive areas or in slightly older buildings. **********\"The impact on the city now will not be good in the short term,\" said Jerry L. Cohen, chairman of William A. White/Grubb & Ellis, a real estate firm. Further consolidation is expected in the two banks' back-office operations, situated in New York City, Long Island and New Jersey. **********Still, large bank mergers have been anticipated by many in the real estate industry for some time. Salomon Brothers' real estate analyst, David Shulman, said that he had been assuming that a transaction like this would occur for so long that it had become a precondition, in his mind, to future improvement in New York City real estate. He said that he, too, expected another merger involving large New York banks and that as far as he was concerned, the sooner the city got the pain over with, the better."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/12/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-525591.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; People", "body_text": " *********** Craig Gugel, 37, senior vice president at Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc., New York, has been promoted to executive director of media research and technology, from media director. * Tony Shor, senior vice president and director of broadcast operations at Ally & Gargano, New York, has assumed the added responsibilities of creative-services business manager. *********** Judith Reiss and Barbara Ifshin, management supervisors at Young & Rubicam, New York, have been promoted to senior vice presidents, from vice presidents. * Gary R.

Its stone facade has been broken by a wrecker's ball, and a small army of Egyptian workers is now carting away the debris, clearing the site for the construction of an eight-story high-rise inside a walled embassy compound with the sunless feel of a Wall Street canyon. **********Like other buildings in other cities all over the world, the aging chancellery had become a dinosaur. Situated in a neighborhood of looping streets and mansions, a quiet, tree-lined quarter called Garden City that borders the din and clamor of central Cairo, the old embassy had great character and style. But it took up valuable space inside a cramped, three-acre compound that already houses one of the United States Government's largest overseas diplomatic missions. 'The Price of Progress' **********Diplomats here mourn the passing of the chancellery as an emblem of a simpler, less complicated era, when staffs were smaller, diplomatic life moved at a more measured pace and security concerns had not turned embassies into brooding fortresses. **********\"It's a shame, especially when you imagine that old building being replaced by another high-rise,\" a staff member said. \"But that is, sadly, the price of progress.\" **********What has happened in Cairo is not unique. In other foreign capitals too, the United States has been forced to abandon the gracious villas and mansions where it had maintained its diplomatic legations, and to replace them with modern buildings, wired for computer cables and high-speed electronics and reinforced to resist terrorist bombs. **********In the last few years, American diplomats have moved out of aging buildings in Georgetown, Guyana, and Sana, Yemen. \"Some of the older buildings we have been in around the world are nice, and they have a lot of character,\" said a State Department official in Washington. \"But they also are inefficient and -- most important -- vulnerable. Fifty or a hundred years ago, people were not building for today's truck bombs.\"  Tougher Look at Security **********After bombings at American embassies in Beirut and Kuwait in the early 1980's, the United States Government took a much tougher look at embassy security. In 1985 a Federal commission recommended an extensive Government program to beef up security at all American sites overseas. **********In Cairo, the task of redeveloping the embassy property was complicated by the astounding growth of the embassy. When Arthur Lowrie took up his post as the embassy's political counselor here in 1975, he recalls, the entire United States mission consisted of 40 Americans, including the Marine security guards. **********Just over 10 years later, the embassy had grown to nearly 600. Today, there are about 480 American staff members, including 110 members of a United States Aid to International Development mission, which is the largest since Vietnam. **********\"It was an elegant old place,\" said Mr. Lowrie, who now teaches at the University of South Florida in Tampa. \"There were tall windows and high ceilings with ornate plaster work, and a fireplace in the Ambassador's office. But even when I was there it was a bit cramped.\" Metaphor for a City **********In some ways, the passing of the chancellery is a metaphor for the city around it. Over the last two decades, as modernization has overtaken this tangled, teeming capital of narrow streets and rich but decaying colonial architecture, thousands of gracious buildings have fallen into total disrepair, or been swept away entirely to build new European-style office buildings. **********The chancellery building was constructed in 1929 as a private residence by a wealthy Egyptian family. Across the street on one corner was the British Embassy, which still occupies the site, overlooking the cocoa-colored waters of the Nile River. Across another street was El Walda Palace, the residence of King Farouk's mother. **********The United States Army bought the villa and its surrounding grounds in 1946, as the site of a military mission. A year later it became the United States Embassy in Egypt. **********As the staff inside the embassy grew, the green lawns and shady groves behind the chancellery were torn up and built over, replaced by marble patios and parking lots. The open-air courtyard where couples once danced at the annual Marine ball is now a 15-story building, from the top of which the Ambassador surveys Cairo, safely protected behind recessed, bulletproof windows. **********In designing the look of the new embassy compound, architects have sought to retain a traditional feel. Drawings of the new embassy high-rise show a two-story columned portico, overlooking a wide lawn of walks, gardens and palm trees. **********In many ways, the old chancellery building had all but disappeared from public view several years ago. The wrought-iron gates that used to afford some views of the interior of the embassy property were pulled down and replaced by steel plates and 20-foot-high, dun-colored walls, reinforced to withstand bomb blasts and constantly monitored by surveillance cameras. **********Among Egyptians who continue to profess their affection for Americans, and the strong ties that now bind the two nations, there is little admiration for the face the embassy compound now presents to Cairo. **********\"I hate to say it, but the American Embassy these days reminds me mostly of another embassy that is also built like a prison,\" an Egyptian woman said. \"You know it, the Russian Embassy, across the Nile.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/02/business/stocks-higher-in-tokyo.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 39, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stocks Higher in Tokyo", "print_headline": "Stocks Higher in Tokyo", "body_text": " **********Prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today.

Yet military spending is still running close to $300 billion, in real terms nearly what it was in 1989, the year the Berlin wall came down and the Warsaw Pact collapsed. **********And Pentagon plans call for total military spending, including atomic energy and the strategic weapons stockpile, to come down only 22 percent over the next five years. Measured in constant 1992 dollars to eliminate effects of inflation, military spending is projected to decline from $295.2 billion in the 1992 fiscal year to $252.5 billion in 1996. Pentagon planners call this plan their irreducible minimum and say further cuts would jeopardize national security. **********But a new study for the Brookings Institution, \"The Post-Cold War Defense Program,\" by William W. Kaufmann of Harvard and John D. Steinbruner, director of foreign policy studies at Brookings, contends that much deeper cuts in military spending could be made over the next decade without weakening national security -- and with important economic gains. The test of the United States as a superpower, they say, \"will be whether it can now arrive at a more realistic balance between its military and economic power.\" **********Their \"low option\" plan for cutting the military budget calls for spending of $2.2 trillion over the next 10 years, compared with $2.5 trillion in Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plan. But the Kaufmann-Steinbruner study maintains that the Cheney projections are too low, because they do not take into account real increases that will be required starting in 1997 for next-generation weapons procurement planned by the Pentagon. Allowing for such additional costs, the authors project the Pentagon's spending plans to reach a total of $2.8 trillion over the next 10 years, or $620 billion more than their low option plan. **********That plan would achieve its savings by scaling back both nuclear and conventional weapons. In the nuclear area that would include reconfiguring the B-1B bomber from a penetrating bomber to a less expensive cruise missile launcher; terminating the B-2 bomber program at 15 aircraft; deferring deployment of the small intercontinental ballistic missile, and reorienting the Strategic Defense Initiative to a research effort. **********For nonnuclear forces, the low option plan calls for continued upgrading of current combat aircraft, while delaying production of next-generation successors; postponing a range of capabilities aimed at enhancing the Army's ability to contain a Soviet attack; extending the life of the C-141 airlift aircraft and terminating the C-17A, and canceling the SSN-21 attack submarine and procurement funds for two new aircraft carriers. **********Despite these cuts, the plan would enable the United States to respond in the same way it did in the Persian Gulf war, except that four carrier battle groups would be used, instead of the six stationed in the Persian Gulf. **********Deeper cuts in military spending could be achieved, the study said, by adopting a \"cooperative security\" arrangement in which the leading military establishments, including the Soviet Union's, would be organized to prevent aggressive actions anywhere in the world. International regulations would guide the movement of forces, concentration of tactical aircraft and the nature of research activities. This arrangement would impose not only new global responsibilities on America's allies but also \"a meaningful shift in the assumptions used to guide investment in U.S. forces.\" **********Cooperative security, by relying more on other nations' forces and slowing down reaction times, could bring total United States military spending down to $2 trillion over the next 10 years, helping to save a total of $800 billion. **********By the year 2001, American military spending would be less than half its current level. The huge cut would reduce the drain on national savings, stimulate capital formation and economic growth, create more jobs and provide resources to meet other critical national needs. **********But the cooperative approach would demand exceptionally committed leadership, here and abroad. It would require countries like Germany and Japan to increase their global responsibilities. And it would require the United States to accept restraints on its freedom to take unilateral actions. For the United States to accept such restraints would be, the authors say, \"internally very difficult,\" but they insist that \"international events mandate a serious effort to make this transformation and are likely to compel the United States to debate it as a viable security option.\" **********President Bush's effort this week to force Saddam Hussein to comply with United Nations resolutions shows how hard it would be for the United States to accept collective restraints on its freedom of action -- and how important it is to be perceived as acting in the common interest of peace-seeking countries. The big military savings and economic gains will demand political vision and large concepts of what is involved in creating a new world order."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/25/business/accepting-the-harsh-truth-of-a-blue-collar-recession.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1991-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2147, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accepting the Harsh Truth Of a Blue-Collar Recession", "print_headline": "Accepting the Harsh Truth Of a Blue-Collar Recession", "body_text": " **********For all the talk of a \"white collar\" recession, it is blue-collar workers who have been hardest hit by the current economic slump, losing more jobs and enduring far higher rates of unemployment. Five times as many blue-collar jobs have evaporated, and jobless rates are more than twice as severe. **********More and more, blue-collar workers are facing the harsh truth that though the economy will no doubt come back, their lost jobs are probably gone for good, given the relentless advance of automation and international competition. Last week's announcement by the General Motors Corporation that it plans to shut 21 assembly plants and shed more than 70,000 jobs over the next few years -- only about a third of the cuts will come from the salaried ranks -- was just the most recent indication that the squeeze on blue-collar factory workers will continue. **********So in places like Haverhill, Mass., a struggling industrial town in the state's northeast, workers are starting to train for new occupations, which offer brighter employment prospects but often pay far less. Losing a Way of Life **********When Robert Harrington, a machine operator, was laid off in July, he lost a $37,000-a-year position and a standard of living he may never recover. After 20 years, his job in a nearby plant that prints and binds telephone directories was eliminated in a cost-cutting program. **********By September, Mr. Harrington was not only out of a job, he was also divorced. Instead of a spacious colonial home, he now lives in a two-room apartment with his 15-year-old son, Robert. After he deducts his rent, utilities and other expenses from his unemployment check, Mr. Harrington figures that he lives on $12 a day. These days, a night on the town is a chicken fajita at McDonald's. **********Mr. Harrington is studying in a federally financed program to be a paralegal, or lawyer's assistant. If he lands a job, he will earn at least $10,000 less than in his old blue-collar job. **********\"The money will be less, but I was looking for something that is recession proof,\" said Mr. Harrington, who is 38. \"I don't want to go through this again.\" Traditional Target for Cost Cuts **********The unemployment rate in blue-collar occupations -- a broad category covering more than 30 million Americans, from skilled craftsmen to manual laborers, with varied talents, incomes and circumstances -- stood at 9.1 percent in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By contrast, the white-collar unemployment rate was 4.1 percent. **********Since the peak of economic activity in July 1990, the blue-collar unemployment rate has increased by two percentage points while the white-collar rate has risen by one point. And the number of blue-collar jobs has fallen by more than a million, as desk jobs over all have declined by about 200,000. **********Of course, white-collar professionals like bankers and lawyers, who once considered themselves immune to recessions, have also lost jobs. Those layoffs have been well publicized, and many occurred early in the economic downturn, reinforcing the image of the white-collar recession. **********\"But the traditional American way of cutting costs is to lay off blue-collar workers in times of recession, and that remains overwhelmingly the case,\" said Erica L. Groshen, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, who has studied the impact on workers in various occupations. 'Joe Middleman' As Odd Man Out **********In a series of interviews in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Michigan, blue-collar workers, regardless of occupation, expressed the concern that the hold they once had on middle-class status was increasingly precarious. \"I am the working man -- 'Joe Middleman,' \" said Gary Aldous, an out-of-work carpenter from Torrington, Conn. \"But we seem to have an economy now that produces two classes, the rich and the poor. It seems as though this country is trying to eliminate people like me in the middle.\" **********The pinch on blue-collar workers has been tightening for years. From 1980 to 1990, after adjusting for inflation, the wages of blue-collar workers fell by 6.3 percent, while white-collar salaries rose 3.9 percent. \"Even a strong economy did not arrest the decline of earning capacity of blue-collar workers,\" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. **********The manufacturing sector, heavily blue collar, suffered more in the 1981-82 recession than this time around. In the previous downturn, 2.2 million manufacturing jobs were lost. Many of the cuts were made in the name of fashioning a lean and newly competitive corporate America that could hold its own against foreign rivals. The streamlining process succeeded in making American producers more vigorous and, recently, manufactured exports have been one of the few sources of strength in the American economy. **********Yet the process of squeezing more production from fewer workers is by no means over. This time, companies began shedding factory jobs 18 months before the recession began. Since January 1989, companies have eliminated 1.2 million manufacturing workers. \"Manufacturing employment has been hard hit in this recession and for years before,\" said Thomas Nardone, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Fewer Auto Sales, Fewer Auto Parts **********Howard Miller, a 53-year-old machinist of Jackson, Mich., went to work for Jackson Drop Forge in 1958, which made forged steel parts for companies supplying the Big Three auto makers. He worked there until the place finally shut down in November 1990, laying off its last 60 workers. **********A member of the United Automobile Workers Union, Mr. Miller made more than $10 a hour, and when the forging plant was busy, he made $28,000 a year. But this year, such jobs have been scarce, as the Detroit auto makers are struggling and thousands of companies that supply the auto industry are retrenching again. **********Unlike workers for the Big Three, who thanks to their labor contracts collect more than 90 percent of their wages when laid off, workers for the subcontractors have no such safety net. Mr. Miller's state unemployment payments of $226 a week ended last May. His wife, Geraldine, died in June of a prolonged kidney ailment. **********Mr. Miller owes the hospital $1,700 and the funeral parlor $2,000. His 1988 Buick was repossessed in July. His house was paid off years ago, but he is behind on his property tax payments. A neighbor helps by cooking him meals and baking him bread. Mr. Miller used to bowl for recreation, but, he said, \"I don't do anything anymore.\" **********Mr. Miller worked for two months this fall for a nearby company that repairs industrial machinery. As a part-time worker, he was paid $4.50 an hour, with no benefits. But the weakening economy brought that job to an end in November, and his prospects are bleak. There is very little forging work left near Jackson these days. The few machinist jobs available in the region require applicants who can handle computer-controlled equipment, a skill Mr. Miller does not have. **********The auto parts industry, with more than 650,000 workers, is America's largest manufacturing employer. But with increasing competition from Japanese suppliers, which are building new factories in America and hiring young workers, \"the domestic parts industry is where the next shakeout is going to be,\" said Sean McAlinden, a labor economist at the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. \"And there's no retraining solution for the older workers in that industry.\" A Union Carpenter, Trying to Scrape By **********During the 1980's real-estate boom, Ron Richnavsky, a 29-year-old carpenter from Harwinton, Conn., had all the work he could handle. A union carpenter, paid $17.50 an hour plus benefits, he made up to $50,000 a year. In 1988, he and his wife, Linda, bought a $135,000 four-bedroom house for themselves and their three daughters, Nicole, Amanda and Danielle. \"At the time, I was making good money,\" he said. \"We thought we could handle it.\" **********Mr. Richnavsky has had some work this year, but not nearly enough. He is about six months behind on his mortgage payments of $1,200 a month, and the bank is threatening to foreclose, he says. His wife makes $130 to $150 a week in her part-time job as a waitress. His unemployment benefits amount to $300 a week. \"We can scrape through,\" he said, \"as long as I don't pay the mortgage.\" Blinded by the 80's **********Like so many other Americans, Mr. Richnavsky admits that he got caught up in the prosperity of the 1980's, assumed it would continue and took on too much debt. \"When times are good, you don't think,\" he said. **********Mr. Richnavsky has thought about seeking training in another field -- \"some kind of computer training,\" he said -- but not seriously. As a journeyman carpenter, he is a skilled craftsman who should be in demand when construction activity picks up. **********The amount of work may never again reach the superheated pace of the 1980's. The current 30 percent unemployment rates in construction in Connecticut, with the number of hours worked by the state's union carpenters cut by half since 1988, is the biggest slump in more than two decades, says John Cunningham, president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners Local 210, representing Fairfield and Litchfield counties. The situation cannot help but eventually improve, Mr. Cunningham says. Seizing the Chance For a Fresh Start **********In the lower Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts, the industrial northeast corner of the state, local government officials are not waiting for the recession to end. They are engaged in an aggressive effort, aided by Federal money under the Job Training Partnership Act, to retrain and find jobs for laid-off workers. Under the local program, the trainees receive unemployment benefits for an extended period of 10 months while they take courses to prepare for a new career. **********The lower Merrimack region includes high-tech industries and traditional manufacturing plants clustered around the cities of Lowell, Lawrence and Haverhill, which have unemployment rates of 12 to 15 percent. The well-known companies in the area include American Telephone and Telegraph, Wang, Digital Equipment and Raytheon, all of which have cut their payrolls. **********Ellen Reingold worked for 24 years as a electronics production worker for various companies in the region. Her most recent job was a yearlong stint at $10.50 an hour for Raytheon, debugging the electronic circuitry on the Patriot missiles of gulf war fame. But she was laid off last May. Mrs. Reingold, who is divorced with two grown children, was forced to sell her house in Haverhill, unable to make the $1,068-a-month mortgage payment. \"It was either sell it or lose it after I lost my job,\" she said. **********In the good years, Mrs. Reingold made $30,000 as an electronics assembler. But in each of the last three years, she has been laid off for months at a time. Seeking a field that offers more steady work, she is studying for a career in medical transcribing, the task of typing up doctors' tape-recorded notes into a computer. Besides word-processing skills, she is studying medical terminology. **********Hospitals and clinics have stables of medical transcribers, she has heard. \"They say there's a lot of work out there,\" said Mrs. Reingold, who is 41 years old. From Dying Job to a Healing One **********Some of the retraining students have embarked on striking career changes. Rene Martineau, a burly 48-year-old former printing superviser, is training to be a licensed practical nurse. A nursing job, he says, will pay only about half of the $50,000 a year he used to make. \"But printing is a dying industry,\" he said. \"It will all be done by computers soon. And there is a real shortage of nurses.\" **********Others see the recession as an opportunity. Michelle Dryver of Amesbury, Mass., has moved through a succession of mainly factory jobs since she graduated from high school eight years ago. She and her husband, Andrew, an assembler at a circuit-board plant, are scrimping to get by and have put off plans to start a family. **********But Ms. Dryver is now studying office management, accounting and word processing at Northern Essex Community College in Haverhill, as well as medical terminology and transcribing. \"I should be able to get something more than dead-end jobs when I graduate,\" said Ms. Dryver, who is 26 years old. \"This is a perfect opportunity for someone like me.\" **********Northern Essex Community College has about 1,000 of what the college president, John Dimitry, likes to call \"our new breed of student,\" in the worker assistance program, a three-year-old endeavor. The students' grades, he said, have been about a full grade point higher than those of the younger students. **********\"What this has taught me is that there is enormous flexibility on the part of the work force,\" Mr. Dimitry said. \"They want to be retrained and educated, given the chance. It can be done and it is being done right here.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/11/world/haiti-s-victors-working-to-soothe-fears.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1991-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 657, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Haiti's Victors Working to Soothe Fears", "print_headline": "Haiti's Victors Working to Soothe Fears", "body_text": " **********Three days after a failed coup attempt set off a spree of looting and vengeful attacks that left at least 70 dead, supporters of Haiti's President-elect, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, have begun working to calm the fears of those who warned that the leftist priest's election last month would unleash a wave of revenge. **********After three nights of curfews and calls for order by Father Aristide and other political figures, life in the capital and other cities largely returned to normal today. But as Haiti cleans up from the violence, diplomats say damage to one target of the attacks, the country's Roman Catholic hierarchy, will prove difficult, if not impossible, to repair. **********There is no evidence that Father Aristide, who has long battled conservative Catholicism, directed attacks in which the capital's 221-year-old cathedral and the Vatican Embassy and residence were destroyed, the Papal Nuncio assaulted and his secretary gravely wounded. But diplomats and Haitian analysts say the incidents have badly hurt the new Government's image among the diplomatic corps and may have crippled ties between Haiti and the Vatican. Explaining the People's Reaction **********Several diplomats said in interviews that Father Aristide had been neither fast enough nor forceful enough in condemning the street violence that followed the failure of an attempted coup by a former leader of the brutal Tontons Macoute militia. **********In a brief statement read over a radio station Wednesday afternoon, Father Aristide called the destruction \"hideous,\" but he dwelt on explanations of the people's violent reaction. His call for \"vigilance without vengeance\" was seen by many as advocating further popular mobilization against supporters of the deposed Duvalier family dictatorship that ruled Haiti for 29 years. **********\"The attack was hideous, but at the same time they are saying, 'We have to get more Macoutes,' \" said one senior Western diplomat. \"Here we have the violation of a diplomatic premise and wherever that happens in the world it must be considered very grave.\" **********Many observers have expressed concern that Father Aristide's past statements, which come close to advocating violence openly, have set a tone for the people that will be difficult to contain.  United States Concerns **********The United States, Canada and the United Nations have publicly expressed strong concerns to Haiti's interim Government and, indirectly, to Father Aristide. **********\"There can be no excuse for using the failed coup attempt as an excuse for exacting vengeance,\" a State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said in Washington. The Vatican has remained silent on the incidents. **********Father Aristide's spokeswoman, Marie-Laurence Lassegue, said the violence was an aberration. \"I know this is something that has shocked a lot of people,\" she said. \"But we don't think the people realized what they were doing, that this was an embassy. We have always respected embassies in this country and this is a great pity that will not be repeated.\" **********Nonetheless, other supporters of Father Aristide said the violence had been caused by criticism of Father Aristide, and the insurgent \"Little Church\" movement he has led, by Msgr. Francois Wolff Ligonde, the Archbishop of Port-au-Prince. 'Chills the Hearts' **********\"Ligonde officially gave his benediction to the coup,\" said Jean-Claude Bajeux, a human rights advocate and former priest, expressing a widely held interpretation of a homily by the Archbishop in which he spoke of the \"anxiety that chills the hearts of mothers and fathers\" at the prospect of an Aristide Government. **********It has been widely reported here that the attacks on the home and office of the Papal Nuncio, Msgr. Giuseppe Leanza, were aimed at Monsignor Ligonde, who has been in hiding ever since. When crowds attacked the Nuncio's home in the wealthy Petionville area early Monday morning, Monsignor Leanza and two nuns were able to escape with the help of neighbors and the police, but the Nuncio's personal secretary, the Rev. Leon Karenga, was chased by the crowd, chopped at with a machete and nearly killed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/23/business/business-people-macoms-president-is-a-venture-capitalist.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Judge", "pub_date": "1991-03-23", "snippet": "M/A-Com Inc., a military electronics equipment maker in Burlington, Mass., has named Allan L.

The group said the money would have been better used to reduce customer bills. **********The methodology underlying the Consumer Federation's charges is technical and arcane, and covers a wide variety of situations in 50 states. BellSouth, the largest Baby Bell, and the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, which represents state public service commissions, both declined to comment until they could study the group's charges and methodology. **********Next month is the 10th anniversary of the Justice Department consent decree that led to the 1984 breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. The Consumer Federation's asccusations come when recent court decisions have freed the Baby Bells to provide information services, like stock quotations, over telephone lines, a service that had been banned by the 1984 accord. **********The Baby Bells' lightly regulated ventures include $2 billion in investments by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech in the New Zealand telephone company, and U S West's ownership of $1.6 billion worth of office buildings whose value has dropped sharply because of the recession. **********Along with the GTE Corporation, the Baby Bells provide the bulk of local telephone service in the country and encounter little or no competition in providing that service to business and residential customers. Their revenues exceeded $100 billion in 1990. **********The Consumer Federation, which claims 50 million members and represents 240 consumer groups, says that lightly regulated emerging businesses like information services would be open to pricing abuse. The group, based in Washington, is arguing that Congress should reimpose the ban on information services until the Baby Bells no longer enjoy a monopoly on local service. **********Mark N. Cooper, the Consumer Federation's director of research, said the Baby Bells had received about $12 billion in \"excess returns\" since 1985. The figure is based on the Consumer Federation's assumption that the Baby Bells, which were virtual monopolies before divestiture, should have continued to earn the same rate of return after divestiture. **********By the federation's calculations, Mr. Cooper said, the Baby Bells earned a nearly 1 percent higher return on equity, an important financial index, than all American manufacturers as a group. 'Excess Depreciation' **********Another $18 billion of the $30 billion in reported overcharges, Mr. Cooper said, comes from what he called \"excess depreciation,\" which covers how a telephone company accounts for plant and equipment on its books. Such accelerated depreciation is intended to encourage a company to replace its outdated plant and equipment, by accounting for the depreciation as a higher cost of doing business. **********But Mr. Cooper argued that the Bells' depreciation practices simply meant that the companies could keep more of their customers' money, rather than reduce telephone bills."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/16/business/the-media-business-advertising-a-big-jump-for-revlon-s-campaign.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 748, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'A Big Jump' For Revlon's Campaign", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 'A Big Jump' For Revlon's Campaign", "body_text": " **********FOR the first time in five years, Revlon Inc. is making over the advertising for its flagship cosmetics products. The campaign, to make its debut next month, is a sharp departure from the elegant glamour of current ads. **********Models are dressed in denim and leather, for example, not evening gowns and designer dresses, and they are smiling and laughing, not pouting and staring. And in altering the way the company sells what its co-founder, Charles Revson, once called \"hope in a jar,\" television commercials will feature the pop group Technotronic rapping a jingle with lyrics like \"Yo! C'mon, move this, shake that body for me.\" **********\"We're making a big jump here,\" Dick Tarlow, president of Tarlow Advertising, Revlon's in-house agency, said in an interview yesterday at his midtown Manhattan office. Joining Mr. Tarlow to provide a preview of the campaign before it is to be introduced on Monday were Jerry W. Levin, president of Revlon since April, and Michael Hammond, newly named president of Revlon North America, which combines the management of the Revlon and Almay brands. **********Revlon's reorientation is of interest not only because the company, owned since 1985 by Ronald O. Perelman, is a primary force in the nation's estimated $12 billion beauty business. Revlon has also been a leader in shaping trends in marketing imagery, from the model Dorian Leigh's dazzling Fire and Ice ads in the 50's -- \"For you who love to flirt with fire . . . who dare to skate on thin ice\" -- to the photographer Richard Avedon's formally stylized print ads of celebrities like Oprah Winfrey in the 80's. **********\"Could we scare off a consumer by saying it's too much of a jump?\" Mr. Tarlow asked rhetorically about the campaign's new direction. On the contrary, he replied, \"I think we haven't kept up with our consumer,\" and the changes are intended to reflect the evolving tastes of Revlon's present customers. **********\"I've felt in the last year we were not moving and the world seemed to be moving,\" he said. **********As evidence, the executives cited recent significant shifts in the ever-fickle world of fashion, like the woman who \"wears a $30 pair of jeans with a $1,000 blazer,\" Mr. Hammond said. That new approach, mixing denim and diamonds, motorcycle jackets and mink, has been trumpeted by Vogue, the flagship of the fashion magazine field, under Anna Wintour, its editor in chief. **********To underscore the changes in the campaign, Mr. Tarlow has switched photographers, ending Revlon's longtime relationship with Mr. Avedon and replacing him with Patrick Demarchelier.

If you don't get better, you'll get left behind.\" For instance, Cover Girl, which leads No. 2 Maybelline and third-ranked Revlon in the mass-market segment of the industry, has undergone a furious series of changes under its new owner, Procter & Gamble, including a new agency, Leo Burnett U.S.A., and a new campaign with the theme \"Redefining beautiful.\" **********Mr. Levin, a former executive vice president of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Revlon's corporate parent, scoffed at suggestions that the changes were intended to help dress up the company for sale.

Last week, at the end of the completion of its first week, Secretary Cheney and General Powell gave you their assessment of where we stood at that time. They have asked me to give you a similar assessment at the end of the second week. Let me start by covering the campaign objectives to date. . . . **********In our first phase what we wanted to do was disrupt leadership command and control; destroy centralized air defense command and control; attack combat aircraft in the air and on the ground to achieve air superiority; damage nuclear, biological and chemical storage and production capability; and commence attack on Republican Guards. **********Once we had that done we planned to go into a second phase, which was to destroy the air defense radars and missiles in the Kuwaiti theater of operation to achieve undisputed control of the air -- some people call that air supremacy. And finally, to sever supply lines in the Kuwaiti theater of operation. And once that phase was completed we planned then to isolate the Kuwaiti theater of operations, continue our attacks on the Republican Gaurds, and we have other objectives which I will not discuss further. **********In order to tell you, to measure our success to date, I think I will measure it against the objectives that I've just discussed. **********. . .          Leadership Objective **********Seventy-five percent of Iraq's command, control and communication facilities have been struck during our air campaign, and one-third of those are completely destroyed or inoperative. As a result, Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis have been forced to switch to backup systems, and those systems are far less effective and more easily targeted. . . . **********We have attacked air defense nerve systems striking 29 targets and more than 800 sorties. As a result, the Iraqis have abandoned centralized control of their air defense within Iraq and Kuwait, a very important point. This accounts, in part, for the very, very low attrition rate of coalition aircraft. **********. . . **********The Iraqi early warning system has completely failed, and their aircraft have been caught totally by surprise when we attacked them. . . . To date, based upon where their airplanes have been, we've attacked 38 airfields, and we've flown over 1,300 sorties against these airfields. The 38 airfields have all been struck at least once, and many of them have been struck at least four times. At least nine of them are nonoperational.  Destruction of Airfields **********But let me -- this is a very important point. We never had any intention to render all of the airfields inoperable. That was not our intention at all. Our intention is to render the air force ineffective. Now, there have been varying reports about how many of these airfields have been destroyed, and there have been varying reports about how much damage was done on the ground. I'll tell you, we can confirm at least 25 airfields destroyed on the -- airplanes destroyed on the ground. **********. . . **********Now, as a result of this type of operation, they decided to put all of their aircraft in hardened structures. They tried to hide their aircraft. Therefore, we commenced a systematic destruction of those hardened shelters. **********. . . **********The results to date of this type of attack is we have destroyed more than 70 of these hardened shelters and, quite frankly, the Iraqi aircraft are running out of places to hide. We now have reports that many of their smaller aircraft they have moved to roads and hidden them in residential areas that are close to the airfields because they know we're not attacking civilian targets. **********As you all well know, 89 of their aircraft -- and I should say these are their front-line F-1 Mirages, and their MIG-23 Fencers -- 89 of them have flown into Iran. The simple fact of the matter is, that now every time an Iraqi airplane takes off the ground, it's running away. As a result, Chuck Horner, my Centaf commander, has now claimed air supremacy. **********I'd like to talk a little bit about the isolation of the Kuwait theater of operations. One of the ways we do this is by destroying the bridges that lead into the Kuwaiti theater of operations area. . . . We have targeted a total of 36 bridges. Out of those 36 bridges, we have attacked 33 of them with over 790 sorties. Obviously, by shutting off the bridges, we shut off the supply lines that supply the forces in southern Iraq and in the Kuwaiti theater of operation. **********. . . **********This  [ refers to a map ]  is the the main supply route right here that comes down into Kuwait City. In the past, on any given day in the early part of the campaign you could look at that main supply route, at any given time you'd find about a thousand trucks on that M.S.R. Nowadays, whenever we look at it with any of our sophisticated systems the maximum we find is less than 100. That means about a 90 percent degradation in his supply rate. If you translate that over to what we know about his supply rate -- it takes him about 20,000 tons per day to support the troops in Kuwait -- we feel that we've reduced him to about 2,000 tons per day. **********We've got some anecdotal information that would also demonstrate that we're being very effective. We get many, many reports out of Kuwait that Iraqi soldiers are begging for food from Kuwaiti civilians; in many cases stealing it also. The enemy prisoners of war that we've taken have told us that they're receiving only one meal a day. That meal generally consists of a bowl of rice or a bowl of beans. And they have no water in which to bathe and, as a result, many of the enemy prisoners of war that we've taken are infested with body lice and many of them have open sores on their body. **********. . .          Republican Guards **********We're targeting the Republican Guards with about 300 sorties a day, 300 sorties a day. We're using very accurate bombing and even in bad weather, the many secondary explosions are confirming the fact that we're inflicting continuous damage on them. . . . **********Just from 12 noon yesterday until 3 this morning, that's a little bit more than a half a day, we have confirmation of 178 trucks destroyed, 55 artillery pieces destroyed or damaged, 52 tanks destroyed or damaged, and heavy secondary explosions from revetments and fires all over the area. **********We had one spectacular explosion n the 28th of January. Let me give you a reference. If, on a scale of 1 to 10, the eruption of a volcano registered 10, and the recent explosion at the Soviet rocket propellant plant would register a 9, the explosion, the explosion -- the secondary explosion we had the other day registered at 12. We now have confirmation that we destroyed over 125 storage revetments in the largest ammo storage area in the northern part of the Kuwaiti theater of operations. And needless to say, we are going to go back and visit it again to get anything else that happens to be left there. **********. . .          Battle of Khafji **********I'd like now to sort of report what's been going on last night and today. . . . Yesterday evening, We had an attack in that area by what was estimated to be an Iraqi mechanized battalion. They had crossed the border. It was engaged by a Marine light armored infantry battalion and tactical air. The result: 10 Iraqi tanks destroyed, four enemy prisoners of -- P.O.W. -- and the Marines lost two light armored vehicles. . . . Later on that same evening, another Iraqi battalion came across the border. These were again engaged by AC-130's  [ ground attack planes ]  and Cobras  [ attack helicopters ] . We destroyed four tanks and 13 vehicles. We have had reports that the Iraqis . . . did go into Al-Khafji. Of course, as you know, Al-Khafji has been abandoned and deserted since the very first day of Desert Storm, so there was no one there. . . . In the very early morning, Iraqi tanks and infantry again crossed the border. This time they were intially engaged by the Saudi Arabian National Guard and then Marine TAC-AIR engaged them and the enemy withdrew. Early this morning, 40 more Iraqi tanks crossed the border again at the same place they came across before. They were once again engaged by the Marine light attack -- light armored infantry. This time the result was 10 enemy tanks destroyed and they captured nine enemy prisoners of war. At the present time we have reports that the Saudis are moving forces into Al-Khafji to eject any Iraqi that may be in that area. . . . **********We have confirmed figures of 24 Iraqi tanks destroyed and 13 other vehicles destroyed. The Marines lost two light armored vehicles. Unfortunately, I'm very sad that I have to report to you that they lost 12 K.I.A.  [ killed in action ]  in that engagement and 2 W.I.A.  [ wounded in action ] . These are the first  [ American ]  casualties of any ground conflict -- the first K.I.A. of any ground conflict. **********. . .          Over 500,000 Troops **********One last announcement: Today, we went over 500,000 troops in the theater. **********Let me just finish up by giving a very brief closing assessment. By every measure -- by every measure -- our campaign plan is very much on schedule. Now, there's no way that I'm suggesting that the Iraqi Army is close to capitulation and going to give up. I think their actions last night have proven that to all of us. But I am quite confident that the direction we're heading in is going to lead to exactly the outcome that we all want to see. . . . **********QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Killing of P.O.W. **********Q. General Schwarzkopf, the Iraqis claimed yesterday that a P.O.W. of unknown nationality was killed in one of the bombing raids on a place where he was being used as a human shield. What can you tell us about this human shield business and how you're dealing with that when it comes to bombing targets in Iraq? **********A. I'll tell you like I'd -- I'd really like to tell you how I'd like to deal with it, but I won't get into that. All I can say is that is a gross violation of the Geneva Convention. . . . The International Red Cross has inspected our P.O.W. camps. I challenge -- I challenge -- the Iraqis right now to do the same damned thing in their P.O.W. camps. And look at how they're treating our people and the other coalition P.O.W.'s. **********. . .          Flights to Iran **********Q. General, why do you think these 89 planes have flown into Iran? Can you give us a reason why you think that's happened? **********A. Well, you could really come up with three different -- I come up with three different scenarios. O.K., scenario No. 1 is, they are flying off to husband them for another day -- that's one of them -- O.K. -- husband their resources for another day. Scenario No. 2, you have that they are flying in there to launch an attack -- to launch an attack against us at some future date -- although the Iranians claim that that is not the case. And to date, I see no reason why we shouldn't believe the Iranians. Scenario No.3 is, we've had some reports that some of those people were defectors. So, it could be any one of those three things or a combination of all of them. But I think it's a very good sign that they don't feel confident where they are -- they've got to run someplace else to hide. And I'm delighted with that outcome. **********. . .          Numbers of Iraqis **********Q. General, could you tell us how many Iraqi troops and tanks have so far come across the border in these engagements down here? **********A. No, I really can't. I told you about a battalion, I think, in each case, and there's about 40 -- 40 tanks per battalion, and that -- and again, we're not in the business -- obviously, we're shooting, not counting, when they come across, so that's ---- Chances of Ground War **********Q. Given this entire presentation tonight about the effectiveness of the coalition air forces, is there a chance that there won't need to be a ground war? **********A. There's always a chance of that, but certainly, you know, I'm -- you know, as a military planner, you always plan for the worst case rather than the best . . . **********. . .          Oil Field Strikes **********Q. General, three days ago you gave us a briefing on the military effort to take out those manifolds at the Ahmadi oil fields, you talked about the air strikes that went in. A Washington newspaper ran a story saying that the Navy Seals were ready and willing to go in and do that job, but that you told them no. Is that true? **********A. Normally, in response to a questions like that, I would say that that report contains some inaccuracies. However, reverting to my old style, I would describe that report as bovine scatology,  [ laughter ]  better referred to by the troops as B.S. I don't know who that guy's source is, but he ought to get a new source, because his source is a liar. **********. . .          Nuclear Installations **********Q. You have mentioned that the -- you have destroyed all of the Iraqi nuclear reactor facilities. Do you have any information about the contamination? . . . **********A. Yes. We -- every target that we have attacked, be it nuclear, chemical or biological, we have very carefully selected the destruction means, okay, after a lot of advice from a lot of very, very prominent scientists. So we selected the destruction means in such a way that we absolutely almost to a 99.9 percent assurance have no contamination. You can -- I found one thing, none of the scientists will ever give you 100 percent assurance of anything -- but they will tell you that there are certain ways that you can limit that contamination. And everyone of those targets that we've attacked, we were very, very careful in the method of attack and the munitions we used to insure that we didn't have any contamination. **********. . .          Effects on Civilians **********Q. One for General Glosson, if you don't mind. Refugees coming into Jordan have been telling tales of convoys of civilian vehicles being strafed, people running in the desert and being strafed, bombs dropping everywhere. Given that frightened people exaggerate, nonetheless something must be happening. Can you tell us what you're hitting along that road and what happens if there are a lot of civilian vehicles in amongst what looks like a military target? **********BRIG. GEN. BUSTER GLOSSON. We're striking only military targets. Now, having said that, the Iraqi Government insists on storing Scuds in culverts and other things along the highway. . . . When we see those type of vehicles go into those facilities, we bomb them. We make every attempt to minimize any possibility of civilian casualties. And that's the best answer I can give you. **********Q. General, along those same lines, some of the refugees and Red Cross workers have brought back fragments of bombs, identified as cluster bombs, CBU. Are you using cluster bombs along that highway? And if so, how do you reconcile that with your efforts to minimize civilian casualties along this -- particularly this refugee route? **********GLOSSON. . . . Yes, we use the cluster munition to cover a wider area when the military situation dictates that. **********SCHWARZKOPF. Let me step in here. We have never said that there won't be any civilian casualties. What we have said is, the difference between us and the Iraqis is we are not deliberately targeting civilians, and that's the difference. There are going to be casualties. Unfortunately, that's what happens when you have a war. But we are certainly not deliberating targeting civilians. We never have and we have no intention of doing it in the future. And our enemy certainly is, and I hope that's obvious to everybody in this room since you've been under Scud attack. **********. . .          Political Factors **********Q. If Saddam Hussein were to have a briefing tonight in Baghdad and discuss two weeks of war, he would probably say that we -- that is, the coalition forces -- have thrown the best at him that they could. And still, he is able to launch an offensive. Now, as much as a distortion that may be, how much in your own thinking, when you're going in through his mental process, is the political dimension of this war a factor, the fact that it is going on, that the Arab peoples are looking at it, and that you have a political constraint as well as other constraints to end the war? **********A. This is strictly Norm Schwarzkopf's opinion now, all right? But it's an opinion based upon discussions with a lot of friends throughout the gulf area, some of whom happen to be very pro-Saddam Hussein. To date, Saddam Hussein has lied to them. He told them that Tel Aviv was a crematorium. We all know that's not true. To date, he has told them that he has shot down 170 American and coalition aircraft. Everybody knows that's not true. **********He has announced that he's going to do all sorts of other wonderful things. The other day he said a prayer for the dead, okay, about -- saying because Riyadh was going to be wiped out that night. That did not happen, okay? He has lied consistently about us damaging religious places. A lot of people know that that is not true. So, I think that one of the things that's happened out there is a lot of people who were supporters of Saddam Hussein, at least those who -- I'm not talking about the mob in the street because the mob in the street isn't going to change their opinion. **********But I'm talking about people who intellectually or at least reasonably thought that he was supporting a cause, have found that he is not delivering on his promises, and that's probably doing him some harm. And I think that eventually, they're going to find the same thing about this particular attack. O.K. With regard to Saddam Hussein saying that he has met the best that the coalition has to offer, I would only say, the best is yet to come. Who Owns the Sky? **********General Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, asserted on Jan. 23 that allied air forces had obtained air superiority over Iraq and Kuwait, and noted that he had helped write the Joint Chief's definition of this term when he was a captain. **********Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of allied forces in the Persian Gulf, said yesterday that his commander of Air Force operations in the region had asserted that the allies had achieved air supremacy over Iraq and Kuwait. **********The Air Force's manual on basic aerospace doctrine says air superiority exists when only one side in a conflict is able to carry out effective combat missions in its enemy's airspace. Air supremacy is defined by the manual as occurring when the enemy is also incapable of interfering effectively with those combat missions at any time or in any place."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/10/world/after-the-war-kuwait-will-begin-trying-collaboration-suspects.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1991-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1001, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kuwait Will Begin Trying Collaboration Suspects", "print_headline": "AFTER THE WAR; Kuwait Will Begin Trying Collaboration Suspects", "body_text": " **********The first trials of people accused of collaborating with Iraqi forces during the seven-month occupation of Kuwait are to begin on Saturday. **********But defense lawyers claim that many of the collaboration charges have been trumped up by the Government, and that in many cases, confessions have been extracted by torture. Altogether 628 people are being held on collaboration charges, and all of them face a possible death penalty. **********Kuwaitis are riveted by these cases because the definition of collaboration appears in many cases to be vague. Some Kuwaitis who remained here during the occupation say they feel that they have been labeled quasi-collaborators by those outside the country simply for not fleeing. **********\"People hint that we must have cooperated with the Iraqis,\" a Kuwaiti businessman said today. \"Otherwise how could we have survived all this time? This is very serious and could mean big problems in the future.\" Will Trials Be Open? **********Kuwaiti defense lawyers say that if the trials are unfair or the rights of the accused are limited, they will refuse en masse to take part in the trials. It is unclear whether the trials are to be held in secret or will be open to the public and the press. **********Many of those who are to stand trial are Palestinians, a people subjected to continuing vengeance from Kuwaitis, who feel that the Iraqi invaders were aided by support from the many Palestinians here. Some of those charged, however, are Kuwaitis. **********Yasir Arafat's vociferous support for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq during the occupation did much to sour Kuwaitis on the Palestine Liberation Organization's leader and the Palestinian cause, a cause they supported with billions of dollars over the years. Although many of the 150,000 Palestinians still in Kuwait were born here, it is widely believed that the Government intends to expel them from the country to join the 170,000 Palestinians who fled and are now barred from returning. **********The trials, which have been promised and postponed repeatedly, may offer the first real look at the extent of collaboration by those who remained during the occupation, or, in the view of many defense lawyers, could turn into a ritual of show trials and retribution. **********The Kuwaiti Government has been reluctant to discuss the subject of the trials or the precise charges against those imprisoned for collaboration. Even the Government-controlled newspaper, The New Dawn, has not mentioned them. **********Amad al-Saif, one of the country's leading defense lawyers, represents about a dozen of those who are to stand trial. He said that torture of those accused was widespread and that many of the cases had been built on the flimsy evidence. **********\"A lot have been tortured in recent weeks,\" he said. \"The people I saw were tortured. They were hit by sticks; some of them had electric power used on them.\" **********As for the charges of collaboration, he was contemptuous. \"Some of the cases are very silly,\" he said. \"If you sell an Iraqi a car, you will be a collaborator.\" **********To be sure, there are cases that suggest collaboration, Mr. Saif said. In particular, he said, many people are accused of telling the Iraqis who was in the police or army, or with providing the Iraqi secret police with information about people they were hunting. **********Although these charges are serious, he said, he has yet to see any evidence supporting them. \"We want to see the evidence that this talk is true,\" he said. \"Until now, I have not seen any evidence.\" Concern About Fairness **********Kuwait's Deputy Minister of Justice, Abdul Aziz al-Dakheel, said there was no doubt about the guilt of those charged. \"Some of these prisoners gave information to the Iraqis to help them enter Kuwait,\" he said. **********Because of recurring charges of abuses against the country's Palestinian residents, the Government is deeply concerned about the appearance of fairness at the trials, an official at the American Embassy said. **********Najeeb al-Waqyan, another prominent lawyer here, said he was not convinced that the trials could be conducted fairly. **********\"They are facing a lot of problems in the prosecution,\" he said. \"Now the military has to present evidence to prosecute. They don't know how to do this. They are in a rush to do this. It's never happened in Kuwait like this. It worries me that it will be a military court. I never in my life dealt with martial law. I worry quite a bit.\" **********Kuwait is still under martial law, and the trials will be held before a panel composed of civilian and military judges. Under martial law, Mr. Waqyan said, there is no appeal from the court's decision. If a death penalty is imposed, however, it must be confirmed by the Emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah. Since he assumed power, Sheik Jaber has never confirmed a death penalty, the American Embassy says.  Hope for Defense Leeway **********Mr. Waqyan said he hoped that defense lawyers would be given greater latitude because no appeals are permitted. **********\"Because there is just one court, I expect they have to give more rights to the lawyers, more rights to the defendents,\" he said. \"But I don't know. I have to wait for the first trial. If it is not like this, we will withdraw. All the lawyers will withdraw if there is a kangaroo court.\" **********Kuwait's Deputy Attorney General, Hamid al-Othman, acknowledged that in the days immediately after the liberation of Kuwait, some prisoners who had just been arrested might have been tortured, but he said this had ceased. **********\"I wish to believe that what you have heard is not true,\" he said. \"The Kuwaiti people are people who are nonviolent. There may have been some cases that may have happened because of inner feelings. Those cases were very few.

Nor does it require the complete disarmament of Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who remain scattered in large numbers throughout the Cambodian countryside. Nor does it force the Khmer Rouge to abandon its goal of one day returning to absolute power in Cambodia. **********After listening to news reports today about the signing ceremony in Paris, a senior Western diplomat in Bangkok, the main listening post for Cambodia in that nation's long civil war, said, \"I find myself a little queasy.\" **********\"We all assume that Pol Pot and his henchmen will not find their way back to power,\" he said. \"But we have no guarantee of that, none at all.\" **********Indeed, over the next several weeks, many of the same Khmer Rouge leaders whose savagery led to the execution or starvation of so many Cambodians in a reign of terror more than a decade ago will return to Phnom Penh to join, once again, in running the nation. Pol Pot Believed Alive **********Diplomats and intelligence officials say Pol Pot, whose plans for a Marxist, racially pure Cambodian society were conceived while he was a student in Paris in the 1950's, is still alive, hiding out, at least until recently, at a jungle camp in northern Thailand, near the Cambodian border. **********While Pol Pot has not been in seen in public for more than a decade, he is still widely believed to control the Khmer Rouge. **********Pol Pot has long been tolerated by the Thai Government, which has seen the Khmer Rouge, the largest and best armed of the guerrilla forces in the civil war, as a useful counterweight to Vietnam and the Vietnamese-installed Government in Phnom Penh. The Vietnamese Army ousted the Khmer Rouge in an invasion in 1978. **********With protection in recent years from the Thais and heavy armament and diplomatic support from China, its principal backer, the Khmer Rouge emerged as an indispensible participant in the negotiations that ended today with the signing of the peace treaty. 'Khmer Rouge 'Had to Be Part' **********\"No matter how distasteful it is to do business with the Khmer Rouge, you cannot ignore the fact that there are 40,000 well-armed Khmer Rouge troops in Cambodia and Thailand,\" a European diplomat said. \"Even if you managed to cut off the Khmer Rouge arms supply entirely, their guns will not rust overnight. They had to be part of the peace negotiations.\" **********Diplomats say the United States and other Western powers supporting the peace treaty are hopeful that China and Vietnam, which recently renewed diplomatic and trade ties after years of hostility, will forestall any attempt by the Khmer Rouge to reassert itself on the battlefield. **********The Bush Administration has said it is seeking to remove Vietnamese influence over Cambodia and allow the Cambodian people to select their own form of government, despite the risk of a return to power by the Khmer Rouge. **********Under the peace accord, foreign arms suppliers have agreed to cut off weapons shipments to the Khmer Rouge and to the two major non-Communist rebel factions involved in the peace settlement: the followers of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the one-time King of Cambodia, and the National Liberation Front of former Prime Minister Son Sann. **********The United States supplied tens of millions of dollars in aid to the two non-Communist factions in the civil war, although there were repeated assertions by human rights organizations and others that American aid ended up in the hands of the Khmer Rouge. **********Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France said this week that it would have been impossible to exclude the Khmer Rouge from the peace negotiations, whatever its reputation as an international pariah. **********\"An accord without them would have meant a rapid resumption of fighting,\" he said. \"We thought it more intelligent to bring them to effective disarmament.\" **********Yet diplomats tracking the peace process say they fear that the Khmer Rouge will circumvent the treaty's disarmament provisions -- all sides are required to reduce their arms and troop strength by 70 percent -- by hiding weapons and soldiers in remote jungle areas under its authority, far from the view of United Nations peacekeeping troops that are expected to enter Cambodia this year. **********The Khmer Rouge will also retain the option of buying weapons on the black market. Because it controls areas of Cambodia rich in gems and timber, the Khmer Rouge has few concerns about money; its annual revenues are estimated to top $80 million a year. **********For their part, Khmer Rouge officials describe as misplaced international concern any idea that they might consider staging a military takeover of Cambodia.

But instead Mr. Bessmertnykh went before television cameras in the State Department lobby and praised the statement as an important event. **********Beginning late Tuesday night, the White House went to extraordinary lengths to put political distance between Mr. Bush and the document, which marked an unusual break in the careful discipline the Administration has exercised on public statements about the gulf. **********Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, did not know of the statement until he was asked about it by a reporter early Tuesday night. **********He said Mr. Scowcroft then gave it to Mr. Bush, who read it for the first time in his limousine en route to the Capitol, where he delivered a State of the Union Address that found itself overshadowed on some television networks by what was supposed to be a routine statement by two foreign ministers. **********In the document, Mr. Baker and Mr. Bessmertnykh said: \"The two ministers continue to believe that a cessation of hostilities is possible if Iraq would make an unequivocal commitment to withdraw from Kuwait. They also believe that such a commitment must be backed by immediate, concrete steps leading to full compliance with the Security Council resolutions.\" **********The communique also said the Soviet Union and the United States would work with the countries of the Middle East after the war to resolve other regional disputes, including the Palestinian issue. **********In many ways, this echoed previous American positions. But the first section was widely interpreted as softening Mr. Bush's vow that there will be \"no pause for negotiations\" in the war. The second was seen in some circles as establishing the \"linkage\" between Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and the Palestinian question that Mr. Bush has sought to avoid. **********In Israel today, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir protested that \"a political act that involves us, our fate, our future, was taken without consulting us, without even telling us beforehand.\" **********Mr. Bush, asked by reporters if he was angry with Mr. Baker, his closest friend and adviser, laughed and said, \"There are no differences there.\" **********White House officials, who have long grumbled about the independence of the State Department, sought to put the best public face on the political squall. They said the United States had satisfied its allies that the statement was being misinterpreted and that it was not a change in policy. They said such things are not normally cleared with the White House. **********But White House officials privately complained about the matter. **********An official said the statement was drafted to \"throw Bessmertnykh something to show that he's in a give-and-take relationship with Baker, something he can take home to show that he made the Americans state that we're not out to destroy Iraq, which has become a big issue for the Soviets.\" **********Another official said Mr. Baker was trying to establish with Mr. Bessmertnykh the kind of relationship he had with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who resigned last month. **********Officials said the communique was not circulated through the State Department's Soviet and Middle East desk officers, career officials who generally are not part of top-level decision making under Mr. Baker. **********Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said Mr. Baker had intended simply to post the statement and was surprised when Mr. Bessmertnykh read it to reporters. \"We did not, at all candor, view this as any big deal,\" she said today. **********As a result, the State Department did not activate the public relations machinery normally used for an important Soviet-American announcement. That left senior White House and State Department officials frantically telephoning reporters late Tuesday to try to dampen publicity on the communique. **********\"The sad fact,\" said one exasperated official today, \"is that it really doesn't matter any more what's in the communique or whether it meant a change in policy. This thing has a life of its own. Everyone's saying two plus two makes five and no one believes you if you stand there screaming 'No, it's four! It's four!' \" **********The Administration was as embarrassed by positive comments as well as by the criticism. A Western diplomat said that during a meeting today with Mr. Baker, the French Ambassador, Jacques Andreani, said that France was pleased with the communique."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/07/business/usx-reopening-talks-with-steelworkers.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1991-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "USX Reopening Talks With Steelworkers", "print_headline": "USX Reopening Talks With Steelworkers", "body_text": " **********The USX Corporation and the United Steelworkers of America will reopen negotiations today that could determine whether the nation's largest steelmaker can retain the edge in cheaper labor costs it has enjoyed over its rivals for two years. **********USX's contract with 18,000 steelworkers expires at the end of this month. Talks between management and the steelworkers on a new four-year contract broke down six weeks ago. Industry analysts and experts say it is too soon to tell if USX, which suffered through a six-month shutdown four years ago, will have another strike on its hands. **********\"It would make no sense for the situation to result in a strike,\" said Ben Fischer, director of labor studies at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. \"But sense does not always govern these situations, and it is certainly a possibility.\" **********While many experts contend that the economy has declined too deeply for either side to accept a strike, some USX customers, preparing for the worst, are already lining up other suppliers, and USX has itself been building up inventories to keep customers in steel during a strike. **********Both sides are still far apart on all basic issues. The steelworkers are pushing for job protection for employees in case USX's steel business is sold or spun off as some shareholders hope and as management has said it will consider doing. The union also wants wage and benefit increases comparable to the 5 to 10 percent raises provided in 1989 by the five other leading steelmakers to employees over the life of their contracts. Harsher Climate Today **********These companies negotiated contracts when the market for steel was healthier. Because of the harsher conditions now, USX is proposing a more modest increase, tied to improvements in quality. Some analysts doubt that USX will succeed in selling its proposal to workers because the steelmaker is still faring better than many competitors. **********A strike would delight the company's besieged rivals. Steel industry operating profits plunged by half, to $890 million, in the first nine months of 1990 over the similar period of 1989. Steel prices have tumbled nearly 10 percent in the last year as demand has fallen for steel for automobiles and appliances. Contingency Plans **********A strike at USX would tighten supplies, cause steel prices to climb and give other steelmakers a chance to win customers from USX. **********Thomas J. Usher, who has been president of the company's steel division since September, said he was optimistic about reaching an agreement, although \"neither side has changed their basic objectives.\" But he said the company has \"a lot of different contingency plans\" if a strike occurs. **********Still, a few customers say they have begun looking elsewhere for steel to keep a steady, uninterrupted supply. \"We aren't abandoning USX altogether so far,\" said the purchasing manager of a large Midwestern steel service center. \"But we have started increasing our purchases from LTV and others.\"  Pressure to Spin Off Steel **********The contract talks come at a time when USX is in transition. Steel, the company's main business just 10 years ago, now accounts for less than a third of its sales. And USX's largest investor, Carl C. Icahn, is again prodding the company to separate the steel operations from USX's vast energy holdings. **********Mr. Icahn, who holds 13.3 percent of USX's shares and last year waged an unsuccessful proxy battle on a resolution to spin off or sell the steel business, disclosed two months ago that he had formed a new shareholder committee to press again to unload the steel business. **********There are other reasons why the union is pushing for job protection. Union officials pointed out that the company conducted talks last year with British Steel P.L.C. about a possible acquisition of the steel business. USX also announced last fall that it was transferring the steel operation to a wholly owned subsidiary, which industry analysts saw as a move by the company to prepare the steel business for a sale.  Union Concessions **********The unions are also seeking to eliminate the Pittsburgh-based steelmaker's labor-cost advantage in an era in which $1 or $2 an hour in operating costs can mean the difference between profit and loss. USX spends $22.83 on labor to produce a ton of steel, compared with the $24.50 spent by the second-lowest-cost producer, the Inland Steel Corporation, and $26.85 by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the nation's second-largest producer. **********The union contends that its workers made huge sacrifices during the money-losing years of the early 1980's, when they agreed to concessions that they say diminished their wages and benefits by 9 percent in 1983 and by an additional 8 percent in 1987. The union regained some of those wages under the 1987 agreement, but workers are still at roughly their 1982 pay level. **********\"At this point we are apart on wages, benefits, health insurance for retirees, and, of course, the question of successorship,\" said Richard F. Fontana, a spokesman for the Pittsburgh-based union. \"The question of protecting jobs if the steel company changes ownership is particularly important because of what is going on with Carl Icahn.\"  An Industry in Recession **********Mr. Fontana is also critical of the company's plan to link pay increases to improved quality, arguing that \"the requirements for a payout are so difficult to achieve that we believe that it would be unlikely that a payout would be possible.\" **********Many analysts say that the company will press hard to maintain its labor-cost advantage. \"It is a difficult time for USX to match the other pay levels because the industry is in a recession,\" said John Jacobson, a steel analyst with AUS Consultants in Philadelphia. **********Still, others contend that the company's steel business will fare better than most because USX derives more of its business than its major rivals from the pipe and tubular steel market, which is holding firm because of sales to the oil industry. \"In profitability, USX has led the pack,\" said Christopher Plummer, an analyst with the WEFA Group, a market research firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. **********That will make it hard for USX to depict itself in the contract talks as having more formidable problems than its competitors. \"They have a broader market scope because they are more tied to oil, energy and capital goods, instead of solely relying on the automotive market,\" Mr. Plummer said. \"And USX has a completely funded pension plan, which most of the others do not. I think we will find that these will be difficult negotiations.\" Steel Labor Costs Per ton, as of Jan. 1, 1991 Bethlehem Steel $26.85 LTV Steel $26.60 National Steel $25.72 Armco $24.70 Inland Steel $24.50 USX $22.83 Source: The WEFA Group"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/23/business/money-fund-assets-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Money Fund Assets Up", "print_headline": "Money Fund Assets Up", "body_text": " **********The assets of the nation's 555 money market mutual funds increased by $4.98 billion, to $466.34 billion, for the week that ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday.

For Its Own Defense **********The implication was that with reports of fighting from Slovenia and Croatia, and the federal army heeding no one in the Government but following instead the dictates of self-preservation, Serbia must be made capable of defending itself. **********To be sure, shredded remains of the central authority linger. Today, the newly installed federal President, the Croatian lawyer Stipe Mesic, a 57-year-old former Communist who was jailed by Tito in 1971 in a crackdown on Croatian nationalism, was in Slovenia seeking to negotiate a cease-fire. But Mr. Mesic, who is detested by the army leadership, was virtually helpless to control affairs. **********The tank battles in Slovenia, the bombing of the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana, the failure of an earlier truce hammered out by European Community mediators, all underscored that the road to any kind of negotiation to recast the bonds linking the country's six republics and two autonomous regions would be long and arduous. **********Increasingly, Yugoslavs have begun to talk of the horrifying possibility of civil war, in a land that lost one-tenth of its population, or 1.7 million people, in World War II. **********A month ago, the Government would have rejected any effort by the outside world to mediate an end to Yugoslavia's internal strife as interference in the country's internal affairs. **********But now the leaders of the central Government and several key republics are publicly asking the European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to send help. **********Like their neighbors in Eastern Europe, the peoples of Yugoslavia in free elections have been casting off the shackles of decades of Communist rule. But the successors to the Communists here are mostly former Communists themselves, like Slovenia's President, Milan Kucan, and the Croatian leader, Franjo Tudjman, who evoke old national aspirations as a means of overcoming the economic rot and social dislocation that are the heritage of Communism. **********Lamenting the country's headlong slide into violence, the Belgrade daily Borba wrote today: \"We wanted a return to Europe, and instead we went back to our dukedoms and principalities. **********\"We wanted modern leaders, freed of Bolshevism and careerism, and we elected instead leaders who bicker, stubborn people, little dictators, surrounded by sychophants.\" **********Were the tensions restricted to Slovenia and Croatia, Yugoslavia's problems with breakaway republics might be more manageable. But Serbs, the largest national group with 9.3 million people, increasingly perceive the killing in Slovenia as a useless sacrifice of Serbian sons, the largest bloc in an army that also includes Slovenes, Croats, Albanians and Montenegrins, in defense of increasingly meaningless Yugoslav borders.  Mothers in Protest **********Today, mothers of soldiers and other women marched in front of the old Hotel Moskva in downtown Belgrade with banners calling for heads to roll in the political leadership and the army. **********Belgrade television broadcast interviews with 18- and 19-year-old conscripts returning from Slovenian imprisonment with stories of humiliation and defeat. Tearful mothers poured out the stories of their lost sons. **********Partly, the Serbian anger is directed at the national leadership. Protesters outside Parliament waved banners calling Ante Markovic, the Croatian politician who is the federal Prime Minister, a \"betrayer of our children.\" Others demanded the resignation of the Defense Minister, Gen. Veljko Kadijevic. **********More ominously, the demonstrators demanded a Serbian army, to defend not only Serbs in their republic but also the scattered groups of Serbs who live in other republics, most notably the 600,000 in Croatia. It is perhaps there that the nervousness is greatest. Serbs cannot forget that in 1941 when Croatia last obtained independence, as a Nazi puppet state, 500,000 Serbs were slaughtered.  Agreement on Self-Defense **********Last week the Serbian communities in Croatia and neighboring Bosnia pledged to work together not only in cultural matters and education, but also in their self-defense. **********Increasingly, too, the Serbian anger is a threat to the regional leader, Slobodan Milosevic, a former Communist who rode a wave of Serbian nationalism in recent years to enable his party, now renamed the Socialist Party, to emerge victorious in free elections. **********But tonight, intermingled with calls for a Serbian army to defend against Slovenia and Croatia to the north, were shouts denouncing Mr. Milosevic's \"red gang\" and cries of \"Slobo, get lost!\" **********In the end, Mr. Milosevic may be the main victim of the conflict in Slovenia, and there is irony in this, since it was his uncompromising policies that set in motion the developments leading to the present crisis."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/25/business/ibm-gears-up-for-battle-over-mainframe-disk-drives.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1991-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1454, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.B.M.

Gears Up for Battle Over Mainframe Disk Drives", "body_text": " **********Here in what may be the biggest factory building west of the Mississippi River, the world's largest computer maker is fighting to protect its most profitable line of business. In a dust-free room clean enough to make computer chips, the International Business Machines Corporation assembles disk drives for its most powerful mainframe computers, turning out one drive every five minutes of every hour, five days a week. **********But now, those file-drawer-sized storage systems, which I.B.M. sells separately or packaged with mainframes, are at risk of becoming a victim to the same force that has stalled the company's mainframe business. Just as the microprocessor chip has made possible ever-more powerful and inexpensive desktop computers and work stations, new palm-sized disk drives are opening up similar possibilities in the storage segment of the business. **********Chained together by the dozens, or even by the hundreds, these drives, known by the acronym RAID, for redundant arrays of inexpensive disks, are faster, more reliable and have more storage capacity than I.B.M.'s systems. And because they can be manufactured in bigger quantities, they cost much less. The technology is largely unproven, yet more than 50 companies are rushing to develop it for mainframe computers. (Offered by such companies as Dell Computer Corporation and Compaq Computer Corporation, RAID is already available for personal computer networks.) **********But unseating I.B.M. could be a chore. The company has had the $5.16 billion mainframe drive market, which accounts for almost 40 percent of all drives, largely to itself for 35 years. Today, it controls 78 percent of the business. **********And it is looking to strengthen its position. It recently made disk drives a top priority by dramatically picking up its pace of product introductions at both the high end of the business, supplying mainframes, and the low end, for personal computers -- a newer business for I.B.M. **********The low end offers faster growth than the high end, which is still growing at a brisk 27 to 30 percent a year, the company reports. Yet the high end is far more lucrative, producing what analysts say are gross margins in excess of 60 percent. I.B.M. does not break out its profits or sales for disk drives. **********Even so, analysts say that I.B.M. must decide whether it will try to stretch its large disks for another generation or rapidly introduce an array product of its own, perhaps as early as 1993. In fact, I.B.M., determined not to be blindsided by this new technology the way it was taken by surprise by the popularity of reduced instruction set chip (RISC) computing for work stations, started its own RAID project. \"I.B.M. will eventually counterattack, but I.B.M. is big and bigness is slowness,\" said James Porter, president of Disk/Trend, a Mountain View, Calif., market research firm. **********Among the computer companies gambling on RAID for mainframes, Storage Technology Inc. of Louisville, Colo., is the farthest along. It plans to introduce its first disk array product in January. \"We made a conscious decision to skip one generation of disk technology while we came out with this new generation,\" said Ryal Poppa, Storage Technology's chairman. \"We intend to maintain a two-year lead.\" **********Storage Technology's array, which is already widely known in the industry by the code name \"Iceberg,\" will blend complex electronics and software with hundreds of 5.25-inch drives made by the Hewlett Packard Corporation. It will target the most profitable segment of the mainframe disk drive business: applications, known as \"mission critical,\"that cannot tolerate any down time or a single failure. (Because a RAID, unlike conventional drive technology, spreads information over many disks, it has a built-in backup should one disk fail.) Storage Technology says it will give customers a guarantee against losing data because of equipment failure. **********Its focus on fault tolerance has prompted some analysts and rivals to say the company is just skimming the cream. But Storage Technology says the segment is a natural extension of its leading tape backup business, which provides duplicates of a company's data on tapes. And early reports from a pool of several thousand potential buyers that have looked at Iceberg are positive. **********Iceberg's high visibility has put I.B.M. on the defensive. The computer maker has held briefings with customers, analysts and the press on its own high-end strategy. **********\"The question is: When is I.B.M. going to be ready to compete with Iceberg?\" Mr. Porter said. **********That is what Hitachi Data Systems wonders. Hitachi, I.B.M.'s closest competitor in the mainframe disk business, with 10.7 percent of the market, is the only compatible disk maker shipping drives that match I.B.M.'s top-of-the-line models. Although Hitachi says it is preparing its own disk array technology, it is waiting until I.B.M. sets the standard for RAID before entering the market with its own version. **********\"We're well positioned to respond to any new product from I.B.M. quickly,\" said Gary Holtwick, vice president for peripherals at the Santa Clara, Calif.-based disk maker. **********By itself, new technology is unlikely to strip I.B.M. of its prowess in the disk drive business. But to underscore its determination to hold onto its dominance, I.B.M. next month plans to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Winchester disk drive, which the company invented in San Jose. **********Industry executives say the computer giant also plans to introduce a higher-capacity version of its 3390 disk drive for mainframes in the second week of September. The 3390 was first shipped only 23 months ago. Its predecessor, the 3380, lasted for almost a decade. The decision to accelerate the product cycle is an indication that I.B.M. realizes it cannot rest on its laurels. **********\"This technology product area spoils quickly,\" said Ray S. AbuZayyad, who is in charge of all disk storage products for I.B.M. **********I.B.M. signaled its determination to stay competitive earlier this year, when it reorganized its disk drive products into a single division, and appointed Mr. AbuZayyad, a savvy and aggressive engineer with 29 years of experience, to head it. **********The company has also fought its way into the most competitive part of the small Winchester business, for high-capacity disks, and has won contracts with both Apple Computer and Sun Microsystems against tough Japanese competition. **********I.B.M. managers also insist that they are going to push a key competitive advantage their company has over many smaller disk makers. I.B.M. is far more vertically integrated than most of its competitors, and says will use its high-end technology combatively, transferring it down quickly to the low end of the market for desktop computers, where players like Conner Peripherals and Quantum Computer compete. **********While some analysts predict that the advent of inexpensive disk arrays will strip much of the profitability out of the lucrative high end of disk drive business, I.B.M. says the complexity of these new drives -- integrating microelectronic controllers and software -- will protect margins. **********\"If you were to take a single element of the system I would say yes,\" said Mr. AbuZayyad, \"but integration will prevent that for the forseeable future.\" A LESSON I.B.M. LEARNED FROM NOT TAKING RISC **********For the International Business Machines Corporation, the progress made by a new disk array technology closely parallels the history of reduced instruction set computing, or RISC. First pioneered by I.B.M. in the mid-1970's, RISC was popularized by a group of researchers at the University of California at Berkeley in the early 1980's. I.B.M. was late to market with a competitive RISC chip and is still scrambling to catch up with one for the work station market. **********As with RISC, I.B.M. was a pioneer in RAID research, developing experimental arrays in the 1970's. However, the significance of the technology did not become widely apparent until 1987, when David Patterson, a Berkeley professor who led the RISC research and another Berkeley professor, Randy Katz, published a paper outlining the RAID idea as a simple way of taking advantage of the trend toward putting more and more bits of information into smaller and less expensive packages. **********Dr. Patterson said that combining RISC and RAID will remove the justification for buying a mainframe computer. \"One of the arguments for mainframes has been much higher disk performance,\" he said. \"RAID enables commodity disks to be combined to offer the capacity, performance and reliability normally associated with mainframes.\" **********Dr. Patterson said he was surprised at how quickly the RAID idea spread after they distributed copies of the original paper in 1987. Soon afterwards, he said, he saw copies come back from Japan with notations in Japanese writing. **********\"It was like a cargo plane had spilled a load of our technical reports into the stratosphere,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/20/world/war-in-the-gulf-censors-screen-pooled-reports.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Censors Screen Pooled Reports", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF; Censors Screen Pooled Reports", "body_text": " **********The American-led military command in Saudi Arabia has put into effect press restrictions under which journalists are assembled in groups and given access to military sources. **********The pool reporters obtain information while under military escort, and their accounts are subject to scrutiny by military censors before being distributed.

Today, yet another student, Kim Young Kyun, was reported to have immolated himself at a provincial campus in another bloody protest.

Jorge Martinez was convinced as early as 1920 that a sea of petroleum lay deep below the surface of the impenetrable plains of eastern Colombia. **********Although he was awarded a good part of the land for his wartime bravery, the general never saw the oil that is beginning to gush from its wells today. **********Colombia and its foreign oil partners discovered earlier this year that the amount of crude oil in the region known as Cusiana, about 100 miles east of here, probably exceeds the wildest predictions of General Martinez. **********How much those riches may amount to is unclear, but industry executives are calling Cusiana the largest oil find in the Americas since the Prudhoe Bay discovery in Alaska in 1968.'World-Class Find' **********\"I'm convinced that it's a world-class find,\" said Andres Restrepo, president of the state-run oil company Ecopetrol, which is working to develop the project with the British Petroleum Company; the Triton Energy Corporation, based in Dallas, and TOTAL-Compagnie Francaise des Petroles of France. **********While Mr. Restrepo stresses the need to be prudent in discussing estimates of potential reserves, one oil executive called Cusiana a windfall, with potential reserves of three billion to five billion barrels. Anticipating an economic boom, hundreds of Colombians have arrived in Casanare province, straining its services. **********The Finance Minister, Rudolf Hommes, said recently that the Cusiana find would enable Colombia to more than double its oil exports by 1995. Production is expected to begin as early as March, and analysts say that within three years the country could lift exports to 500,000 barrels a day, from the current 200,000. **********Colombia is currently Latin America's third-largest oil exporter, behind Venezuela and Mexico, but it is considered a marginal exporter in world terms. With 1.8 billion barrels of proven reserves, Colombia produces 450,000 barrels of oil a day. **********The promise of Cusiana's riches may serve to lure foreign capital back to Colombia, where guerrilla terrorism has kept investors at bay. **********Leftist rebels of the National Liberation Army, known by their Spanish initials ELN, have made it their mission in the last six years to try to force the authorities to nationalize the oil industry and throw out foreign investors. This year alone they have bombed the main Cano-Limon oil pipeline 59 times. **********The pipeline transports about 220,000 barrels of oil a day from the eastern Cano-Limon fields, previously Colombia's richest deposit with about one billion barrels of reserves, to Caribbean ports for export. **********Over the years, the pipeline bombings have spilled about 35 million gallons of raw crude into rivers and jungle forests, roughly three times the amount of oil lost in the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska, and Ecopetrol estimates that the attacks have cost the national economy about $700 million since 1986. **********The guerrillas' propensity for kidnapping foreign oil employees is also a disincentive to outside investment. Three engineers from the Natco Company, a drilling concern based in Tulsa, Okla., were released in November after a year in the hands of the ELN. Unconfirmed reports said the company paid a hefty ransom. Two Japanese and three French oil engineers were also kidnapped in 1991. **********But Patricia Correa, a private economic researcher in Bogota, believes foreign investors will be willing to overlook the rebel violence in the future. \"With the discovery of Cusiana, there is much more interest in Colombia now,\" she said. \"I expect levels of foreign investment to start reflecting that.\" **********Foreign investment is the key to exploration and development of Colombia's oil reserves -- especially in Casanare provice, where the Cusiana field is situated and where petroleum lies 17,000 feet below the surface, beneath rock formations. Each well takes a year to complete and costs nearly $20 million. **********Some analysts say they think Ecopetrol and its foreign partners will have to spend $3 billion just to get Cusiana's oil to market. **********If the three billion to five billion barrels of reserves are confirmed, Colombia stands to earn about $2.5 billion a year in oil exports by 1995, more than double its current earnings. Considering that Colombian law gives the Government 80 percent of all oil profits, the foreign partners stand to make about $620 million a year, based on the current price of $17 a barrel.Court Challenges **********But some citizens have taken the Government to court, claiming a share of the region's profits. The descendants of General Martinez, for instance, and several other families say they were awarded subsoil rights to Cusiana in a series of court and presidential decrees dating to 1920 **********Colombia's Attorney General and the Energy and Mines Ministry, citing other legislation, say all subsoil belongs to the nation. A final decision by the Council of State, made up of senior magistrates, is expected next year. **********The ELN has announced that a decision favoring the families would provoke a wave of rebel violence."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/business/reducing-tenure-in-the-boardroom.html": {"writer_name": "Jayne Barnard", "pub_date": "1991-12-22", "snippet": "WITH all the recent attention on term limits in Congress, perhaps it's time to consider bringing term limits into the boardroom.

The problem is the same: a system under which incumbents linger on and on, having to prove nothing and facing no challenge to their tenure. **********Establishing term limits for outside corporate directors could prove valuable, especially at companies in need of a jump-start in leadership, and shareholders with clout -- like pension funds -- should encourage such a move. **********Directors could be elected to three- to five-year terms; they would run initially with a publicly disclosed platform, and then run for re-election based, first, on how closely they made good on their earlier promises, and, second, on the attractiveness of their future promises. Competitive candidates, nominated by institutional investors could run against in-house candidates and they all would run on a common ballot. **********Of the winners, outside -- but not inside -- directors would be subject to term limits totalling no more than 10 years. New members could join the board as incumbents resign or retire. **********Term limits would force directors to focus more on shareholder expectations and less on building relationships with top executives, and might discourage high-dollar compensation packages for top executives. They would also permit the graceful elimination of unproductive directors. **********The result: a board guided by agreed-upon objectives, which could develop some esprit de corps, and yet one that does not get stale or too clubby. The idea is not to make leadership unstable but to encourage diversity and fresh thinking. **********Although critics might argue that term limits would discount valuable institutional memory, the limits would be applied only to outside directors so that the most significant experience would be retained. And term limits would not enhance the already-considerable power of the chief executive: Directors with a limited tenure are more likely to challenge the delivered management wisdom than those with a lifetime ticket. **********COMPANIES that stand to gain the most are ailing mature companies that have traditionally had the longest tenure for board members. Until recently, there were seven outside directors on the General Motors 20-person board who had served at least 10 years. (Of its 17-person board now, there are five long-term outside directors.) Sears, Roebuck has six outside directors with at least a decade of service. And they are not the only companies with such records. By pruning some deadwood -- and even active, constructive board members whose creative thinking days may have passed -- term limits on directors could push companies to do better."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/27/world/walesa-vetoes-election-law-but-won-t-oust-legislature.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Walesa Vetoes Election Law, But Won't Oust Legislature", "print_headline": "Walesa Vetoes Election Law, But Won't Oust Legislature", "body_text": " **********President Lech Walesa vetoed an election law today for a second time, but backed away from his threat to dissolve the lower house of Parliament. **********He had threatened on Sunday to dissolve the legislature, which is dominated by holdover Communists from the previous Government, but apparently he decided he did not have clear constitutional power to do so. **********Mr. Walesa told workers at a pharmaceutical factory he would not dissolve Parliament because he could \"never act against the law.\" **********The factory was the second stop on a nationwide tour Mr. Walesa was making to gauge public support for his showdown with Parliament over setting voting rules for Poland's first fully free parliamentary elections since World War II.

And they are having success, luring significant numbers of older people who find traditional retirement meccas overbuilt, crime-ridden and unaffordable. **********Many civic leaders say it is now far easier and more lucrative for rural towns to attract older people -- with their pensions and savings -- than new factories or office parks. Companies often demand millions of dollars in tax abatements and new roads and other repairs, they say. But retirees and their hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets are being enticed with a brochure, a tour, a handshake and a smile.  Healthy, Wealthy and Wise **********\"These migrants are healthier, wealthier and better educated than most Americans,\" said Mark Fagan, a professor at the Center for Economic Development and Business Research at Jacksonville State University in Alabama, which is helping 94 Alabama municipalities attract older people. **********On average, Mr. Fagan said, the retired couples who have settled in Alabama have annual incomes of $35,000 and assets of more than $250,000. **********\"They pay for their homes with cash and spend most of their income locally,\" Mr. Fagan added. \"It is like having an export industry to bring in out-of-state dollars.\" **********In addition, the retirees place few demands on the most expensive of local services, the public schools. **********The marketing campaigns come after a decade in which many rural towns that depended on agriculture, mining and manufacturing had some of their sharpest population declines in this century, as young people moved away in search of jobs. **********With 20 million Americans expected to retire in the next decade, experts say, the futures of many towns may depend on their ability to grab a piece of the retirement trade. **********Most of America's 2,400 rural counties outside of metropolitan areas had sharp drops in population in the last decade. But some 480 counties, many of which include retirement resorts, saw their populations jump by 16 percent as retirees settled in year round. **********As a result, more than 200 rural communities that were losing population have tried to tap into the senior market with home-grown marketing campaigns, Mr. Fagan said, and growing numbers of other towns are inquiring about them. Many of the established programs are now reporting significant successes. **********Chewelah, a town with fewer than 2,000 residents, 45 miles south of Spokane, has attracted 35 retired couples in the last two years with ads in retirement magazines, a toll-free hot line and a video made for $750 by high school students, town officials say. These all boast of Chewelah's nearness to golf courses, ski slopes and hospitals. **********\"If you had a heart attack in my office this very minute,\" Gloria Davidson, the town's Mayor, said in a telephone interview, \"you would be in Spokane in 15 minutes by helicopter.\" **********The arrival of the retirees, Ms. Davidson says, has created jobs by spurring the opening of a bakery, a restaurant and a beauty shop.  Unpaid 'Ambassadors' **********Other places have added a more personal pitch. **********Kennewick, Richland and Pasco, Wash., together have trained 49 residents to act as unpaid \"ambassadors\" on their business trips and vacations. The ambassadors offer middle-aged people promotional literature and bumper stickers. Together with ads and a toll-free hot line, officials say, the campaign has attracted 35 retired households. **********In Alabama, the four-year-old state program has purchased $100,000 in ads in national retirement publications and advised towns on how to market themselves. The campaign has drawn 15,000 queries from out-of-state residents and several hundred retirees have settled in the state. **********Guntersville, Ala., a town of 7,000 along the Tennessee River that lost its major employer, a textile factory, in the early 1980's, attracted 250 retired couples in the last three years with magazine ads and commercials on ESPN, the cable sports network, during the network's coverage of fishing tournaments. **********The retirees, town officials say, have revived business in banks, real estate offices, marinas and golf courses.  Going Home Again **********In North Dakota, the Legislature this year financed Operation Back Home Again, a program designed to help towns across the state trace the graduates of their high schools as far back as 1950 and ask them to return for their golden years. In Mississippi, county development agencies and the Mississippi Power Company have set up booths at national boating, fishing and recreational vehicle conventions. **********Hot Springs, a lakeside city of 32,000 in central Arkansas, has attracted more than 500 households in the last two years with its ads in retirement magazines, town officials say. When retirees arrive, they are met by blue-coated volunteers, who offer tours of the town, including its new art galleries and shops. Meanwhile, the guides sing the praises of retirement in the Ozarks. **********\"This is a garden,\" said Richard Bingham, a 59-year-old tour guide in Hot Springs who moved from South Pasadena, Calif., in 1987. Mr. Bingham recalls that rising pollution, crime and real estate prices made Southern California less and less inviting as a place to retire. **********So he sold his home there for $250,000 and bought a three-bedroom house on a lake in Hot Springs for $100,000. He also bought a 24-foot boat, and put $75,000 into a local bank. **********\"It just got too darned crowded,\" Mr. Bingham said of California.\" It used to take me 30 minutes to drive to downtown Los Angeles. In the last year it took an hour and a half to two hours.\"  Traditional Areas Slip **********The dimming luster of traditional retirement areas may just be starting to appear in census findings, said Stephen Golant, a professor of geography at the University of Florida in Gainesville. **********In 1987, for example, Florida estimated that it would have 2,542,000 residents over the age 65 by 1990, based on past growth of the state's retired population. But the 1990 census found that the state had only 2,389,000 residents over 65, an indication, Mr. Golant said, that the migration may have slowed. **********The youngest people now making plans for retirement, who will be joined by the oldest members of the baby boom in the next five years, are increasingly asking about small towns far away from traditional retirement resorts, said Kate Greer, the editor in chief of New Choices, a magazine aimed at retirees. **********\"I sense a real change in attitude,\" Ms. Greer said. \"These people are asking, where do I really want to retire?\" **********Mr. Golant cautioned, however, that rural towns could be disappointed in the long term by the arrival of retirees. Although Mr. Fagan estimates that each retired couple has the same economic impact as 3.7 factory jobs, Mr. Golant said the retirees did not create the types of well-paying jobs that towns would gain by attracting businesses. **********\"Certainly they will generate jobs in recreation, personal services and health-related activities,\" Mr. Golant said. \"But it is not clear the presence of retirees will generate higher-paying jobs that are generally related to management, research, technology and finance.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/28/business/vietnam-shops-are-backed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Vietnam Shops Are Backed", "print_headline": "Vietnam Shops Are Backed", "body_text": " **********The President of Vietnam has signed a law sanctioning and protecting private business in hopes of reviving one of the world's most backward economies. **********The Communist Government has been relaxing central control of the economy and encouraging private enterprise since doctrinaire Marxist leaders retired and changes were adopted in late 1986. **********The law, which the National Assembly adopted on Dec. 21, was signed last Monday by President Vo Chi Cong, the official Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan reported.

Havel's Attention Diverted **********As Slovak groups have increasingly called for greater autonomy or even secession, Mr. Havel, a former dissident playwright, has had to turn his attention from leading the drive for economic reform and greater democracy to deal with the challenge to the integrity of the multinational state, which was created after World War I from the ruins of the Hapsburg Empire. **********Just how inflamatory the issue is was made clear on Thursday, when television viewers saw images of Mr. Havel, who is Czech, confined to his car as an angry crowd demonstrating for a separate state in Bratislava, the Slovak capital, engulfed his motorcade and jeered him with cries of \"Judas! Judas!\" and \"Provocateur!\" **********In an address late Thursday that was televised nationally, Mr. Havel called upon the Slovaks to stay within the federated state, but assured them they were free to form a separate state, provided it was done in a legal and constitutional manner. **********As if to reassure the Slovaks of his good will, the President met on Thursday in Bratislava with officers of the Czechoslovak Army based in the Slovak Republic, and gave public assurances that force would not be used to impede the formation of a separate Slovak state if a majority of Slovaks chose that course. Referendum 'a Healthy Thing' **********\"We believe there have been so many discussions, so many arguments and misunderstandings, that it is probably a healthy thing if a referendum is held,\" said Michael Zantovsky, the President's spokesman. **********Mr. Zantovsky said that various amendments to the legislation proposed by Mr. Havel were being discussed by the federal legislature and that one possible form for a referendum would be to ask Slovaks, \"Do you want to secede from the federation?\" **********Mr. Havel appeared to have allayed Slovak nationalist passions in November, when the federal legislature passed laws defining the powers of the regional governments. **********But the latest crisis was sparked by the continued emergence of radical nationalist groups in Slovakia. That led to a split in Public Against Violence, the Slovak counterpart of Mr. Havel's Civic Forum movement, which spearheaded the drive to topple the former Communist regime in late 1989. **********While Civic Forum in the Czech lands has divided in recent weeks largely over ideological questions involving the pace of economic change, Public Against Violence has been deeply split between opponents and supporters of a separate Slovak state. **********Officials in Prague are closely watching events in Yugoslavia, another federated state, where challenges to the leadership of Serbia, the most populous republic, have compounded political and ethnic strife there. And in the Soviet Union, millions of citizens are to vote on Sunday in a referendum reflecting their attitudes toward unity. **********But officials close to Mr. Havel emphasized the differences in the situation in Czechoslovakia, where violence or the threat of armed intervention have played no role and where the central Government has declared its willingness to accept dissolution of the federated state, if those involved so desire."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/20/business/gas-giant-suspends-dividend.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1991-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 739, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gas Giant Suspends Dividend", "print_headline": "Gas Giant Suspends Dividend", "body_text": " **********The Columbia Gas System Inc., one of the leading suppliers of natural gas to utilities in the Northeast, suspended dividend payments yesterday and said it might seek bankruptcy court protection unless it could renegotiate contracts with gas producers and bankers. **********On the news, the company's shares lost 40 percent of their value. The stock's opening on the New York Stock Exchange was delayed yesterday, pending the announcement. Columbia's share price later opened at $20 before closing at $20.75, off $13.75. With 4.4 million shares traded, the stock was the most active Big Board issue. **********The plunge helped send the whole stock market down, with the Dow losing 31.31, to 2,955.50.  [ Page D8. ] No Effect on Consumers **********There should be no immediate effect on consumers. Spot markets determine the price paid by local utilities, and the majority of the gas Columbia ships is for these companies. Even if it files for bankruptcy, the company anticipates operating under court protection. **********The company blamed warm weather in recent years for depressing gas prices on spot markets, leaving it locked into contracts to buy gas at much higher prices set years ago when supplies were tighter. The company said the gap between what it had to pay for gas and what it could sell for could amount to as much as $1 billion. **********In a statement, Columbia said \"a substantial portion\" of these losses would be charged against second-quarter income, probably producing a sizable loss.  Other Pipeline Companies **********Analysts said the rest of the pipeline industry appeared to be in better shape than Columbia, having previously negotiated old fixed-price contracts to reflect spot-market prices. \"I think other companies have some spot problems, but nothing near the problems Columbia has,\" said Paul R. Ferretti, an analyst with Dillon, Read & Company. **********Still, the stock prices of other pipeline companies also fell, though not by nearly as much. The Ensearch Corporation's share price closed at $18.25, off 62.5 cents, while that of Consolidated Natural Gas Utilities fell $1.75, to $39.50. **********\"While ll segments of the pipeline industry have been affected to some extent, Columbia was uniquely affected because of their mix of contracts, customers and structure,\" said Michael Baly, president of the American Gas Association. \"We hope the contract problems at Columbia are the last chapter of the 'take or pay' era.\" Under such a contract, a buyer must purchase a certain amount of a product or make payments in lieu of the purchases. **********The company said a recent review had shown that its \"potential exposure under its above-market-priced gas purchase contracts is substantially larger than previously projected.\" **********The company said it was offering gas producers $600 million in securities of its Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation subsidiary as an inducement to break the old, high-price contracts. But if those negotiations fail, or if banks withdraw lines of credit, the company said, it could \"force the system, the pipeline subsidiary or both to seek protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws.\"  Paying $6.70 for $1.30 of Gas **********Columbia said the old fixed-price contracts obligated it to pay as much as $6.70 for a thousand cubic feet of gas at the wellhead, while the spot price is about $1.30. **********In an interview, John H. Croom, the chairman of Columbia, said the company was \"caught in a fix\" because of changing regulations. The local utilities that formerly bought gas from pipeline companies like Columbia are now allowed to purchase spot-market gas when it is cheaper. And the pipelines must transport the gas if they have available capacity. **********\"We have had seven warm winters in a row,\" Mr. Croom said, \"so that has freed up capacity.\" He said that last year, between 60 and 70 percent of the gas going through Columbia's major pipelines was transported for other owners.  Deadline of Oct. 1 **********The company set a deadline of Oct. 1 for concluding agreements with gas producers. \"We must have strong encouragement from representative producers by the end of July and commitments from substantially all producers\" by Oct. 1, the company said in a statement. **********Robert Oswald, Columbia's chief financial officer, said the size of the gas-contract problem had caused banks to cut off previously established lines of credit. **********After the announcement, the Standard & Poor's Corporation announced that it was downgrading the company's senior debt from BBB+, to BB, and Columbia's commercial paper to B, from A-2.

Since earlier this year, a businessman who is not a member has been chairman of the board of the kibbutz's main enterprise, the orange-juice factory. **********\"We are in a major economic crisis,\" said Amir Levy, the elected secretary who manages the kibbutz, where he was born 48 years ago. \"We realize we need somebody who brings a more capitalistic view of what we're doing.\" **********Not all do. \"Outside managers?\" exclaimed David Bar, an agricultural entomologist. \"This is fundamental.

In debates that have much in common with those in the remaining or former Communist countries of Eastern Europe, kibbutzniks are taking the pulse of socialism and question whether any life is left in it. **********\"The old idea is dead, we have to admit it,\" Mr. Levy said. \"We have entered the capitalist era.\" **********At a public meeting last year, Yehuda Harel said, \"The socialist system in all its forms has been a total failure.\" Mr. Harel, a founder of the first kibbutz established on the Golan Heights, now heads his kibbutz's management-consulting concern, which wants to help kibbutzim to separate their businesses, to be run on a strictly entrepreneurial basis, from their communal life. **********Mr. Levy said he had arrived at the University of California in Santa Barbara, where he obtained a Ph.D. in sociology, imbued with the collective, anti-capitalist ideology of the kibbutz. **********\"There I saw you could succeed by the opposite values of the kibbutz,\" he said. \"I thought capitalism was exploitation. But I saw that with individualism, freedom, personal responsibility, you can succeed. In the kibbutz no one takes responsibility. **********\"We will have to try to absorb some of the capitalist ideas and remain socialist. I don't know if it's possible, but there's no other way.\" **********Mr. Bar said that as a natural scientist he recognized Mr. Levy's sociological expertise, and that \"I understand we're in a bad situation.\" **********\"But I'm afraid if we continue this process, we will see outsiders eat in the dining room or renting apartments here,\" he continued. \"I don't like it. I came to the kibbutz in 1957 to live together with my colleagues and friends. The kibbutz is a kind of nature reserve. The quality of life is the highest in Israel. I want to put some limits to what I give up.\" **********Mr. Levy, speaking for those who believe that the \"old idea is dead,\" said the kibbutz model was undercut when the Israeli economy shifted from reliance on agriculture into higher technological gear, and industry became the main business of the kibbutzim and professional specialization a requirement. **********\"The traditional kibbutz was built on agriculture, and to work hard and produce a lot was the goal,\" he said. \"But now it's not enough to produce. We must sell and compete with the world.\" **********He said management was a professional skill, and under Mr. Bar's management the dining hall proved that running it was not his profession. Mr. Levy said he wanted to make the dining hall, the social center for the 1,000 adults and 500 children of Givat Brenner, a paying cafeteria rather than the traditional kibbutz mess hall of \"this is what we all eat today.\" **********The present dining-hall system causes great waste as well as poor meals, Mr. Levy said, because no one feels responsible, no one cares and no one wants to work there. \"If we pay, we will eat better, and it will cost half of the 6 million shekels we spend now,\" he said. **********\"But for the others, the dining room is a principle, a temple,\" he said. He said deviations from tradition had an almost sacrilegious aspect for the \"true believers\" of the kibbutzim. **********If concessions to commerce like paying for meals continue, Mr. Bar said, soon members will be asking, \"Why do we need the kibbutz?\" **********\"The dining room is part of my own home,\" he said. \"If I pay, what happens to the idea? If it doesn't work, then we have to close the doors and say, 'It was a beautiful experiment, bye-bye.'

But he said intellectuals should acknowledge that religious faith could help people understand death, suffering, evil and other aspects of existence \"which to scientific analysis appear incomprehensible if not totally absurd.\" **********In the same statement, the Pope strongly urged a return to religious instruction in public schools. This has been a delicate issue in Hungary for decades. Efforts by the Communists to restrict religious education contributed to bitter conflicts of church and state beginning in the late 1940's. **********The Pope asserted that modern Hungary was \"profoundly threatened by the phenomenon of secularism\" and that moral values \"are not infrequently ignored, and even ridiculed.\" He said schools should stress religious values that parents tend to ignore. **********\"Parents have too little time to devote to their children,\" he said. \"Perhaps they too are deeply wounded in spirit, shaken in their basic convictions and consequently have no interest in the real and ultimate meaning of life.\" **********--------------------       Tanks Roll Into Town **********BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Aug. 17 (AP) -- Federal army tanks rolled into a strategic Croatian town today and warplanes attacked positions of local militias in fighting that threatened an 11-day-old truce, officials said. **********About 23 armored vehicles and 11 army trucks entered Okucani, 70 miles southeast of Zagreb at the intersection of several major roads and near Yugoslavia's main north-south highway, the official news agency, Tanyug, said.

In the past, India has provided asylum to hundreds of thousands of Tibetan refugees. **********For the Chinese Prime Minister's visit, though, Mr. Rao's officials rounded up hundreds of Tibetans and forcibly -- at times brutally -- halted protest marches to the Chinese Embassy.

Moreover, the rule changes announced by the Treasury will not change the auction process much.  Some Short-Term Risk **********Nevertheless, by choosing to put the changes into effect at the start of the refunding auctions on Nov. 5, the Treasury has opened itself up to some short-term risk. **********The size of the refunding is expected to be announced on Wednesday. Most analysts expect the Treasury to sell a total of $38 billion worth of 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. **********The overall size of the auctions and the existence of the speculative 10-year and 30-year offerings make these quarterly debt sales the riskiest the Treasury conducts each year. **********And the auctions will take place in the week after credit market participants will have digested a series of important economic reports, including the Commerce Department's preliminary estimate on third-quarter economic growth, and October employment data from the Labor Department.  Potential Market Shift **********If those statistics are stronger than currently anticipated, the market's mood could suddenly shift. And a shift in market sentiment could make even the mildest changes in auction rules difficult and possibly expensive for the nation's taxpayers by driving up interest rates. **********\"I don't think there will be any impact, but financial regulation is subject to the law of unanticipated circumstances,\" said Louis van B. Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm. \"And when you change auction rules, the last place you want to experiment with is the refunding.\" **********Apart from the potential effects of the economic statistics, Mr. Crandall and others said that for the time being, the Treasury's decision to open the bidding process would not mean much.

Kelly, chairman of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a primary dealer. Choice for Customers **********Without an automated system, customers will have the choice of physically submitting tender offers to the New York Fed before auction time, or telephoning primary dealers to place their bids. The Treasury has made it plain that it will accelerate efforts to automate the process. But that job will not be completed before the refunding auctions. **********For the time being, the decision to increase the maximum amount of securities awarded to noncompetitive tender bids to $5 million, from $1 million, will also not have much impact. **********But Mr. Crandall said that under different market conditions, increasing the size of noncompetitive awards, which are made at the yield reflecting the average of accepted competitive tenders, will drive up borrowing costs. **********\"There is no way that change is more favorable to the Treasury,\" Mr. Crandall said. \"We are in a bull market right now, so it won't have any impact. But in a down market, where you have a wider dispersal of bids, the larger noncompetitive awards will produce higher yields for the Treasury. At the margin, this rule change can only be bad for the taxpayer.\"  Righting Another Wrong **********Along with promoting broader distribution of securities at the auctions -- which presumably will make it more difficult for dealers to gain control of a particular security at an auction -- the Treasury also intends to right another wrong Salomon committed by developing a way to prevent primary dealers from placing unauthorized bids on behalf of customers. **********The method under discussion would require customers to send letters of verification to the Treasury before the settlement dates of securities sales indicating they had bid for a certain amount of securities. **********Mr. Kelly, who served as a Treasury official in the Carter Administration, contends that policing firms and their customers in this manner would be inefficient and costly. **********\"I already find customers who have indicated reluctance to send letters of any kind to the Fed or Treasury verifying an auction bid,\" he said. **********\"Some customers might find this to be such a nuisance that they choose no longer to bid at the auctions but rather to purchase their securities in the secondary market,\" he added. \"That in turn will transfer the auction risk to the primary dealers.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/05/business/ex-brokerage-officials-accused-of-stock-manipulation.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1991-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 493, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Brokerage Officials Accused of Stock Manipulation", "print_headline": "Ex-Brokerage Officials Accused of Stock Manipulation", "body_text": " **********The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil securities fraud charges yesterday against three former top officials of the defunct brokerage firm Moore & Schley, accusing them of manipulating the prices of two stocks. **********The charges, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, were an outgrowth of an investigation into the trading of the Chase Medical Corporation's stock. The S.E.C. had previously said that shares of the small Florida health-care provider were \"cornered\" in late 1988 by two Moore & Schley brokers, whose clients had purchased all of the available shares. **********The new charges say the two brokers, who have pleaded guilty to criminal securities fraud charges and will be sentenced this year, were not acting as rogue brokers but were following the brokerage firm's policy. The firm ran out of funds in part because of losses caused by a collapse of what the charges say were efforts to corner Chase Medical's stock. **********The Moore & Schley officials who were charged yesterday are John J. Cranley Jr. of Short Hills, N.J., who was managing partner; Thomas Core of Manhattan, a partner and branch office manager, and Robert Sayegh of Manhattan, the partner in charge of trading. All three men are now employed by Jesup, Josephthal & Company, a Manhattan brokerage. **********Reached at his office, Mr. Sayegh said, \"I have no knowledge\" of the charges, but declined further comment. Mr. Cranley and Mr. Core did not return telephone messages. **********Mr. Cranley was also a director of the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, an Irish company whose shares were underwritten in the United States by Moore & Schley. The price of those shares collapsed after Moore & Schley went out of business in 1989. The charges accuse the defendants of manipulating the stock's price. **********The latest charges appear to be based on statements by Vincent Militano and Milton Sonneberg, the two former brokers. Civil charges are still pending against them. **********The S.E.C. contended that the brokers and their customers had amassed a stake in Chase Medical that amounted to more than the number of publicly traded shares, hoping to profit from short-sellers, who had borrowed shares and sold them in the hope that the price would decline. **********Also named in the case were two of Mr. Militano's customers, John Kolb of Wantagh, L.I., and Carl Varrone of Dix Hills, L.I., who were accused of making large profits by trading in Chase Medical securities without putting up money, and of lying to S.E.C. investigators. Jonathan Lagemann, a lawyer for Mr. Kolb, said there was \"no basis\" for the charges. Mr. Varrone's telephone number is unlisted. **********The S.E.C. asked that the defendants be barred from violating securities law and required to surrender illegal profits, which it put at $50,000 for Mr. Kolb, $203,000 for Mr. Varrone, $245,000 for Mr. Militano and $178,000 for Mr. Sonneberg.

But if the current recession ends up lasting longer, and going deeper, than is currently expected, that relatively happy outcome could change. **********To be sure, 1990 was no fun for anyone involved in the stock market, with the possible exception of the short-sellers, who seek to profit from lower prices. For the first time since 1981, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index showed a loss for a year, falling 6.6 percent before dividends. **********In 1991, the most important issue for investors may be just how much impact the Fed's easing of interest rates has on the economy. Rebound or Lag **********If it helps to shorten the recession by getting businesses and consumers to step up spending, then the rebound that began last October may be not just a bear-market rally but the beginning of a bull market. But if the pressures of debt, and the banks' new-found fear of bad loans, keep a lid on economic activity, then this bear market could have a way to go. **********The carnage last year was worse for the brokerage industry than for investors. On Wall Street, the leveraged escapades of the 1980's left one big firm bankrupt and several others dependent on rich parents for capital infusions. With trading volume down and institutional commissions measured in pennies a share, few equity desks on Wall Street are making money. There are rumors of many more pink slips in this new year. Worst Showing Since 1974 **********Wall Street's problems are more accurately reflected in the performance of the vast majority of stocks, whose owners can only look at the narrower gauge of the S.& P. performance with jealousy. The Nasdaq composite, which measures stocks traded over the counter, fell 17.8 percent in 1990, its worst showing since it plunged 35.1 percent in 1974. **********The dismal performance seems not to have concerned a lot of investors much. It has become commonplace to note that many institutions are invested a lot more bullishly than their managers talk, and individual investors poured money into stock mutual funds for almost the entire year, although there were reports of a slowdown in the final weeks of December. In the aftermath of the 1987 crash, many investors concluded that the crash created great investment opportunities, and that bottom-fishing mentality has remained alive. **********Only a year ago, the conventional wisdom on Wall Street was that the economy was slowing, but a recession would be avoided. Now the general expectation is that there is a recession that began sometime this summer or fall, but that it will be relatively mild. 'A Complacent View' **********\"I think investors now are taking a complacent view,\" said Abby Joseph Cohen, who began 1990 as chief investment strategist at now-bankrupt Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and ended it with the title of co-chair of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs. \"They think the recession will be short and sweet, but we don't know how much damage it will do to corporate profits.\" **********Historically, stocks have performed poorly early in a recession, but have tended to rise in the last half of the downturn, as the market anticipates the recovery. Optimists have hoped that the rebound that began after most stocks bottomed in October might be evidence that the economic downturn will be a mild one, but Mrs. Cohen is among the analysts who think that the huge debt burden confronting corporate America may serve to extend this downturn. **********Those who are pessimistic recall the 1973-74 recession, where large stocks also outperformed the market as a whole in the early going. In 1974, the S.& P. 500 fell by 17.4 percent, while the Nasdaq composite was off 31.1 percent. The next year, the S.& P. dropped 29.7 percent, while the Nasdaq index plunged 35 percent.  Depressed Industries Lifted **********In 1990, big was best in stocks, and small was worst. Financial stocks were out of favor, and makers of consumer staples -- toothpaste and soft drinks and the like -- were the Wall Street darlings for their profits that kept rising despite economic problems. But the late rally tended to lift such depressed industries as banks and home builders more than other shares, though not nearly enough to allow them to break even for the year. **********Among the major gauges, the Dow Jones industrial average, composed of only 30 large stocks, was the best performer for 1990. In July, long after indexes of smaller stocks had peaked, the Dow average topped 3,000 in several sessions, but never was able to close that high, hitting 2,999.75 on two occassions. But it started down even before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, stirring war fears and driving up oil prices. **********For the year, the Dow fell just 4.3 percent before dividends, and less than one percentage point if those payouts are included. The Dow gets the most publicity, and its action may help to explain the relative lack of investor reaction.  Index Up 2.9 Percent **********Of the 20 largest companies in market capitalization at the end of 1989, 11 saw their share prices rise in 1990, and a capitalization-weighted index of the 20 was up 2.9 percent. **********By contrast, the Russell 2,000 measures the performance of the companies that rank from 1,001 to 3,000 in market capitalization. That index fell 21.5 percent in 1990. **********For fans of small stocks, the recent past has been a dreary history of underperformance, beginning in the summer of 1983, when seven years of outperformance by the small stocks came to an abrupt end. The Nasdaq industrial index is down six-tenths of a percent from where it stood on June 24, 1983. By contrast, the Dow industrials are up 112.1 percent over that period. **********But in the last couple of months of 1990, the losers early in the year started to do better. Some of the hardest-hit areas of the market rallied, among them the banks and the homebuilders. And the Russell 2,000 gained 11.2 percent in the final two months, while the S.& P. 500 added just 8.6 percent. **********The average New York City bank stock fell 39.5 percent in 1990, but it was up 21.1 percent over the final two months. Regional banks, which had not fallen as far, also did not bounce as high. The Nadsdaq bank index, down 34.8 percent for the year, gained 7.7 percent in the final two months. Expectations Confounded **********As 1990 began, the general expectation was for lower interest rates, but rates confounded those expectations and rose early in the year. Rates came down in late 1990 as the Federal Reserve tried to contain recessionary pressures, but long-term rates nonetheless were up for the year. The rate on 30-year Treasury bonds, at 7.97 percent a year ago, now is 8.29 percent. But the rate on three-month Treasury bills dropped from 7.60 percent to 6.44 percent. **********The rise in long-term interest rates may help to explain the relatively poor performance of utility stocks. The Dow utility average was down 10.8 percent for the year, despite the reputation of the stocks as the kind to own in downturns. **********Charles Clough, the chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, argues that utilities now represent the best values in the market, simply because their dividends appear to be safe at a time when the pressures of debt and recession are likely to make many other companies cut payouts. \"Income may be the thing that is in short supply in the 1990's,\" he said, forecasting that interest rates will decline sharply. **********As it is, 1990 was one of the worst years for dividend payouts in recent years, although final figures are not in. The fact that many large companies did acceptably well helped overall dividend payments to rise, but more companies cut their payouts than in any year since 1982."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/20/business/business-technology-5-millionth-us-patent.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "5 Millionth U.S. Patent", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; 5 Millionth U.S. Patent", "body_text": " **********The nation's five millionth patent was issued this morning, and the process it registers seems to be a sign of the times.

Magazine Company is vigorously developing new ways to use television to market its magazines. **********Some Time magazine correspondents now carry small eight-millimeter cameras when they go out on assignments in order to shoot footage for possible use on network and local television. **********For instance, when William Dowell, the chief of Time's Cairo bureau, was in Kuwait last spring covering the oil fires, he also filmed them. After he had finished his report for the magazine, he narrated a piece for television and shipped it to New York. The footage was sold to \"The McNeil/ Lehrer Newshour\" and later to \"CBS This Morning.\"  Looking to Be 'a Major Player' **********\"We started about a year ago to familiarize ourselves with the whole TV-video end of the business,\" said Robert Miller, president of Time Publishing Ventures, who is exploring television possibilities for all the magazines. \"At some point, I like to think we would be a major player in television.\" **********Joe Quinlan, a former television journalist, has been working at the Time Inc. Magazine Company for more than a year to combine the journalistic resources of the magazines with the television production and distribution companies owned by Time Warner Inc. **********\"If there is a way to make ourselves available, almost like a joint venture, with these companies, we'll do it,\" he said. **********Entertainment Weekly magazine, for example, now produces a four-minute weekly program about its next issue for Home Box Office, another unit of Time Warner. **********\"The next step is why doesn't Entertainment Weekly have its own program,\" Mr. Quinlan said.  Promoting the Magazines **********The primary purpose of these ventures into television is, of course, to promote the company's magazines. As a news-gathering operation, however, Time is also interested in disseminating information to the widest possible audience. Some people worry that this duality of purpose poses a troublesome blurring of the lines between the editorial and business sides and fear that it could lead to the manipulation of news for marketing purposes. **********On Oct. 19, the day before Time published its exclusive excerpts from Oliver L. North's new book about his role in the Iran-contra affair, Time distributed a television news spot promoting its report. The networks, the Cable News Network and many local stations broadcast parts of the news spot, attributing it to Time. **********But \"NBC Nightly News,\" in what it says was an oversight, used parts of the news spot without identifying Time as the source. \"It wasn't by design,\" said Don Browne, executive vice president at NBC News. \"Our policy is to identify that kind of video, but it was late in the day and it didn't appear.\" **********As a result, many viewers were unaware that some of the video they were seeing was not produced by NBC as a news report, but by Time as a marketing tool.  'Some Kind of Alert' **********\"Given the importance and reliance that people put on television news, I believe that they minimally should have some kind of alert when this stuff comes into their living rooms that it was produced by a promotional source,\" said Eugene Secunda, professor of marketing at Baruch College and co-author of \"Shifting Time and Space: The Story of Video-Tape.\" **********The problem arises mostly at local television stations, which are under increasing pressure to get good ratings while cutting costs. Every day, these stations are offered an array of video news releases that are often more professionally produced than anything they could afford to do. The temptation is to broadcast these videos without giving credit. **********David Smith, vice president and senior consultant at Frank N. Magid Associates, a media and marketing research and consulting firm, said many video news releases were promotions disguised as news, like a tour of a tire factory that claimed to make a new kind of tire. **********\"It might be done very much as a news feature story,\" he said. \"Since it's just the way the station would do the same story, you are not as suspicious as you should be of the marketing angle.\" **********Professor Secunda sees other potential problems. \"If you are Time and are trying to promote a particular issue, you use whatever influence you might have on various electronic media owned by Time Warner,\" he said. \"But I do have a problem with the increased integration of media ownership so that Time magazine begins to have a certain favored edge or favored relationship with electronic media owned by Time Warner. It certainly begins to cut down on the diversity of points of view.\" **********Since neither of Time magazine's main competitors, Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report, belongs to a giant multimedia conglomerate like Time Warner, they do not have the resources to market themselves as efficiently on television. **********Diana Pearson, a spokeswoman for Newsweek, said the magazine did not produce video news releases and \"would feel very uncomfortable trying to present a news story for someone else to transmit.\" **********Both magazines are involved to some extent in creating specials for television. Newsweek will do a program next spring with MTV on \"kids and politics.\" U.S. News produced a multipart television series on winners of the Congressional Medal of Honor last year. **********\"Every year, we do six television tie-ins or presentations on CNBC based on our back-of-the-book features on careers and best colleges,\" said Mortimer B.

It was the highest jobless rate in California since March 1984, when the rate reached 8.3 percent. The national unemployment rate in June was 7 percent, the Labor Department said.  Three Increase Reserves **********Analysts said the sharp rise in unemployment reflected broad problems in the state's economy, including the effects of a drought, the slowdown in Pentagon spending, an overbuilt commercial real estate market as well as the national recession. And the unemployment rate explains some of the problems behind the large increases in loan-loss reserves taken in recent weeks by Security Pacific, Wells Fargo and First Interstate. **********Because of the additions to their reserves, Security Pacific and Wells Fargo said they would post sharply lower earnings for the quarter ended June 30; First Interstate said it would post a loss for the period. **********BankAmerica said that it was having more problems in many parts of its loan portfolio but that they were more than offset by improvement in its loans to other countries. BankAmerica, based in San Francisco, said it expected its second-quarter earnings to be flat compared with the similar period a year earlier.  Basically Sound **********The California banks are still basically strong, analysts said, and no one sees evidence yet that any of them will suffer the devastating losses like those that crippled many banks in the Northeast, Texas and other markets suffering from prolonged economic and real estate troubles. **********But the deteriorating condition of the California banks' loan portfolios has burst a recent surge in confidence among investors that the banks would weather the recession without much difficulty. **********With business slow, more companies, especially those with heavy loads of debt, are having difficulty meeting all of their payments. Developers and owners of commercial real estate are having trouble filling office buildings and shopping centers, putting more real estate loans in jeopardy. **********\"The common thread in what's happening to the banks is the softening California business climate and the slumping commercial real estate market,\" said Denise Petsis, an analyst at Argus Research in New York. **********After running up sharply this spring, Wells Fargo's stock closed at $66.50 a share on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, up $1.125 for the day but down nearly a third from its peak of $98.75 in early June. First Interstate's shares have fallen from a high of $42.50 this year to $26.75 a share, up 12.5 cents on Friday. **********Security Pacific's shares have dropped from a recent high of $33.125 two months ago to $21.125 on Friday, down 12.5 cents on the day. Even BankAmerica, which was hurt the least by loan problems in the second quarter, saw its stock driven down from $40.375 a share earlier this year to $34.50 a share on Friday, up $1 for the day. **********In addition to the difficulties posed by the California economy, the banks are also paying a price for the business strategies they pursued in recent years. **********First Interstate, based in Los Angeles, was battered in the second quarter by its push into neighboring states, with its Nevada and Oregon operations reporting more loan problems. Security Pacific, also based in Los Angeles, suffered from loans it made in Britain and Australia. The problems of Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, were mainly with companies that borrowed heavily to finance buyouts or other transactions. **********\"Each of their operations and loan compositions are different,\" Ms. Petsis said.  Tougher Regulation **********Moreover, the banks are contending with regulators who are suddenly applying stricter standards than ever, in some cases forcing the banks to deal more aggressively with potentially troubled loans than the institutions think is necessary. **********\"It appears that regulators are applying the same generally tougher standards they were in the East last year,\" said Mark Lynch, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company. **********At Wells Fargo, the company's addition of $350 million to its reserves for bad loans was made primarily at the direction of Federal banking regulators from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, industry executives said. In announcing the step on June 25, Wells Fargo pointedly noted that it was counting among its potentially bad loans about $400 million on which the borrowers were up to date on all interest and principal payments. About half of those loans were related to buyouts or other deals that regulators called highly leveraged transactions. **********An industry publication, The American Banker, has reported that the regulators based their decisions about the loans' soundness on their assessment of the borrowers' prospects several years in the future, a new approach that Wells Fargo strongly objected to. **********A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo declined to comment, and a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency could not be reached. **********Similarly, regulators reportedly took a very hard line with First Interstate, creating serious disagreements with the bank's managers, especially in Nevada. Donald Snyder, chairman of First Interstate's Nevada bank, resigned in the wake of the intense regulatory scrutiny, as did the Nevada bank's president and several other top lending officers.  Softness in Real Estate **********One big uncertainty now facing California banks is the real estate market. Residential real estate is showing signs of bouncing back after a period of little sales activity and declining prices in many markets. The commercial market is very slow and is plagued by an excess of available space, especially in Southern California. **********In making its earnings projection last week, Security Pacific said it was adding $200 million in commercial real estate loans to its pool of troubled loans. Wells Fargo said real estate loans were not a serious factor in its problems. First Interstate reported some moderate problems and warned that the California real estate market \"retains elements of unpredictability that may result in changes in the level of nonperforming assets, as well as in further exposure to credit losses.\" **********The other big question is how soon the state's once-robust economy will bounce back. Economists said California will probably lag the national recovery from the recession because the drought, continuing layoffs in the aerospace business and a bad slump in housing construction will continue for some months at least. **********The state's budget crisis is not helping, either. The package of tax increases and spending cuts being pieced together by Governor Pete Wilson and the Legislature to close a $14.3 billion budget deficit could leave consumers and businesses with less money to spend. More layoffs in state and local government could also result."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/30/business/finance-new-issues-philip-morris-sells-300-million-issue.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Philip Morris Sells $300 Million Issue", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Philip Morris Sells $300 Million Issue", "body_text": " **********The Philip Morris Companies is selling $300 million noncallable notes due June 1, 2001, through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. **********First Boston and Lehman Brothers were co-managers on the deal. **********The 8.75 percent notes were priced at 99.357 to yield 8.848 percent, or about 80 basis points more than the 10-year treasury note.

This means the bad news has already had its impact on the markets and on prices. **********Since the bad news is already factored in, it is only the unexpected news that will move prices one way or another. And since no one can forecast the unexpected, it is important to keep a cash reserve. These are uncertain times and no one really knows what will happen. **********However, to decide where to invest, I tell people to work backward. If you need $10,000 a year in income, look at Treasury bills, bonds and notes. If interest rates are 8 percent on a five-year Government bond, you must invest $125,000 at 8 percent to get the income you need. **********But the truth is, no one knows what interest rates and bond prices are going to be. So just buy whatever bonds you must have to live on at the current rates -- but no more -- and hope for the best. But buy only the highest-quality bonds. It's mindless to take risk -- any risk -- to get one more percentage point of income. And owning bonds, even Governments bonds, represents a risk. **********The problem with bonds is that inflation is grinding down the value of the money you make from them. So with your remaining investment capital, you should invest for growth in stocks. **********Historically, across the broad stock market, stocks have been high when the average price has been about 20 times the average earnings per share. But when you think about the price-earnings ratio, you must also think about inflation. **********The relationship between the rate of inflation and the price-earnings ratio of the broad market represents the impact of inflation on stock market prices. Based on what I have seen in the last 30 years, the annual rate of inflation -- now about 4 percent -- must be added to the price-earnings ratio, which is currently about 14. These two numbers together equal 18, which tells me that stocks are no great bargain either. **********Because stocks are no big bargain, I would not invest too much in the stock market. I would hold back and wait for a big market break before I invested more than a fifth of my money in stocks. I would watch for a break big enough to make the front pages of the newspapers before I bought more stock. But what to buy? **********To be honest, I really don't know. Who really does? So stick with a high-quality mutual fund. **********In the end, my advice is simply to forget the advice of professionals. Forget people who talk about market timing and asset allocation. That's just another way of telling you that they can forecast the unexpected. They can't. In the end, what I have learned, is that every investor is pretty much on his own."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/18/business/german-prices-fall.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "German Prices Fall", "print_headline": "German Prices Fall", "body_text": " **********Producer prices in western Germany fell three-tenths of a percent in March from February, to stand 1.8 percent above the level recorded in March 1990, the Government said today.

The leaders of the Soviet republics, who were hoping for a coin or three in return for assuming the Soviet Union's debts, were left empty-handed last week. While the West agreed to a delay in repayment of the principal through 1992, the deal offered no money to slow the republics' perilous financial decline. **********Indeed, the negotiation with the United States and its major economic allies in Moscow may have added to the republics' economic woes by highlighting both the division of interests between the Russian Federation and the Ukraine and Washington's indecision on aid. **********Russian leaders, eager to put the best possible spin on the agreement, point out that it gives the West explicit leverage over plans for creating a market economy in the republics. And that arrangement improves the prospects for a \"grand bargain\" on the financing of reforms. \"It was a willing surrender by Russia,\" said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. **********By conventional yardsticks, the Soviet foreign debt is quite modest. Official Russian estimates put hard-currency debts to governments, banks and private businesses in the range of $80 billion. Planecon, a Washington consulting firm specializing in Eastern European economies, pegs the net debt -- Soviet obligations less sums owed to Moscow -- at about half that. But even the higher official number \"would be the envy of most developing countries,\" said Darryl McLeod, an economist at Fordham University. **********The $80 billion represents one and a half times current annual Soviet export earnings -- and just 7 percent of the Soviet G.N.P. Mexico, by contrast, owes 2.5 times as much as it earned from exports in 1990. Even South Korea owes foreigners the equivalent of 17 percent of its G.N.P. **********The catch, of course, is that the Mexican and South Korean economies are stable and growing, while lenders doubt both the capacity and the will of the former Soviet republics to service a foreign debt. While Soviet hard currency earnings will actually be higher this year than last because former East bloc trading partners are now required to pay their bills in dollars, signs of the rapid deterioration in Soviet creditworthiness are still plain to those who care to look. **********Soviet gold reserves, the former union's rainy day fund, now stand at 240 tons -- hardly enough to cover a month's worth of imports. The production of oil, along with natural gas and weapons, the Soviets' most reliable source of hard-currency revenues, has fallen by a sixth since the peak in 1987. And while David Johnson, an economist at Planecon, notes that the decline largely reflects poor physical management of the oil reserves, production problems are rapidly being compounded by organizational chaos. For example, critical oilfield machinery is desperately scarce because the factory in Azerbaijan has been plagued by the conflict between Muslims and Armenian Christians.  Spending on Imports **********What is more, the pressure to spend foreign exchange earnings on imports rather than interest payments grows as domestic deliveries of consumer goods falter. Morgan Guaranty estimates that Soviet factories idled for want of parts and supplies will make 15 percent less this year than last. The 1991 harvest was also smaller than expected because farms were short of everything from tractor fuel to fertilizer. And farmers are shipping less of what they produce because they are less than eager to trade food and fiber for rubles that buy nothing. **********It is thus no surprise that private foreign lenders are scrambling to trim their exposure, canceling short-term credits that had previously been renewed routinely. Even before the August coup attempt, Susanne Gehler of Morgan Guaranty in London predicted that Soviet short-term debts to Western banks and suppliers would be reduced by $5 billion this year. And with the cupboard otherwise bare -- hard currency reserves are reportedly down to a few billion dollars -- it was obvious the republics would be forced to default on billions in longer-term debts scheduled to be repaid next year. **********What was not obvious, is that the response to the impending debt crisis from the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada would be so limited, said Jeffrey Sachs, an economist at Harvard and consultant to the Russian government. **********The deal proposed by the Western finance ministers and signed last week by their counterparts from eight republics requires the republics to assume joint responsibility for Soviet debts and to keep current on all interest payments. In return, the Western governments agreed to look the other way when $3.6 billion in principal payments due this year and next fail to arrive. The finance ministers also implied that they would lean on Western (mostly European) banks that hold billions in Soviet i.o.u.'s to make parallel concessions.  Pawnshop Operation **********But the only cash the West put on the table was a $1 billion line of credit, to be secured by $1 billion of Soviet gold. This pawnshop operation does spare the republics the embarrassment of selling the last of their gold, but as Mr. Hormats of Goldman Sachs said, the Western governments \"certainly got a lot for their money.\" **********One unintended result of the hard-nosed bargaining is a further fraying of the inter-republic fabric. While the Ukraine was reportedly willing to guarantee a share of Soviet debt, it balked at Western demands that each republic be responsible for the whole. That can only add to the temptation for the Russian Federation to go its own economic way, Ms. Gehler of Morgan Guaranty suggested. **********Western economists are virtually of one voice in urging the opening of borders to inter-republic trade. But the path of least domestic political resistance for Russia, which sells more within the union than it buys, is to require all trade with other republics be settled in dollars at world prices. This would give Russia the ability to divert substantial amounts of oil for sale in the West much the way the demise of the East bloc market created a surge in hard-currency sales for the Soviet Union. **********This might damage Russia's economic prospects almost as much as it damaged the oil-importing republics. After all, a substantial portion of Russian exports to other republics consists of manufactured goods that no one would buy if they had to pay hard currency. **********But Ms. Gehler of Morgan Guaranty pointed out that it took a year for the former East bloc economies to have second thoughts and begin to reconstruct internal barter arrangements -- a year in which trade between the Soviet Union and its former satellites fell by half, stranding hundreds of thousands of workers in enterprises with nothing worth selling. **********The best hope, said Graham Allison at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, is that the debt deal will suck Western governments into the elusive \"grand bargain,\" rewarding a rapid Soviet transition to democratic capitalism with dollars, yen and Deutsche marks. While the agreement offers no money beyond the modest gold swap, it does say that the debt deferral would be renewed beyond 1992 if the republics follow the International Monetary Fund's advice on economic reforms. **********Such leverage, Mr. Allison said, \"is a step down a slippery slope,\" toward taking broader responsibility for the economic fate of the shattered Soviet empire."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/24/business/forum-cookie-crunching-forecasts-revisited.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Goldman", "pub_date": "1991-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 376, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cookie-Crunching Forecasts, Revisited", "print_headline": "FORUM; Cookie-Crunching Forecasts, Revisited", "body_text": " **********Once again, sales of Girl Scout cookies represent a leading economic indicator.

Some suggested that Mr. Collor might have stage-managed it to make an eventual accord with the fund more palatable at home. Debt-rescheduling talks with the fund resumed today after a three-day suspension. **********The confrontation between Brazil, the third world's largest debtor, and the fund started last Thursday when the Jornal do Brasil, a newspaper, reported that Mr. Fajgenbaum had said Brazil could straighten out its finances only when it changed clauses in its Constitution that mandate generous federal revenue sharing with states and muncipalities. **********\"He's the one who should get his own house in order,\" President Collor snapped in response, demanding Sunday that the Washington-based organization recall him. \"For someone from outside to come and give us tips is inadmissible.\"  Statements Are Denied **********Mr. Fajgenbaum denied that he had made the statements, but his denial had no effect. **********Many analysts here suggest Mr. Collor's highly confrontational stand was intended to defuse future left-wing opposition to constitutional changes of the kind the Fund representative was advocating. **********\"He is playing up a basically insignificant thing to show the domestic audience how tough he is,\" one Brazilian businessman said, noting that by law Mr. Collor needs the Senate's approval for debt-rescheduling agreements. **********But other analysts feared the verbal sparring could signal a new phase of Brazilian intransigence that could slow Brazil's return to the good graces of the international banking community. **********An agreement to reschedule $8.5 billion in overdue interest has been reached with representatives of foreign commercial banks, but must be endorsed by 95 percent of the creditors before it takes effect. The pact, which is the only debt rescheduling of Mr. Collor's 16-month-old Government, has been ratified by 280 banks, or about half the total. **********\"People here are very concerned; they don't want the arrears deal to fall through,\" Riordan A. Roett, a Brazil expert, said today from New York where he is a bank consultant. **********Brazil's left views the fund as a meddling policeman for capitalist banks. Now, Mr. Collor, a free market conservative, is taking the same view, giving rise to such anxieties. **********\"The Government should reject this inadmissable interference and send this technician out of the country on the first plane,\" said Roberto Freire, a Congressman for the Brazilian Communist Party. **********Brazil has not had an agreement with the fund since early 1989. A new accord could involve the disbursement of up to $2 billion in low-interest loans to Brazil over 18 months. But the true significance of an accord is that it signals private bankers that Brazil's finances are in order.  Talks on $52 Billion in Debt **********Next month, talks are to start in New York over rescheduling Brazil's $52 billion medium- and long-term foreign debt. Without an I.M.F. accord, there is little chance that the bankers will sign an agreement. **********In constrast, Argentina's Central Bank president, Roque Fernandez, announced today that the fund is to approve a $1 billion standby loan to Argentina on Monday. **********Brazil's progress on debt talks -- and Mr. Collor's position -- will no doubt be of considerable interest to an American business mission scheduled to arrive in Brasilia in two weeks, led by Vice President Dan Quayle and by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher. **********In recent days, Mr. Collor has openly expressed frustration with a perceived lack of support from the developed world.

As long as the advancing armies control the ground and the air along the lines of attack, their logistical trains will be relatively safe. **********But paradoxically, the success of the attack so far has probably strained the logistical system, since the rapid advance implies that large quantities of fuel have to be delivered over longer distances than expected.  Advance Ahead of Schedule **********The allied commander has reportedly told his troops to accelerate their pace today, and other senior officers told reporters that the advance was moving ahead of schedule. That means supplies are being used up faster than scheduled. **********To deliver the fuel, tanker trucks must scurry across the desert and transport aircraft must drop off bladders of fuel. **********Special mobile pumping equipment, designed so that many vehicles can simultaneously replenish themselves, allows units to pull in and quickly get back into combat. **********Eventually, pipelines may even be laid to speed the flow of fuel and to free trucks and aircraft for carrying ammunition instead. **********The problem of logistics is nothing new.

Norman Schwarzkopf, the allied commander, surely knows what happened to the World War II allies after their breakthrough in France after the invasion of Normandy. One hundred days after D-day, the advance was 200 days ahead of the schedule that logistical planners had provided for. The advance bogged down when it ran too far ahead of its supply train. **********In and around Kuwait, the distances are shorter, the armies smaller and the advance swifter. Even so, without plentiful fuel, General Schwarzkopf's forces would lose their freedom to maneuver across the desert, which is rich in crude oil but without the diesel and other refined fuels required by a modern army. **********The allies' main battle tanks, which are too big and heavy to be delivered by air, crossed the Saudi border carrying enough fuel to reach their first day's objectives deep in Iraq without refueling. They can go nearly 300 miles before refilling. But they measure their fuel consumption in gallons per mile, not the other way around, and every refill soaks up 498 gallons for their thirsty turbine engines. **********When the heavy mechanized and armored divisions begin fighting deep in enemy territory, firepower replaces maneuver in importance, and ammunition rises to the top of the cargo manifests. A multiple rocket launcher, for instance, can shoot only one volley of 12 rockets before it must load a new box of armament onto its rack. **********Finally, food and water rations will have to be delivered after about three days, and the wounded and dead will have to be shipped out. Refueling Base in Iraq **********In some cases, logistical bases may have been set up in advance of the ground forces, for example the helicopter refueling base reportedly set up inside Iraq by the 101st Airborne Division. The base supports the 101st's own activities and could be used as a forward gas station and ammunition dump for armored units approaching overland from the south. **********But most combat units that enter Iraq or Kuwait must set up their own staging areas, usually only after the assault has already moved safely past.

A 500-man mechanized battalion, for instance, has 12 heavy trucks attached to it. They shuttle back and forth to fuel and ammunition depots 15 miles or so behind the main battle lines. **********The battalion's depots would be supplied from larger ones established by the brigade commander farther back, and he would get the brigade's supplies from the division's stocks, fed in turn from the corps's supplies back in the rear areas.

Gorbachev today to provide concrete assurances of political and economic reform when he approaches Western leaders for assistance later this month. **********The Soviet President, for his part, pointed to the strife in Yugoslavia \"as a lesson and a warning\" that his commitment to a united and renewed Soviet Union was the only path. Serving up a graphic illustration of the problem facing Mr. Gorbachev, groups of Ukrainian nationalists waved protest banners at the airport and in Kiev, capital of the Soviet Ukraine. **********Mr. Kohl and Mr. Gorbachev made their comments at a news conference after holding their first meeting since the reunification of Germany in October. It was probably the last meeting Mr. Gorbachev will hold with a major Western leader before seven industrial powers meet in London, where their leaders are expected to discuss aid to the Soviet Union and then hear Mr. Gorbachev. Luxurious Setting **********At the news conference, held after almost five hours of talks at a luxurious Soviet Government estate outside Kiev, neither leader gave any indication that they had reached specific agreements. **********Their meeting, rather, appeared to have been a strategy session at which Mr. Kohl pledged to press Mr. Gorbachev's case in London, and at the same time sought to impress on the Soviet leader that his chances of aid depended on solid evidence of reform. **********\"I would like to make clear to all citizens of the Soviet Union, without interfering in the internal affairs of your country, that the success of reforms in your country is not only in the interests of the Soviet population, but in the interests of all Europeans, and especially my compatriots,\" Mr. Kohl said. **********Mr. Gorbachev has reportedly been working on a presentation for London, and his Government has rushed through Parliament several laws speeding foreign investment. But negotiation on a new union treaty, one among the republics, are the keystone to any meaningful reform. This has been far slower than Mr. Gorbachev had hoped. The Ukrainian legislature, for one, has put off any further consideration of the treaty until fall. **********Mr. Kohl took pains to express his support for the beleaguered Soviet President, declaring that the Germans -- and he personally -- were conscious of their debt to Mr. Gorbachev for enabling the two Germanys to unify. \"I simply do not intend to forget this,\" the Chancellor said. **********\"Together with colleagues, I will speak out in London in favor of providing joint assistance in the process of reform and openness within our possibilities and strengths,\" Mr. Kohl said, adding that he intended to press the case by telephone before the summit meeting. But the German leader gave only vague answers to questions of what might emerge from the summit. **********Mr. Gorbachev similarly argued that Soviet national renewal was criticial for the world, and he seized on a question about events in Yugoslavia to give an impassioned defense of his position. **********\"I think what is happening and what we are suffering through in Yugoslavia must force us all to think again and to understand that we must stay the path of renewal, and not disintegration,\" he said. **********\"I will not step from this road under any pressure.\"  Kohl Prefers Rural Informality **********The two leaders' meeting today took place at Mezhigorye, amid sculptured gardens and forests on the bank of the Dnieper River where the Communist Party chief of the Ukraine used to live. The site was in keeping with Mr. Kohl's preference for meetings outside capital cities, where protocol can be replaced by the chumminess he favors. **********The schedule included a stroll through the woods, and the news conference was held on a lawn. The two men, who have formed a reasonably close relationship in several meetings over the last two years, exchanged quips and generally seemed optimistic as they walked to their news briefing. **********The choice of the Ukrainian capital, however, prompted some protests from Ukrainian legislators, who argued that the President had not consulted with them beforehand, thereby demonstrating a disdain for their claim of sovereignty. Demonstrators from the Rukh nationalist organization heckled the motorcade in Kiev, with one banner reading \"Gorbachev, get out of the Ukraine.\" **********Mr. Gorbachev, nonetheless, took advantage of the visit to hold separate talks with Leonid M. Kravchuk, the president of the Ukrainian Parliament, and other Ukrainian leaders. He also arranged for Mr. Kohl to meet separately with the Ukrainians. \"We have to show that we, too, can exploit foreign labor,\" he quipped.  Matter of Troop Withdrawal **********One issue that was said to have prominently figured in the discussions was Moscow's continuing troop withdrawal from eastern Germany. The Soviet command in Berlin announced today that it was cutting this month's scheduled withdrawal by 30 percent because of housing shortages at home. Germany is also miffed that contracts for housing projects financed by Germans have been granted to non-German firms. **********The leaders gave no indication whether they had reached any agreement on this matter. **********Germany has committed itself to $31 billion in loans, grants and credits to the Soviet Union since Mr. Gorbachev assented to unification. Much of the money has gone to provide housing and other aid for Soviet soldiers returning home. **********Asked about a possible visit by President Bush to Moscow later this month, Mr. Gorbachev said, \"I do not exclude that there will be a meeting in July.\" He said no summit date been set, but that a series of contacts with Mr. Bush had given new impetus to negotiations on a treaty cutting strategic forces by half. **********--------------------       Qualified Approval for Treaty **********MOSCOW, July 5 (Reuters) -- The Parliament of the Russian republic today approved in principle Mr. Gorbachev's battered blueprint to hold the Soviet Union together, but attached tough conditions. **********After a day of wrangling and private negotiations, the Parliament approved the proposed union treaty but called on delegates to the final talks to impose restrictions, including control of taxation and foreign trade for the republic, two areas jealously guarded by Moscow, as well as a broad demand for joint management of all other aspects of political and economic life. **********Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian President, appealed for approval of the measure, saying: \"The union treaty is an act of huge political importance, and just to reject it would mean political collapse and the destabilizaion of the country. We should bear in mind this is a negotiating process.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/12/world/us-soviet-talks-provide-few-gains.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1991-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1247, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S.-SOVIET TALKS PROVIDE FEW GAINS", "print_headline": "U.S.-SOVIET TALKS PROVIDE FEW GAINS", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Foreign Minister, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d held four and a half hours of talks today to try to wrap up the nuclear arms reduction treaty, but Mr. Baker said they had made only limited progress and certainly not enough yet to merit scheduling a Moscow summit meeting in late July. **********The two officials said that they had asked their experts to continue working on the three major outstanding issues holding up the accord and that they would meet again Friday to see if they can close the gaps. **********\"We have made progress on some of these, but we clearly have more work to do,\" Mr. Baker told reporters after today's session. \"We still have a good ways to go.\" 'Meaningful' Soviet Proposals **********Mr. Baker said Mr. Bessmertnykh had brought with him \"meaningful\" new proposals on the issues of how missiles transmit their data to earth so each side can monitor the other's tests, and on how to define new missiles that will not be covered by the treaty. **********Mr. Baker said he hoped that these Soviet proposals would pave the way for agreement in these areas once the experts have time to go over them fully. But he added that a third issue -- how many warheads should be allowed for each missile -- remained a problem. **********Both President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have made completion of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start, a condition for holding a full-scale summit meeting in Moscow this summer. Asked if enough progress had been made today to fix a summit date, Mr. Baker answered: \"We have not made that kind of progress today. There is still a lot of work to be done.\" 30 Percent Cut Is Sought **********Before opening the negotiations at the State Department, Mr. Bessmertnykh made it clear that he had come with the authority to reach the compromises necessary to finish the treaty, which will reduce the long-range nuclear missiles and bombers of the two superpowers by 30 percent. **********\"We have the position, we have the authority and we have the will to finish the job,\" he told reporters, with Mr. Baker standing at his side. **********Last weekend, President Bush asked Mr. Gorbachev to send his Foreign Minister to Washington, after lower-level Soviet negotiators in Geneva told their American counterparts that they did not have authority to respond to a series of American compromise proposals for bridging the last differences in the strategic arms treaty. **********The remaining issues holding up the treaty are highly technical, so much so that experts have to do the hard negotiating and then report to Mr. Baker and Mr. Bessmertnykh on their progress. **********\"The issues are so technical that in a certain way we are hostages of either crazy professors or some technicians,\" Mr. Bessmertnykh said. \"But we are trying to break down the technicalities of the issue and to make the decisions.\" **********One of the thorniest issues, known as data denial, involves determining how much and by what means data from missile tests are beamed back to earth, so each side can easily monitor the other's tests and insure that the other side is not developing missiles restricted by the treaty. The draft treaty establishes a ban on encoding missile test data to deny it to the other side, but because the two sides use different frequencies, power levels and techniques, they have to work out common standards. These can involve major, and costly, electronic adjustments. **********Also because the United States tests its missiles over water and is an open society, the Soviets can easily pick up its telemetry signals from offshore ships and obtain other missile data through open sources. But the Soviets test their missiles over land, which makes the data harder to obtain, and have a closed society, so they are being asked to adopt more transparent methods of data transmission. **********The other major outstanding issues involve how to define what will constitute a new missile that will not be covered by the treaty and how each side should actually go about reducing the number of nuclear warheads in each of its missiles so it comes within the treaty limits, but does not allow for too much spare capacity that could be used in the event of a war. **********Earlier in the day, Mr. Baker found broad bipartisan support in the Senate for approval of the other major arms control treaty pending with the Soviet Union -- the non-nuclear arms reduction treaty, which he and Mr. Bessmertnykh finally concluded last month. **********The Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, or C.F.E. -- which will require the Soviets to withdraw from Europe, or destroy, thousands of tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery pieces -- was signed in November. But the Administration refused to submit it for ratification to the Senate because of Soviet attempts to reinterpret the treaty in a way that would have allowed them to keep several thousand extra pieces of equipment. After seven months of wrangling, the dispute was finally resolved. **********The Secretary's appeal for treaty approval found no opponents on the committee. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat, explained why he would vote in favor, saying: \"This treaty will eliminate a fundamental cause of tension in Europe since the end of World War II -- that is, the huge numerical advantage of Soviet conventional forces. This superiority threatened the security and prosperity of the West for many years. This superiority also fueled the nuclear arms race. In every strategic doctrine adopted by NATO for 40 years, from massive retaliation to flexible response, nuclear weapons were intended to compensate for the Soviet edge in conventional arms.\" **********Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican, also argued that the treaty was so tilted to the benefit of the United States and its NATO allies that \"I predict it must pass the Senate by a large margin.\" Helms Doubts Relevance **********The only discordant note was sounded by Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican from North Carolina, who argued that the treaty was largely irrelevant, given the fact that the Warsaw Pact has been disbanded and the Soviets have already been forced to withdraw -- at rates exceeding the treaty -- from most of Eastern Europe by the pro-democracy revolutions there. **********Even Senator Helms acknowledged: \"It's true that there may be some marginal utility in the treaty. It does establish guidelines for withdrawal of Soviet troops, and it does set limits on the number of conventional arms and military vehicles that each group of the states party to the treaty may keep west of the Ural Mountains.\" **********But Senator Helms put Mr. Baker on notice that he would not be so forthcoming when the Secretary tries to win approval for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, where the issue of verification will be much more important. **********\"To put it as politely as possible, the Soviets are cheats and liars and scoundrels,\" Senator Helms said. \"They've proved that through the years. I would get angry about this treaty if it meant anything, in my judgment. But it does mean something for Start. Start, unlike C.F.E., is a treaty that matters. Start needs full scrutiny, even though it may not be possible to ratify it in time to save Mr. Gorbachev.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/31/world/summit-in-moscow-yeltsin-spurns-gorbachev-on-meeting-with-bush.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 989, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yeltsin Spurns Gorbachev on Meeting With Bush", "print_headline": "SUMMIT IN MOSCOW; Yeltsin Spurns Gorbachev on Meeting With Bush", "body_text": " **********President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic spurned President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's invitiation to take part in a summit meeting today with President Bush, saying that his republic would not be part of a \"faceless mass audience\" and was pursuing its own independent foreign policy with the United States. **********The bold move was intended not as a rebuff to President Bush, who saw Mr. Yeltsin later in a one-on-one meeting in the Kremlin, but rather as an unequivocal notice to Mr. Gorbachev that the Russian federated republic can no longer be counted on as an obedient member of the Soviet retinue, either in the domestic or the foreign arena. **********But Mr. Yeltsin also gave a tremendous lift to Mr. Gorbachev's attempt to forge a new union treaty, which the Soviet President hopes will save the crumbling union by refashioning it into a looser, federal structure. The Russian republic's President announced today that he was ready to sign the agreement after working out questions on taxation with Mr. Gorbachev at a meeting early this morning. **********Mr. Yeltsin pointed out that the same union treaty gave each of the participating republics the right to pursue its own foreign policy, as he had done today. But the dissonance between Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev today could presage future friction between the two leaders, who recently reached what appears to be a precarious peace after months of accusing each other of dictatorial ambitions.  Yeltsin Denies Campaign Plan **********Mr. Yeltsin told CNN in an interview that Mr. Gorbachev's last-minute invitation to him and to Kazakhstan's President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, to take part in expanded meetings between the American and Soviet leaders was suggestive of \"past traditions\" of discredited Soviet regimes, when republican leaders were pliant players in \"mass audiences.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin said his decision to turn down the Gorbachev invitation, which Mr. Nazarbayev accepted, should not be seen as a step toward usurping power from the Soviet President. In an effort to spare Mr. Gorbachev a \"headache,\" Mr. Yeltsin said he was eager to put to rest any rumors that he might challenge Mr. Gorbachev for the Soviet presidency in the first nationwide elections for a Soviet leader, which are expected to be held next year. **********After a 40-minute session in the Kremlin with Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Bush also stressed that his private negotiations with the Russian President were not intended to undermine the Gorbachev Government. He praised the new era of relations between the Russian republic and the United States that began with Mr. Yeltsin's visit to Washington last month after the Russian President was elected to his new post in a landslide victory. **********\"President Yeltsin's visit to the United States was a big hit and furthered not only relations and understanding between the Russian republic and the United States but also the Soviet Union and the states,\" Mr. Bush said. **********Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin told reporters that they hoped for further economic and political cooperation and they pronounced their meeting a success. **********\"I am satisfied,\" said Mr. Yeltsin. **********Mr. Bush said, \"So am I.\" **********A Western diplomat who has been kept abreast of summit-meeting plans said the American delegation was told before the opening session with Mr. Gorbachev today that Mr. Yeltsin would not attend the meeting because he wanted to emphasize that the central Government would have limited, delineated powers in any new union agreement. **********\"It was a declaration of political autonomy,\" the diplomat said. **********Perhaps more important than Mr. Yeltsin's decision to turn down the Gorbachev invitation was the compromise on the issue of taxation that Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Nazarbayev reached at a meeting that reportedly ended at 3 this morning. **********For months, the dispute over who would have the right to impose taxes in a newly configured union seemed unsolvable. Mr. Gorbachev originally wanted the central Government to keep sole control over taxation, while republic leaders were demanding that power to tax belonged to them.  Union-Treaty Talks **********Leaders from 9 of the 15 Soviet republics have been taking part in negotiations over the shape of the new union, with Georgia, Moldavia, and the three Baltic republics, Latvia, Estonian and Lithuania, refusing to take part. An Armenian delegation has started to attend the meetings but has not decided whether to support the treaty. **********Achieving a union treaty is critical to the Soviet Union's ability to attract aid from Western governments, who have said they see a redistribution of power from the center to the republics as a sign of the Gorbachev Government's commitment to change. **********Mr. Gorbachev's decision to hold union-treaty negotiations during Mr. Bush's first visit to Moscow underscores how important the success of those talks is to the Soviet President.  Social Invitation Accepted **********The tax compromise, which is expected to bolster the treaty's chances of passage, was suggested by Mr. Yeltsin, according to the independent Interfax news agency. Mr. Yeltsin proposed a system under which each republic would impose its taxes and then pay a fixed percentage to the central Government to cover national expenses, like defense, according to reports by Interfax and the Russian Information Agency. **********Though he turned down Mr. Gorbachev's working invitation, Mr. Yeltsin accepted a social invitation from the Soviet President to dine with Mr. Bush at a state dinner in the Kremlin. Mr. Yeltsin arrived late to the dinner, lingered for a long time with Mr. Bush on the receiving line and sat two seats away from Mr. Gorbachev, next to Barbara Bush. **********In a further gesture of support for Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Yeltsin told Interfax that after his early morning meeting with Mr. Gorbachev he was convinced that the Soviet President had turned away from the conservative direction took earlier this year. **********\"We, the democratic forces, are now sure that the Union President will not let us down, as he did in January, February and March of this year, and will follow the path of democratic reform,\" he told Interfax. \"So we support him.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/20/world/the-soviet-crisis-the-western-alliance-condemnation-and-a-halt-to-aid.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1991-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 532, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Condemnation And a Halt to Aid", "print_headline": "THE SOVIET CRISIS: THE WESTERN ALLIANCE; Condemnation And a Halt to Aid", "body_text": " **********Amid strong condemnations of the overthrow of President Mikhail S.

Baker 3d had already proposed them in a recent memo to Mr. Bush as a way of countering Congressional opposition to the trade decision.  Senate Leader Is Critical **********China's trading privileges, guaranteeing the lowest available tariff rates on Chinese goods, expire on July 3. Mr. Bush's action will take effect immediately unless both houses of Congress approve measures to reverse it or attach conditions. At least five measures that would do so are pending. **********A measure of the Congressional displeasure likely to develop was quickly evident. The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, attending a parade in Maine, his home state, called the proposed sanctions a \"joke,\" and pledged to \"make every effort to reverse this mistaken policy put forward by the Administration.\" **********Most-favored-nation status is not normally granted to Communist countries considered in violation of human rights.

His announcement on trade with China drew hisses and boos, as well as some applause. **********Keenly aware of the growing political opposition, Mr. Bush sought to present his policy on China as a measured mixture of engagement and sanctions. Trying to draw a historic line between his policy and past American actions like the defiance of the Berlin blockade and the institution of the Marshall Plan, he said: **********\"This nation's foreign policy has always been more than simply an expression of American interests. It is an extension of American ideals. This moral dimension of American policy requires us to remain active, engaged in the world. Many times, that means trying to chart a moral course through a world of lesser evils. That's the real world, not black and white. Very few moral absolutes.\" **********Addressing his critics, Mr. Bush said he would hold China to the strictest human rights standards and spoke of sanctions that he imposed against China after the violence in Tiananmen Square and the nationwide crackdown on political activity in 1989. **********The White House said Mr. Bush ordered three measures to limit the export of missile and satellite technology to China: ***********Licenses will be refused to companies that have applied to sell China 20 high-speed computers, valued at $30 million, that can be used for missile flight testing. ***********As long as the United States is not satisfied that China is abiding by inernational regulations restricting the flow of ballistic missile and nuclear technology, licenses will not be granted to American companies seeking to take part in seven proposed satellite launches by China.

China this year is expected to have the second biggest trading surplus with the United States after Japan. **********The disagreement on the issue, which does not closely follow party lines, covers views ranging from the tactical argument of carrot and stick to the moral argument of whether China should receive a benefit denied the Soviet Union, which is liberalizing human rights policies. **********The most-favored-nation designation needs to be renewed each year, a process requiring that the President certify that China is in compliance with the Jackson-Vanik amendment, a measure denying favored-nation status to countries denying free emigration. **********The President's contention that China can be induced by trade and other contacts to make accommodations on human rights, weapons proliferation and religious freedom is disputed by many Democrats and some Republicans. The critics find no appreciable shift so far and say it is also morally wrong for China to enjoy privileges denied the Soviet Union. **********\"We don't want to reward them for behavior we find evil\" and which may be getting worse, Senator Moynihan declared."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/28/world/war-in-the-gulf-canada-canadians-enter-gulf-war-sparking-debate.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1991-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 541, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: Canada; Canadians Enter Gulf War, Sparking Debate", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: Canada; Canadians Enter Gulf War, Sparking Debate", "body_text": " **********Canadian forces went to war last week against Iraq, and although their role has been modest, the commitment to offensive action has stirred considerable debate here. **********Flying from their base in Qatar, four Canadian CF-18 fighters flew air cover for United States Air Force F-15E fighter-bombers.

With three naval ships and 26 CF-18's, ground-based versions of the F-18 Hornet fighters flown by the U.S. Navy, Canada has deployed about 1,900 members of the armed services.

This leaves Citibank as virtually the only American money center institution with a large, sustained overseas presence. **********At the same time, while American banks shrink their international operations, their foreign competitors in Europe and Japan are preparing to expand both at home -- within their newly deregulated national and regional environments -- and abroad. These banks continue to expand even at a time when conditions in the world's stock and lending markets are difficult. **********In 1992, for example, European Community banks will be equipped with what is called the \"single passport\" that will enable them to pursue universal commercial, investment and insurance business anywhere in the community. And in Japan, where the laws already allow banks and industrial companies to hold each others' stock -- a practice barred in the United States since 1956 -- the Ministry of Finance has announced its intention to allow banks and securities firms to enter each other's fields. These domestic and regional reforms will give foreign banks added strength to compete. **********But while European and Japanese institutions are positioning themselves to increase their overseas commitments, American banks have redirected their strategy and presence almost entirely toward the domestic front. For these banks, opportunity is seen as Washington's moves to reverse the Depression-era Glass-Steagall and McFadden Acts limiting a bank's participation in the equity markets and in expanding across state lines. **********The outright repeal of these statutory restrictions by Congress will happen, but probably not this year. That is because Congress still fears that deregulation might lead to another crisis like the one that brought down the savings and loan institutions. Nevertheless, when these statutes and regulations are revamped, probably by mid-decade, the international flight of American banks will have placed them at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis their more internationally minded and stronger foreign rivals. As a result, in the near term it is the large foreign banks with big American presences that will benefit most from any regulatory changes here. They will be able to apply the experience they gained internationally to compete in the United States. **********A study earlier this year by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, noted that despite the growth possibilities presented by Europe's 1992 program, American banking institutions continue to eliminate capacity in Europe. According to the G.A.O., many executives attribute this withdrawal to their inability to perform both debt-and-equity functions under the straitjacket of Glass-Steagall and the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation K statutes. These statutes set strict ceilings on the securities trading and underwriting functions of American banks operating outside United States jurisdiction. European banking institutions do not operate under these restrictions. **********Just this month, responding in part to the G.A.O.'s findings, the Congressional Task Force on American Bank Competitiveness, chaired by Representative John LaFalce, Democrat of New York, released a report calling for \"reassessment and adjustment\" of the American financial services structure to parallel more closely the norm in other developed countries. The report said that \"inherent system inefficiencies\" prohibiting product line and geographic diversification have resulted in the loss of international business and influence.\" **********The LaFalce report echoed the views of key Washington policy makers, including Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, that the present American bank regime is untenable. **********But repealing or revamping Glass-Steagall, the McFadden Act and Regulation K, will not be enough to save our banks from intense foreign competition if they continue to shut their overseas operations. If we follow today's trends into the future, by the mid-1900's the vast majority of industrial nations will maintain common standards of banking practice as well as rules for supervision. **********In that environment, the strongest, most internationally minded banks will be the most competitive. What that means for America's banks is that along with banking reform, they must reform their strategic vision and return to international competition."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/31/business/world-markets-dollar-s-gains-upset-the-exchanges.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1991-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 874, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Markets; Dollar's Gains Upset the Exchanges", "print_headline": "World Markets; Dollar's Gains Upset the Exchanges", "body_text": " **********Oh, how the dollar has hurt Americans with investments abroad this year.

But until seven weeks ago they hadn't a worry about losing money when converting profits into dollars. **********The dollar hit its post-World War II lows against the German mark and Swiss franc and its 1991 lows against other major currencies in mid-February. But it has since jumped 17.3 percent against the mark, 15.9 percent again the lira, 16.6 percent against the French franc and 14.6 percent against the British pound. **********The gains of American investors are now being gobbled up by unfavorable exchange rates. The 28.5 percent gain in the Swedish market is cut to 17.2 percent when profits are converted into dollars. In Spain, the 26.5 percent rise is reduced to 14.2 percent. In Italy, the 12.6 percent rise is reduced to 0.66 percent. In Britain, the 15.4 percent jump is slashed to 4.6 percent, while in Germany, the 7.7 percent spurt falls to a 5.2 percent loss. **********Despite the dollar's move, some investment managers are not making major changes in their portfolios. Some of them had already expected the dollar to rise moderately this year -- even to its current levels -- but just not this quickly. **********And while there will be a loss on exchange when profits are brought back home, the higher dollar will be a benefit for many European companies that either export to the United states or have large operations here. The stronger dollar will make European exports more competitive here and the dollar earnings in the United States will grow when translated back into marks, pounds, francs, lire and guilders. **********\"What we have been doing is placing emphasis on companies that are more export- oriented,\" said Sander Cseh of Cseh International in Philadelphia. For example, he likes Hunter Douglas of the Netherlands, a manufacturer of blinds and other window coverings with major business in the United States. But he has not \"bet the ranch\" on these prospects because he is not sure of how high and how long the dollar will rally. **********Some forecasters predict that it will rise to 1.80 against the mark by the end of the year, 6 percent above where it is now. Some say it will drift even higher. **********Nicholas Sargen, a director of international bond trading at Salomon Brothers in New York, thinks the dollar might peak at 1.80 marks, but is likely to fall below that level before the end of the year. He is not expecting a higher rise in part because of the impact of capital flows. For the dollar to continue to rise this year, he says, a significant amount of foreign capital would have to flow into the United States. He does not anticipate that happening. **********Traditionally, interest rates have been a key determinant of exchange rates. A country with higher interest rates than another usually has a stronger currency, other factors being equal, because the higher return attracts investors. **********But the movement of capital from country to country has become a much bigger factor,and can often overwhelm the interest rate factor. **********New data for the fourth quarter of 1990, Mr. Sargen said, showed that there was a net inflow of foreign capital into Germany of $18.7 billion. This surge, he said, helps explain the jump in the value of the mark near the end of the year, when it reached new highs against the dollar. The $18.7 billion inflow was even greater than the $16.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 1989, when money was flowing to Germany on the euphoric wave from the fall of the Berlin Wall and the opening of Eastern Europe. **********Although he does not yet have the data, Mr. Sargen now suspects that the flow of capital, mostly into German bonds, continued in the first part of this year, which helped bring the mark to its post-World War II record high against the dollar in mid-February. **********But he said those investors have been sent scurrying by the renewed focus on German political and economic problems since the end of the Persian Gulf war and the diminished fears that there would be a devaluation in the European Monetary System. That capital drain helped bring down the mark -- and push the dollar up -- quicky, adding to the momentum from the interest rate changes also now expected to favor the United States. **********The impact of capital flows to the United States can also explain the fall of the dollar in 1990. The total flow of capital shifted to a net outflow of $27 billion, compared with a net inflow of $88 billion in 1989. **********Mr. Sargen does expect there to be a reversal in 1991. But he does not think the United States bond market will be attractive enough to bring back the flows of capital that marked 1988 and 1989. \"My story,\" he said, \"is that the pendulum of captial flows that hurt the dollar last year will start to shift back. But there is no way we will get back to the good old days of the late 1980's.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/28/world/mandela-calls-west-europe-racist-on-sanctions.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1991-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 641, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mandela Calls West Europe Racist on Sanctions", "print_headline": "Mandela Calls West Europe Racist on Sanctions", "body_text": " **********Nelson Mandela today accused the European Community of racism over its lifting of sanctions against South Africa this month against the wishes of his organization, the African National Congress. **********\"This decision also once again shows clearly how Europe allies itself with white South Africa and has no regards for the lives, the views and the needs of black South Africa,\" the anti-apartheid leader said in a speech prepared for delivery at a conference of the National Union of Mine Workers, a black union that has supported the congress's call to maintain sanctions. **********On April 15, the nations of the European Community lifted sanctions imposed in 1986 that banned imports of South African iron, steel and gold coins.

Mr. Nzo said such a conference should be under broader sponsorship of anti-apartheid organizations.  Assassination Plans Charged **********The African National Congress also said it had uncovered \"massive plans\" to assassinate some of its officials and attack black communities before May 9, the deadline for its ultimatum. It blamed the plot on a \"third force\" with links to the security forces that was trying to scuttle the peace process. **********Previous incidents it mentioned included the assassination of Chief Mhlabunzima Maphumolo on Feb. 25 near Pietermaritzburg.

Freeing of Prisoners **********For its part the Congress had maintained that the abandonment of the armed struggle was to follow the freeing of all political prisoners and the return to South Africa of all political exiles. The Congress, which charged that the Government was obstructing the release and return of these people, had threatened to break off talks with the Government unless the prisoners and exiles were home by April 30. **********Both sides were reported to have made compromises today, but no details were disclosed pending approval by the Cabinet and the National Executive Committee of the Congress. **********As the Government was reporting but not detailing the progress it was making in the talks with Mr. Mandela in Cape Town, its prosecution of Winnie Mandela, his wife, on kidnapping and assault charges in Johannesburg encountered new difficulty after two prosecution witnesses balked at testifying against her. Disappearance of Witness **********The prosecution reported that the two witnesses had been frightened by the disappearance Sunday of a third main witness. However, Jan Swanepoel, the lead prosecutor, reported this afternoon that one of the reluctant witnesses, Kenneth Kgase, had given an assurance that he would appear in court tomorrow. **********Mr. Mandela, the deputy president of the Congress, had attended the first two days of his wife's trial in a show of support. He has accused the Government of harrassing her. **********Mrs. Mandela and three co-defendants are being tried on four counts of kidnapping and four counts of assault with intent to commit grievous bodily harm in connection with the abduction of four young men to her Soweto home on Dec. 29, 1988. **********The youngest youth, James (Stompie) Moeketsi Seipei, was later found with his throat cut in an open field. Mrs. Mandela's chief bodyguard, Jerry Richardson, was convicted last year of murdering the 14-year-old boy.

The Government planned to call them to repeat their testimony at this trial. **********On Monday, Mr. Swanepoel, the Deputy Attorney General of the Witwatersrand, told the judge, Justice M. S.

William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Robert L. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, told Congress that there was strong evidence that the economy's problems, particularly in New England, had only begun. **********\"Almost everything we're seeing in unscientific samples shows we're not seeing any improvement and we might see some further decline,\" Mr. Seidman told the Senate Banking Committee. \"I am not prepared to say that the economy has bottomed out.\"  What Kind of Recession **********Mr. Seidman said there would be more large failures if the recession was more than \"short and shallow.\" Mr. Seidman defined such a recession as one in which the gross national product does not decline by more than 2 percent over two quarters and the economy begins to turn around within two quarters, in this case by midyear. **********When he announced that the Bank of New England was being seized by the Government on Sunday, Mr. Seidman said he did not anticipate other large failures soon. His remarks today did not directly contradict that position because many economists expect a mild economic decline. **********As a result of the threat of large failures, Mr. Seidman said officials and industry representatives had begun exploring ways for the Government to intervene before institutions face the brink of collapse, but he did not describe any specific measures. **********The fund that protects bank deposits is at its lowest level since its creation during the Depression, and is expected to lose $5 billion this year from failures, leaving it with $4 billion by the end of 1991. **********Regulators have based their estimates of the losses to the Federal fund that insures bank deposits on a forecast of a mild recession. **********Mr. Seidman said he still did not expect a Government bailout of the fund, which is financed by a levy on the industry, but he appeared to be considerably less optimistic than he was late last year. **********\"It's not beyond the realm of possibility that taxpayer money will be needed,\" he said. **********\"Clearly the banking industry is under stress,\" he said. \"It is not, however, in a situation like the Great Depression or anything like that magnitude.\" **********The Bush Administration is preparing to present soon to Congress a package of proposals to overhaul the nation's banking system and the program that insures deposits. Despite the consensus on Capitol Hill that the support given Bank of New England would slow the drive to limit deposit insurance, which currently covers all accounts up to $100,000, Administration officials are preparing to reducecoverage so that it does not fully protect larger institutions, like pension funds, that break down their deposits into $100,000 increments so that they can be fully insured.  Treasury Proposals **********Treasury officials also said today that they planned to go forward with one of two proposals to limit the amount of coverage sharply for individuals. While technically the coverage of each account is limited to $100,000, the current system enables families and others to obtain protection of significantly more than that by putting the funds in different names and joint accounts. **********One proposal is to limit the total coverage for each depositor to $100,000 systemwide. The other would limit the number of $100,000 accounts protected to three for a depositor. **********Officials concede that either measure would be difficult to achieve, but would probably rely on a system that uses the depositor's Social Security number. **********At a morning hearing before the Senate committee and an afternoon session before the House Banking Committee, Mr. Seidman and Mr. Clarke came under heavy questioning about the way the Government handled the collapse of the Bank of New England.  Questions of Fairness **********Lawmakers criticized the decision to protect all depositors, including the estimated $2 billion in accounts of larger than $100,000, and $55 million in foreign branches that do not contribute to the bank insurance fund. They also raised questions about the fairness of protecting all accounts at larger banks, like Bank of New England, but not smaller ones, like Freedom National Bank, the minority-owned institution in Harlem that was seized by the Government in November. **********Mr. Seidman conceded that the current system was fundamentally unfair, but said he could do little without changes in the law. He said Freedom had failed to meet current standards, which require that its existence was essential to the community it served, and that it was cheaper to close it than to save all of its depositors. In the case of the Bank of New England, he said, a failure to protect all deposits would have further destabilized the area's economy. **********Mr. Clarke said the losses from the Bank of New England to the insurance fund \"may well have been reduced\" because the Government waited more than a year after the bank's difficulties began to appear to declare the institution insolvent. He said the decision to approve a new management team at the bank early last year had made it possible for the bank to sell many of its assets and reduce its overhead more efficiently than the Government might have done."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/09/business/market-place-dirks-is-back-with-a-hot-stock.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1991-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1229, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dirks Is Back, With A Hot Stock", "print_headline": "MARKET PLACE; Dirks Is Back, With A Hot Stock", "body_text": " **********Ray Dirks has twice become famous on Wall Street. First he uncovered an insurance company fraud. Then he ran a brokerage firm that went bankrupt after underwriting a series of offerings that in his words \"went down the tubes.\" **********Now the 57-year-old Mr. Dirks is back, promoting a hot insurance stock and promising that this time the quality of the companies he endorses will be higher than in the past. **********\"If we do a deal now, we have to look for sales and earnings,\" Mr. Dirks said yesterday in an interview at Baird, Patrick & Company, where he now runs a division. **********Mr. Dirks's fame began in 1973 after he learned that the Equity Funding Corporation, then a hot insurance stock, had issued fradulent financial statements, and told his clients. That set off his first dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which he says has a vendetta against him. The 'Short Busters Club' **********Mr. Dirks has been at Baird, Patrick since 1986, but it was only this year that the firm began promoting \"Ray Dirks Research,\" which has focused both on insurance stocks, his longtime specialty, and on a \"Short Busters Club,\" which recommends stocks that have been heavily sold by short-sellers betting the price will fall. **********Mr. Dirks now seems to have a great success in Conseco, an insurance company based in Carmel, Ind., which was heavily shorted earlier this year. That stock has zoomed in recent weeks, with Mr. Dirks as its greatest supporter on Wall Street. **********Yesterday morning, as Conseco reported quarterly profits, Mr. Dirks was ecstatic. \"Two dollars versus $1.01,\" he said, referring to the company's operating earnings per share. \"That's it. The shorts can forget it.\" **********As brokers gathered around Mr. Dirks, he told them to call as many clients as they could to recommend the stock. \"It's a buy into the $80's, and maybe the $90's,\" he said. Conseco shares opened higher in New York Stock Exchange trading, but then weakened and ended the day at $72.50, down $2.375. Still, that was not bad for a company whose shares traded at $17 last October, and were at $55 at the end of March, when the \"Short Busters Club\" included it in a list of heavily shorted stocks worth buying. **********The argument for buying stocks that have been shorted is that the short-sellers, who borrow stocks and then sell them, must eventually buy them back. Thus there is guaranteed buying power. **********That works if the buyer knows more about the company's fundamentals, or about the market's psychology, than the short-seller. But even heavily shorted stocks can keep going down. Another insurance company that Mr. Dirks put on his \"short busters\" list of buy recommendations was First Capital Holdings, which in March was selling at $3 a share. Now, with a failure seen as possible, the shares trade around half that level. \"We've got a disaster there,\" Mr. Dirks said. \"You can't win them all.\" **********One that Mr. Dirks did win came in the Supreme Court, when the S.E.C.'s censure of Mr. Dirks for his role in the Equity Funding case was overturned. The Court said Mr. Dirks acted within the law in alerting his clients first and disagreed with the S.E.C.'s assertion that he had illegally passed inside information about the company. **********The Equity Funding case established Mr. Dirks's reputation, and he wrote two books. One, called \"The Great Wall Street Scandal,\" chronicled the Equity Funding case. The next, called \"Heads You Win, Tails You Win,\" was a book of conservative financial advice. Among other things, it recommended buying stocks selling below book value. **********With that reputation, in the late 1970's he effectively took over John Muir, an old-line Wall Street firm, which trumpeted \"Ray Dirks Research\" and handed out copies of his investment book. **********Muir became known for its underwriting of initial public offerings, which were generally highly speculative and far removed from the kind of investments recommended in the book. \"We did 49 I.P.O.'s,\" Mr. Dirks recalled yesterday. \"Plenty of them went down the tubes.\" One that did not, he proudly noted, was Digital Switch, now known as DSC Communications. **********At Muir, and again at Baird, Patrick, Mr. Dirks chose to place his desk in a noisy beehive of activity, not in a private office. \"I'm an action junkie,\" he explained, adding that that applied to his investment style as well. \"The 'Heads I Win' book was very sound philosophically, but it's really not my style.\" **********At Muir, \"some of the worst deals we did were in the insurance business,\" Mr. Dirks recalled. **********The S.E.C. said negligence by Mr. Dirks had contributed to the Muir failure in 1981, an accusation he denied, and suspended him for six months from being a supervisor at a brokerage firm. His appeals of that decision failed. **********After Muir, \"For a while, I got into penny stocks,\" Mr. Dirks said. \"I did several deals, and some of them were quite successful, at least for a while.\" One company, he said, saw its shares rise from 10 cents each to $2, and Mr. Dirks helped arrange a $20 million financing for the firm. \"It later went bankrupt,\" he added. **********He joined a small brokerage firm in 1984, and in 1986 went to Baird, Patrick, where his wife had worked as a broker since 1982. At Baird, he said, he has been involved in two significant underwritings, both for companies in the insurance business. Both companies, Pioneer Financial Services and Condor Services, are now trading below the offering prices. **********Condor went public in the underwriting arranged by Mr. Dirks. Based in California, it had been an insurance broker specializing in the insurance of garbage trucks. The money raised by the offering enabled it to become an insurance company as well, Mr. Dirks said, but results have been disappointing. The shares, issued two years ago at $7.50 each, closed yesterday in over-the-counter trading at $1.875. **********Mr. Dirks's support for Conseco, as a company that is likely to grow rapidly because of the popularity of the single-premium annuities it sells, and the doubts voiced by short-sellers who think the company's accounting is overly generous, were detailed in a Barron's article in February. The next day, Mr. Dirks said, S.E.C. investigators showed up at Baird, Patrick demanding to see records. Mr. Dirks said he was suspected of trading on inside information in Conseco, an idea he called \"pure baloney.\" **********An S.E.C. spokeswoman would not comment on whether there was an investigation, or on Mr. Dirks's assertion of a vendetta. Mr. Dirks said S.E.C. investigators had shown up at every firm he has worked for since the Equity Funding case, but added that they had not got in touch with him in the first five years he was at Baird, Patrick. **********Mr. Dirks said that after his penny stock days in the early 1980's, \"I started going back up in quality,\" and added that he had ambitions of making Baird, Patrick \"a full service insurance firm\" with a large institutional clientele. **********Whether he succeeds in that regard may depend in large part on whether Conseco continues to be the kind of winning stock he says he is confident it will be."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/29/world/fighting-subsides-in-somalia-s-capital.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1991-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 684, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fighting Subsides in Somalia's Capital", "print_headline": "Fighting Subsides in Somalia's Capital", "body_text": " **********Fighting subsided in Mogadishu today after rebels took the war-ruined Somali capital and forced President Mohammed Siad Barre to flee. **********The airport, where Mr. Siad Barre maintained a well-fortified bunker, was the last important point to fall to the rebels of the United Somali Congress, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported today. The deposed president and top aides were reported to have fled in a convoy of more than 40 vehicles, some of them tanks, the BBC said. **********A spokesman for the Somali Congress in Nairobi, Ali Mohammed Hirabe, said the group was preparing to form a \"a broad-based democratic government.\" Other opposition forces would be invited to join, he said.  Clan-Based Politics **********The three groups that are to be included in the new government, the spokesman said, were the Congress, which is drawn from the Hawiye clan from the center of the country; the Somali National Movement, based on the Isaak clan from the north, and the Somali Patriotic Movement, whose members are Ogadenis from the south. **********But the other major rebel groups are also based on clans, and there is come question about how they can work together for the government of \"national reconciliation\" that the Somali Congress is calling for, experts on Somalia said. **********Mr. Siad Barre \"will be remembered for destroying his country both economically and politically and for fragmenting Somalia's clans, a terrible legacy for the people who come after him,\" said Professor I. M. Lewis, a historian who specializes on Somalia at the London School of Economics. **********Mr. Siad Barre favored his own small Marehan clan in all appointments and in his final years singled out members of other major clans for brutal killings.  Kenya Offers Safe Passage **********Kenyan authorities said today that Mr. Siad Barre was reported to be in the southern Somali town of Kismayu, about 100 miles from Kenya. The Kenyan Foreign Ministry, which has maintained testy relations with Mr. Siad Barre during his 21 years of autocratic rule, said that Mr. Siad Barre would be accorded safe passage if he turned up at the Kenyan border. Senior members of Mr. Siad Barre's Government have already taken refuge in Kenya in the past weeks. **********There was speculation in Nairobi that Mr. Siad Barre, who is said to be about 82, might try to reach Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, where his family landed soon after the fighting consumed Mogadishu a month ago. **********The only independent contact between Mogadishu and the outside world during the turmoil of the last few days has come by radio telephone from a team of doctors with the French humanitarian agency, Doctors Without Borders. Accompanying them are a British environmentalist and pilot, Murray Watson, and a journalist, Stephen Smith, with the French newspaper, Liberation. **********One of the French doctors who returned from Mogadishu to Kenya Sunday said some two-thirds of Mogadishu's approximately one million inhabitants had fled during the fighting. The doctor, Dr. Gastellu Etchegorry, said civilians were reaching his group's makeshift hospital with bullet or shell-fragment wounds. \"The hospital floor is awash with blood,\" he said.  A Switch of Clients **********In the late 1970's, when the Soviet Union and the United States competed in Africa for clients, the two superpowers switched allegiances in the Horn of Africa. Washington picked up Somalia, a Muslim country with about six million people, from the Soviets after Moscow backed the Marxist revolution in Ethiopia, previously friendly to Washington. **********Under pressure from Congress, which cited Mr. Siad Barre's retaliation against civilians belonging to clans other than his own, Washington has reduced military and economic aid to Somalia to virtually zero over the last two years. **********But the legacy of the arms donations by the two superpowers, as well as from Italy, the former colonial power, allowed the fighting in Somalia to reach great intensity in the past two years, culminating in the battle for Mogadishu this month. Civilians were able to buy rifles and mortars in the markets of the city. And in the days before Mr. Siad Barre fled, Dr. Ethchegorry said, the president's forces had been \"indiscriminately shelling the city, killing thousands of people.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/07/business/mattel-s-net-rises-51.5.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mattel's Net Rises 51.5%", "print_headline": "Mattel's Net Rises 51.5%", "body_text": " **********Mattel Inc., the nation's largest toy maker, said today that its fourth-quarter earnings increased 51.5 percent, to $14.7 million, or 29 cents a share, from $9.7 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier.

The agreement set guidelines for an international peace conference that would be attended by a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. Yitzhak Shamir, who was then and is now Prime Minister, was furious when he learned of the secret accord and blocked it in the Israeli Cabinet. **********The King mentioned the possibility of reviving peace talks along the lines of the London agreement, if Palestinians agreed to this proposal, in a recent meeting with Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's Foreign Minister, the official said. Mr. Genscher discussed the suggestion with the Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak, in Cairo, and with Mr. Peres in Israel in mid-February.  A Signal From Jordan **********Arab and American officials said they viewed this and other signals from King Hussein as consistent with his effort to repair the diplomatic and economic damage resulting from the coalition view that he sided with Iraq in the Persian Gulf war. The King, they said, was apparently trying to shore up his own position by stressing that he is still committed to and capable of helping the Palestinians achieve what he called in a speech on Friday \"their national rights on their national soil.\" **********Some Arab analysts have begun to argue that King Hussein could conceivably emerge in a strong position from the gulf war. President Hussein, his powerful neighbor, has been destroyed, Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, is widely viewed as discredited, and the Americans are likely to refocus on finding a solution to the Palestinian problem that plagues his country as well as Israel. \"The U.S. and Arab allies may well conclude that he is the best they can do in the region and that he must be shored up,\" one Saudi analyst said. **********An Israeli official said that Mr. Peres and King Hussein have previously had more than 100 hours of private meetings. Jordanian officials, who have long said that Palestinians must decide who should represent them, have always denied that direct contactswith Israelis have taken place. Mr. Peres, in Israel, denied the first report of such a signal from King Hussein, which appeared a few days ago in the Israeli newspaper Maariv. But a senior Israeli official, familiar with previous discussions between the King and Mr. Peres, insisted that the report was accurate.

Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, who visited Amman last week, said senior Jordanian officials expressed interest in resuming the effort to put together a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation that could negotiate with Israel. That effort failed because, among other reasons, Israel insisted that no members of the P.L.O. be part of the delegation. \"I had the strong impression in Amman that King Hussein is willing to play an active and prominent role to deal with the Palestinian problem if the Palestinians in his country are willing to let him do that,\" Mr. Solarz said. **********President Bush recently characterized past relations with Jordan as \"very pleasant,\" adding, \"I have no personal animosity towards His Majesty the King.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/09/world/soviet-miners-vote-an-end-to-9-week-strike.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 215, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Miners Vote an End to 9-Week Strike", "print_headline": "Soviet Miners Vote an End to 9-Week Strike", "body_text": " **********Soviet coal miners have voted to end a devastating nine-week old strike, averting a clash with President Mikhail Gorbachev and opening the way for radical reforms in the industry. **********The Soviet news agency Tass said the central strike committee in the Kuznetsk caol basin in central Siberia, the largest in the country, voted today to suspend the strike effective Friday.

Prime Minister to Resign **********Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, a Social Democrat, said he would resign on Monday. But it was unclear tonight whether all five of the non-Socialist parties would be willing to cooperate with each other, which would be necessary if they are to form a new government. The Social Democrats have led Sweden since 1982 and have been in power for more than five of the last six decades. **********Indeed, about the only thing certain tonight was that Sweden will not have a strong government. While Swedish voters apparently know what they do not want -- what they have come to consider a suffocating welfare state that costs too much and exerts too much influence over their lives -- the election results indicate that it is not clear what they want to replace it. **********Carl Bildt, the 42-year-old leader of the Moderates, said he would try to form a new government, but he predicted it might take three weeks. **********The Moderates received more than a fifth of the votes, making them the largest non-Socialist party. **********Calling the election a \"historic defeat for the left,\" Mr. Bildt said: \"It's a very strong mandate for change.\" Still, he admitted to being worried about a fragmented Parliament. **********The Social Democrats, the architects of the Swedish welfare state, got only about 38 percent of the vote. That was their worst performance since 1928. Size of Tax Burden **********All five non-Socialist parties have either vowed to cut taxes or at least intimated they would go along with some reductions. Last year taxes equaled 57.7 percent of Sweden's gross national product, the highest in the West. **********They have also promised to roll back the public sector and heed Swedes' requests for more personal choice by opening up social services like health care and child care to more competition from the private sector. But one of the five, New Democracy, which was formed only last February, wants to make much deeper tax cuts and to dismantle the welfare state. **********The four center-right parties -- the Moderate, Liberal, Center and Christian Democratic parties -- have been willing to form a coalition government. But they appear to be 5 or 6 short of the 175 seats in Parliament they need to do so. And it was unclear tonight whether they would be willing to strike a deal with New Democracy, which will have about 24 legislative seats. **********In another sign of discontent, the Christian Democrats, who are not currently represented in Parliament, did well. Preaching Christian family values, they blamed the Social Democrats for everything from rising crime to the high number of divorces and single-parent families. Together the Christian Democrats and New Democracy got about 14 percent of the vote. **********During the campaign, the Liberals vowed not to go along with a government that included or depended on the support of New Democracy. Tonight, however, Bengt Westerberg, the Liberal leader, seemed to soften his tone. \"I'm not saying I won't take part, but a four-party government dependent on New Democracy wouldn't be a good government,\" he said. **********In all but 9 of their 53 years in power, the Social Democrats have had a minority in Parliament and have relied on support from other parties. But given the poor performance of the most likely allies -- the Left Party, as the Communists are now called, and the Greens -- that seems improbable this time. **********In a campaign strategy that did not work, the Social Democrats portrayed themselves as the party that would defend the welfare state. The Swedish 'Third Way' **********Over the last six decades, the Social Democrats built what they called the third way between the capitalism and Communism. Its hallmarks have been neutrality, free trade, centralized bargaining, relatively low corporate taxes, a high level of cradle-to-grave benefits for everyone and high personal taxes. **********This model has given Swedes one of the highest standards of living in the world and some mighty multinational corporations. But the public sector grew increasingly bureaucratic and inefficient, and the nation turned away from neutrality toward membership in the European Community, which has been applied for. **********In recent years, the country has been battered by high inflation, anemic economic growth, fleeing business investment and rampant worker turnover and absenteeism, which crippled companies and social services. **********Swedes have had to wait for years for cataract and other operations, and some have died awaiting heart bypass surgery. There have also been shortages of places in public old-age homes and day-care centers. **********The Social Democrats tried to deal with these problems by cutting the highest income tax rate but raising other taxes; raising interest rates; clamping down on public spending and cutting sick pay. **********Although absenteeism and turnover rates have dropped and inflation fell to zero from 10.4 percent last year, these steps angered traditional supporters like blue-collar workers. Moreover, the overall tax burden has not changed, and interest rates, while dropping, are still high. The economy is expected to show no growth in 1991 and 1992. And some economists predict unemployment will rise in the next year or so to as much as 5 percent, the highest level since the 1930's. **********\"Now it's the Moderates turn,\" Mr. Carlsson said.

But in making detailed rules on acceptable clothing, hair styles and jewelry, among other things, part of its terms of employment, the company finds itself caught in a legal and cultural dispute. A Court Is Investigating **********The controversy has risen above the usual labor squabble as critics in the press, at universities and elsewhere have joined in asking how brash Americans could be so insensitive to French culture, individualism and privacy. Most of the critics, and many people on the street, seem amazed, if not amused, that Disney found it necessary to put such a subjective and personal hygiene code in writing, and to make its violation a firing offense for everyone from the actors portraying Mickey and Minnie who greet visitors to the chambermaids cleaning hotel rooms. **********Disney executives say the planned April 12 opening of the $4.2 billion complex in Marne-la-Vallee, 20 miles east of Paris, is unlikely to be delayed by the conflict, which is being investigated by a district court. But they insist that any ruling that bars them from imposing squeaky-clean employment standards could threaten the image and long-term success of the park. **********\"For us, the appearance code has a great effect from a product-identification standpoint,\" said Thor Degelmann, vice president for human resources for Euro Disneyland, which has its headquarters in Noisy-le- Grand. Mr. Degelmann, an American from Los Angeles, is in charge of hiring for the theme park. **********\"Without it, we wouldn't be presenting the Disney product that people would be expecting,\" he added. \"It would be like going to see a production of 'Hamlet' in which everyone looked different than you expected. Would you ever go again?\" **********The rules, spelled out in a video presentation for job applicants and detailed in a guidebook, \"Le Euro Disneyland Look,\" go way beyond height and weight standards. They require men's hair to be cut above the collar and ears, with no beards or mustaches. Any tattoos must be covered. **********Women must keep their hair in one \"natural color\" with no frosting or streaking, and they may make only \"limited use\" of makeup like mascara. False eyelashes, eyeliner and eyebrow pencil are completely off limits. Fingernails can't pass the ends of the fingers. **********As for jewelry, women can wear only one earring in each ear, with the earring's diameter no more than 2 centimeters (about three-quarters of an inch). Neither men nor women can wear more than one ring on each hand. **********Further, women are required to wear \"appropriate undergarments\" and only transparent pantyhose, not black or anything with fancy designs. **********Similar rules are in force at Disney's three other amusement parks in the United States and Japan. **********Though a daily bath is not specifically mentioned in the rules, the applicants' video depicts a shower scene and informs applicants that they are expected to show up for work \"fresh and clean each day.\" Communists Warn Applicants **********In the United States, some unions representing Disney employees have occasionally protested the company's strict appearance code, but with little success. **********French labor unions began protesting the regulations in September, when Euro Disneyland opened its \"casting center\" at its corporate headquarters and began interviewing thousands of applicants who responded to the company's ubiquitous ad campaign, which invited them to \"play the role of your life\" and to take a \"unique opportunity to marry work and magic.\" **********The Communist-led Confederation Generale du Travail (General Confederation of Labor) handed out leaflets in front of the center to warn applicants of the appearance code, which represented \"an attack on individual liberty,\" it contended. A more mainstream union, the Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail (C.F.T.D.) appealed to the Labor Ministry to halt what it termed Disney's violation of \"human dignity.\" A Formal Complaint **********The conflict became more serious on Dec. 2, when a Government labor inspector lodged a formal complaint against the company, prompting a preliminary investigation by the prosecutor's office that sources say is likely to lead to court action in the weeks ahead. The complaint charged that the appearance rules constituted a form of disciplinary code that applied to all employees, and should therefore, under French labor law, be included in the company's internal employment regulations instead of as an attachment to the employment contract. **********The legal nuance is important, because if the code was written into internal regulations, it would first have to win the approval of the national labor inspector's office. A Government official said it would be difficult for Disney's particular restrictions to win approval, because they appeared to have little bearing on the work of all employees. **********\"In certain cases, I could see a connection, but certainly not for 12,000 people,\" the official said. **********Robert Chabin, an official of the C.F.D.T., said \"no more than 700\" employees would be involved in theatrical work at the park -- parades, bands and the like -- and that for the other positions, the code \"cannot be justified by necessity.\" **********French law prohibits employers from restricting individual and collective liberties unless the restrictions can be justified by the nature of the task to be accomplished and are proportional to that end.  Assault on Europe Is Seen **********But beyond whatever legal prescriptions arise, it is clear that many French people feel stung by the whole episode. Roger Blancpain, a professor of labor law and president of the International Industrial Relations Association, based in Geneva, said Disney's code represented a frontal assault on French and European social standards. **********\"A certain kind of underwear?\" he asked. \"There's a limit, and that's going too far.\" **********He insisted that Euro Disneyland management \"should have been aware of the environment it was operating in and shown more sensitivity.\" **********Mr. Degelmann, however, said the company was \"well aware of the cultural differences\" between the United States and France, and as a result had \"toned down\" the wording in the restrictions from the original American version. **********He said the conflict resulted from a \"lack of understanding\" about the nature of a Disney park, and said that many other companies, particularly airlines, maintained appearance codes just as strict. \"We happened to put ours in writing,\" he added. 5 Percent Drop Out **********A generalized code, he said, was required because employees in \"backstage\" positions might be asked any given day to assume a job that would involve contact with the public, and therefore all workers needed to maintain an appearance appropriate for that possibility.  In any case, he said he knew of no one who had refused to take a job because of the rules, and he said that no more than 5 percent of the people showing up at the walk-in casting center for interviews, nearly 400 a day, had decided not to proceed after viewing the 15-minute video, which details transportation and salary as well as the appearance code. **********But Stephane Baudet, a 28-year-old trumpet player from Paris, said in an interview that he refused to audition for a job in a Disney brass band when he learned he would have to cut his ponytail, which flaps a few inches over his collar. He said he was also dissuaded by the long hours and low pay -- 6,000 francs ($1,150) a month, or about 20 percent more than the French minimum wage. **********\"Some people will turn themselves into a pumpkin to work at Euro Disneyland,\" he said. \"But not me.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/31/business/year-finance-newsmakers-1991-money-movers-caught-turbulent-times-90-s-john-s.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1991-12-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 279, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Money Movers Caught in the Turbulent Times of the 90's; John S.

If successful, the cost cutting would restore Citicorp's profit margin to a level that could absorb the continuing losses of its corporate banking business. **********So far, the financial markets have been skeptical, however, and at one point Citicorp's stock price fell to $8.50, its lowest level in 11 years.

And the dollar's run-up against the German mark has been so sharp that the Bundesbank may be forced to raise German interest rates, which could push the cost of reunification to prohibitive levels.  Two Alternative Courses **********The Fed has at least two alternative courses if it wants to stem the dollar's rise: massively dumping dollars in the foreign exchange markets along with other central banks, or if it decides against intervention, it could ease domestic interest rates again. **********\"Bringing the dollar down has to have a higher priority\" than previously, said Lawrence Chimerine, senior adviser to Data Resources Inc., the economic forecasting firm. \"I am hearing that export orders are starting to slow further, and given the debt overhang we have, the only real stimulus you are going to get from lower interest rates is in exports.\" **********In a weekly letter to clients, William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, wrote that \"since the Fed has consistently identified the trade sector as being extremely important to any recovery process in the United States, the credit authorities may now be more willing to lower interest rates to brake the dollar's upward climb\" to sustain export momentum.  Not All Are Convinced **********Not all economists are convinced that the dollar's rise will have much influence on how the Fed conducts monetary policy. **********\"Our central bank normally cares about inflation or growth, depending on where we are in the business cycle,\" said Alan Sinai, president of Boston Company Economic Advisers. \"Currency is a tangential concern. The strong dollar makes it easier for the Fed to ease if it wants to, but right now priority No. 1 is the economy.\" **********Although the predominant evidence supports the view that the economy remains in recession, analysts who have been predicting that an upturn would begin by midyear have more reason to believe in their forecast than they did a month ago.  Houses and Economic Index **********Recent reports on housing starts and sales suggest conditions in that depressed sector of the economy may have bottomed out. **********And Mr. Sinai noted that the increase of 1.1 percentage points in February's index of leading economic indicators was almost certain to be followed by another gain in March, given the run-up in stock prices, the growth in money supply and the sharp rise in consumer confidence that has occurred. Three straight months of gains in the index are almost always followed by an upturn in the economy, he said. **********Even the optimists concede that more bad news is coming. And strong dollar or no, Mr. Chimerine and others said that the Fed was not likely to ease policy further unless bond yields fell in the face of additional signs of economic weakness. **********Based on Wall Street forecasts, such signs will probably be seen this week, beginning with the March survey of the nation's purchasing managers, which is expected to be released today. Most analysts are expecting the report to show that although conditions in the manufacturing sector improved marginally from February, activity remains at a very low level.  Employment Data Due **********The most important news is not expected until Friday, however, when the Labor Department is scheduled to release March employment data. Based on recent trends in initial unemployment claims, John Lonski, a senior economist at Moody's Investors Service, projected that nonfarm payroll employment fell by 225,000 in March, following the February drop of 184,000. **********A decline of that size would almost certainly push up the unemployment rate from its current level of 6.5 percent. And some analysts said that if the report also shows little growth in hourly wages, the Fed might be tempted to respond by easing policy further. **********That view is far from uniform. **********The Fed, which lowered short-term interest rates after the last two employment reports, is not likely to move again until it sees a slowing in broad-based inflation measures like the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index. **********Analysts, who have been surprised and perplexed by the resilience of inflationary pressures in the midst of an economic downturn, expect to see an improvement in the March data, which are expected next week."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/22/world/un-says-iraq-admits-research-on-atomic-bombs.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick Tyler", "pub_date": "1991-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 663, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

The licensing agreement gave Ortho the right to sell the drug in Europe and the United States for patients other than those on kidney dialysis; Amgen retained the American dialysis market. **********Amgen received F.D.A. approval in June 1989 for kidney dialysis. In April 1990, Judge McGarr directed Ortho to buy all EPO it sells in the United States from Amgen. Ortho received F.D.A. approval in January to use EPO with the anti-viral drug AZT to treat AIDS patients. **********The damages awarded to Johnson & Johnson today reflect lost revenues from the 19 months it was delayed from entering the American market. **********Amgen also filed a motion in Federal District Court in Boston today, requesting that an order blocking Genetics Institute from selling EPO be reinstated, along with the escrow account for Genetics Institute's past shipments of the drug.

Hustlers Arrive, Too **********While about 1,100 French and European technicians have moved here with their families, overseeing the launching of 43 Ariane rockets to date, untold thousands of semiskilled contract workers, desperate job hunters and plain hustlers have rushed in as well, from Brazil, Suriname, Guyana, Colombia, Haiti and countries as far away as China. **********Despite the planners' attempts to recreate the feel of one of the many modern professional neighborhoods that ring Paris, many here say Kourou's ever-richer ethnic blend has led to a climate of deep-seated suspicions and festering jealousies that contribute to a sense of unease for all. **********\"I have lived all over the world, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and never have I been to a place where it was more difficult to feel comfortable,\" said a shop owner transplanted from France, whose husband is the representative of an electronics company. \"Here in Kourou, a city without a soul or a center, everyone detests everyone else.\" **********Ethnic division, if unsanctioned, is everywhere in evidence. Legionnaires and other French soldiers congregate in their own raucous bar, where few dark-skinned residents venture, while most other clubs here are either exclusively French or operate on an informal ethnic rotation, Brazilian one night, Creole the next. **********The population of Kourou was recently put at 14,000, but with its sprawling squatters' quarters and other makeshift neighborhoods housing clandestine residents, the city seems perhaps twice as large. **********As the French here have grown more insecure, their complaints about foreigners, blamed for everything from street-corner prostitution to a wave of armed robberies, have grown louder. Recently, graffiti slogans proclaiming the virtues of the National Front, France's far-right anti-immigration party, have begun springing up widely. **********\"This is not at all like living in France,\" said Jacques Brugerie, a municipal counsellor originally from Strasbourg who says that allowing more people to move here from neighboring countries is the only way to develop Guiana. \"There is the heat and the isolation, but most of all the incredible mixture of people. Some people get off the plane from Paris and want to go back home right away. They detest it immediately.\" **********Yves Dejean, a former Deputy Mayor of Kourou and director of logistics at the space center, says he tells newcomers from France: \"You can't have any illusions.

Strikers Block Roads **********With their grip on local government threatened, the Creoles have lately turned to making the Arianespace center itself the target of demonstrations to gain leverage for social demands ranging from greater participation in the space program to better schools and housing, playing on French fears that they will revive a sporadic quest for independence. **********For the second time in the last year, just as preparations for a recent satellite launching were entering their final phase, striking members of the Guiana Workers Union, a Creole-dominated institution, used huge trucks to block roads leading in and out of the space center. **********Milling workers, echoing opinions widely heard among Creoles, complained how the preoccupation of France with space supposedly blinded it to social problems in Guiana. \"The French come here for two or three years to make their money and go back to France,\" a striker said. \"They don't care about the Guianese people, and if it weren't for their rockets, they wouldn't care about Guiana.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/15/world/tomb-of-warlike-maya-king-found-in-guatemala.html": {"writer_name": "John Wilford", "pub_date": "1991-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1011, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tomb of Warlike Maya King Found in Guatemala", "print_headline": "Tomb of Warlike Maya King Found in Guatemala", "body_text": " **********Archeologists digging in the jungle of Guatemala have found the tomb and remains of an eighth-century ruler who they believe began the policies of militarism and territorial expansion that eventually led to the collapse of the classical Maya civilization. **********Dr. Arthur A. Demarest, an archeologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, announced yesterday that the discovery was made beneath the ruins of a pyramid at Dos Pilas, the ancient capital of the Petexbatun region of Guatemala. The tomb contained the skeleton of a man accompanied by a regal headdress of jade, conch and pearl, obsidian blades probably used in bloodletting ceremonies and ceramics inscribed with hieroglyphics. **********Scholars at the site said they were almost certain that the skeleton is that of Ruler 2, so called because the hieroglyphics giving his name have not been deciphered. A monument at the pyramid indicates that this is the burial site of that particular king, and the writing on pottery found inside the tomb is expected to confirm the skeleton's identity. **********\"It looks like we've got a large dead king in there,\" Dr. Demarest said in an interview by telephone from Guatemala. Evidence of Relentless Warfare **********The discovery of the tomb, along with excavations of extensive fortifications at Dos Pilas and other evidence of relentless warfare, is expected to figure in new interpretations of the Maya as a more militaristic people than had been thought by earlier scholars. It could also illuminate the causes of the mysterious fall of lowland Maya culture beginning in the eighth century and culminating in the 10th. **********\"This is going to change the textbooks radically,\" Dr. Demarest said. \"Ruler 2 was a pivotal figure in the initiation of the catastrophic sequence of events in which the polity broke up into a dozen warring states that militarized the landscape within a period of 50 years and may have destroyed the ecology of the region.\" **********Ruler 2 reigned between 698 and 725 over the Petexbatun region, which spanned some 2,000 square miles along the Pasion River in northern Guatemala. Ruler 2 and his successor conquered neighboring city-states and created the largest kingdom in Maya history. The classic Maya period began with the rise of large cities and elaborate ceremonial centers around A.D. 250 and, in the south at least, collapsed by the year 900. **********Other archeologists said this was one of the most significant recent discoveries in Maya studies. But many of them were not yet prepared to accept Dr. Demarest's interpretation that a rapid escalation of warfare and territorial expansion doomed the Maya civilization. **********Dr. Jeremy A. Sabloff, an authority on Maya archeology at the University of Pittsburgh, called Dr. Demarest's research \"very important and exciting,\" but said he doubted that a single factor, like destructive warfare, accounted for the fall of the Maya civilization. **********He noted that, contrary to some accounts, the entire Maya civilization did not collapse at the end of the classic period. The cities in the southern lowlands of present-day Guatemala declined, but in the north the major ceremonial centers of the Yucatan in Mexico were built. **********Dr. David Webster, an archeologist at Pennsylvania State University who specializes in Maya warfare, said the discovery \"will tell us a great deal about the dissolution of these kingdoms and about the role of warfare in this dissolution.\" **********Excavations at Dos Pilas, Dr. Webster said, focused attention on a major shift in scholarly attitudes toward the Maya culture. Until recent years, scholars tended to idealize the Maya as a peaceful and industrious people. The only warfare was supposed to be the limited, ritualized battles fought between rulers as part of dynastic struggles, but rarely involving the common people. That interpretation reflected the apparent absence of fortifications at Mayan cities, but overlooked evidence on icons depicting warfare and human sacrifice. **********With his discoveries of moats, fortifications and other signs of widespread military activity, Dr. Demarest has become a leader in the revisionist thinking. **********\"The Petexbatun kingdom collapsed into warfare far more destructive than we had ever imagined,\" Dr. Demarest said in explaining the new findings at Dos Pilas. \"The landscape and settlement pattern became almost medieval as many smaller states fought for survival.\" **********In the turmoil, food shortages forced peasants into destructive farming practices in the fragile rain forest and drove people into overcrowded, impoverished cities for protection behind stone walls and trenches. The kingdom controlled by Dos Pilas disintegrated in 760, and the area was abandoned by 830. **********The tomb was found deep in the core of a major funerary temple on the east side of the Great Plaza of Dos Pilas. Archeologists found the tomb intact, but the stone vault on the verge of collapse. Once they can get inside for a more thorough investigation, they expect to find jade jewelry, ceremonial objects, carved bone and more pottery with hieroglyphic writing that could tell some of the history of this fateful period. **********Dr. Demarest's excavations, which involved more than 40 scholars and graduate students, are financed in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Geographic Society.

Portugalov was a member of the Soviet Communist Party for 40 of his 63 years, holding the rank of senior counselor in its once all-powerful Central Committee when the whole structure crashed in ruins last month after the failed coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********\"I never thought I'd be out on the street and accused of being a member of a criminal organization,\" Mr. Portugalov said in an interview today. \"But I'm not shedding any tears for the party.\" **********He said he could not even remember his party card number, or think why he should even try. Mr. Gorbachev had already seen to it two years ago that the party card had stopped being a coveted badge of privilege, entitling its owner to supplies of food, clothing and housing not available to ordinary mortals. **********\"I hadn't been to a party meeting for five years,\" he said. \"The party had long since outlived its usefulness, and it was not reformable -- too inextricably bound up with the totalitarian state.\"  Popular Resentment Recalled **********It is easy to talk about the party that way now that it is gone. But more than a year ago, Mr. Portugalov had been saying popular resentment of the party was so great that he feared for his safety in the streets at night. **********Whether he really thought it was on its way out as early as four years ago, as he now says, is hard to judge. What is clear is that like thousands of other Central Committee staff members who have been clearing their personal belongings this week out of its collection of pre-revolutionary buildings in Old Square, this apparatchik is now unemployed. **********He did not seem particularly worried about it today. Neither did a few of his friends and colleagues from the party's international department, scuttling out a back entrance and carrying bags and briefcases full of books and personal effects past heavily armed police guards. **********Mr. Portugalov got many of his belongings out over the last week, and is not concerned about the rest. His apartment belongs to the Moscow city authorities, and he does not expect them to try to evict him and his ailing wife, Tamara. But he is prepared for a rise in the rent, which is now, including utilities, 50 rubles a month -- the equivalent of $1.56 at the official tourist exchange rate. **********In a reminder of the Stalinist past, Mr. Portugalov lives on Pavlik Morozov Lane, named after a young Communist Pioneer who was glorified by the party after being killed by relatives for having turned in his own parents to the authorities during the bloody collectivization of agriculture in the 1930's.  Party's Archives Sealed **********The party's archives and official files have all been sealed since Aug. 24, when Mr. Gorbachev, angry at support for the putsch from the party he headed, suspended its central apparatus and put party property into the hands of the Soviet Parliament. **********Since Parliament, too, will apparently soon be suspended by Mr. Gorbachev and the presidents of the Soviet republics, the Moscow city authorities have taken over responsibility for overseeing the Central Committee's dismemberment. **********Mr. Portugalov is one of the Soviet Union's leading experts on Germany, and his bespectacled face and polished German are familiar to practically every adult in that country, from the many television appearances he has been making on behalf of Soviet policies since the days of Leonid I. Brezhnev and Yuri V. Andropov. **********One reason he is not worried is that he thinks that people like him will continue to be necessary -- if not in the party, then outside it. He said he hoped now that he might join President Gorbachev's foreign policy staff, or, failing that, that some German news organization or German-Soviet joint venture would hire him, at some multiple of his 800-ruble-a-month Central Committee salary, $25 at the official tourist rate.  'I Was on Vacation' **********Mr. Gorbachev, who dismissed Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh last month for showing too much \"passivity\" and lying low during the coup, might not find Mr. Portugalov's account of his loyalty very convincing, though he swears it is undying. **********\"I was on vacation at one of the Central Committee dachas on the outskirts of Moscow,\" he recounted today, \"and on Aug. 19, I decided to take one of the buses that ferries people back and forth every Monday, to come in and pick up the newspapers; there aren't any out at the dacha. I came into the office and bought a paper in the lobby, and there I saw the strange announcement that Gorbachev was sick and had been relieved of his duties.\" **********\"It's a coup, I thought to myself,\" he said. \"It had been long enough coming, and talk of one had been in the air. But I decided I'd have nothing to do with these people until Gorbachev either said himself that he was resigning or was killed.\" **********From his talks with his colleagues, Mr. Portugalov estimated that a third of the members of the 150-member international department favored the coup, about a third opposed it, and a third were prepared to go either way. Valentin M. Falin, the department's chief, made his opposition clear about the time the coup failed, two days later, he said.  Listening to Voice of America **********Mr. Portugalov went back to the dacha with his papers and spent the next day tuned to the Voice of America, as Mr. Gorbachev did himself, coup-bound in the Crimea. He returned to Moscow the same day the President did, on Wednesday, Aug. 21. **********\"On Friday, I went into the office again to pick up the papers,\" Mr. Portugalov said. He called his son, Sergei, a sports doctor, and asked him to meet him at the main entrance, No. 3, at 9 A.M. \"He told me there was a mob there and that the entrance was closed,\" his father said. **********Meeting instead at the Dzerzhinsky Square station, the two men went to a back entrance to the Central Committee, and Mr. Portugalov went in to retrieve a few of the 300 or so books he kept at his office. He left with his son about noon, and took a taxi with the books back to the dacha. **********A few hours later, the rest of the Central Committee staff was advised to leave the building for their own safety, and the building was sealed. **********On Saturday morning, Aug. 24, Mr. Portugalov said, he came back into town again and called one of his Central Committee colleagues, Andrei Grachev, who was about to leave on a trip to Finland. \"You won't get back in again,\" Mr. Grachev told his friend. \"It's all sealed off.\"  'Let's Wait and See' **********\"Let's wait and see what happens Monday,\" Mr. Portugalov decided. **********On Monday, Aug. 26, he approached the main entrance on Old Square and saw that, indeed, all the entrances had been sealed and barricaded. Going around to the back door again, just below the staff cafeteria and the party grocery store, he saw a crowd of his colleagues huddled on the steps in the rain. **********Some had left their bankbooks in their desks, others the keys to their dachas, others who knows what. \"The police wouldn't let us inside,\" Mr. Portugalov said. \"They said they had to make sure first that the files wouldn't be destroyed, and that we'd get in later.\" **********After some hours, the group of about 50 was told that they would be allowed into their offices under police supervision. The first group of four men allowed in took two hours to get out, and Mr. Portugalov decided to try again on Wednesday. **********Then he was told to appear at Entrance 5 on Friday, Aug. 30, and get a temporary pass. He finally got in at about 2 P.M. \"The police let me into my office alone,\" he said. \"They had left the telephones connected, but not the document shredders.\"  Policemen Looked 'Ashamed' **********Policemen searching the packages taken out of the building looked \"ashamed,\" Mr. Portugalov said, but a reporter for Kuranty, an independent newspaper, shouted out a question: \"How are you being paid?\" **********\"From the secret dollar funds you're all writing about!\" Mr. Portugalov shouted back. **********He knew nothing about any laundered money or secret Central Committee funds, he said, but on Saturday, when he returned again to take away more books, a policeman seized 20 sheets of plain white paper -- hard to find in Moscow -- that Mr. Portugalov tried to bring out. \"State property,\" the policeman insisted. **********Now that the Central Committee exists no more, Mr. Portugalov said, he had been told that like everybody else who worked for it, he would get two months' severance pay from the Moscow city authorities on Thursday, and an additional possible dismissal payment, a maximum of two more months' salary, later. **********But there will be no more Central Committee dachas next summer, and no Central Committee cars and drivers to take him around to appointments. The Central Committee store is closed, but, he said, there had not been much in it anyway for the last two years, since Mr. Gorbachev started reducing party perks. **********The main thing he was worried about losing access to was the clinic where he and his wife have been treated in the past. \"It wasn't a Central Committee clinic,\" he said. \"But my wife needs an operation to remove a splint in her leg, and I hope they'll still take her.\" **********And in the future, he said, the country will continue to need Communists, whatever they call themselves. Ivan S. Silayev, the head of the acting Soviet government now, had been a party member and a leader of the military-industrial bureaucracy for years, but Mr. Gorbachev and President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic have now put him in charge of a temporary committee to bring a market economy to the country. **********\"I think they'll continue to need German experts too,\" he said. \"And if they don't, maybe the Germans will have me.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/25/world/war-in-the-gulf-journalists-cbs-news-says-crew-vanished-near-front-lines.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 646, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CBS News Says Crew Vanished Near Front Lines", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: JOURNALISTS; CBS News Says Crew Vanished Near Front Lines", "body_text": " **********A four-man CBS News crew led by the veteran correspondent Bob Simon has been missing in a front-line region of the Persian Gulf war since early Monday, the network said yesterday after the crew's vehicle was found in the Saudi desert near the Kuwaiti border. **********Four sets of footprints, apparently those of the missing men, were found in the desert trailing northward from the car into Kuwait, Saudi officials said last night.

There was no sign of a struggle, CBS said, or any indication of what had happened to the newsmen. **********Saudi trackers followed the footprints northward from the car into Kuwait, but were unable to proceed past a checkpoint manned by Iraqi troops, the Saudi Defense Ministry said in a statement. **********The statement said that $6,000 in cash, television equipment, some Iraqi currency and a wristwatch with a picture on the dial of the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, had been found in the crew's vehicle. Many journalists who have visited Iraq in recent weeks have purchased the watches as souvenirs. **********\"We hope they've hooked up with a friendly military unit and are off somewhere and just not able to communicate,\" said Tom Goodman, the director of communications for CBS News. \"But the reality is we just don't know their whereabouts or condition.\"  Last Contact on Monday **********News correspondents in war zones are occasionally unable to communicate with their offices for two or three days. It is rare for reporters to be missing as long as Mr. Simon, who last contacted the CBS base in Dhahran at about 9 A.M. Monday. **********Pete Williams, the Pentagon's spokesman, said yesterday that all allied military commanders in the northern Saudi desert had been asked to be on the lookout for the CBS crew, but that no word on the missing men had been relayed. **********Mr. Simon, a 49-year-old correspondent who covered the Vietnam War, conflicts in the Middle East and Central America and other major news events in 24 years with the network, was accompanied by Peter Bluff, 47 years old, a CBS News staff producer; Roberto Alvarez, 37, a cameraman, and Juan Caldera, 31, a sound man. Mr. Alvarez and Mr. Caldera are a freelance team based in Miami who often work for CBS. **********Mr. Simon, who has frequently filed reports from Saudi Arabia since Iraq invaded Kuwait last August, took his crew into the gulf region several weeks ago. Like an increasing number of correspondents, he was dissatisfied with the Pentagon's pool arrangements for combat reporting. He went out without a guide or military escort last week to report from the front. Not a Violation of Rules **********Such independent reporting is frowned upon by American military officials, but does not violate the Pentagon's rules for journalists covering the war. **********The town Ar Ruqi, where the newsmen's car was found parked on the side of the road, is a short distance from the desert junction of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq. It is the heart of a combat no man's land occupied on the Saudi side by the First and Second Marine Divisions, and on the Kuwaiti-Iraqi side by Iraqi troops, who have crossed the border in recent days to engage in firefights with the Americans."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/28/business/the-media-business-loss-posted-by-tribune-co.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 210, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Loss Posted By Tribune Co.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Loss Posted By Tribune Co.", "body_text": " **********The Tribune Company said today that it lost $191.4 million during the fourth quarter of 1990 because of costs associated with The Daily News of New York. **********The Daily News was sold on March 20 to the British publisher Robert Maxwell after a five-month strike by nine unions.

Linn Williams, deputy United States trade representative, and Naomichi Suzuki, the vice minister for international trade at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Japan. Both are elite agencies that deal with each other on many different issues and must work to keep relations cordial. **********President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, which includes many passionately free-market economists, also played a role in the negotiations. **********The semiconductor industries in both countries also depend heavily on exports to each other, so they had stakes in a friendly outcome. And the executives and workers in that industry tend to be young, highly educated and global minded. **********In the semiconductor dispute, the United States wanted the Japanese ministry to continue to put pressure on Japanese manufacturers to buy American computer chips. Japan wanted the United States to lift sanctions imposed in 1987 on imports of hand power tools and color television sets in retaliation for the low market share that American chip companies had captured in Japan. **********The semiconductor talks ended with an agreement nearly two months before the deadline, and with little acrimony. The final deal relied heavily on private companies, with a minimum of direct government oversight. **********The construction negotiations, by contrast, ended a month after their deadline and after the United States trade representative published in the Federal Register a request for public comments on how best to ban Japanese companies from American public works projects. J. Michael Farren, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, the official who declared the talks in Tokyo at an impasse, demanded repeatedly that the Japanese Government make major changes. **********Japan eventually agreed to offer preferential bidding procedures for foreign companies on at least 17 public works contracts. **********Japan had little to gain in the construction talks because it already had access to the American market, although Japanese companies have won few public works contracts in this country. \"There was nothing really hanging out there that they wanted fixed, and therefore their energy level and desire to get things done were different,\" said an American negotiator who insisted on anonymity. **********The threat of a sanction against Japanese companies in the United States created an incentive to an agreement comparable to lifting the sanctions imposed in 1987, the official said. **********But a Japanese negotiator, who also insisted on anonymity, said Mr. Farren's and the Commerce Department's aggressive tactics put a strain on bilateral relations. Negotiations were more relaxed with Mr. Williams, he said. **********But American officials say the difference between the approaches to negotiations may be exaggerated by the Japanese. While the Commerce Department may have had jurisdiction over the construction negotiations and the trade representative oversaw the semiconductor talks, the two agencies also assigned officials to each other's negotiating teams. **********\"Commerce is close to business; there's no doubt about it,\" said another American negotiator who also insisted on anonymity. But he added that this made little difference in negotiations. **********The Japanese official also acknowledged that bureaucratic considerations in Japan made a construction agreement more difficult. The construction, tranportation and foreign ministries were all directly involved in the talks and accepted a need for concessions. But other agencies with no stake in the outcome were reluctant to open their public works contracts to foreign companies. **********\"Those other agencies have been a little difficult to extract from bureaucratic resistance, and we had to have some help from the Prime Minister's office,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/17/business/key-rates-498891.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/30/world/soviet-turmoil-the-day-s-highlights.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 422, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Day's Highlights", "print_headline": "SOVIET TURMOIL; The Day's Highlights", "body_text": " **********Shaping a New Union **********In Transition: After three hours of anguished debate, the Soviet Parliament voted to suspend all activities of the Communist Party pending an investigation of its role in the coup.

Admits the Human Error Was on Management's Side **********When a switching station went out in Manhattan last week it sent the entire region into conniptions. Hundreds of flights had to be diverted as the region's airports closed. Five million long-distance calls were blocked. It was the third major shutdown of A.T.& T.'s long-distance service in less than two years. This time, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company cited human error. An inattentive crew failed to notice when a generator switched off, said Robert Garnet, a company spokesman. Union officials countered that it was the alarms that failed. Grudgingly, A.T.& T admitted management and technical lapses. This did not go unnoticed by its biggest rival. \"A.T.& T. has described its system as self-healing and fully redundant,\" said Daniel F. Akerson, executive vice president of MCI, which came out with a new ad campaign in response. \"Clearly it's not. Their reliability is more advertised than delivered.\" Where Will the Chips Fall?  It may not be Operation Desert Storm, but the potato chip wars are heating up. After years of offering coupons and other promotional deals rather than cheaper prices, Frito Lay Inc., the nations No. 1 snack-food maker, has shifted strategies to win back market share lost to No. 2 Borden Inc. and No. 3 Eagle Snacks, a subsidiary of the Anheuser-Busch Companies. To do that, the division of Pepsico Inc. said it will cut costs. First, 1,800 jobs will go, saving the company $100 million. Those dismissals will mean a $91 million charge against Pepsico's third-quarter earnings. Which salty-snack maker will fare best? \"It's a war and they are all bleeding,\" said Max Busetti, editor of the Food Industry Newsletter.  Salomon Raids the Piggy Bank  The scandal at Salomon Brothers Inc. tarnished its credit rating as well as its name. Though its rating is still higher than half of corporate America's, it is lower than Salomon's more reputable competitors. That makes it more difficult for Salomon to raise money cheaply in a business where profits are squeezed from fractions of basis points. Last week, Salomon disclosed that it had begun dipping into its rainy-day fund of securities, which may be worth as much as $15 billion. By selling securities to raise capital -- and agreeing to buy them back -- Salomon has set up an alternative to issuing commercial paper until Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Treasury Department and the 33 state regulators investigating the firm say it has cleaned up its act. That may take time.  The B-2's Fading Purpose  The Northrop Corporation's B-2 radar-evading Stealth bomber is a plane without a mission. With Communism in collapse, there may be no need to sneak in under Soviet radar to drop a cache of bombs. But last week Congress learned that the Stealth's lack of mission may not be its only problem: in tests, the big B-2 showed up on radar. For Northrop, that is a big problem. With the Pentagon's budget shrinking, the B-2 was ailing Northrop's last cash cow. The Air Force said it wanted up to 75 planes -- worth about $60 billion -- and has ordered 15. But the B-2 is in real trouble in Congress. \"We are not going to give a blank check to the program,\" said Senator Jim Exon, Democrat of Nebraska. Even without a blank check, Congress is in the hole for $30 billion on the B-2. Some fear that if the B-2 disappears, Northrop will drop off the scope as well. G.E. Plays It Safe Among the nation's biggest corporations, the General Electric Company -- with its high-tech emphasis -- is something of a risk taker. But last week G.E. showed itself to be very prudent. It announced it would take a $1.8 billion charge to cover medical and benefits obligations to future retirees. Most companies have until Jan. 1, 1993, to take the hit. G.E. decided to take it early. Dirty Diaper Business The rivalry between Toys \"R\" Us Inc. and Child World Inc. has reached a new level. Now they are fighting over, well, diapers. To lure customers into its stores, Child World announced a special on disposable diapers. But last week Child World said it learned employees from Toys \"R\" Us were slipping into its stores, loading up on diapers and reselling them. Child World threatened to sue Toys \"R\" Us. Child World was tipped off to the caper when three men in suits drove up to a Houston store and bought $100 worth of diapers each. Either something was fishy, or those three men had some baby. ECONOMY **********The Laggard Services Sector  If the future lies in services, as most economists are quick to say, the United States is in trouble. Economic growth in August was centered in mining and manufacturing. According to the Federal Reserve Board, factory and mine output rose by three-tenths of 1 percent in August. Though the gains were modest, this sector showed more vigor than the rest of the economy. \"The manufacturing sector is the only area where we're seeing much strength,\" said David Wyss, an economist with DRI/McGraw-Hill. When Spending Hurts  As consumers rouse from their recessionary slumber, they are beginning to spend. Trouble is, as they do, more boatloads of goods are coming stateside. According to the Commerce Department, imports exceeded exports by $5.9 billion in July. That was the largest monthly trade deficit since January and was an increase of 55.6 percent over June's figure.  Housing Recover Falters  For the nation's home builders, six months of interest-rate cuts have not been enough to keep the recovery from sputtering. According to the Commerce Department, housing starts were up by a modest six-tenths of 1 percent in August, the smallest gain in three months. The number of new permits issued also fell 4.9 percent, which signals even fewer construction starts in the months ahead. Since new construction fuels growth in other areas -- plumbing, furnishings, labor and even banking and insurance -- analysts looking at the figures were disappointed. \"These numbers show a housing recovery losing steam, at least through August,\" said Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Society in New York.  Perfect Resume for the R.T.C.?  Albert V. Casey, a former chairman of American Airlines and of First Republic Bank of Dallas, is now expected to fill one of L. William Seidman's jobs. Mr. Seidman is retiring next month as head of both the Resolution Trust Corporation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Mr. Casey -- known as a tough manager -- is the leading candidate to head the R.T.C. The R.T.C. will manage the savings and loan bailout on a day-to-day basis. Mr. Casey has at least one qualification for the job few others could boast. Shortly after he became chairman of First Republic, it went under. It was one of the costliest bank failures in history.  The General Accounting Office said the savings and loan bailout will cost $191 billion.  INTERNATIONAL **********Honda's Short Road to Market  It had to be one of the swiftest new-product introductions in automotive history. Last summer engineers from the Honda Motor Company in Japan said they had developed a thrifty new engine. They called it the VTEC-E. Last week, Honda announced the debut of the Civic VX, which is equipped with the first of those lean-burn engines. Honda expects the Civic VX to get about 55 miles a gallon on the highway and 48 miles in the city. But what is really remarkable about the new engine is that while its mileage is only 10 percent better than the next-best Geo Metro, imported by the General Motors Corporation, the Civic VX has about 30 percent more horses under its hood. According to Honda's critics at G.M., the new engine does not represent any big technological breakthrough. But if it is so easy, why didn't G.M. bring one out? Keeping the Sushi Chefs at Bay The bluefin, which is native to the North Atlantic, is a delicacy in the world's sushi bars. Environmentalists now worry it may be dying out due to over-fishing. Big bluefins -- put on ice and loaded onto planes -- can fetch $10,000 to $15,000 in Japan. So the National Audubon Society is proposing to have the bluefin listed as endangered under an international treaty. That would be the first time a commercial fish was deemed endangered. The United States Fish and Wildlife Services is expected to decide by Oct. 4 whether to recommend protection of the fish.  B.C.C.I. Punishment  The slow-paced investigation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International is finally yielding results. Last week, the Federal Reserve announced a $37 million fine against Ghaith R. Pharaon, a Saudi businessman, for acting as a front for B.C.C.I.'s 1985 purchase of the Independence Bank of Encino, Calif. Regulators also asked a Federal court in Manhattan to freeze Mr. Pharaon's assets. They were worried, it seems, that he would turn his holdings into transportable cash."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/28/world/war-in-the-gulf-iraq-iraq-issues-a-call-for-peace-hours-before-bush-s-speech.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1991-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 670, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: Iraq; Iraq Issues a Call for Peace Hours Before Bush's Speech", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF: Iraq; Iraq Issues a Call for Peace Hours Before Bush's Speech", "body_text": " **********Hours before President Bush announced a conditional suspension of offensive fighting today, Baghdad moved closer to capitulation, offering to relinquish all claim to Kuwait, release allied prisoners and accept responsibility for war reparations in return for an immediate cease-fire and the lifting of international sanctions. **********Shortly after the Iraqi offer was made known on Wednesday, three explosions rocked central Baghdad, and a Reuters correspondent there said the blasts, possibly from cruise missiles, were so great that the Rashid Hotel, where Western reporters in the city are staying, \"heaved and shuddered.\" **********The decisions announced by the Baghdad radio were said to have been made on Tuesday at a meeting of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council under President Saddam Hussein.

Shevardnadze, a toughening of Mr. Gorbachev's domestic politics, the military crackdown in the Baltic republics and a distinctly more visible role for the military have led Western analysts to question whether Moscow's foreign policy might begin to shift. **********The Germans have also noted that Mr. Gorbachev has failed to win parliamentary ratification for two of the several Soviet-German treaties that formed part of the broad agreement between Moscow and Bonn leading to German unification. The two that were not approved dealt with the phased withdrawal of the Soviet Army from Germany. **********A large part of Mr. Genscher's goal on this visit, his first to Moscow since German unification last October, was reportedly to assess Mr. Gorbachev's and Moscow's position. Diplomats said he came away from his meetings with Mr. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh \"reassured\" about Moscow's course. **********Mr. Genscher said that from what Mr. Gorbachev had told him, he had concluded that the Soviet President was \"fully determined\" to continue reforms. Issue of Honecker Transfer **********The only issue on which Mr. Genscher made a firm comment was the transfer of Erich Honecker, the former East German Communist leader, from a Soviet hospital in eastern Germany to the Soviet Union. He said he had told the Soviet leadership \"with all seriousness about the position and expectations of the Federal Government\" about the action. **********Soviet officials have insisted that Mr. Honecker was moved for additional medical help and that he is in no condition for another move. **********Soviet officials have privately questioned the earnestness of Germany's indignation, speculating that Bonn may be just as happy to have an excuse not to put Mr. Honecker, who is 78 years old, on trial.

The police stood by and watched. **********Although the catalyst for the outpouring of anger was bomb damage early in the day to the tomb of a Sandinista guerrilla hero, the deeper reason was the unresolved onflict over private-property rights in Nicaragua. **********The Government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro -- its actions somewhat limited by continuing Sandinista Front control of the police and army under terms of 1990 accords by which the leftist Sandinistas ceded power -- did not fix blame for the violence. But it appealed for calm in a Saturday night television broadcast. **********Carlos Hurtado, the Minister of Government, who is responsible for internal security, said he knew of no deaths or serious injuries from the actions.

While one group of Sandinistas quickly repaired the damage, others sought revenge. **********The first target was the office of Mayor Arnoldo Aleman, which was sacked and burned.

High yields? And stable principal? And guarantees by the United States Government or one of its agencies? **********A new breed of funds -- adjustable-rate mortgage-backed funds -- is one solution, although critics say there are problems. These new funds promise higher yields than money-market funds, less fluctuation than long-term bond funds -- and the credit safety of securities backed by American Government agencies. Investors have poured more than $1 billion into the first fund of this sort and rivals are racing into the market. **********Mortgage funds, of course, are not new; for years, there have been funds that invest in fixed-rate Government National Mortgage Association securities, and those of Ginnie Mae's cousins, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.  But adjustable-rate funds investing in offerings from these same agencies were developed to eliminate the volatility that has long characterized the fixed-rate funds. Prices for fixed-rate funds must move around to compensate for any shifts in market interest rates that cannot be reflected in the portfolio's fixed rates. **********Adjustable-rate mortgage funds also offer competitive yields as rates rise and a cushion against any sharp rate declines. **********But as fund groups rush into the market, some experts worry that investors don't understand the tradeoff that these funds require. \"Trying to do it all in one investment is a loser's game,\" said Anthony J. Ogorek, an investment adviser in Buffalo, N.Y., who believes investors pay too much in total return for reducing volatility. **********For those willing to do so, there are now several options. The biggest -- and oldest -- of these funds is the Franklin Adjustable U.S. Securities Fund, sponsored by Franklin Resources, San Mateo, Calif. Its assets soared to $1.3 billion at the end of February; at yearend 1989, they were $76.2 million. **********Although it was set up in October 1987 as the Franklin Adjustable Rate Mortgage Fund, it languished until last year. Its name then was changed and sales shot up, partly because it was perceived as a safe haven during market turbulence and because of its solid record. For the 12 months ended Feb. 28, it yielded an average of 9.5 percent -- or roughly 2 points more than the average money market fund, said CDA Investment Technologies, which tracks mutual funds. Franklin's total return -- yield plus changes in principal value -- was 10 percent, compared with 9.2 percent for all bond funds. **********This success has drawn rivals: Pilgrim Group, Los Angeles, launched its fund in late February; Keystone Group, Boston, said it plans to introduce one this month, and others are in the works. **********What is the investor's tradeoff for lowering some of the interest rate risk? For one thing, monthly dividends fluctuate more than they would with a standard Ginnie Mae fund, potentially every month, said Jack Lemein, the Franklin fund manager. That could pose problems for people who rely on regular checks to cover their living expenses. **********Another problem is that the funds' yields will drop when interest rates fall. That's because the underlying mortgages will pay less over time as the borrowers' rates are adjusted downward. Even when interest rates rise, the funds will lag because the rates on the underlying mortgages are adjusted periodically, not immediately. And when mortgages are prepaid, the money often is reinvested at a lower rate. **********\"Franklin's quest to significantly lower the fund's volatility has cost investors too much in total return,\" said Mr. Ogorek. **********Consider this, he said: In 1988 the Shearson Lehman Hutton Mortgage Backed Security Index rose 8.7 percent. The Franklin fund rose 6.4 percent, while the Vanguard Ginnie Mae Fund rose 8.8 percent, according to CDA. In 1989, the index rose 15.4 percent, Franklin gained 10.3 percent and Vanguard, 14.8 percent. Last year, the index increased 10.4 percent while Franklin gained 9.5 percent and Vanguard, 10.3 percent. **********Meanwhile, the \"standard deviation,\" a measure of risk, for the Franklin Fund is 0.30 percent compared with 1.45 percent for the Vanguard Ginnie Mae Fund. While it is five times higher, 1.45 percent is hardly a risky rating. Municipal bond funds, for example, carry a 1.29 percent rating. **********Then there are sales charges. The Franklin fund has a hefty 4 percent sales load, so if you had invested $50,000 in it three years ago, you'd have $61,684 today, for an annual return of 7.25 percent. But if you had invested the cash in money funds for three years, yielding the Donoghue 12-month average at yearend, you would have earned a combined 7.93 percent return -- or more than a half point more than the Franklin fund. Your $50,000 would be worth $62,865. **********Mr. Ogorek's conclusion: You can do better by dividing your portfolio among various investments. But if you do want to invest in mortgage-backed securities, buy shares in a regular Ginnie Mae fund, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/19/world/mandela-s-group-quits-discussions-on-a-new-charter.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1991-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 971, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MANDELA'S GROUP QUITS DISCUSSIONS ON A NEW CHARTER", "print_headline": "MANDELA'S GROUP QUITS DISCUSSIONS ON A NEW CHARTER", "body_text": " **********The African National Congress announced today that it would refuse to discuss a new constitution with the Government until progress was achieved on its demands to end fighting between black factions that has claimed about 800 lives so far this year. **********The congress's secretary general, Alfred Nzo, announced plans for a consumer boycott, a general strike and demonstrations by its supporters to protest the violence, which pits congress loyalists against supporters of Inkatha, a rival black group.

An Important Forum Lost **********But in abandoning negotiations, the congress loses its most important forum for influencing the direction and pace of change in South Africa.

Such discussions have been taking place, it said. **********The congress previously refused to join formal negotiations until the Government released all political prisoners, a process unfinished, and eliminated other obstacles. **********A further delay could also be in the leadership's interest, since it is believed reluctant to be drawn into substantive talks before the congress's national conference scheduled for early July, when an enlarged new executive committee will be chosen.

Zach de Beer, the Democratic Party leader, said delaying negotiations was in no one's interest. **********Today's action made good a threat originally made on April 5, when the African National Congress said it would suspend talks unless the Government met seven demands by May 9. **********The congress demanded that Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Defense Minister Magnus Malan be dismissed, that counterinsurgency units be dismantled and disarmed, that weapons be outlawed at political events, that policemen involved in two fatal clashes with congress supporters be suspended and that the police assigned to crowd control not be issued live ammunition. **********It also demanded that single-sex migrant hostels be phased out and that an independent commission be created to investigate misconduct by the security forces. **********It subsequently delayed until May 9 its response to the passing of the April 30 deadline it set for the release of all political prisoners. **********After President de Klerk announced last week that he was banning the carrying of most tribal weapons in areas of unrest, the congress extended its deadline another week, with the insistence that spears be included. Mr. de Klerk has yet to respond. **********The congress said that to support its demands, it would call for a nationwide consumer boycott, the timing and duration of which would be left to the congress's regional branches; a nationwide general strike on a date to be determined in the next few days; mass demonstrations on June 15, a day before the annual commemoration on June 16 of the 1976 uprising in Soweto against white minority rule, and a day of fasting on Wednesday May 22, to show solidarity with political prisoners still in custody who have gone on a hunger strike to force their release. **********Today, the congress said it was \"outraged at the cruelty\" shown by prison officials toward some of the hunger strikers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/08/business/data-bank-september-8-1991.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Data Bank/September 8, 1991", "print_headline": "Data Bank/September 8, 1991", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/21/business/hallmark-to-enter-cable-tv-in-1-billion-cencom-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1991-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 608, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hallmark to Enter Cable TV In $1 Billion Cencom Deal", "print_headline": "Hallmark to Enter Cable TV In $1 Billion Cencom Deal", "body_text": " **********In its largest diversification effort to date, Hallmark Cards Inc. has agreed to invest about $1 billion in Cencom Cable Association, which has, directly and indirectly, about 550,000 cable television subscribers.

The group included WXTV-TV, Channel 41 in New York, and KMEX-TV in Los Angeles. That purchase price was $286 million. **********In 1988, it bought Univision Inc., the Spanish-language television programming network, for $265 million. **********Hallmark remains the largest maker of greeting cards, ahead of American Greetings and Gibson Greetings. Mr. Hockaday estimated that Hallmark had about 44 percent of the market and that about half of the company's revenues came from cards. **********He said Hallmark looks at expansion from two angles. On the one hand, the purchase of Binney & Smith was \"a form of reinvestment in our core business.\" Many of Hallmark's card sales come from a franchised chain of card shops, which the company thought would also be good sites for selling Crayola products. \"People use the word diversification loosely,\" Mr. Hockaday said. \"I prefer to think of new channels of distribution.\" **********By contrast, he said, the more recent acquisitions, of Spanish-language television and cable, were an example of diversification as most people use the term. **********\"We saw a market that is growing 4 to 5 times faster than the Anglo market,\" he said. **********As for the latest deal, he said: \"We think the future of cable is attractive. But we also think there is a possiblity that it will provide us with cross-term marketing.\" **********As one example, he said that consumers seemed to have less time for shopping in stores and that probably held down greeting card sales, but \"if you have a customer base of 550,000 subscribers some day, how much could you do with home shopping?\"  Competition Grows **********Hallmark, which prints 11 million cards a day, has seen competition heat up at the same time that industrywide sales growth has slowed. **********The Greeting Card Assocation, a trade group that is based in Washington, said that card sales in the United States totaled about $4.6 billion last year and that it expects sales to rise to only about $4.7 billion this year. **********\"We don't have a lot more greeting card companies,\" Mr. Hockaday said. \"But in the mass channels, it is getting more competitive.

DeLay, an expert on the mail-order business. \"This year is terribly important because things have been so flat.\" **********Hoping to put shoppers in the buying mood, Spiegel and some other mail-order companies sent out their Christmas catalogue weeks earlier than usual. Experts say some companies are also likely to re-send their catalogues, with new covers, after Thanksgiving. **********Cataloguers are also emphasizing their discounted merchandise and promising to deliver products in time for Christmas, even if orders are placed in late December. **********For much of the 1980's, mail-order sales grew by about 15 percent a year. That was triple the growth rate of most department stores and other retailers that depend on face-to-face sales. **********But the bleak economy and rising costs have caught up with many catalogue companies. The good news, at least for consumers, is lower prices from a few companies and a reduction in the 12 billion or so catalogues stuffed annually into the nation's mailboxes. **********Mail-order experts say that weaker companies are starting to be weeded out -- some merging with larger ones, others folding altogether. Most survivors will have to cope with permanently lower profit margins, analysts and industry executives say. **********As if the tough retailing climate were not enough, the catalogue companies have also been hit by a confluence of cost increases imposed by the United States Postal Service, which delivers the catalogues, and by shippers like United Parcel Service that deliver the goods. **********Even harder blows may yet land. The industry is feeling pressure from courts and state legislatures on issues that range from sales taxes to proposed privacy laws that would make it hard to send catalogues to people who did not request them. Most catalogue companies do not charge sales tax to customers who live outside the state or states where the company has offices. But revenue-hungry states are trying to change that. **********The various rising costs \"could have some impact on the basic economics of the industry,\" said Richard C. Anderson, chief executive of Lands' End Inc., a mail-order retailer based in Dodgeville, Wis. \"With these fierce price increases, it becomes rather difficult to survive if you are a smaller company.\"  'A Question of Size' **********The recent casualties include Royal Silk Ltd., which had offered popular moderately priced silk apparel through its catalogue. The company went out of business this summer after a costly expansion into retail stores. **********Sensing opportunity in the industry's plight, Montgomery Ward & Company said last month that it planned to re-enter the mail-order business with a line of speciality catalogues. Company executives said the pressures on weaker players made it \"perfect timing\" to start the new business. **********\"In this business, it's very much a question of size,\" said Sharon E. Rappaport, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company. \"It's all dependent on volume,\" she said. \"The larger you are, the better you are able to take advantage of discounts,\" in postal rates and buying merchandise.  Mining the Niches **********But size is not everything. Two of the nation's largest cataloguers, Sears, Roebuck & Company and the J. C. Penney Company are struggling to breathe life into their \"big book\" catalogues, which try to be many things to many people. **********Several companies, however, are doing a brisk business in more narrowly focused areas. A fresh-flower catalogue, Calyx & Corolla, for example, is attracting a lot of attention and customers with its offerings of orchids, anthuriams and birds of paradise. **********Children's clothing is another hot area. Hanna Andersson, a Portland, Ore., cataloguer that specializes in cotton clothing made in Sweden, is attracting legions of parents. **********Not all successful catalogues are aimed at the affluent. Fingerhut Companies, based in Minnetonka, Minn., is growing quickly by selling a wide range of goods on credit, primarily to lower-income families. **********Analysts said there is no true catalogue equivalent of the discount stores, which have revolutionized retailing by offering name-brand merchandise at lower prices than are found in department stores. But the new Ward venture, analysts said, may be taking aim at that market. And other mail-order merchants, including Lands' End, have been placing added emphasis on their lower-priced offerings and beefing up sections that feature discounted goods. **********The current cost pressures are forcing companies to alter their basic approach to the business. **********In April, after much agonizing, L. L. Bean Inc. reversed a 79-year tradition of free shipping and began charging its catalogue customers a $3.50 fee for each order. **********\"It was something we were very reluctant to do,\" said Catharine Hartnett, a spokeswoman for the Freeport, Me., company, which mails 100 million catalogues a year. \"We waited as long as possible before making the decision.\" **********Companies are also revising their blanket approach to mailing. Infrequent buyers are quickly dropped from mailing lists because they do not support the cost of paper and postage. Producing and mailing each catalogue costs about a dollar, according to industry estimates. **********And while it may not be apparent yet, mailers are also sending out fewer catalogues.  Smaller Books, Shorter Lists **********Some merchants are even shrinking their offerings to save money. **********\"The next catalogue will be smaller,\" said Kevin Sweeney, a spokesman for Patagonia Inc., a Ventura, Calif., retailer of outdoor clothing. Patagonia recently laid off 120 people, or about one-fifth of its work force, because of a slowing sales. This year's holiday catalogue pages will be the size of an 8 1/2-by-11-inch business letter, in contrast to the Patagonia's previous oversized offerings. \"Cost is the primary reason,\" Mr. Sweeney said. **********Responding to the same pressures, the Lillian Vernon Corporation decided to cut its catalogue circulation by 10 percent. The company also took steps to more carefully direct its mailing to proven catalogue shoppers, a move that paid off with higher revenue per catalogue mailed. **********Despite such measures, the Mount Vernon, N.Y., company recently reported reduced revenues and a loss for the first six months of its fiscal year.  Impact of Rate Increases **********It was in February that the United States Postal Service increased the third-class rates used by mailers by 40 percent. In the case of Lands' End, the increase will translate to $7 million more in expenses this year. **********Yet, even after the United Parcel Service added its own rate increase, many catalogue companies have been reluctant to pass along the price increases to already skittish consumers. **********The tax issue continues to hang over the industry. State governments are currently barred from charging taxes on sales by out-of-state companies that have no stores in a state. But last month, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case that could overturn the prohibition on sales taxes for most catalogue purchases.  Two Views on Taxes **********Catalogue companies express concern that having to charge and administer state taxes will hurt sales and increase operating costs. **********But Ms. Rappaport of Morgan Stanley noted that several large cataloguers already charge sales tax, because they have retail stores as well. \"I don't think that it threatens the viability of the mail order business,\" she said. **********Privacy laws, though, could be more damaging than either taxes or postal increases, said Mr. DeLay, publisher of The DeLay Letter, an industry publication in New York. He said that a California proposal would effectively require companies to obtain permission from consumers before sending them catalogues. Even if the proposal does not become law, he said, \"down the road, there are going to be some restrictions.\" **********Which is why many cataloguers are afraid that the years of easy growth may be over. \"When we got started,\" said Mr. Anderson of Lands' End, \"we didn't have these problems.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/02/business/company-news-british-sky-financing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 65, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Sky Financing", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; British Sky Financing", "body_text": " **********The two major shareholders of British Sky Broadcasting P.L.C. said today that they had reached an agreement on providing additional financing for the money-losing satellite television network.

Any purchase, whether it be flowers, sweaters, college tuition or vacations, earns the miles, which are redeemable for free airline tickets or ticket upgrades to first class. **********But American Express's program, the company's first ever, hopes to spur both business travel and consumer spending, slowed by the recession, by offering some extras. For example, card holders could pool into a kind of \"bank\" the credits they buy with any version of the American Express card. Charges made on cards of the members' spouses and families count as well. Perhaps most significantly, the card holders could then allocate the pooled credits to as many as seven airlines, instead of one per card, as with present bank-card programs. **********The Membership Miles program, as its called, will be free the first year, but will cost $25 the second year. **********The arrangements between bank cards and airlines have proved to be one of the most effective marketing tools in the sharply competitive travel and credit card businesses. Competition among credit card issuers of all kinds has risen in recent years, as a glut of cards and a similarity of services, like rental-car damage insurance, have forced issuers to offer more and more incentives for using their particular form of plastic. The recession's effects on both consumers and businesses have intensified that trend. **********As the slump hurt the restaurant business, for instance, restaurateurs began to complain about the fee American Express charged merchants who accepted its cards because the percentage was generally higher than that of Visa and Mastercard. Earlier this year, American Express reduced the fee for some merchants. **********American Express has not been alone. Last March, Citibank, the nation's largest issuer of Visa and Mastercards, said it would guarantee, through a form of rebate, that purchases of most items using its cards were at the lowest available price. Profits Down **********In April, American Express announced a quarterly profit drop for the Travel-Related Services, which is mainly the credit card business, to $162 million, from $215 million a year earlier. Quarterly charge-card volume fell 1.3 percent, to $25.4 billion. **********Company officials cited a white-collar recession that slowed consumer spending and raised bad debts among its generally middle- to upper-class card holders. **********\"It will be expensive, but necessary,\" said David F. Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, a credit card industry publication. \"American Express needs to increase sales from their upscale customers.\" **********American Express, which once enjoyed nearly all of the market for airline tickets, has been steadily losing business to bank cards affiliated with major airlines. Frequent-flier programs, which flourished in the 1980's, were designed to build customer loyalty to airlines. **********The air carriers in the new American Express program are Delta Air Lines, Northwest, Continental, Southwest, MGM Grand Air, Midway and Pan American. They carry nearly half of United States air traffic. In addition, they have 24 affiliated airlines, many of them foreign carriers like KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Singapore Air, which could yield additional travel awards under existing programs. **********Delta, which did not previously have an affinity card, said the structure of the American Express program was attractive. \"We've always resisted entering these programs, because we just didn't think it was right to get tickets by charging tires and what all,\" said Neil A. Monroe, a Delta spokesman, \"But the difference here is that we're getting paid, which is nice, and we're only one of seven.\" 'Premier Affinity Card' **********American Express program does not include American Airlines and United Airlines, the nation's two largest carriers. Still, experts on frequent-flier incentives hailed the American Express program. \"American Express has instantly become the premier affinity card with this program,\" said Randy Petersen, editor of Frequent, a Colorado Springs, newsletter for frequent travelers. **********Joe Brancatelli, executive editor of OAG Frequent Flyer magazine, agreed, but said, referring to the absence of American and United, \"Thirty-six percent of my readers won't be able to cash in on it.\" **********Referring to his company's affiliation with American Airlines, James L. Bailey, senior executive in charge of Citibank Visa and Mastercard, said: \"This is a marriage. We expect it to be monogamous.\" **********American Airlines agreed. \"We're happy with the relationship,\" said Martin P. Heires, a spokesman for American. Sara Dornacker, a United spokeswoman, said the carrier considered the American Express program a competitor to its own card with First Chicago bank and therefore did not want to participate. **********Today, American Express has a nearly 42 percent share of the market for airline tickets, while Visa has nearly 20 percent, according to the Nilson Report. Big Spenders **********The affinity cards appeal strongly to frequent fliers, who tend to spend many times more than typical credit card holders. The Nilson Report estimates that United Airlines' affinity cardholders spend as much as three times more and American Airlines card holders as much as seven times more than a typical gold Visa card holder who spends $2,600 annually. **********\"Our new program will encourage people to spend as much as possible with American Express,\" said Kenneth I. Chenault, president of the consumer card group. **********Typically, under these programs, a bank buys frequent-flier miles, at a penny or less per mile, from the airlines. American Express may pay cash but could also trade services, like cooperative advertising, to reduce expenses for the program, which analysts said could be costly in its first years. **********Mr. Chenault would say only that \"American Express is not structuring this program as a loss leader,\" meaning a money-losing incentive."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/17/world/suspect-in-iranian-s-death-eludes-the-police.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 231, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Suspect in Iranian's Death Eludes the Police", "print_headline": "Suspect in Iranian's Death Eludes the Police", "body_text": " **********For the second time in 10 days, a suspect in the slaying of former Prime Minister Shapur Bakhtiar of Iran slipped through the hands of the police because of a mix-up, a police spokesman said. **********The suspect's hotel registration card was inserted into a police computer after he checked into a downtown hotel on Monday, but a computer failure delayed the indentification process until Wednesday, said the spokesman, Thierry Magnin. **********By that time, the suspect, Ali Rad Vakili, had checked out, Mr. Magnin said.

Aboriginal tribal groups and settlers from other parts of India also arerefusing to identify themselves with the Assamese. **********\"I don't think the immigrant groups or the tribes are going to declare Assamese as their language,\" one top state official said. \"If the Assamese become a minority, it'll start an upheaval that will be difficult to control,\" he added. **********The census is likely to revive a push to split Assam into linguistically based states. **********Rajmohan Gandhi, a lawmaker, earlier had compared the Assamese to the Arabs: \"They have the oil; they have not been paid enough for it; their lands are being settled by others. Such Assamese see Bengalis as the area'sIsraelis, wanting to appropriate someone else's lands.\" **********In the last census conducted here, in 1971, the population of the oil-rich, tea-producing, thickly forested northeast Indian state was 14.6 million, with more than 50 percent declaring Assamese as their native language. But that figure included many immigrants from East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, who were actually Bengali-speaking, as well as aboriginal tribal groups who feared government harassment if they listed their true native language. **********Agitation against immigrants forced the census takers to drop Assam from the 1981 national census; projectionsplaced the state's population at about 21 million out of a total of 683 million Indians. The state recorded the country's highest population growth rate, more than 34 percent, from 1961 to 1971, and officials said that was largely because of unchecked immigration from East Pakistan. **********The state's volatile ethnic and linguistic mix has touched off frequent riots. The sharpest divisions have been between the Assamese and the Bengali speakers. Their antagonism goes back to the days of British rule, when Bengali professionals and officials ran the region and Bengali was made the official language.

Their descendants speak a patois of Assamese and Hindi, the main language of northern India, and they also are resentful of Assamese domination. **********This atmosphere has spawned armed groups, some of which are well armed and trained, and there is at least one current pro-independence insurgency, which is being persued by the Indian troops and paramilitary soldiers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/10/business/irs-operations-called-smoothest-in-some-time.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1009, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.R.S.

But even some of the agency's most persistent critics say that day-to-day operations are generally the smoothest in a long time. The contrast to the experience of the mid-1980's, particularly to 1985, when computer problems caused extensive and costly delays, is especially sharp.  'Proceeding Successfully' **********\"This year's filing season is proceeding successfully,\" Jennie S. Stathis, director of tax policy and administration issues at the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, told a House oversight panel late last month. **********A dimmer view, however, was taken by David A. Berenson, national director of tax policy for Ernst & Young. He said the apparently smooth flow of returns masked growing frustration with the complexity of the tax system and a related decline in the accuracy of tax assessment. \"The level of inadvertent noncompliance has never been greater than it is now,\" he said. **********On the positive side, the refund pace has quickened a bit since last year, more of the elderly are using simpler forms, electronically filed returns are running well above expectations, instruction booklets and forms are better distributed, and the I.R.S. has markedly improved its accuracy in fielding taxpayer inquiries. **********\"The filing season is going exceptionally well,\" boasted Fred T. Goldberg Jr., the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who took over in 1989. \"Our ongoing investments in quality and technology are continuing to pay off, much to the benefit of the taxpaying public.\" **********Mr. Goldberg also acknowledged a debt to those who write the tax law: Few changes were made affecting 1990 returns, a situation that benefits the I.R.S., as well as taxpayers. **********The latest reports show filings running 1 percent above last year's pace and distributed refunds up three-tenths of 1 percent. The reports are updated weekly, and issued on Wednesdays. As of March 29, 60,755,000 returns had been filed, and 40,639,000 refunds distributed with the size of the average refund so far this year up almost 6 percent to $899, from $849. **********One of the things that most pleases the I.R.S. is the boom in electronic filings, which have soared 80 percent so far this year, to 6.8 million, about 10 percent of the returns filed so far. The system is for the second year available nationally to nearly all taxpayers claiming refunds, even if they do not live in one of the three districts that currently process electronic returns, and the I.R.S. is testing it in several states with returns on which taxpayers have a balance due. **********Electronic returns are less likely to contain errors than returns filed on paper, which I.R.S. personnel must enter into a computer, and are quicker for the agency to process. **********But electronic filing is also a source of concern. One problem, according to a Congressional aide, is that fraud may be harder to detect. This has led the Administration to request additional money for I.R.S. enforcers. **********Moreover, according to the G.A.O., electronic filing must triple next year if cost-savings targets are to be reached, a goal that is prompting the I.R.S. to seek ways to make it more accessible.  Less Erroneous Information **********One of the most publicized I.R.S. problems of recent years, giving erroneous information to taxpayers who telephone for help, has eased, according to both the agency and outside monitors. The accuracy rate so far this season, as gauged by a formal program of test calls, has been running at 81.8 percent, up from 76.5 percent in 1990, the I.R.S. reported. **********Outsiders generally do not dispute that the information is better, partly because the agency has issued a standard question-and-response manual to aid its \"assistors\" in obtaining pertinent facts about a taxpayer's situation before trying to answer. \"We believe that the development and nationwide use of this guide has already contributed a great deal to I.R.S.'s improved accuracy,\" Ms. Stathis of the G.A.O. told the House oversight panel. **********However, she said it remained \"unclear\" whether the availability of assistance to taxpayers had improved from last year, \"and that is a concern.\" A Congressional aide who receives a weekly statistical breakdown that includes calls answered, busy signals and hang-ups described the chances of reaching an I.R.S. assistor as \"way down\" this year. Decision Pleases Retirees **********But there is no doubt that many retirees are pleased with an I.R.S. decision in December to permit income from pensions, annuities, individual retirement accounts and Social Security to be declared on Form 1040A, which is shorter and simpler than the 1040 long form that was formerly required. Nearly a million had made this switch by mid-March; an estimated 4.5 million are eligible. **********Despite this year's gains, the I.R.S. continues to face huge challenges, including the maintenance and modernization of its computers. At a March 20 hearing, Mr. Goldberg told the House oversight subcommittee that he monitored \"key milestones each month personally\" in this area. **********However, Howard G. Rhile, a senior accounting office official, said, \"There is no system to track the modernization projects against cost, schedule and performance goals.\" **********A continuing sore point with Congressional and other critics is the I.R.S.'s low audit rate, which slipped well under the 1 percent level during the 1980's, and the fact that tax delinquents of relatively modest means are more likely to be enforcement targets than the wealthy. **********Mr. Goldberg, however, won plaudits in many quarters by resisting a Bush Administration budgetary effort last fall to have the agency concentrate on mail audits, which tend to be directed at ordinary taxpayers, on the ground that fairness should outweigh getting the maximum in short-run revenue. \"I said I wasn't going to do it,\" Mr. Goldberg told the panel last month.

Neumark, chairman of the fringe benefits subcommittee of the American Bar Association's section on taxation, which helped to persuade the I.R.S. to change its position. \"This can be tremendously beneficial, because usually people who work at these hours don't make much.\" **********Law and accounting firms often employ word processers to transcribe documents overnight. Utilities have repair people and technicians who work late, as do broadcasters. People in a variety of service industries also work through the night. **********Some law and accounting firms paid employees extra, to cover the taxes on the taxi rides they had to report as income, said Mr. Neumark, a partner in Weber, Lipshie, a New York accounting firm. But some did not, and many workers were afraid to accept a night job or risked using public transportation in high-crime areas to avoid the tax liability. **********A taxi ride to the New York suburbs or the outer parts of the Bronx or Queens could easily cost $30, Mr. Neumark said. That would equal $7,200 a year; Federal, state and city income taxes on that amount, plus Social Security taxes, could be $2,900. **********To be eligible for the tax forgiveness, a worker has to meet two tests: he or she must be paid $60,535 or less in 1991 (the number is indexed for inflation and will rise in future years) and be eligible for overtime pay of at least time and a half for working more than 40 hours a week. **********In testimony before the I.R.S. this week, Mr. Neumark asked that only the first test be used. \"The mugger doesn't ask, 'Are you an hourly or salaried employee?' \" he said. **********That and a further recommendation to extend the regulations to cover transportation in employer-owned cars are being considered. In the meantime, the rules already adopted should help to raise the morale of urban workers fearful of crime, Mr. Neumark said, and \"it puts them on a parity with workers elsewhere, who are not taxed on employer-provided parking.\"   Home Ownership **********When Americans start to look for new homes -- as many are doing this time of year -- the vast majority think first about the mortgage. How big and desirable a home they can buy is determined by how big a mortgage they can receive. Indeed, the conventional wisdom is that over the years the home's value will rise and its owner will receive tax deductions. **********But William J. Goldberg, who is in charge of personal financial planning for KPMG Peat Marwick, rejects that view. He is advising home owners to take a conservative stance and hold down their mortgage costs. **********\"Back when there was high inflation, generally leverage worked in your favor,\" he said. \"Fix your cost today, stretch, and pay it off with cheaper dollars.\" But since home values have declined in many regions, the opposite approach is now best, said Mr. Goldberg, a partner in KPMG's Houston office. With many economists expecting low inflation to continue, the situation may not change. **********In addition, tax deductions were more attractive when they meant the Federal Government was picking up half of the cost of real estate taxes and mortgage interest. Now a taxpayer in the top Federal bracket of 31 percent is still paying 69 cents on the dollar, he noted. **********\"Vocational insecurity is also a factor,\" he said. With layoffs widespread, many employees are anxious about their jobs, he said, and many professionals like doctors, lawyers and accountants are finding their income is 20 to 30 percent lower than a year ago. People with relatively low monthly payments are in better shape to weather any storms. **********Mr. Goldberg advises people who are selling one home and buying another to put the equity from the first into the second, rather than make a minimal down payment. \"Not many people can pay cash,\" he said, \"unless they are moving from Los Angeles to Houston,\" or are selling a big home to buy a retirement home.

But American military officials say Iraqi soldiers will be allowed to remain in the palace, so the Iraqi leader's threat may be more a political gesture than a real warning. **********The safety zone carved out today is to run about 30 miles south from the border with Turkey and about 60 miles east from the Zakho area to a point a little beyond this village jutting above a spectacular mountain view. **********Long truck caravans of British marines, American paratroopers and French and Dutch troops ground along the ragged, steep roads near here all day, with helicopters beating overhead. **********The allies have sought to bring an estimated 800,000 Kurdish refugees out of the mountains along the Iraqi-Turkish border.  But their rapid advance into Iraq raises the question of whether the allies will move south to secure Dohuk, a provincial capital. Dohuk is politically sensitive because of its administrative importance, but it is also a city that military officers say must be part of the security zone because it is the home of many Kurdish refugees. **********Nazir Abdul Bahke, 21 years old, who came down from a mountain refugee camp to check his family home, was among the few people in the streets here, deserted first by their 5,000 residents and today by the Iraqi Army.

Did he feel safe now? he was asked. **********\"If you want the truth, no,\" he replied. \"We are scared they will do something to us.\" **********Speaking of the Kurdish fears, the allied commander in northern Iraq, Lieut. Gen.

And we have to do all that in a deliberate manner, to decide just how far south or in any direction for that matter, we want to extend the security zone.\" **********During the day's advance there was some tense, then merely odd, moments beginning when a British Royal Marine reconnaissance team reached Saddam Hussein's palace at about 10 this morning. **********First Lieut. Matthew Cawthorne of the Marines said his men had jumped off their vehicles and took cover at the ready, as they had been trained, which apparently alarmed several of the Iraqi soldiers who raised their AK-47 rifles before being calmed by their own officers. **********Lieutenant Cawthorne said the Iraqis had told him, \"Our mission is to protect this place to our last drop of blood.\" **********That being said, the Iraqis, including a journalist in a army uniform who took television and still pictures, stood glumly around their Chevrolet Blazers amid a growing, milling crowd of foreign journalists, American marines perched atop their amphibious armored cars and the British marines who have set up their headquarters in a nearby cafe. **********\"I am very happy for the peace, because this is our Government's decision,\" Col.

He said he thought it contained the captors' proposals for freeing the 11 remaining Western hostages in Lebanon in exchange for prisoners being held in Israel. **********But the hopes that at least one more hostage, presumably an American, would quickly follow Mr. McCarthy to freedom were set back when a murky and apparently new underground group announced that it had kidnapped a French medical worker living in Beirut and threatened to kill him if any more hostages are released. A French relief organization later confirmed that one of its employees was missing in the Lebanese capital.  Report on Other Hostages **********In an emotional appearance in Damascus, Mr. McCarthy said three well-known fellow hostages -- Terry A. Anderson, Thomas M. Sutherland and Terry Waite -- were alive and in good health. **********Despite the report of another kidnapping, both President Bush and the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, expressed some confidence that another hostage, an American, would be released soon. But it was unclear how disruptive the reported kidnapping by a previously unknown group would be. **********United States officials were monitoring the hostage situation through both high-level diplomatic contacts and what they declared were intelligence channels too sensitive to describe in any way. Several officials conveyed the impression that the United States was largely on the sidelines as events were unfolding. Kidnapping of Frenchman **********Bush Administration officials said they were offering nothing in return for the release of the hostages. They said international diplomatic efforts were focused on promoting the deal the kidnappers say they want: to exchange Arab prisoners held by Israel for the release of the remaining 11 Western hostages and captured Israeli servicemen. **********The sudden report of a new kidnapping in Beirut today, the first in more than two years, caught Bush Administration officials off guard. Initial reports from news agencies in Beirut said an anonymous telephone caller claiming to represent the Organization for the Defense of the Prisoners' Rights declared that a Frenchman named Jerome Leyraud was abducted. **********The caller asserted that Mr. Leyraud was a French intelligence officer working undercover with a relief agency. French Defense Ministry officials denied this allegation. **********Doctors of the World, a French relief agency, cnfirmed that Mr. Leyraud, its administrator for Lebanon, had been missing from his home and office since mid-afternoon. The janitor at Leyraud's apartment building in west Beirut told the Reuters news agency that the 26-year-old Frenchman was last seen leaving the residential building at about 2:45 P.M. carrying a towel that indicated he was going swimming.  Underground Groups **********Lebanon's shadowy kidnappers identify themselves by a number of organizational names, with some of them loosely affiliated with the Party of God organization, which operates openly as one of the contending political factions in Lebanon. Party of God leaders deny that they are involved in holding hostages, but say they know the kidnappers and communicate with them. **********Among the known hostage holding organizations are: Islamic Holy War, which holds Mr. Anderson, Mr. Waite and Mr. Sutherland, the former agriculture dean of the American University of Beirut; Islamic Holy War for the Liberation of Palestine, which holds the Americans Alann Steen and Jesse Turner; the Revolutionary Justice Organization, which holds another American, Joseph J. Cicippio; the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, which took responsibility for the killing of Lieut. Col. William R. Higgins in 1988; Holy Warriors for Freedom, which holds two German relief workers, and the Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Muslims, which said it killed the British journalist Alec Collett in April 1986. **********President Bush, vacationing in Kennebunkport, Maine, told reporters that he is still confident that an American hostage could be released. **********\"I think those that follow this most closely feel that it is likely an American will be released,\" Mr. Bush said, adding that he did not know the time frame for the next release. \"The ball is not in our hands,\" he said, \"and the evidence is not all that hard. We keep getting assurances through third parties, but that's not good enough for me.\" **********Asked whether he had information that Mr. Anderson, a 43-year-old correspondent for the Associated Press and the longest-held hostage, could be the next prisoner released, Mr. Bush said: \"We don't know that. I think that's what the latest rumor had, that it would be Terry Anderson.\" Swiss in Intermediary Role **********United States officials were careful not to reveal the specific sources of their diplomatic exchanges and sensitive intelligence. But officials said the Swiss Government was playing an active role as an intermediary between Washington and the Iranian Government. The officials also indicated that Syria was pressing its efforts to free the hostages. This was apparent today in scenes from Damascus, where Syria's Foreign Ministry and state television took a prominent role in helping to manage Mr. McCarthy's release. **********Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who was expected to rendezvous with Mr. McCarthy to receive a letter he is carrying from his kidnappers, the Islamic Holy War organization, said he remained hopeful that an American hostage would be released sometime today or Friday. **********\"I have hope that the other hostage will be released today,\" the Secretary General told reporters outside the United Nations Secretariat in New York. \"I have reason to have hope.\" Negotiations With Israel **********The diplomatic work now highlighted by Mr. McCarthy's release centers on negotiations that have sputtered for months between Israel and Lebanese Shiite Muslim groups. After he was released, Mr. McCarthy said in Damascus that he had not looked at the contents of the letter he was carrying to Mr. Perez de Cuellar but said, \"I understand that the letter seeks the Secretary General's help in arranging the release of all prisoners and hostages being held in Lebanon, and for those held in Israel.\" **********\"I believe they want to make a full exchange of the Western hostages, all the prisoners, civilian and military, who are currently being held in Israel, from Lebanon.\" **********British officials said they planned to press Israel to release several hundred Arab detainees in a bid to build on the momentum of Mr. McCarthy's release. **********Israeli officials quickly responded. Defense Minister Moshe Arens said Israel was \"definitely ready\" for a hostage swap provided that seven Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon are accounted for. Some of the Israelis are believed to be still alive. **********Negotiations for such an exchange of hostages and prisoners between Israel and Lebanon's militant groups have been stalled on the question of how many Arab detainees Israel would release and whether the Lebanese groups would return the Israeli servicemen they hold. There are about 300 Lebanese detainees in Israeli jails, but in addition, there are thousands of Palestinian fighters and civilians, some seized in Lebanon, but thousands more detained in the West Bank and Gaza during several years of Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. Rockets Fired in Beirut **********The shadowy group trying to block today's hostage release efforts called itself the Organization for the Defense of Prisoners' Rights. This is the same name used by callers who took responsibility this week for firing rocket-propelled grenades near United Nations offices in Beirut to protest the first indications that hostages would be released this week. **********It was not clear how large or well organized the group is or why it is against the release of hostages. Its demands for the release of Arab detainees and the demands of Islamic Holy War are similiar, though one group may demand that Israel act concurrently in releasing Arab prisoners. **********\"We shall not stop at this point if the deals and the trading persist at the expense of the dignity of our brethren imprisoned in Israel,\" the telephone caller representing the Organization for the Defense of the Prisoners' Rights said, according to an Associated Press dispatch from Beirut. **********In anticipation of the release of an American hostage, the Bush Administration sent a team of medical and psychological specialists today to Wiesbaden, Germany, another sign that the Administration had reliable intelligence information that a second hostage could be freed in Lebanon. **********Mr. McCarthy, in an interview aired by Syrian television, said that his Islamic Holy War captors told him Wednesday that they believed the time was right to settle the long hostage situation and had released Mr. McCarthy as a sign of their good will."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/20/business/the-media-business-a-hard-sell-inspired-by-the-classics.html": {"writer_name": "Edwin McDowell", "pub_date": "1991-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 739, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Hard Sell, Inspired by The Classics", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; A Hard Sell, Inspired by The Classics", "body_text": " **********Americans bought more than 3.5 million Penguin Classics last year, everything from Aesop's \"Fables\" to the history of Xenophon. But sales of the classics have been flat for a couple of years and competition is more heated than ever. **********So Penguin U.S.A. recently embarked on a three-year promotion to persuade booksellers to carry more of the Penguin Classics -- presumably at the expense of its competitors. **********\"Those sales have to come from somewhere,\" said Marcia Burch, the marketing director of Penguin's adult trade paperbacks. She laughed when she said it, but her remark exemplified how competitive -- some would say cutthroat -- the merchandising of even the world's great literature has become. Important Industry Segment **********Classics account for only a small percentage of the estimated 220 million adult paperback books that will be published this year. Yet they are not only a prestige item for publishers but also an important segment of an industry that is made up of segments -- everything from fiction to westerns to biographies to mysteries to reference books. And competition to dominate each segment is intense. **********Penguin's largest inducement, of course, is money: Stores that agree to carry at least 300 of its Classics paperback titles in a special section will receive the company's highest discount (46 percent) and free freight on all reorders of 10 copies or more. **********The publisher will give them free spinner racks with 48 pockets for displaying the books and free brochures and newsletters for customers, and will remit 5 percent of each store's 1990 gross sales of Penguin Classics toward promoting the line. **********Such promotions are essential to book publishers. \"More and more, stores are willing to carry only one line of classics, or two at most,\" said Ellen I. Chodosh, the director of trade paperbacks for the Oxford University Press, whose 350 World's Classics titles compete with the much-larger Penguin line. Oxford also offers price incentives to booksellers, as well as the occasional coffee mugs, posters and similar inducements. **********\"We are definitely the underdog to Penguin,\" Ms. Chodosh acknowledged. \"But little by little, we'll take chunks out of the market.\" **********While Penguin and Oxford are the principal competitors in trade paperback classics, with books averaging $5.95 to $6.95 (but $19.95 for Penguin's recent oversized edition of the Koran), Bantam Classics and Signet Classics are fighting it out for dominance in the mass-market end of the business, where prices more typically range from $3.95 to $5.95. The more expensive classics usually include more extensive introductions, footnotes, bibliographies and appendixes. **********Last year, Signet -- which was bought by Penguin U.S.A. in 1987 -- sold about four million copies of its 300 classics titles. Since almost all classics are in the public domain, some titles like \"David Copperfield\" by Charles Dickens are published by all four publishers. Different Markets **********Yet there are significant differences in the kinds of books sold in the different markets. Lou Aronica, the publisher of Bantam mass-market books, said \"Huckleberry Finn\" by Mark Twain was Bantam's biggest-selling classic title. Penguin's best-selling title last year was \"The Three Theban Plays\" of Sophocles, translated by Robert Fagels. Runners-up were Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" and \"The Odyssey\" by Homer, translated by E. V. Rieu. That book, with Mr. Rieu's translation, was the first Penguin Classic title in 1946. **********Other competitors are also beginning to publish classics. **********For example, Vintage Books, an imprint of Random House, has begun publishing trade paperback editions of the Library of America, a series of classic works by American writers. The Charles E. Tuttle Company, a publisher in Rutland, Vt., plans to distribute paperback editions of the Everyman's Classic Library from Britain, beginning with 35 titles this fall and adding more than 50 titles each year for each of the next five years. Also this fall, Alfred A. Knopf will begin publishing hardcover editions of the Everyman Classics. 86 Stores Signed Up **********Penguin says its promotion is running ahead of expectations, with 86 stores already signed up. These include the McCawber Bookstore in Princeton, N.J.; Tower's Bookshop in Washington; the William and Mary College Store in Williamsburg, Va.; Humboldt State University store in Arcata, Calif., and Schwartz Bookstore in Brookfield, Wis. **********Another recent enthusiast of the Penguin Classics is Jerry Harper, co-owner of Cyrano's Bookstore in Anchorage. \"We just expanded our Penguin Classics section and they're selling a lot better than we expected,\" he said. \"Our customers like them, and we're satisfied with the discount structure.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/19/world/gustav-husak-czechoslovak-leader-dies-at-78.html": {"writer_name": "Wolfgang Saxon", "pub_date": "1991-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 950, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Biography; Obituary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gustav Husak, Czechoslovak Leader, Dies at 78", "print_headline": "Gustav Husak, Czechoslovak Leader, Dies at 78", "body_text": " **********Former President Gustav Husak of Czechoslovakia, the old-line Slovak Communist who came to the fore after a Soviet bloc invasion stamped out the Prague Spring of 1968 and fell with the collapse of Communism, died yesterday. He was 78 years old. **********The nation's official press agency reported that he died in a hospital in Bratislava, the Slovak republic's capital and his hometown, of heart, circulatory and respiratory failure. He had been hospitalized 10 days earlier. **********Mr. Husak's party career reflected the vagaries buffeting the eastern bloc formed by the Soviet Union after World War II. He spent years in jail in the Stalinist era, accused of \"bourgeois nationalism,\" because he advocated a measure of autonomy for Slovakia, a constituent republic administered from Prague. **********He was ousted from the Czechoslovak Parliament in 1951, thrown out of the party -- an experience that was to be repeated early in 1990 -- and arrested on charges of treason and sabotage. Others around him were executed, but he was spared that, receiving a life prison term in 1954. The Rise to the Top **********The sentence was declared illegal in 1963, and the Communist Party returned his membership card. But it took five more years before he started to rise again through the party hierarchy and to the top. **********Once there, Mr. Husak presided over one of the sternest, least tolerant governments in Eastern Europe for the next 20 years. Mr. Husak, as the party's General Secretary, replaced Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the brief spell of reforms that were to give Czechoslovakia \"socialism with a human face.\" Instead, it brought to the streets of Prague the tanks and guns of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. **********In 1975, Mr. Husak added the Czechoslovak presidency to his portfolio, also becoming militia Commander in Chief. Ten years later, the ascendance of Mikhail S. Gorbachev to the Soviet leadership and his subsequent campaigns for openness and social and economic restructuring began to reverberate through the Soviet satellites of Eastern Europe. **********Under some reform pressure, Mr. Husak yielded the party leadership to Milos Jakes in December 1987. Two years later his membership was suspended and he was expelled once again in January 1990. **********On Dec. 10, 1989, Czechoslovakia swore in a Cabinet with the Communists in the minority. After 41 years of party rule, a \"Government of national understanding\" took office, with 11 non-Communists and 10 Communists heading the ministries. **********With a huge crowd celebrating outside, Mr. Husak resigned and opened the way for Vaclav Havel, the dissident and playwright who headed the Civic Forum movement, to succeed him. **********Mr. Dubcek emerged from years in limbo, spent partly as a forester and a locksmith fitter, and became Speaker of the Czechoslovak Parliament. **********Gustav Husak was born on Jan. 10, 1913, in Bratislava. He joined the Slovak Communist Party in 1933 as a student and immersed himself in Marxist doctrine. Working for his doctorate in law in Bratislava he fell in with other intellectuals with Communist leanings. They were led by Vladimir Clementis. **********He practiced in Clementis's law firm in Bratislava and was jailed in 1940 by the German-backed Slovak puppet Government. Freed in 1943, he played a significant role in a revolt against the puppet regime a year later. He also began a career as a government official and party functionary. In 1948, after the Communists took sole control of the country, he was elected to the party's Central Committee. **********Soon afterward, a purge began of party stalwarts suspected of \"nationalism\" and of plotting to follow Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia out of the Soviet sphere of influence. The party chief, Rudolph Slansky, and Foreign Minister Clementis were the main targets, and Mr. Husak's close association with Clementis put him at risk as well. **********He was arrested in 1951 and convicted and sentenced in 1954. Six years later, in 1960, he was released, pending review of his case, and found a job with the Department of Buildings in Bratislava with enough spare time to write a history of the 1944 uprising. **********In his petition for rehabilitation, Mr. Husak acknowledged certain \"negative\" traits, like \"too much self-confidence, a quick temper, frequent impatience, a tendency to demand too much from people.\" He also said that working for the party had meant neglect of his family and seeing his children \"only occasionally.\" **********He became an early supporter of Mr. Dubcek, perhaps because of the previous leadership's condemnation of Slovak nationalism. He was also a principal architect of the federated system under which the Slovak minority of about 5 million and the nearly 10 million Czechs were given limited autonomy in their own regions, at least in theory. **********Mr. Husak was said to be a sophisticated man. Above all, he was considered a deft politician with a logical mind and the ability to tailor his oratory to an audience, speaking in polished Czech to a Prague audience and turning folksy and freewheeling back home in Slovakia. **********Since his ouster, Mr. Husak had been living quietly in Bratislava, reportedly suffering from stomach cancer. Roman Catholic Church officials said he had been given last rites 10 days ago. **********Little was known about Mr. Husak's life away from the office other than that he was a widower and a father. His wife, Viera, died in October 1977 in a helicopter crash on the way from a Slovak spa, Bardejov, to the Husak villa in Bratislava. She and Mr. Husak were married in 1975, some years after the death of his first wife."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/29/business/bloomingdale-s-christmas-wish.html": {"writer_name": "Eben Shapiro", "pub_date": "1991-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1362, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bloomingdale's Christmas Wish", "print_headline": "Bloomingdale's Christmas Wish", "body_text": " **********About 200,000 shoppers are expected to descend on Bloomingdale's flagship store in Manhattan today, looking for that perfect gift. Behind the scenes, Bloomingdale's executives are trying to tie a bow on their most important Christmas season in years. **********After nearly two years in Federal Bankruptcy Court, dealing with uncertainty about its fate and the future of its legendary boss, Marvin S. Traub, Bloomingdale's is trying to put all of that behind it and buck all the gloomy projections for Christmas sales this year. **********\"You may think I'm crazy, but I really believe we are going to have an outstanding fourth quarter,\" said Allen I. Questrom, chief executive of Federated Department Stores Inc., Bloomingdale's owner, in a videotape played to employees at a rally this week. **********Indeed, for Mr. Questrom's optimism to bear fruit, a miracle on 59th Street is essential. Of Federated's nine department store chains, Bloomingdale's accounts for the largest portion of sales, providing some 17 percent of Federated's $7.1 billion in revenues. And the New York store generates half of the operating profit for the 15-store Bloomingdale's chain. The retailer typically generates about 25 percent of its annual sales in the period from Thanksgiving to Christmas. **********\"Questrom needs a showcase for not only the retail community, but to show the vendors that Federated is still alive,\" said Allan Mottus, a retailing consultant in New York. \"He is going to use Bloomingdale's to do that.\" **********But more than Christmas is at stake. \"We're not looking to just do Christmas business; we are really building towards the future,\" said Richard J. Mast, store manager for the Bloomingdale's store on 59th Street and Lexington Avenue. \"We really made a special effort to put our best foot forward this year. We want to remind people in New York that we are a viable, strong company and a good place to do business.\" **********The store is considerably brighter, more festive and more welcoming this year. And if Mr. Mast's plans actually work, it will be a much more convenient place for customers to part with their money. From the looks of the place, said Alan G. Millstein, publisher of the Fashion Network Report newsletter, \"it appears that they've opened up the checkbook.\"  'Just Fabulous' Windows **********One bit of evidence is in the windows, where zany Rube Goldberg-like contraptions featuring mechanical reindeer wearing red high-top sneakers are drawing bemused crowds. \"They are just fabulous,\" a well-dressed window shopper said to no one in particular as she hurried by one morning this week. **********This year the store has dedicated 15,000 square feet of its second floor -- the equivalent of seven average-sized American homes -- to create an arcade of flashy Christmas shops selling such gifts as toys, gourmet food, lingerie, sports memorabilia and bar accessories. The horseshoe-shaped scheme is decorated in a jarring mix of green, red and hot pink, with modern archways lining the walkway to each shop. **********Although Bloomingdale's is still operating on a tight budget under the gaze of the bankruptcy court, it has aimed its extra spending at areas that customers will notice. This year, it has hired 150 more sales clerks than it had last year in an effort to minimize complaints about long waits. **********The store has also set up a Federal Express desk in the store -- the only such in-store site in the city, the company claims -- to help expedite the shipping of out-of-town gifts for last-minute shoppers. Gift-wrapping service has been expanded to more floors. And customers can drop off gifts for wrapping and continue shopping or go to a restaurant in the store and have the gift delivered to their tables. The store is also expanding its coat and package check-in service, and it has hired a Japanese-speaking guide to help tourists from Japan.  A Language Directory **********To accommodate foreign shoppers, who account for about a third of the Manhattan store's sales, the company has distributed to every person on the sales floor a directory of employees that speak foreign languages like Turkish, Indonesian, Romanian and two dozen others, as well as sign language. **********The company has also made it easier for its charge-card customers to cash personal checks. **********Many of these changes grew out of complaints from last year's shoppers and criticism from within the store's ranks. **********After Christmas was over, \"I felt we needed to focus more on service,\" said Marian H. Goodman, the assistant store manager. She suggested publishing the phone number of individual departments in newspaper advertisements for shoppers who want to call for more information and providing more shelving to display sweaters, a perennial fast-moving Christmas item. **********Comments from a number of store employees were assembled into a three-inch-thick book that is being used in an effort to increase this year's Christmas sales.  Rumors and Uneasy Vendors **********Last year, the company was mired in bankruptcy court by the downfall of its owner, the Campeau Corporation. As a result, vendors were uneasy about shipping dresses, purses and perfume to the store. Rumors flew in the stockrooms that the store would be sold to Japanese investors and that the company's well-regarded chief, Mr. Traub, was planning to retire with no successor in line. **********The uncertainty showed. \"I was aghast by how they did things on the cheap,\" said Mr. Millstein, the newsletter publisher. Shoppers had to look no farther than the store's windows for a sign of gloom. The uninspired window displays featured different colored globes, surrounded by merchandise of the same color -- a feeble attempt to recapture Bloomingdale's merchandising flair. **********\"We didn't get a lot of awards for last year's windows,\" Mr. Mast, the store manager acknowledged. **********\"We got three stumps,\" he said, referring to an insulting grade assigned by a critic who ranked window displays by awarding multiple Christmas trees for the best, and sawed-off stumps for the worst. **********But this year, the uncertainty has diminished. Mr. Questrom chose Michael Gould, an experienced merchant, to succeed Mr. Traub. And a plan for Federated to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection next year has the support of important creditor groups. **********Retailers work all year to prepare for the holiday season. \"It's much like General Schwarzkopf planning the invasion of Kuwait,\" Mr. Millstein said. \"It takes 11 months of planning to execute 30 days of business.\" **********Designers and merchandisers spent the summer ordering merchandise and laying out the store's design. After Labor Day, Bloomingdale's held a daylong management retreat outside of the store. **********The physical retooling for Christmas began earlier this month, with the final coat of paint drying as the store opened its doors this morning. Construction, painting and wiring has been going on around the clock. **********On Monday, last-minute loose ends needed to be tied up. At a meeting, a department manager complained that her newly constructed cash register stand had been scratched. \"Hit them again\" with paint, Mr. Mast said to a painter. **********Another manager noted that the newly installed lights were not highlighting the goods. So Mr. Mast reminded the electrician to get the light pointed in the right direction and to connect the red \"Exit\" signs before the fire department inspected the newly constructed area. Calming Jangled Nerves **********James Gundell, the recently appointed general manager of the store, tried to calm the jangled nerves of department managers concerned that meddling executives would rearrange displays. \"I don't think we should let ego get in the way today,\" he said. \"Let's just get through today.\" **********Most important, one manager was scrambling to make sure the hot items were in stock. Mrs. Goodman called a buyer to get more cashmere sweaters. \"My business is going through the roof,\" she barked over the phone. \"I have no problem with my on-order; it's my current on-hand that I have problems with,\" she said, ringing off after getting the buyer's promise to hunt down more $300 sweaters. **********Despite the last-minute chaos, \"it's easier to focus on business this year,\" Mr. Mast said, \"because we are not preoccupied with all those horrible bankruptcy thoughts.\" **********\"People aren't going around thinking, 'Am I about to lose my job tomorrow,' \" he added. \"They are thinking about making sales.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/30/business/a-settlement-for-wieboldt.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-10-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 210, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Settlement for Wieboldt", "print_headline": "A Settlement for Wieboldt", "body_text": " **********Former directors and principal shareholders of Wieboldt Stores Inc. have agreed to pay $11.7 million to the bankrupt estate of the Chicago retailer, which collapsed after a failed leveraged buyout of the chain in 1985. **********Under the agreement, a group including the Ohio businessman Jerome Schottenstein, his family, and Julius and Edmond Trump agreed to settle claims against them without admitting or denying wrongdoing.

These technologies include high-definition television. For the last seven months, he said, a team of Goldstar engineers has been working at Zenith laboratories to develop high-definition equipment. **********Mr. Lee's comments, in an interview at his company's headquarters tower overlooking the Han River in downtown Seoul, came a month after Goldstar purchased nearly a 5 percent stake in Zenith, which was expected to help the American company fight off a takeover threat from Nycor Inc., a Peapack, N.J., investment company. **********But the investment also had a broader signficiance: It is the first big Korean stake in a large American company, and a big concession by loss-ridden Zenith, which has advoated strict protectionism against foreign competitors. Indeed, Zenith succeeded in getting large penalties invoked against color television sets from Japan and Korea in the early 1980's. Zenith said the sets were being sold below cost, driving most of the American television equipment industry off shore or out of business. **********In today's interview, Mr. Lee said that Goldstar was \"not inclined to be a white knight\" for Zenith should Nycor gain ground in its effort to oust Zenith's current management. A \"white knight\" is a friendly acquirer sought by the target of a hostile takeover. Mr. Lee said he did not envision Goldstar taking more than a 10 percent share in Zenith in the foreseeable future. **********Mr. Lee, 59 years old, described a deal that appears to transfer some of Zenith's best technology to the Korean concern. That move has made Zenith a target for criticism in recent weeks on the ground that similar deals led to the loss of many key technologies to Japan in the last two decades.  Flat-Tension Screen **********The key element of the deal, in which Goldstar paid $15 million for its stake, is a license from Zenith for the Korean company to use Zenith's flat-tension screen technology to make television sets. So far the screens, which create a much brighter, flat image than ordinary television sets, have been used primarily on computer monitors. Goldstar plans to use them for commercial television sets, Mr. Lee said, but so far is prohibited from applying the technology to more lucrative computer screens. In the future, he said, \"I will push for them to license us to use it on monitors as well.\" **********He added that the two companies were exploring much broader links: joint manufacturing in Mexico, where Zenith has a plant that is not being used to capacity; marketing of Zenith products outside the United States, where Goldstar is strong; even jointly using delivery trucks and service personnel. Most important, he said, joint research and development is already under way. **********It was a common fear of Japan, Mr. Lee seemed to suggest today, that drew him into talks with Jerry K. Perlman, Zenith's chairman and president, more than a year ago. For Zenith, which lost $52.3 million last year on sales of $1.4 billion, an alliance with a manufacturer of Goldstar's size may well be a matter of survival. **********\"We need to globalize our operations and move our brand image from the low end of the market to the high,\" Mr. Lee said, describing a worldwide network of research operations and factories that sound much like what Sony and Matsushita Electric Industrial built through the 1980's. Goldstar's sales this year are expected to be about $5.13 billion.  Reaction From Japan **********But Goldstar's future faces one big hurdle: Like its major Korean competitors, its once-easy supply of Japanese technology is being choked off. As Japanese manufacturers have come to view Korea as a growing threat, they have declined to license their leading-edge products. **********For example, Koreans are not manufacturing the light, notebook computers that have proved a boon for Toshiba and NEC, or the lightest, handheld video cameras like those made by Sony and Matsushita. They are a generation behind in memory chip technology and further behind in more specialized chips. **********One critical area is high-definition television, in which Japanese makers have invested billions. Goldstar is hoping to make up for that technological shortfall by allying with Zenith, which in turn is allied with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. **********\"We have had a team of 10 engineers in Zenith's laboratory, and they are making good progress,\" Mr. Lee said, adding that he had no interest in taking a management role at Zenith, which is based in Glenview, Ill. **********He dismissed industry allegations that Zenith, desperate for cash and an equity partner, was selling off its most vital technology. \"They would not do that for a mere $15 million,\" he said. \"The deal is not technology for money, but for a total business cooperation.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/12/business/market-watch-the-fed-eased-but-where-s-the-money.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1991-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 525, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Fed Eased, But Where's the Money?", "print_headline": "MARKET WATCH; The Fed Eased, But Where's the Money?", "body_text": " **********Economic indicators, like clothing styles, go in and out of fashion. It has been more than a decade since the money supply was the most-watched and most-feared statistic, the number that every trading room had a pool on, the one that could send stock and bond prices spiraling up or down if Wall Street's crystal balls had been cloudy. **********Perhaps, however, it is time to again delve into the arcane world of the M's. The figures released late Thursday were stunning, showing sharp declines for the final week of April. **********\"With the amount of Fed stimulation that has taken place to date, there should still be a rising trend in money growth,\" noted Dan Bernstein and Ross Waller of Bridgewater Associates.  If the trend did not turn around, they added, \"the Fed will have to do a major reassessment of growth prospects for the economy.\" **********The money supply figures were important when traders hoped they would fall, indicating that inflation was easing. Now inflation is low, and a larger money supply is desired as a sign that the Fed's easing has brought increased economic activity. There are some encouraging signs, such as evidence that layoffs are slowing, but also evidence that many with good credit are choosing not to borrow and invest, while those with poor credit still can't get loans. **********In January, Alan Greenspan pointed to last fall's extremely slow monetary growth as a symptom of the credit crunch. He indicated it was a major reason the Fed needed to ease further. That round of easing briefly pushed up monetary growth and gave heart to stock traders. **********But the money supply as measured by M2 -- basically most consumer savings plus cash, checking accounts and overnight corporate investments -- peaked in mid-April and has fallen sharply for two weeks. That statistic is an indicator of business activity and is not what those forecasting an early recovery had expected. **********\"It raises questions about whether we are in some kind of credit contraction phase that would be associated with asset deflation, including real estate, stocks and corporate assets,\" said David M. Jones, the chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company and author of \"The Politics of Money,\" a new book on the Greenspan Fed. Mr. Jones thinks this recession may last into next year, far longer than conventional wisdom expects. **********Concerns over the monetary figures probably played a role in Friday's sharp drop in stock prices, which erased the week's previous gains and left the Dow Jones industrial average down 18.69 points for the week, to 2,920.17. **********The money supply figures are notoriously volatile, and maybe in a few weeks the Fed will revise away the most recent drop. But if that does not happen, new questions will be raised about whether monetary policy alone is enough to get the economy moving again. **********And who knows what would be done then?

We've got bread!\" -- an expression of hope that with the end of war will again come prosperity. Angola is one of the most richly endowed countries in Africa, but its economy has been devastated. **********\"I've been waiting all my life for this,\" said Dolce Henriques, a 23-year-old student as she danced around Kinaxixe Park. \"Look at this,\" she said, pointing at the crowd, \"this is what peace is about. We're free.\" **********Bursts of automatic weapons fire could also be heard throughout the night. Firing weapons is a risky practice that often punctuates festivals here and a reminder that much of the civilian population is heavily armed. **********\"This is probably one of the most armed countries on earth,\" said Susan Hurlich, an American anthropologist doing research here. A Western relief worker added, \"Nobody is really going to feel safe here until they get rid of the guns -- and there's nothing in the cease-fire about that.\" **********The peace agreement came after more than a year of arduous negotiations in which Portugal, which was Angola's colonial master, and the United States and the Soviet Union, which backed the opposing factions, played a key role in encouraging the two sides to end a war that has taken 300,000 lives and produced no winners. **********Later this month, a United Nations force of 600 men is expected to arrive here to monitor the cease-fire. At the same time, a joint political and military commission will form a single 40,000-member army and prepare for internationally supervised elections in the second half of 1992. **********A de facto cease-fire has been in effect since May 15, and the two sides have largely complied with it, African and Western diplomats said today. Scattered and inexplicable incidents of violence have continued, however. **********Last Wednesday, a bomb exploded in the main market in Huambo, a provincial capital in the central highlands, killing 8 and wounding 20. The next day on Huambo's outskirts, a truck carrying civilians hit a land mine, killing 17 and wounding 30. **********The last full-blown fighting between the two sides took place in the eastern city of Luena in early May, Western relief officials said, when the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, besieged the area and the Government sent reinforcements in an effort to oust the rebels. The Angolan news service has also reported rebel incursions in Bia, Huambo and Kwanza Sul provinces in the west, but most of the incidents occurred before May 15. **********The celebrations here were notable not only for their high spirits, but also for the virtual absence of any visible Unita presence. A senior Unita delegation is expected to arrive here later today, Government officials said, but the rebels are not likely to take part in any of the commemorative events in this capital of 1.3 million. **********In Washington, a spokesman for Unita said the rebel leader, Jonas Savimbi, would make his first trip to the capital in at least 15 years, sometime in July. For most of the bloody civil war, rebel forces have been headquartered in Jamba, a town in the southeast. **********Also conspicuous by their absence are the Cuban forces, at one point numbering 50,000.

Yesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission took steps to restrict the ability of fund managers to gamble in two different ways -- making risky loans or taking interest-rate risks by investing for long periods. The result may be to reduce slightly the yields available on money market funds, which compete with bank accounts for investor money, and have cultivated an image of safety. So important is that image that the fund industry generally backed the changes with enthusiasm. **********One step taken by the S.E.C. has not been widely publicized, and it is likely to affect the way some funds are run. Those funds, seeking to get as high a yield as possible, have invested in securities that do not mature for relatively long periods of time. **********In periods of falling interest rates, funds with longer maturities have been able to advertise higher yields. But now the S.E.C., which had allowed an average maturity of up to 120 days in money market funds, will restrict that to 90 days. **********Several funds now have average maturities longer than 90 days, and will have to cut back. They should have no trouble doing so because the new rule will take effect 90 days after it is published in the Federal Register, giving them ample time to roll over investments into shorter maturities. A list of money market funds, with their yields and average maturities, appears on page D9. **********The other change, which has received much more publicity, will restrict the amount of risky corporate loans -- known as low-rated commercialpaper -- that a fund can have in its portfolio. Under the new rules, a money market fund may invest no more than 5 percent of its assets in commercial paper that is not top-rated. **********The principal rating services are Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Duff & Phelps, and paper will be deemed to be top-rated if rated that way by two of the agencies, or, if only one rates the paper, by that agency. Previously, there had been no limit to such investments. **********In addition, investments in the paper of any one issuer will be limited to 5 percent of a fund's assets, if that issuer is top-rated, and to 1 percent otherwise. The old limit there had been 25 percent. Investments in United States Government securities are not restricted, and funds may continue to hold as much of those securities as they like. **********Marianne Smythe, the director of the S.E.C.'s division of investment management, said she understood that there were \"very, very few funds\" whose investments in paper that is not top-rated exceeds the new limits. She said the average money market fund now had about one-half percent of its assets in such securities, down from 10 to 15 percent in 1988. **********\"Now, the ceiling allows substantial room for growth\" in holdings of such assets, she said. **********Most of the rapid decline in such holdings was not caused by the pending S.E.C. rule. Instead, there was a general increase in credit quality concerns, spurred by commercial paper defaults by<biIntegrated Resources in 1989 and by Mortgage and Realty Trust last year. In each case, some money market funds held the commercial paper and would have suffered losses. But the sponsors of the funds, fearful of the bad publicity that would ensue from such an event, stepped in and took the losses themselves. **********Money market funds are a select group of mutual funds, subject to different rules from other funds. The S.E.C. chairman, Richard C. Breeden, emphasized that the change does not affect other mutual funds, which he noted were free to invest all their assets in risky securities, whether in long-term \"junk bonds\" or in low-rated commercial paper. **********One big difference in rules is that money market funds are not required to record their assets at market value every night, as are other funds, so long as the asset is expected to be redeemed on schedule at full value. A fund that buys a six-month Treasury bill, as many do, could see its value rise or fall based on daily interest-rate movements. If funds are \"marked to market,\" they would show those gains or losses, leaving the possibility of capital losses for some investors, something that funds wish to avoid. **********Money market funds have become a significant investment vehicle for millions of Americans. The Investment Company Institute, a trade group, said taxable money market funds now had about $455 billion in assets, with more than 20 million accounts. Including tax-exempt funds, which buy short-term municipal securities, total assets are about $530 billion. **********Investors in tax-exempt money funds will not have the same assurance of high quality. While the S.E.C.'s rules on investment maturities will apply, those limiting concentrations of assets, and limiting investments in low-rated securities, will not."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/20/business/company-news-shell-oil-plans-to-sell-its-alaskan-properties.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1991-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 294, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shell Oil Plans to Sell Its Alaskan Properties", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Shell Oil Plans to Sell Its Alaskan Properties", "body_text": " **********The Shell Oil Company said today that it planned to sell its oil and gas properties in Alaska as part of an effort to shed high-cost production operations in the United States. **********The company also said it had halted drilling in the deep waters of the Chukchi Sea about 80 miles west of Barrow, Alaska, and near waters controlled by the Soviet Union.

GOLDENSON, who is 85 years old, believes he knows television business: The ideas are not fresh enough, the programming is not risky enough and the executives are not young enough. **********In many respects, he said, the problems that the networks face today are not much different from those he faced in 1953 when he took control of a puny little network - five stations and eight affiliates - called the American Broadcasting Company. **********With the death of William S. Paley of CBS last year, Mr. Goldenson is the last of the television patriarchs. He was always the least well known, partly because the ascension of ABC followed so long after David Sarnoff's founding of NBC and Mr. Paley's master-building of CBS. **********But Mr. Goldenson also sought to avoid a high profile - mostly, he said, out of concern that he would bore people. \"Anybody more deadly than a television executive, I haven't found yet,\" he said. **********For that reason, Mr. Goldenson has augmented his autobiography, \"Beating the Odds,\" written with Marvin J. Wolf and published last week by Charles Scribner's Sons, with comments by more than 100 associates at ABC. The idea was to provide more than a single point of view on the rise of Mr. Goldenson's network, and also, he said, \"to get away from the ego trip approach that Paley and Sarnoff had in their books.\" **********Most of the characters in ABC's story are present and former employees, including many of the most powerful executives in the entertainment industry: Michael Eisner, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company; Barry Diller, the chairman of 20th Century Fox; Brandon Tartikoff, the chairman of NBC Entertainment; Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, the producers of some of television's most successful comedies, and ABC's own news president, Roone Arledge. **********Despite their similar roles, Mr. Goldenson said he had little interaction with Mr. Paley. He said he had a sense that \"CBS and NBC looked down their noses at us.\" **********Mr. Goldenson said Mr. Paley was upset when ABC built a headquarters in Manhattan that was just one block from CBS's framed \"Black Rock\" building. \"So I arranged to have an ABC logo put up on top of the building facing directly at CBS,\" he said. \"And at night it was illuminated. **********Mr. Goldenson said his real revenge on CBS and NBC was the development of a revolutionary programming strategy. In the mid-1950's, when ABC found it could hardly compete with the entrenched strength of the other two networks, researchers from Columbia University devised an approach that came to define ABC - and redefine the business of television advertising. Mr. Goldenson described the strategy: **********\"They came to us and said: 'What you've got to do is go after the young families of America; they're more apt to change and flip the dial than older people. Basically, they are the purchasing power of America.' **********\"At that time, advertisers were not buying television on that bases. We brought that idea to the advertisers. We had to convince them that these people had the buying power.\" **********He added: \"The idea sold. Surprisingly, CBS and NBC didn't respond to that until a number of years later. That was open sesame. They left the door open for us.\" **********Mr. Goldenston said the strategy for survival in what has become an even more competitive television environment ought to be exactly the same. \"I wouldn't deviate from the strategy,\" he said. He did acknowledge, however, that Fox Broadcasting, under Mr. Diller, an ABC alumnus, was doing the same thing to get established that ABC did 40 years ago. \"Barry's going for the offbeat, just as we did,\" he said. \"The Simpsons' is what 'Batman' was for us.\" **********Even with cable channels taking away large segments of the audience and with the population getting older, Mr. Goldenson said that aiming shows at younger viewers remained the way for a network to succeed. \"The population may be getting older, but the purchasing power is still people aged 18 to 49,\" he said. \"The older people, even though they have the money, obviously don't want to spend it. And we're only after the ones that want to spend their money.\" **********As for cable, Mr. Goldenson said he recognized how powerful a competitor it had become and, in fact, steered ABC's own investments in three cable channels, Arts & Entertainment, Lifetime and ESPN. **********Mr. Goldenson argues that even with the diminshed reached of the networks - down from a high of about 92 percent of the nation's homes to what he expects will be about 58 to 60 percent by the time the decline levels off - they will remain a powerful force. **********\"By the year 2000, we will pass 100 million homes with television,\" he said. \"Sixty percent of that is still a fantastic audience.\" **********Mr. Goldenson's gave up most of his active role as chairman of the company in 1986 when he agreed to sell the company to Capital Cities Communications. He is still the chairman of the company's executive committee. He also watches all the pilots of the network's new programs, making recommendations about his favorites - and his non-favorites. **********\"I didn't car for 'Twin Peaks' too much,\" he said. \"It was a cult show; I thought it never had a chance.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/06/business/the-media-business-ad-scene-agencies-hope-books-help-their-images.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1991-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 904, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Ad Scene; Agencies Hope Books Help Their Images", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Ad Scene; Agencies Hope Books Help Their Images", "body_text": " **********FROM the time he began drawing cartoons as a teen-ager, John Emmerling wondered how the mind and body conspired to make ideas a reality. Later, running his own advertising agency, he thought he could help other business executives harness their own creativity. So he wrote a book, \"It Only Takes One: How to Create the Right Idea and Then Make It Happen,\" which Simon & Schuster will publish later this month. **********But Mr. Emmerling acknowledges that more than altruism stoked his literary fires. \"Early on,\" he said, \"I realized, son of a gun, ad guy writes a book, pretty good for the ad guy's business.\" **********Inside every copywriter, it has long been said, is an author screaming to get out. But talk to the ad men and women who have written books and you will find that the screams are not from frustration, but for attention. Books are one of the advertising industry's most potent marketing tools. **********Today, Prentice Hall is scheduled to release \"The Day America Told the Truth,\" a survey of American attitudes toward sex, morality, work and religion, written by James Patterson and Peter Kim, two senior executives at J. Walter Thompson. **********And Young & Rubicam is currently circulating \"The One Place,\" a critical investigation by the agency of American education, which St. Martin's Press will publish in the fall. **********Like the book by Mr. Emmerling, the chief executive of John Emmerling Inc., these works appear unrelated to advertising. In fact, they are advertising's way of advertising itself. **********\"A book gives an agency credibility,\" said Hank Seiden, the chairman of Ketchum Advertising/New York, who wrote \"Advertising Pure and Simple\" in 1976. \"If you're in the process of soliciting business, it's wonderful. It's something the other agencies you're pitching against don't have.\" **********A book's effect on an advertising agency or executive can be monumental. When Jerry Della Femina wrote \"From Those Wonderful Folks Who Gave You Pearl Harbor: Front-Line Dispatches From the Advertising War\" in 1970, his agency, Della Femina, Travisano & Partners, was three years old and struggling to survive. He recalled that the week the book was published, the Schieffelin & Somerset liquor company got in touch with him. **********\"They had read the book, and signed us as their agency,\" Mr. Della Femina said. \"If it hadn't been for the book, I doubt this agency would be here. We're talking jobs, careers and fortunes made from the book.\" **********Agency executives believe that books can show off their knowledge and skills, even if the tomes are about something else. **********\"The Day America Told the Truth,\" for example, is a collection of titillating revelations, drawn from proprietary survey research, about how Americans supposedly lead their lives. Among its conclusions: women are morally superior to men and \"lying has become an integral part of the American culture.\" **********Mr. Patterson, the chairman of J. Walter Thompson North America, conceded that the book could tell advertisers as much about the agency as about the nation. \"I hope it makes clients and potential clients question the research they're currently getting,\" he said. \"To me, it just builds an argument for much deeper research in the product categories we're involved in.\" **********The Young & Rubicam book, to which the agency assigned a team of researchers, also has an advertising spinoff, even though its subject, the problems of the American educational system, seems far removed from marketing. The Y.&R. team recommended that schools should be open all day throughout the year, that schooling should begin for all children by the age of 2 1/2, and that teachers should receive more training in child development. **********Alex Kroll, the agency's chief executive, wrote in the book's introduction that Y.&R. reached these conclusions by acting \"as if the education establishment in this country had approached us like a paying client in trouble.\" It interviewed experts, analyzed data, talked with children and visited schools. **********\"One of our company's basic fundamental skills and reasons for being is understanding people and how they learn,\" Mr. Kroll said. \"I don't know if anybody reading the book would say, 'Here's an agency that knows these things,' but it is a demonstration of it.\" **********To make sure the demonstration has an audience, both Y.&R. and J. Walter Thompson are sending copies of their books to clients. Mr. Emmerling, whose agency specializes in trade advertising for magazines, is using his book more directly, to prospect for new clients. **********\"I've already done four presentations, including one in Toronto to 400 marketing people,\" he said. \"I expect I'll get more lecture invitations, but I will be judicious about it. If it's a marketing company or someone with an ad budget, I'll be delighted to meet with them. A group of dentists meeting in Tucson, I'll take a pass.\" **********Books by advertising people can be a liability. Perhaps the most famous ad book ever written, \"Confessions of an Advertising Man\" by David Ogilvy, helped put Ogilvy & Mather on Madison Avenue's road atlas. But it has also proved something of a burden to the agency, said Graham Phillips, Ogilvy's chief executive. **********\"When we break our own rules, clients remind us, 'This wasn't in David's book,' \" he said. \"They'll say, 'It says on page 6 not to use reverse type. So why are you using reverse type in this ad for us?' \""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/27/business/company-news-rochester-utility.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 78, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rochester Utility", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Rochester Utility", "body_text": " **********The Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation said the damage caused by a large ice storm in upstate New York earlier this month would cost it at least $25 million to repair and would cut first-quarter earnings by as much 7 cents a share.

Simultaneously, the Japanese Government funded a five-year, $12 billion drive to develop its own version of Metglas.

Best, the 92-year-old company on which thousands of American corporations and consumers depend for evaluations of the financial health of insurance companies, is being accused of grade inflation. A new study concludes that it is significantly easier for insurance companies to win a top rating from Best than from two other major raters of insurance companies -- Standard & Poor's and Moody's. **********The study was conducted by Joseph Belth, an Indiana University professor who is an expert on the insurance industry. He published his findings in the December 1990 issue of his Insurance Forum newsletter. The study comes at a time when the number of insurance-company failures is rising and public concern about the solvency of insurers is increasing. **********Professor Belth says that Best's apparent easing of requirements has caused some customers who buy its books, newsletters and other publications to lose faith in the rating agency. Some people in the industry agree.  Charges by Critics **********\"The Moody's and Standard & Poor's process is much more rigorous and the results are more meaningful than Best's,\" said Peter Hutchings, chief financial officer of the Guardian Life Insurance Company, based in New York. **********The real issue, people familiar with the situation say, is whether Best has loosened its requirements in response to increasing competitive pressures from S.& P., Moody's and a few smaller firms like Duff & Phelps. **********Some critics have argued privately that to hold on to the thousands of insurance companies across the country that pay in some cases tens of thousands of dollars to buy its publications, Best has eased the requirements A+ companies must meet. **********Best vigorously denies this accusation. \"Totally untrue,\" said Paul Wish, the spokesman for the A. M. Best Company, based in Oldwick, N.J. \"The ratings in the books have nothing to do with the sale of the books.\" **********Mr. Wish, defending Best's rating system, said: \"The major difference between us and them is that we take the long-term view. We look at an insurance company's long-term prospects, whereas Moody's and Standard & Poor's are more attuned to day-to-day changes in market conditions.\" **********An agency's rating is crucial to insurers because independent agents who sell life insurance steer customers to higher-rated companies. Some industry experts say that lower-rated insurers have to offer higher yields to attract consumers. A rating reduction can also force an insurance company to pay more interest when it borrows in the capital markets. **********And when many large corporations consider an insurance company, they want it to have top ratings from at least two major rating agencies.  Striking Differences in Ratings **********Professor Belth studied 100 life insurers rated by both the Standard & Poor's Corporation and Best. Of that group, 33 received Best's top A+ rating but were rated lower by S.& P. Over all, 53 of the 100 compared were rated higher by Best than by S.& P.; 36 were rated the same, and 11 were rated lower by Best. **********The study also found 62 life insurers rated by both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Best. Of that group, 34 were rated A+ by Best but received lower ratings from Moody's. Over all, 43 of the 62 fared better under the Best system than under the Moody's system; 16 were rated the same by both agencies, and 3 got a lower rating from Best. **********Some of the differences between Best's ratings and the other agencies' were striking. For instance, Best gave the Executive Life Insurance Company of Los Angeles a rating of \"contingent A,\" meaning it has the third-highest rating but is under review. The same insurer was rated 12 notches from the top by Moody's (a Ba2 rating) and by S.& P. (a BB rating). Executive Life's parent, the First Executive Corporation, has suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses on its portfolio of high-yield \"junk bonds,\" and many customers have cashed in their policies. **********\"What all this suggests to me is that the Best system is significantly looser than that of the competition,\" Professor Belth said. \"I am not saying that Best is selling out. I have no evidence of that. What I am saying is that it is easier to get a top rating from Best.\" **********Best said recently that its rating system essentially paralleled that of S.& P. and Moody's, meaning that a top rating from Best was equivalent to a top rating from S.& P. or Moody's, and so forth.  Differing Criteria **********Other factors may explain how Best ends up with higher ratings. The S.& P. and Moody's ratings are based on a fairly narrow criterion -- the ability of an insurer to pay claims. Best says it bases its ratings on the ability of an insurance company to meet all financial obligations. **********\"The mechanics for rating are the same, but the underlying philosophy is different,\" said Mr. Wish, the Best spokesman. **********Whatever the reason for Best's higher ratings, there is little disputing that Best, while still important in the insurance business, has seen its influence wane in recent years. **********\"While a decade ago most of the big brokers did not spend much time with it, today they have full-time research departments that get to know the insurers well,\" said Richard Heydinger, the senior insurance executive at Hallmark Cards Inc. in Kansas City, Mo. A Near Monopoly Until 1983 **********Nor is there much disputing that Best, which is privately held, has been facing new competition. For decades the company held a near monopoly on the business of rating insurers. Wall Street analysts published reports on publicly held insurance companies, but it was not until 1983 that S.& P. got into the business. Moody's started in 1986. Both companies still have much smaller operations than Best's but their influence has been rising as policyholders have grown concerned about the ability of insurers to pay claims. **********Recognizing that the risks insurers face have been changing along with the investments insurers make with their income from premiums, many industrial companies now subscribe to more than one rating agency. **********Moody's, S.& P. and Duff & Phelps tend to focus more than Best on an insurer's financial results. This emphasis reflects their background as bond-rating agencies. By contrast, Best, in making its rating, tends to look beyond the numbers at aspects of the overall quality of an organization, like experience of management, modernization of the back office and the speed of payment of claims. **********\"Some people are saying that in a much more complex world, Best may no longer be as adequate as it used to be,\" said Richard Hackenberg, an executive vice president in Boston for Caroon & Black, the big insurance brokerage firm."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/20/world/the-soviet-crisis-yeltsin-s-remarks-a-reactionary-coup.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 454, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yeltsin's Remarks: A 'Reactionary Coup'", "print_headline": "THE SOVIET CRISIS; Yeltsin's Remarks: A 'Reactionary Coup'", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from remarks made in Moscow today by Boris N.

Despite all the difficulties and severe trials being experienced by the people, the democratic process in the country is acquiring an increasingly broad sweep and an irreversible character. **********The peoples of Russia are becoming masters of their destiny. The uncontrolled powers of unconstitutional organs have been considerably limited, and this includes party organs. **********The leadership of Russia has adopted a resolute position toward the union treaty striving for the unity of the Soviet Union and unity of Russia. Our position on this issue permitted a considerable acceleration of the preparation of this treaty, to coordinate it with all the republics and to determine the date of signing as Aug 20. Tomorrow's signing has been cancelled. **********These developments gave rise to angry reactionary forces, pushed them to irresponsible and adventurist attempts to solve the most complicated political and economic problems by methods of force. Attempts to realize a coup have been tried earlier. Citizens' Rebuff Urged **********We considered and consider that such methods of force are unacceptable. They discredit the union in the eyes of the whole world, undermine our prestige in the world community, and return us to the cold-war era along with the Soviet Union's isolation in the world community. All of this forces us to proclaim that the so-called committee's ascendancy to power is unlawful. **********Accordingly we proclaim all decisions and instructions of this committee to be unlawful. **********We are confident that the organs of local power will unswervingly adhere to constitutional laws and decrees of the President of Russia. **********We appeal to citizens of Russia to give a fitting rebuff to the putschists and demand a return of the country to normal constitutional development. **********Undoubtedly it is essential to give the country's President, Gorbachev, an opportunity to address the people. Today he has been blockaded. I have been denied communications with him. We demand an immediate convocation of an extraordinary Congress of People's Deputies of the Union. We are absolutely confident that our countrymen will not permit the sanctioning of the tyranny and lawlessness of the putschists, who have lost all shame and conscience. We address an appeal to servicemen to manifest lofty civic duty and not take part in the reactionary coup. **********Until these demands are met, we appeal for a universal unlimited strike."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/08/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-456891.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 181, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; People", "body_text": " *********** Roger Neill, chief executive at Bozell Europe, London, is leaving the company.

Gorbachev and leaders of seven republics agreed to work toward a loose new \"Union of Sovereign States,\" with the republics deciding what powers to delegate central authorities. **********The State Council also confirmed the plan for a new Ministry of External Relations responsible for foreign policy and foreign economic relations, coordinated by a council of republican foreign ministers.  Authority in Flux **********That was the basic plan, at any rate. **********But like many other officials unexpectedly catapulted into a senior office by the coup, Mr. Pankin has discovered that a major part of his new job is trying to figure out what that job is and struggling to keep it from being swallowed by the republics, especially by the increasingly aggressive Russian republic. **********While Mr. Pankin was in Madrid acting as co-chairman of the Middle East peace conference late last month, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia suddenly announced that the Foreign Ministry should be cut by 90 percent, sending shock waves among the 12,700 staffers and diplomats. **********\"The proposal to cut the Ministry by 90 percent was a metaphor, like telling someone 'I haven't seen you in a thousand years',\" Mr. Pankin insisted. The current plan, he said, was to cut the total staff of the two ministries by half, and to reduce foreign missions sharply. **********\"In essence, the decision was that our country needs a single foreign policy worked out by the Union of Sovereign Republics and enacted in their name and with the participation of the sovereign republics,\" he said. The responsibilities of the Ministry would include issues of disarmament, compliance with international agreements and treaties, representation at the United Nations and other international forums and bilateral relations.  Powers of Republics **********\"All else remains with the republics,\" he said, listing economic, cultural, scientific and humanitarian relations and regional issues. **********Whether this division of responsibility will hold up, and how much control the republics will maintain over the center, and what republics will opt to participate at all, are all questions yet to be answered. **********According to an article in Thursday's issue of the newspaper Izvestia, the battle over the Foreign Ministry is not yet over. The paper quoted the foreign minister of the Russian republic, Andrei Kozyrev, criticizing \"the men in the 'wedding cake' \" -- those at the all-Union Foreign Ministry -- for failing so far \"to draw lessons from the current developments.\" **********Mr. Kozyrev has been one of the sharpest critics of the central ministry, and in the Izvestia article he outlined the transfer of far more functions to republican foreign ministries than Mr. Pankin did. Among other things, he said the republics should take aver all regional departments of the central ministry, those sections directly in charge of relations with foreign countries. **********Izvestia said further that republics were demanding that ambassadors be appointed by the council of foreign ministers, and be responsible to the republic leaders. That would effectively strip bilateral relations away from the central ministry and leave it largely with the role of coordinating the actions of the republics. **********Mr. Pankin, however, did not seem ready to let his ministry be dissected without a fight. While he agreed that deep cuts were necessary and inevitable, he also argued that a concerted foreign policy was essential. **********The cost of administering Soviet foreign affairs, he said, was a fraction of what the United States or West European governments spent. The total expenditure in foreign currency, he said, was $150 million to $200 million, compared with $3.5 billion in the United States. **********Mr. Pankin also argued against any suggestion that he has not done enough. His three months in office, he said, had seen a major human rights conference in Moscow, a joint statement with the United States on Afghanistan, new agreements with the East European states, revival of relations with Israel and the opening of a conference on the Middle East, and new openings to South Africa.  Collapse of Hard-Liners **********All these were made possible by the collapse of forces that used to resist any movement toward a new foreign policy -- the old Ministries of Defense and Internal Affairs, the K.G.B. and the military-industrial complex. **********The minister talked in a reception room of the gloomy, neo-Gothic \"wedding cake\" Foreign Ministry building on Smolensk Square into which he was thrust after the August coup in large part because of his alacrity in condemning the putsch from his post as ambassador to Prague. His predecessor at the Ministry, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, was dismissed for the opposite reason -- for being too slow to say anything about the putsch. **********But in the current situation, Mr. Pankin said, even Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin were learning that taking responsibility did not win applause. **********\"I'm in the same position at my level,\" he said. \"It's hard to expect that people will applaud if we restore diplomatic relations with Israel, or talk to the Afghan mujahedeen now in Moscow. To me it is most important to follow my image of what is right, what is good for the country and the nation. For now that works. **********\"If the country falls apart into 12 different states and doesn't need a Foreign Ministry, then it won't need a Minister, either. In the meantime, our line has been accepted and approved, also by Yeltsin.

In the first 16 days of the year, European markets fell 6.7 percent, on top of a decline of more than 18 percent between Aug. 2, 1990, the day of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and the end of last year, according to the Financial Times index. **********But by early March, the euphoria over the success of the Allied effort in the Persian Gulf had helped to push the Financial Times index of European markets up 12.6 percent in dollar terms, the high for the year. In September, the European markets hit their 1991 high in local currencies: a gain of 20.6 percent through Sept. 2. **********Japan's market reached its high point in dollar terms in February, up 17.8 percent, and in local terms, up 17.1 percent, in March. **********As a whole, the Financial Times's index of world markets is up 10.4 percent in dollar terms so far this year. But that is just two thirds of what the gain was when the index reached its high for the year just over a month ago, right before the American market took its big tumble on Nov. 15. **********The lost gains seem even more dramatic in terms of local stock market indexes, which are in the home currency and have a different blend of stocks than the Financial Times index. By this measure all the stock markets in the Group of Seven are below their highs by about 50 percent or more -- except in the United States. **********In Germany, the Dax index of 30 leading shares is up 11.5 percent for the year, after rallying to a 23 percent gain at its high. In Canada, the Toronto index of 300 shares is up only 3.2 percent after an 11 percent high. In Japan, the market was up 14 percent at its peak but then was down 10 percent until the Friday rally, which leaves it down 4.6 percent for the year. The CAC index of 40 shares in France has fallen sharply recently and is now up 11.2 percent for the year after reaching a peak gain of 24 percent. **********In Britain, the FT-SE 100 index reached an all-time high in September, putting it up 25 percent for the year. But that gain has now shrunk to 14.4 percent. In Italy, the 20 percent gain seen in June has evaporated. The Banca Commerciale Italiana index is now down 4.6 percent for the year. **********For the American investing abroad, the dollar's performance has been important. Its rise against European currencies contributed to the lackluster performance there. But it fell against the yen, helping turn losses into gains. And if the dollar, which was up about 25 percent against the German mark this year, had not fallen sharply recently, the small gains would probably have been losses. **********In Europe, the dollar is still up about 10 percent against the mark and that was enough to cut the stock gains, when they are translated back into dollars, to 4.1 percent in dollars from 10.6 percent in local terms by the end of last week. **********Right now, the outlook for next year is not great. While the recent declines would suggest there are bargains available, the list of negatives is hard to ignore. Among the problems: high interest rates in Europe and no likelihood of an easing soon; worries about the recovery in Britain and the United States and the slowdowns elsewhere in Europe and in Japan; downgrades in estimates of corporate earnings almost everywhere because of the sour economies, and worries about the course of events in the former Soviet Union, which have a dramatic impact in Germany. **********In addition, there is the dollar. If the American economy does begin to recover and confidence rebounds, the dollar is likely to begin to rise again. And that would cut into profits when investments overseas are turned back into dollars. **********In its most recent world investment report, Goldman Sachs takes a view that blends advice to practice restraint with the need to sell stocks. The firm concludes: **********\"There are good reasons for believing that equities might underperform in the short term, including the possibility that markets are likely to remain nervous about the economy. However, investors might consider that equities do well in January, that it pays to buy undervalued markets in January and that by being out of the market now, investors could miss a significant up side.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/08/business/briefs-176891.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 392, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Angeles Corp., Los Angeles, an investment management company, has sold three of its Florida home parks in separate transactions for a combined total of more than $20 million. * Canada Packers Inc., Toronto, reached an agreement to sell its Dairy division to Ault Foods Ltd., a wholly owned unit of John Labatt Ltd.

Although the executive had been with the company for nearly two decades, and his performance was deemed consistently outstanding, top management hired an investigator to examine his credentials before sending him abroad -- and was dismayed. **********The executive did not have the Ph.D. in biology he claimed and the university he said he received it from did not even exist. \"His certificate was a phony, from one of the diploma mills,\" said Jeremiah McAward, president of McAward Associates Inc., the New York-based firm that handled the case.  \"The situation could have been terribly embarrassing if he'd gone to Europe and been uncovered as a fraud.\" **********Pre-employment background checks are commonly used by corporations, mainly as a way to avoid negligent-hiring liability suits by shareholders or customers. But midcareer resume investigations are also on the rise. Mr. McAward, whose firm conducts several hundred searches each month for corporations nationwide, does 20 percent of his business in that area, up from 10 percent in 1986. \"Corporations today are more conscious of their image,\" he said. \"They're wary not just of who they hire, but who they promote. They think top management should be like Caesar's wife.\" **********Many corporations, of course, uncover imposters themselves. One executive from a Fortune 500 company boasted of his participation in the Aspen Institute, an elite management society. At a dinner party one night, his boss introduced him to another member of the institute, who was astonished he had not met the executive. It turned out that the executive had never been a member. Although he wasn't fired, he's unlikely to be advanced. \"I'm not sure we'd be comfortable with him in a more senior role,\" said a spokesman for the company. **********A variety of events can bring about a resume investigation: a promotion or transfer to a position of greater visibility, an assignment to a classified project, a move from a nonfiduciary role to a fiduciary one. An executive might also be scrutinized before being appointed to a management committee or elected to a board of directors. In such situations, the executive's corporate biography is usually rewritten and verified. **********Some investigations stem from less favorable circumstances. An executive may become the target of a witch hunt by industry watchdogs, or the subject of an expose by the news media. Colleagues or competitors may have blown the whistle, revealing damaging information. Jeff (Mad Dog) Beck, a rainmaker on Wall Street in the 1980's, worked at four different investment banks before The Wall Street Journal reported that he had fabricated stories about his work and family background. While some of his colleagues had long doubted his stories, no one wanted to challenge someone of Mr. Beck's status. **********Since checking credentials can arouse needless suspicion among people who aren't involved, experts advise sensitivity. \"These investigations are generally done very, very quietly,\" said Tom Norton, president of Fidelifacts, an agency based in New York. \"Once somebody's been at a company for a while, it's more a matter of reviewing records and making sure they're accurate. You don't want to draw attention to the process.\" **********Some people try to undo the damage before it can be used against them. According to a 1987 study by Personnel Administrator magazine, nearly 20 percent of 300 personnel managers at major American corporations have been approached by employees attempting to correct their records. Most ofthese employees were subsequently demoted or dismissed. **********Rather than track down credentials themselves, companies often turn to executive recruiters for help. \"If we had a question about an executive's resume, we'd probably ask the recruiters who brought him in about it,\" said Peter Thorpe, a human resources administrator at Citicorp. **********But recruiters can't always help.  \"The value of the working papers on an assignment is about three years,\" said Dwight Foster, executive managing director of Foster Partners, a recruiting firm affiliated with KPMG/Peat Marwick. \"After that, the records may be destroyed.\" **********That's where the investigative agencies come in. Over the last decade, these businesses have proliferated, charging anywhere from $50 to $500 per search. With an employee's name, address, social security number and birthdate, they can access considerable information from computer data bases kept by universities and government agencies. While no comprehensive statutes regulate employees' privacy, employers do have to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which requires them to notify employees in writing of their intention to obtain certain documents like credit reports. **********Companies often want to examine employee's bank records, outstanding bills, loan defaults and tax liens before a promotion or a transfer. \"If you've got a $2 billion operation in Europe, a guy who can't manage his own financial affairs might not have the kind of judgment necessary for that challenge,\" said one executive recruiter. **********Ultimately, the safest measure is to conduct a thorough background check at the start. Said Mr. Norton, who estimates that 30 percent of resumes he sees contain errors, \"The first mistake is neglecting to investigate someone when you hire him. \"  HOMING IN ON THE CHIEF OFFENDERS **********In faking credentials, it is academic records that people most often try to doctor. \"There's a whole bunch of people who are all done with their Ph.D., except for their dissertation,\" said Dwight Foster of Foster Partners, a New York executive recruiting firm. \"They don't see any problem with putting the Ph.D. on their resume, because they feel they've earned it.\" **********At Columbia University in New York, the registrar's office uncovers several thousand cases of misrepresentation each year. But it's tougher to determine authenticity if a degree is from an unknown institution. Agencies keep track of phony universities, as well as defunct ones. Foreign countries, particularly England, are popular locales for bogus alma maters. Even trickier are those universities where data has been destroyed. **********\"One list we keep well guarded consists of bona fide schools that had fires in their record rooms,\" said Jeremiah McAward, head of McAward Associates. \"An executive could say, for instance, that he graduated from the Sorbonne in 1963 and no one could doubt his word.\" **********Another common ploy involves passing oneself off as the past president of a defunct corporation. To prevent such shams, private detectives develop extensive libraries of old telephone books. \"If somebody tells us he worked for XYZ company in 1965, we can immediately check whether XYZ ever existed,\" said Tom Norton, president of Fidelifacts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/21/world/air-force-to-cut-philippines-units.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1991-06-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 545, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AIR FORCE TO CUT PHILIPPINES UNITS", "print_headline": "AIR FORCE TO CUT PHILIPPINES UNITS", "body_text": " **********The United States Air Force announced today that it would evacuate more than half of its uniformed personnel in the Philippines because of an erupting volcano that has coated a major American air base in ash, making it unusable. **********The pullout of 4,500 of the 7,000 active-duty workers assigned to Clark Air Base would be the first major withdrawal of American military personnel from the Philippines since Mount Pinatubo unleashed a series of deadly eruptions last week.

Its shipyards employ thousands of skilled Filipino workers. **********The lease agreement permitting American use of Clark and Subic expires in September, and American and Filipino negotiators have been haggling over a lease renewal for months.

Gorbachev of the Soviet Union in Oslo as winner of the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize, as translated by the Nobel committee: **********Today peace means an ascent from mere coexistence to cooperation and common creative endeavor among countries and nations. Peace is movement toward globality and universality of civilization. Never before has the idea that peace is indivisible been as true as it is now. **********Peace is not unity in similarity, but unity in diversity, in the juxtaposing and reconciling of differences. And ideally peace means the absence of violence, an ethical value. But here we must recall Rajiv Gandhi, who died so tragically a few days ago. I consider the decision of your committee as a recognition of the great international importance of the changes now under way in the Soviet Union, and as an expression of confidence in our policy of new thinking, which is based on the conviction that at the end of the 20th century, force and arms will have to give way as a major instrument in world politics. **********I view the decision to award me the Nobel Peace Prize as an act of solidarity with the monumental undertaking which has already placed enormous demands on the Soviet people in terms of effort, costs, hardships, will and character.                    . . . **********As for the foreign policy aspect, there was the East-West confrontation, a rigid division into friends and foes, two hostile camps with a corresponding set of cold war attributes. Both East and West were constrained by the logic of military confrontation and were wearing themselves down ever more by the arms race. The mere thought of dismantling existing structures did not come easily. However, the realization that we faced, domestically and internationally, inevitable disaster gave us the strength to make a historic choice, a choice I have never since regretted. Policies and Peace **********Perestroika, which once again is returning our people to common sense, has enabled us to open up to the world, and has restored a normal relationship between the internal development of the country and its foreign policy. **********But all this takes a lot of hard work. To a people which believed that the Government's policies had always been true to the cause of peace, to them we proposed what was in many ways a different policy, which would genuinely serve the cause of peace, but differed from the prevailing view of what it meant, and particularly from the established stereotypes as to how we should protect peace. In a word, we proposed new thinking in foreign policy. **********We thus embarked on a path of major changes, which may turn out to be the most significant in the 20th century, significant for our own country and for its peoples, but also for the entire world.                    . . . **********Being resolute in the pursuit of perestroika, a subject of much discussion these days, must be measured by the commitment to democratic change. Resoluteness does not mean a return to repression, diktat or suppression of rights and freedoms. I will never agree to seeing our society once again being divided into reds and whites, into those who self-appointedly claim to speak and act on behalf of the people and those who are enemies of the people. Soviet Foreign Relations **********Resolution today means acting within the framework of political and social pluralism and the rule of law to insure conditions for continuing reform and preventing the collapse of the state and economic collapse, to prevent elements of chaos from assuming catastrophic proportions. All this means taking certain tactical steps, to search for various ways of addressing both short- and long-term tasks.                    . . . **********Ladies and gentlemen, international politics is another area where a great deal depends on the correct interpretation of what is now happening in the Soviet Union. It is true today and will remain true tomorrow. We are now approaching what might be the crucial point when the world community and, above all, the states with the greatest potential to influence world developments will have to decide on their attitude to the Soviet Union, and on the basis of real deeds. The more I reflect on what is happening in the world today, the more I am convinced that the world needs perestroika no less than the Soviet Union itself does. Fortunately, the present generation of politicians for the most part are becoming ever more deeply aware of this interrelationship, and also the fact that now, when perestroika has entered its critical phase, the Soviet Union is entitled to expect large-scale support to insure its success. **********Recently we have been seriously rethinking the substance and role of our economic cooperation with other countries, above all the major Western nations. We realize, of course, that we have to carry out measures which would enable us genuinely to open up to the world economy and become an organic part of it. But at the same time we have come to the conclusion that we need a kind of synchronization of our actions toward that end with the Group of Seven and the European communities. In other words, we're thinking of a fundamentally new phase in our international cooperation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/08/business/bond-unit-to-be-liquidated.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bond Unit to Be Liquidated", "print_headline": "Bond Unit to Be Liquidated", "body_text": " **********The family-owned company of Alan Bond, the Australian financier, has been shut down with debts of more than $760 million. **********John Lord, of the Australian accounting firm Duesburys, was named to liquidate Mr. Bond's company, Dallhold Investments, at a federal court hearing here on Friday. **********Dallhold said in court papers that its total debts were more than $760 million (United States), while its assets totaled $30.4 million at best. **********The move to liquidate followed the appointment on Wednesday of receivers for Mr. Bond's last large asset, a stake in the Greenvale nickel-mining venture in Queensland.

The protesters carry homemade banners and signs that read \"Freeworld Save Us,' and \"Dead Better than Red.\" **********\"So far the demonstrations have been peaceful and orderly, but everyone is very, very anxious, and some extremists are pushing for more violent actions,\" said David Liu, a spokesman for Refugee Concern Hong Kong, an umbrella organization of relief groups that work inside the camps."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/26/world/war-in-the-gulf-phone-numbers-for-relatives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Phone Numbers for Relatives", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF; Phone Numbers for Relatives", "body_text": " **********The Pentagon has set up special 24-hour telephone lines to be used by relatives of military personnel seeking information about the status of family members stationed in the Persian Gulf.

I was a student in the greasy hamburger school of nutrition for my first 43 years and in 1966 I suffered a massive heart attack. I was thin; I didn't smoke; I exercised before it was fashionable. But a shocking 300 cholesterol level got my attention. **********An inquisitive mind combined with the cholesterol information available persuaded me to reduce my cholesterol level to 150. I began telling my story. Only my family accepted my cholesterol advice until 1984, when the Government, in a 10-year, $150 million study, validated the connection between high cholesterol and heart attacks. The time seemed right to take my \"cholesterol kills\" message to the public. **********I established the National Heart Savers Association in January 1985. We did the first citywide cholesterol testing in America in Grand Island, Neb., that year. We did not even know if people wanted to know their cholesterol level. In five days we tested 8,500 people in a city of 35,000. **********In the next two years we tested the cholesterol levels of more than 200,000 people in 16 cities. We also created \"National Know Your Cholesterol Month\" and got it approved by Congress. We tested the cholesterol levels of more than 20,000 Capitol Hill staffers, including more than 50 Senators and 100-plus Congressmen. We also sent 11,000 letters to food processors asking them to remove highly saturated coconut oil and palm oil from their products. But at the time, nobody listened. **********The food giants' lack of interest in our calls and letters led to our first \"poisoning of America\" campaign -- full-page national newspaper advertisements castigating the major food processors. We alerted the public to the \"No Cholesterol\" and \"Pure Vegetable Oil\" distortions on product labels that contained tropical oils. When ingested, these oils turn into deadly cholesterol. Outraged protests by consumers brought massive reformulations. **********Meat and high-fat dairy products make up three-fourths of our saturated fat intake. It was a natural evolution from these earlier efforts to our McDonald's \"Poisoning of America\" campaign. We called on the chain to lower the fat in its hamburgers and remove beef tallow from its french fries. **********Our national full-page advertisements brought dramatic results. A Gallup Poll showed 31 percent of the public had heard our message and 38 percent of them had decreased their visits to fast-food restaurants as a result. McDonald's, after citing an \"eight year study,\" took just three weeks to remove beef tallow from its french fries after our advertisements ran. The other fast-food chains followed. **********The public does not realize the dramatic power it wields. The consumer's wish is big business's command. **********Another example of \"people power\" was demonstrated during the national food-labeling bill debate in the Senate last October. **********Many food processors did not want more detailed ingredient labeling of their foods for obvious reasons. After passing the House of Representatives, the bill languished in the Senate. We ran a series of four national advertisements citing opponents of the bill and asked people to call their senators and representatives to express support for food labeling. They did. **********I am proud to repeat the words that Representative Henry Waxman of California, the bill's author, said about me after the bill was finally passed: \"His ads played such an important role in educating the public and the Congress. What he was able to do on his own as an individual is an inspiration. This bill is a tribute to his tenacity.\" **********The American people passed that bill. They made their wishes known to lawmakers and will be rewarded next year with the identification of cholesterol, saturated fat, sodium, calories, and other important nutritional information, on all packaged foods. **********The big picture is that Americans know lowering cholesterol can extend their life span. That awareness is not wasted on the food giants, which are now bringing to market a variety of delicious low-cholesterol, low-saturated-fat foods. **********The new 9 percent fat hamburger that McDonald's introduced -- down from 20 to 30 percent -- is also available to other restaurants and to supermarkets everywhere. With hamburger making up 44 percent of the meat we consume, the potential for lowering the cholesterol levels of Americans is truly mind-boggling. McDonald's and I are now working the same territory. The public's nutritional needs make for strange bedfellows."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/14/business/media-business-advertising-j-c-penney-fires-ayer-after-8-years-hires-bozell.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 717, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "J.

Penney Company yesterday abruptly dismissed Ayer Inc., its agency for eight years, and hired Bozell Inc. **********Executives of the nation's fourth-largest retailer said the change, effective Oct. 1, was unrelated to the quality of Ayer's award-winning work. Instead, they said, they were drawn to the abilities of Bozell/Southwest, as Bozell's Dallas office is known. **********While \"we've been very pleased over the years with our relationship with Ayer,\" Robert B. Gill, Penney's vice chairman and chief operating officer, said in a telephone interview from Dallas, \"the main thrust is that the resources down here available to us through Bozell are substantially larger and more in depth than what we could have.\" **********At 450 employees, Bozell/Southwest's office is 10 times the size of Ayer's office in Dallas, which opened in 1988 to serve Penney after the retailer moved its corporate headquarters from New York. **********Though Mr. Gill said the recession was not a factor in Penney's decision to change agencies, the soft retail environment is slowing Penney's ambitious program to change the company's image among shoppers. Once a plain-vanilla merchandiser of everything from ties to tires, Penney has in the last decade strived to transform itself into a modish national department-store chain concentrating on apparel. But during the recession, Penney's same-store sales growth has been hurt as many of its present or potential customers turned to discount retailers. **********Penney's sales this year \"have been disappointing, as have those for most of the recession-sensitive retail industry,\" said a memo distributed to Ayer employees. \"At times like this, an advertising agency's prior record of success is easily forgotten.\" **********A national image campaign that Ayer created soon after it became Penney's agency in 1983, \"You're looking smarter than ever,\" is credited by retail analysts as helping change consumer perceptions of Penney. A replacement campaign, \"Fashion comes to life.\" was introduced last year. **********Penney's billings this year were to total $45.6 million, said Ayer's New York-based top executives, who are deeply disappointed by yet another large account loss. And the timing could not have been worse: Penney's announcement came as another client, The National Sports Daily, announced that it was going out of business. **********\"We've had nothing but praise from Penney,\" Jerry J. Siano, Ayer's chairman and chief executive, said at a news conference in his Manhattan office. \"It's discouraging. It's just not understandable. What else can I say?\" Mr. Siano and Thomas F. Maxey, vice chairman, deferred questions about the fate of their Dallas employees, who might seek additional accounts there to add to a now bittersweet recent addition, the Dallas Chamber of Commerce. **********Penney's shift brings to an estimated $600 million the value of the important national accounts being reassigned, or placed in review, since the recession began in July. Almost every client involved in this unusual spate of switching finds itself fighting fiercely for ever-scarcer consumer dollars. Among them: American Isuzu Motors, Avis, Club Med, Reebok, Subaru of America and Vons supermarkets. **********At Ayer, Penney's loss is the latest in a skein exceeding $200 million, including Burger King, Continental Airlines and Citicorp's New York branch banking. **********\"It's no secret that Bozell has been courting the business ever since Penney moved from New York to Dallas,\" Mr. Maxey said. Bozell last year was named Penney's agency for a cable television shopping channel that was later discontinued. **********Liener Temerlin, Bozell's chairman, chuckled at a characterization of Bozell as nipping at Ayer's heels for Penney's favor. During a telephone interview from Dallas, where he is based, Mr. Temerlin described Bozell as having tried \"to let them know who we are and what we can do.\" The cable account \"gave us a chance to flex some creative muscles,\" he added. The Penney victory gives Bozell/Southwest the accounts of four of the five largest corporations with Dallas headquarters, Mr. Temerlin said, including American Airlines and Texas Instruments. And it brings Bozell/Southwest billings to $380 million, he added. That is very close to the billings of the largest of Bozell's nine full-service United States offices, the New York headquarters office. **********In addition to the spending coordinated through Penney's agency, the retailer also spends an estimated $275 million a year on advertising, like circulars, created in-house. Penney's total spending, at around $320 million, makes it the nation's 27th-largest advertiser."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/12/world/arms-issue-drives-us-soviet-policy.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Rosenthal", "pub_date": "1991-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 873, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARMS ISSUE DRIVES U.S. SOVIET POLICY", "print_headline": "ARMS ISSUE DRIVES U.S. SOVIET POLICY", "body_text": " **********While confident that there is no threat to American security from the Soviet upheaval, the Bush Administration believes the system of control over Soviet nuclear weapons is in danger of breaking down and that the breakaway republics have not yet worked out a way to replace it, officials said today. **********As Washington watched a growing number of republics support the commonwealth formed by Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia, the safety of Soviet nuclear weapons has become the driving force behind American policy on the rapid changes in what Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, has taken to calling \"the former Soviet Union.\" **********In public, President Bush and his top aides have taken care to reassure Americans that they have seen nothing to indicate that the 27,000 Soviet nuclear weapons are in danger of falling into the hands of someone who might consider using them. **********There also is no sign that any of the political factions in the Soviet Union are interested in taking control of the weapons for any reason other than to destroy them, officials said. Indeed, they said, some Administration officials have been suggesting that the United States should consider making separate deals to destroy nuclear weapons with some of the republics that have them on their soil. Assurances 'Pretty Good' **********\"We have a keen interest, the whole world does, in the nuclear questions there, and frankly, assurances have been pretty good there,\" Mr. Bush told reporters at a White House photo session today. **********But Administration officials have been unable, or unwilling, to say precisely what guarantees they have received from President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and other republic officials. **********And it is clear both from public statements by Administration officials and from their private comments that Washington believes the decision by Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia to declare an end to the Soviet Union is a direct threat to the command structure that controls Soviet nuclear weapons. **********Replacing that structure with one equally centralized and equally reliable would be a top priority of the Bush Administration if Mr. Yeltsin's attempt to form a commonwealth of former Soviet republics succeeds, officials said. **********\"I see no reason to alarm the American people, but it's something that we are following extraordinarily closely and we are in touch,\" Mr. Bush said today. Yeltsin's Position Called Strong **********The Administration has tried to follow a scrupulously neutral tone in public toward the struggle for power between the republics and Mr. Gorbachev, based on what officials said was a conclusion by Mr. Bush that taking sides could only worsen an already tense situation and run the risk of leaving the United States' seeming to be on the wrong side when the dust settles. **********But the Bush Administration was closely following today's moves by more republics to back Mr. Yeltsin and there were outward signs of a growing conclusion in the Administration that Mr. Gorbachev stood to lose the fight. **********In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Robert S. Strauss, the American Ambassador to Moscow, said today's developments put \"President Yeltsin in a very strong position vis-a-vis President Gorbachev.\" **********\"He obviously is much stronger politically than President Gorbachev, who's in the decline,\" Mr. Strauss said. **********\"My personal view is there is a role for President Gorbachev, and a very significant one,\" he said, but added: \"Unquestionably President Yeltsin and his various ministers are the people with whom we'll deal.\" **********Thus far, American policy toward the Soviet Union has been predicated on a conclusion by Mr. Bush's team of Soviet specialists in the White House that the struggle for power in the Soviet Union will be resolved relatively quickly, perhaps as early this week, officials said. Civil Violence Feared **********But if there is no quick resolution, that could strain Washington's studied neutrality. The President and his advisers are also considering what options they might have in that case, especially because of Washington's concerns about who is controlling Soviet nuclear weapons. **********These concerns are part of Mr. Bush's consideration of virtually every area of Soviet-American relations. For example, American willingness to help the Soviet Union get through what is expected to be a tough winter is not just based on humanitarian interests. It also is based on a fear that food shortages could provoke civil violence. The United States wants very much to avoid the kind of warfare that has rent Yugoslavia in a country that has nuclear weapons. **********Beyond that, compliance with treaties requiring the destruction of some Soviet nuclear weapons would be much simpler if the United States had a central miliitary authority to work with. **********But on Tuesday, Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, said, \"We face a period of uncertainty as Russia and the other republics sort out possession of the weapons and establish new structures and procedures for controlling and operating them.\" **********And in a separate appearance on Tuesday, Mr. Strauss said: \"Everyone says, 'We know we need a unified control and we will cooperate in getting it for you, in seeing that you have it.' Do we have that now?

The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index and the New York Stock Exchange composite index each advanced to new highs, a clear demonstration that investors were coming in across the board. **********Analysts could not point to any one factor to explain the wave of market euphoria but pointed to a steadily building series of individual events that together meant the economy was gradually improving.  'A Lot of Small Things' **********\"It's a combination of a lot of small things.\" said Peter J. Canelo, chief investment strategist for County NatWest Securities. \"One huge plus,\" he said, was that the dollar rallied yesterday against both the Japanese yen and the German mark. **********\"This tells foreign investors that maybe the U.S. is not such a bad place to invest,\" Mr. Canelo added. **********Hugh Johnson, chief strategist for the First Albany Corporation, said, \"The fundamentals don't look particularly inspiring, but I learned a long time ago you don't argue with the stock market.\" **********In an even stronger sign of broad stock buying, the Wilshire 5,000 index, representative of just about every stock, reached a record 3,582.30, up 68.48, or almost 2 percent.

Program trading, typically 10 percent of the day's activity, accounted for almost 24 points of the Dow's gain, Birinyi Associates said. **********Except for a small selloff in the final 30 minutes, the Dow moved sharply higher throughout the session. Short-sellers, who sell borrowed stock and hope to profit from price declines, moved in several times during the day but were repeatedly forced to buy back their stock to avoid losses.  Big Board Steps In **********Buying was so heavy that the Dow was ahead 50 points by 2:39 P.M., at which point the New York Stock Exchange intervened and imposed its 50-point rule. **********When the Dow moves ahead 50 points or more, the Big Board bars program traders from buying any stock, in the S.& P. 500 for example, at a price higher than the previous price, in effect halting most activity for the rest of the day. The procedure is also used when prices are falling to prevent program trading from exaggerating price movements. **********Four stocks -- I.B.M., Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble and Westinghouse -- accounted for more than a fourth of the gain in the Dow blue chips. **********I.B.M., the leader, jumped 2 7/8, to 133 1/2, with almost 2.5 million shares changing hands. Philip Morris, a highly recommended growth stock, climbed 2 1/4, to 67 5/8, with 3.6 million shares changing hands. Procter & Gamble, which has its eyes on Revlon Inc., rose 1 5/8, to 84 3/4, while Westinghouse, project leader for an international group planning to upgrade the Soviet air-traffic control network, advanced 1 5/8, to 29 5/8. Trading in Westinghouse stock jumped to 3.1 million shares. **********\"It's very hard to point to any fundamental development,\" Mr. Johnson said of yesterday's strong advance. \"The market's been saying for some time that the recession is going to end and recovery will start at the end of the second or start of the third quarter.\" **********But, he said, \"The reason it's doing as well as it's doing is the behavior of the market itself. A lot of investors -- institutional and individual -- still have meaningful cash positions and are feeling uncomfortable with them. There's a growing sense of urgency to get it into the market. The return on cash is looking more dismal with every passing day, and the market is looking better with every passing day.\" **********He said that \"the stock market is saying that forecasts on the economy and on earnings are way too pessimistic\" but added that he found it \"hard to make the case for a strong recovery.\" **********Even so, he said, \"My experience says I should take the message of the stock market seriously -- and buy.\" **********Ticking off a list of positive economic indicators, Mr. Canelo of County NatWest noted optimistic signals in the index of leading indicators, the purchasing managers index, the purchasing managers order index, commodity prices, the Barron's confidence index and the dollar. **********Asked when the Dow might break the record, which is just short of 3,000, he replied without being more specific, \"in short order.\" He said that oil stocks in the Dow were \"dragging it down\" and from that standpoint \"it's already there.\" **********Nevertheless, he added, \"We have a good chance of going into the 3,100 to 3,200 area before valuations look too high. It won't be immediately,\" he went on, \"maybe later this year.\" **********Looking at all the new highs, he said: \"The leadership here is still in the small stocks.

Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, said the country's production capacity would be raised to 10 million barrels a day by 1994. **********The Soviet Union's oil output has slipped in the last three years from a high of more than 12 million barrels a day to an anticipated average this year of less than 10 million barrels. Many experts expect a further slide in 1992, allowing Saudi Arabia to become the world's top producer within the next few months. **********OPEC officials said that the Saudi statements, and subsequent comments expanding on them, were meant to accomplish a dual purpose: reassuring other OPEC members that Saudi Arabia will not provoke a collapse in oil prices by rushing to raise exports, and emphasizing that the country has every intention of becoming the world's prime oil supplier as global demand increases in the next decades. **********The Saudi declaration was also viewed within the organization as a reassertion of the dominant position the country has relentlessly staked out in the oil market since the Persian Gulf crisis began in August 1990. **********Saudi officials stressed that this significant expansion of Saudi production capacity had been under way for some time and that it was unlikely to be slowed or interrupted soon. **********The officials noted, however, that while they strongly favored moderate oil prices, they would be careful not to allow prices to collapse, stressing that the increase of output would be \"gradual and predictable.\" **********Still, the Saudis left little doubt in the minds of several OPEC officials that they would reject any requests from other members to scale back production to push up prices. Key members like Iran, Algeria and Nigeria are advocating such a move. Agreement on First Quarter **********OPEC did agree today to a Saudi and Venezuelan proposal to keep prices and production at their current levels for the first quarter of next year. OPEC is now producing about 24 million barrels a day, of which Saudi Arabia alone claims 35 percent. **********The OPEC ministers are scheduled to continue their talks on Wednesday, concentrating on plans for the second quarter, when seasonal demand for oil is expected to fall. Iran's oil minister, Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, told reporters that some agreement \"in principle\" should be arrived at that mandates a second look at OPEC's overall production should oil prices weaken in the spring. So far, the Saudis have adamantly refused to make such a commitment.  High Profile **********Some OPEC officials noted here today that the Saudis appeared to be acting as though they wished to communicate to their colleagues in OPEC that they were on their way to becoming the leading oil power, which entails new \"global responsibilities.\" **********The Saudis' high profile at this and other recent OPEC meetings parallels the country's growing power in the Persian Gulf region since the war against Iraq. **********When the Persian Gulf crisis began, Saudi Arabia rushed to compensate for the huge shortage of oil supplies created by the cessation of exports by Iraq and Kuwait. Output was raised to 8.5 million barrels a day, from 5.5 million barrels. Now the Saudis are openly saying they will not give up this new share of OPEC's total production. **********\"There will be no return to the policies of the 70's and 80's,\" a senior Saudi official asserted in a recent conversation, alluding to repeated cuts in Saudi production in that period, with the aim of lifting oil prices. The only direction Saudi production is going, the Saudis say, is up. **********Other OPEC officials do not dispute the notion that Saudi Arabia may soon become the world's leading producer, but they say that is not the goal of Saudi policy. \"They want to insure there is plenty of oil to respond to the continuing rising demand,\" said a senior Arab delegate who insisted on anonymity. \"They want moderate oil prices to help their Western allies and third-world allies, and they want OPEC to recognize they are the king of the jungle.\" **********The inflexible Saudi stand is causing some bitterness among the 12 other members of OPEC, prompting many delegates to complain about Saudi \"arrogance.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/23/business/chrysler-banks-set-credit-pact.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1991-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 583, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chrysler, Banks Set Credit Pact", "print_headline": "Chrysler, Banks Set Credit Pact", "body_text": " **********The Chrysler Corporation agreed with a consortium of 38 banks today on a new $1.75 billion revolving credit through the end of 1993.

Under the previous agreement the banks could not have claimed Chrysler's assets as collateral. **********The credit agreement should reassure suppliers, lenders and others that the banking community is confident of Chrysler's ability to weather current hard times in the industry. Chrysler has been cutting $3 billion from its cost structure and trying to sell an equity stake in its Chrysler Financial Corporation subsidiary. **********Mr. Capo said the banks and the auto maker wanted to change their previous credit line because of \"a much tougher environment for the auto industry and the banking industry.\" Banks have been under regulatory pressure to reduce the size of loans that could be judged as risky.   Borrowing Limit Extended **********Offering an example of a covenant that had been made more liberal, Mr. Capo said Chrysler's borrowings might now constitute up to 110 percent of the company's net worth, compared with a previous limit of up to 100 percent of the net worth. Banks routinely attach tests of financial soundness to loan agreements to make sure they will be repaid, even if a company's condition deteriorates. **********Mr. Capo said Chrysler's current borrowings were much less than 100 percent of the company's net worth, although he said he could not be more specific. He acknowledged that the banks were demanding collateral in the event of substantial borrowings because of the worsening business environment. **********The lead bank in the consortium is the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. **********As of Jan. 1, Chrysler had about $3 billion in cash and marketable securities. But Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman, said in a recent interview that the company was drawing down its supply of cash quickly because of the industry's deep recession.   Effort on Financial Unit Stake **********Chrysler is trying to sell its equity in Chrysler Financial to raise cash and improve the ratings of its debt securities. Chrysler executives expect the Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Service to raise the ratings on Chrysler Financial debt from below-investment-grade status if it is partly owned by a company stronger than Chrysler. With better ratings, Chrysler Financial could once again raise money in public debt markets. **********The parent company has not had strong profits for two years, and it has forecast a big loss for the current quarter. **********Beyond waiting for an upturn in the United States automotive market, Chrysler is racing to bring out two critically important vehicle models, a new Jeep and its L/H midsize model. Both models are expected in 1992, and automotive analysts say they could hold the key to renewed financial health."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/16/world/toronto-journal-official-gadfly-finds-canada-united-in-discontent-360991.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1991-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1920, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Toronto Journal; Official Gadfly Finds Canada United in Discontent", "print_headline": "Toronto Journal; Official Gadfly Finds Canada United in Discontent", "body_text": " **********When Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Government decided last fall to invite Canadians to express their feelings about Canada and its problems, it chose as its Pied Piper a former newspaper editor and language commissioner with a distinctly un-Canadian propensity for stirring things up. **********Four months later, the official, Keith Spicer, has more than lived up to his billing as a quirky fellow who says what many Canadian public figures may think but hesitate to say in this country, where public discourse generally remains within well-circumscribed proprieties. **********Just as irksome to those who prefer seemliness, Mr. Spicer has brought forth a babel of opinions on everything from laws requiring French alongside English on cereal boxes to the extravagant re-decoration of Mr. Mulroney's official residence, as well as much else not obviously helpful to those hoping to bind Canada together.

The reason: the tax law and Deficit Reduction Act passed just before Halloween last year makes it necessary to draw up new plans for the eventual transfer of the business to the next generation with as small a tax bite as possible. **********Actually, the history of the matter goes back farther than that, and it relates to an essential problem for the taxpayers: Gift and estate taxes run as high as 55 percent, but such a sizable tax bite could cripple many small businesses. **********Before 1987 there was a way out known as an estate freeze. It generally involved recapitalizing the business and issuing preferred stock, which enabled a family to pass on a business virtually unscathed, or using a trust or a buy-sell agreement to accomplish the same goal. Congress perceived this as an abuse and tried to correct it in 1987, by passing Section 2036(c) of the revenue code. **********\"Section 2036(c) took a sledgehammer to these issues,\" said Gerald Morlitz, director of advanced estate planning for the Cowan Financial Group in New York, \"and created what are now recognized as generally unworkable concepts.\" **********Indeed, that law brought such loud and widespread protests that in the 1990 tax law Congress repealed it retroactively, replacing it with a complicated set of rules for passing on businesses. It is as though the 1987 law had never existed, so succession plans written to conform to that law need to be redone. But at the same time estate freezes done before that are likely to run afoul of restrictions in current law. That is why business owners need to see their legal and tax advisers to plan how to make transfers to children. Family businesses, of course, can vary widely -- from well-established to start-up, from a one-person operation going to one child to one with a maze of owners and many heirs whose involvement will vary. The varieties of circumstances make it difficult to give any general advice beyond saying the matter should be addressed. **********\"Generally, the new law is more liberal than Section 2036(c) for business interests but stricter for trusts,\" Mr. Morlitz said. \"It is always more onerous than the law prior to the enactment of Section 2036(c).\" **********Sam Radin, head of the National Madison Group, which advises other lawyers on trusts and estates, said that although it would be hard to give definitive answers before the Government issued regulations and case law developed, owners of privately held businesses should review estate plans. **********One thing that is clear, Mr. Radin said, is that buy-sell agreements between family members \"have to meet rather tough conditions.\" Theremust be a bona fide business arrangement, and the price of property transferred from one family member to another must be equal to that in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated person. **********Still, the new law also presents opportunities, provided care is taken to avoid its pitfalls, said Ross W. Nager of Houston, director of family wealth planning for Arthur Andersen & Company. **********For example, he said, the new law \"allows the transfer of equity to children while parents retain control,\" which is frequently more desirable than an abrupt change. \"Minority and marketability discounts are allowed and can substantially decrease the gift value,\" he said. **********It can also permit the consolidation of family wealth for management purposes, Mr. Nager said. And it permits a reverse freeze, which is a transfer of a preferred interest while retaining the junior interest through common stock. **********\"If carefully structured, the preferred interest can provide a relatively high rate of return, possibly 16 to 18 percent, and still have a low gift-tax value due to lack of marketability and minority discounts,\" he said. \"The result is an investment for the children with a rate of return which may actually 'pull' value away from the parents' junior interest over time.\" **********This could be helpful in funding a life insurance trust or a child's home purchase or reducing the parents' estate over time, he said. **********Also, Mr. Nager noted, the classic freeze is now explicitly permitted, and this can be useful in a start-up business or when the parents need dividends for retirement income, but problems could result if the parents' preferred rate of return is higher than the equity's appreciation rate. **********Indeed, there are so many pitfalls and permutations that it is imperative that business owners get expert, individual advice, lest a big, unexpected tax liability arise. The success of the next generation in the business could depend on it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/01/business/white-house-may-finish-bcci-inquiry-soon.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Rosenthal", "pub_date": "1991-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 487, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "White House May Finish B.C.C.I.

The reasoning: Polaroid has been denied fair access to camera distribution systems in Japan and Nikon benefited from and/or possibly caused Polaroid's inability to gain fair access in Japan. **********There is precedent for this sort of action in American laws governing the dumping of foreign goods in American markets. Antidumping laws provide guidelines to determine if foreign goods or services are being sold at lower prices in the United States than in the producers' home market. Penalties are assessed against the importer of record, and despite some unfairness in this practice, the law has encouraged pricing policies that are not predatory. **********With antidumping statutes as a guide, an unfair markets access law could be crafted to help pry open foreign markets by penalizing overseas companies that benefit from closed markets -- and our open ones. With such a law, American manufacturers would gain better access to foreign markets, America's position in trade talks would be bolstered and American producers would have their interests looked after according to the merits of each case.

Rosenberg, manager of international fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch, have sought to catch the wave by quickly revamping their forecasts that the dollar would stay low. **********The rally has brought the dollar back to its levels of a year ago. But at 1.7065 marks to the dollar yesterday, it is still well below the average level of 1.88 in 1988 and the highs of more than 2 marks hit in the late 1980's. And it is still far below its all-time high of 3.475 marks in February 1985. **********For American companies with large sales abroad, profits will be hurt when the foreign earnings are converted into dollars. But the reverse will be true for Japanese and, especially, European companies that had been hit hard by a weak dollar. **********Some corporations seemed to have been caught unprepared. Mrs. Nealon said she has corporate customers who did not expect the dollar to rise much beyond a brief victory rally after the war. Now they hope to buy dollars when the value dips, only to find that the dollar just keeps rising, forcing them to pay even more. Affecting the Trade Deficit **********A stronger dollar could also slow or even eventually end the decline in the American merchandise trade deficit, which dropped to $100 billion last year. Some economists have advocated an even lower dollar to help reduce this troublesome deficit. But others, like Mr. Kudlow, contend that the deficit can continue to fall, even if a little more slowly, with the dollar at these levels. They say that American manufacturers are more competitive than they were a few years ago and that a modest economic recovery should not create a consumer boom that would cause a surge in imports and a rise in the trade deficit. **********The response by officials in the Group of Seven, composed of the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, was a little confusing yesterday but did not indicate strong opposition to having the dollar at present levels. **********In Bonn, Theo Waigel, the Finance Minister, said the United States and Germany could live with the current levels of the dollar. His comments, coming on his return from a meeting with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady on Monday, were taken by traders as clearance to push the dollar higher, and it shot up, passing 1.70 marks and closing at 1.7065, its highest level since March 27, 1990. **********In Washington, David C. Mulford, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, told reporters: \"We are concerned about the rapidity of the rise. We are not seeking a stronger dollar.\" But he also said that Mr. Waigel's comment was accurate at the time of the meeting with Mr. Baker, which was Monday when the dollar closed in New York at 1.6840 marks. **********The dollar's surge started after it hit its low of 1.4475 marks on Feb. 11 in New York trading. At first many traders said the rally would be just a short-lived response to what was shaping up as a quick and easy victory in the war against Iraq. But the rally was pushed further on expectations of a rebound soon from the American recession and a slowing of economies abroad. **********Then in early March, the German Government said it would raise taxes to help pay for modernizing eastern Germany. By raising taxes, the Government would have to borrow less, making it suddenly more likely that German interest rates, which set the tone for Europe, would not rise further and even begin to decline. **********Foreign exchange traders concluded that interest rates would fall abroad, while remaining stable in the United States or falling only slightly. Such a narrowing of the interest-rate differential between dollars and others currencies makes the dollar more attractive to foreigners. **********One immediate effect of the dollar's rise is on the contributions from Germany and Japan to pay for the costs of the war. A report from Bonn yesterday said the German Government agreed to pay more marks to make up for the appreciation of the dollar. **********The Japanese have refused so far to cover the loss from the dollar rally. They made their pledge in yen but the United States wants it counted in dollars."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/06/business/pickens-drops-japan-suit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 259, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pickens Drops Japan Suit", "print_headline": "Pickens Drops Japan Suit", "body_text": " **********T.

Mutual Benefit is the nation's 18th-largest life insurer, with more than $13 billion in assets and 400,000 individual policyholders nationwide. **********The rating agency A. M. Best Company said on Wednesday that it would have an important announcement today about Mutual Benefit. While it is conceivable that A. M. Best could affirm its A-plus rating on the company's ability to pay claims, A. M. Best, which specializes in rating insurance companies, normally does not issue news releases except to change its ratings on the claims-paying ability of insurers. **********Two other top rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, have lowered their ratings on Mutual Benefit, making it unlikely that A. M. Best would continue to give the insurer its top rating. **********The ratings of insurance companies are crucial to both policyholders and agents. Policyholders view them as a guide to the safety of insurers, and agents prefer to sell policies of companies that are highly rated. **********If Best does lower its rating, it will be because of Mutual Benefit's growing problems with commercial real estate. At the end of 1990, Mutual Benefit had roughly $5 billion, or approximately 40 percent of its $13 billion in assets, invested in commercial mortgages, primarily loans to developers of office buildings, shopping centers and apartment complexes. About 10 percent of those loans are delinquent or have resulted in foreclosure. **********Mutual Benefit is just one of several large insurers experiencing difficulties from investments. The Equitable Life Assurance Society and the Travelers Corporation also suffer from troubled real estate investments. U.S.F.& G., First Capital Life and Executive Life have had large losses on their holdings of high-risk \"junk bonds.\" 3 Areas of Concern **********Insurance analysts are concerned about Mutual Benefit on three fronts: ***********Mutual Benefit's exposure to commercial real estate, a particularly troubled business of late, is well above the industry average. Many large life insurers focus on stocks and bonds. ***********Many industry analysts expect continued declines in the value of commercial properties. ***********Mutual Benefit's \"capital and surplus,\" which is essentially its cushion to cover future losses, has dropped to $520 million. If the value of Mutual Benefit's $5 billion mortgage portfolio fell another 10 percent, the company would be insolvent. **********Despite those concerns, Tim Clark, an analyst at Standard & Poor's, asserts that right now \"we are still dealing with a company that is fundamentally sound and not close to failure.\" **********But Mutual Benefit is badly in need of capital to reduce its vulnerability to future losses. Toward that end, it recently entered into \"strategic alliance\" talks with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Those talks collapsed when the two companies could not agree on terms. **********Mutual Benefit has also announced that it will spin off its highly profitable group insurance business, based in Kansas City, Mo., and will sell shares in that unit to outsiders. An offering memorandum describing Mututal Benefit's group insurance operations is being circulated among institutional investors. **********The headquarters operation in Newark houses some of the operations for Mutual Benefit's individual life insurance business, where profits have slipped in recent years as it has been forced to pay ever-higher rates of return to policyholders. **********The exact number of Mutual Benefit employees to be dismissed will not be announced publicly until Monday.

The report suggested that the economy was still mired in recession. **********After the figures were released, interest rates on Treasury securities fell, as they often do on publication of statistics that indicate weakness in the economy. The data also suggested that the unemployment rate for March, to be announced by the Labor Department today, will show a rise from February's 6.5 percent level. **********But the sharp increase in initial unemployment claims for the week ended March 23 -- that is, applications for unemployment pay filed by newly laid-off workers -- ran counter to other recent data indicating that the recession was past its lowest point and that a recovery was beginning. Rising home sales and a rebound in consumer confidence with the end of the Persian Gulf war were among the recent optimistic reports. **********The conflicting data produced conflicting assessments. David Mullins, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, for example, said the latest unemployment insurance claims simply confirmed what the nation already knew -- \"employment is weak and will continue to be weak, even after we start an upturn.\" He added, \"The figures were not unexpected.\" **********Mr. Mullins's remarks seemed to suggest that even if the Labor Department's employment report was very negative, the Federal Reserve would not respond by lowering short-term interest rates another notch to stimulate economic activity. The Fed lowered rates on March 8, the same day the Labor Department announced that the unemployment rate rose to 6.5 percent in February from 6.3 percent in January and 208,000 private-sector jobs disappeared. **********The Labor Department itself was pessimistic about the initial claims level that it announced yesterday. \"If you look back over the figures for initial claims in recent weeks, you don't discover a lot of upturn in the economy,\" said Thomas Plewes, an associate commissioner in the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. **********The 543,000 initial claims, seasonally adjusted, represented a rise of 33,000 from the 516,000 claims in the week ended March 16. Although the norm is for claims to fall in the spring when construction and other activities increase, Mr. Plewes said, initial claims have been moving gradually upward instead. **********The last time initial claims were this high was in the week ended Jan. 8, 1983, when they reached 546,000. The nation was then beginning a recovery, and the number of initial claims was moving downward, not upward as it is today. **********\"What happens in the spring is that claims decline, but this spring initial claims are growing,\" Mr. Plewes said. **********Initial claims for most of March averaged 200,000 a year more than they did in March 1990, the Labor Department said, and the total number of people receiving unemployment insurance rose by one million over a one-year period to 3,475,000 in mid-March. **********Still, the relationship between unemployment insurance figures and total unemployment is not as close as it once was because state regulations governing unemployment insurance have tightened, making fewer unemployed people eligible for jobless pay. **********During the 1974-75 recession, for example, 67 percent of the nation's total unemployed people were eligible for unemployment insurance, compared with 45 percent in the 1981-82 recession and roughly the same percentage today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/04/business/media-business-publishing-writers-loyalties-are-split-when-their-editors-depart.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1054, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Writers' Loyalties Are Split When Their Editors Depart", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: PUBLISHING; Writers' Loyalties Are Split When Their Editors Depart", "body_text": " **********When editors or executives leave publishing houses, they take their Rolodexes and their paperweights -- but do they take their authors? **********Writers, after all, sign contracts not with editors, nor even with heads of publishing houses, but with the houses themselves. Still, they develop relationships with people, not institutions. Often when editors are recruited, it is not just for their talents but for the authors who may follow. **********Publishing houses recognize that they do not operate an assembly-line business. Changing a factory foreman may change the spirit of a shop but have little effect on the product. An editor, however, can have a profound impact on a book. So when an editor or editing publisher leaves, a house has to decide whether to give up an author and a book it signed up, or fight to keep them. **********The phenomenon of migrating editors and publishers has been growing over the last few years, as publishing houses restructure to meet changing conditions and more houses are taken over by media conglomerates. **********Just last week, the issue exploded when writers learned that James H. Silberman would be leaving Summit Books, which he helped to found as a division of Simon & Schuster in 1976. **********Writers and agents have been calling Simon & Schuster to get out of their contracts or to find out what will happen to their books. Meanwhile, the house has been trying to reassure the anxious authors. **********Mr. Silberman, who has not announced his future plans, joins a long list of editors and publishing executives who have migrated this year, including Michael and Cornelia Bessie, who moved their imprint from HarperCollins to Pantheon, and Henry Ferris, who is leaving Houghton Mifflin for Times Books, an imprint of Random House. **********At 30 years old, Mr. Ferris is on his way to his third job in publishing. He went from Bantam to Houghton Mifflin, where he developed a reputation for finding and cultivating young writers, particularly journalists. Last week, Times Books said he would be moving there as a senior editor. **********When he left Bantam, the company let two authors who worked with him follow him, but they refused to let two others go. Houghton Mifflin, Mr. Ferris said, \"has been very gentlemanly about letting me take authors with me, and Times Books has been very welcoming in wanting these authors to come along.\" **********Deciding who has custody of authors highlights a general problem that publishing houses frequently face when the creative and the financial sides of their business come into conflict. One publisher, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that losing a top author could shake a house's balance sheet. **********If authors have already written best sellers, or there are high hopes that they will, publishing houses generally make a concerted effort to persuade them to stay. Typically, they offer such writers the opportunity to choose anyone in the company to edit their books, hint at -- or agree to -- contracts for future books or promise hefty publicity campaigns. **********Such promises were not enough to persuade either Margaret Atwood or Pat Conroy to stay at Houghton Mifflin when their publisher, Nan Talese, left to start her own imprint at Doubleday a few years ago. **********When Dan Frank left Viking as editor in chief last December, one of the writers who followed him to Pantheon was James Gleick, author of the best-selling book \"Chaos,\" who was three years into a contract with Viking to write a biography of Richard Feynman, the physicist. **********But Mr. Gleick had a clause in his contract that allowed him to leave Viking if Mr. Frank did. Publishers are reluctant to agree to such \"editor out\" clauses and usually reserve them for best-selling authors. **********Having such a clause is often an unnecessary insurance policy, since most publishing houses eventually let writers leave with their editors or publishers if a book is not in production. The theory is that a house cannot force someone to write a book for it any more than one can force someone to fall in love. **********The clause cuts through the initial hemming and hawing that publishers go through when confronted by a writer who wants to follow a departing editor. In most cases, said Martin Garbus, a lawyer involved in the publishing industry, a house can get back any advance it has paid on a book contract, plus interest. **********Lately, however, Mr. Garbus has been fighting a trend in which publishers demand a portion of the book's eventual profits. **********Of course, there are times when a publisher is relieved when an author asks to follow an editor and is happy simply to get back the advance. **********Sometimes, publishing houses can be unusually gracious. When Jonathan Galassi left Random House Adult Trade for Farrar, Straus & Giroux a few years ago, Random House let him take a book that had already been listed in its catalogue, \"That Night,\" by Alice McDermott. **********There are many cases, however, in which publishing houses hold writers to their contracts against their will. **********\"It can be a very difficult situation if a publishing house, for public relations purposes, wants to take a stand and prove that everything is continuing as before and the writers are part of the house,\" said Charlotte Sheedy, a literary agent in New York. **********Ms. Sheedy said some of her clients had trouble finishing their books when publishers refused to let them follow an editor who left. \"Twice, when the publishers wouldn't let the writers go, the writers couldn't go on working,\" she said. **********Ann Roiphe wrote three novels with Mr. Silberman at Summit, including her latest, \"The Pursuit of Happiness.\" When she learned of his departure, she said she was distraught and feared that, \"I will never have an editor who'll work with my words, my meaning, my text, as Jim did.\" She said she could not decide what she would do until Mr. Silberman decided what he would do. **********Mr. Gleick said that despite his attachment to Mr. Frank, his commitment to his project was stronger. **********\"My interest in Dan is not emotional; it's cold blooded,\" he said. \"Dan's a good editor. He cares, and he did a fine job on my last book.

It was the second time in a month they have moved against a large insurer burdened with a deteriorating portfolio of high-risk \"junk bonds.\" **********Faced with a flood of customers seeking to cash in their policies after reports of the company's financial problems, the California Insurance Department ordered a freeze on policy withdrawals and loans and barred the insurer from issuing new policies or transferring funds to its parent, the First Capital Holdings Corporation of Los Angeles. **********As a result of the action by the California regulator, Shearson Lehman Brothers, which owns 28 percent of First Capital Holdings, said that it planned to take a $144 million pretax charge against its second-quarter earnings. Shearson is the brokerage subsidiary of the American Express Company.  'Hazardous Condition' Found **********The heavy volume of policy surrenders At First Capital Life had the same effect that a run has on a bank, diminishing the company's supply of cash and endangering its ability to meet future obligations. First Capital Life has 190,000 customers in 49 states. Regulators said the company would continue to pay all death benefits and make regular payments to holders of annuities. **********California regulators said policy surrenders and loans had increased steadily from $10 million a day last week to $100 million on Thursday alone. **********\"I have issued a cease-and-desist order to put a halt to the wave of policy surrenders and loan requests that were threatening the long-term viability of the insurance company,\" said John Garamendi, the California Insurance Commissioner. \"On the basis of the Department of Insurance's financial examination I have concluded that First Capital Life is in a hazardous condition.\" **********The company's troubles follow similar ones at the Executive Life Insurance Company, which was seized by California regulators on April 11 after a rapid deterioration in the value of the junk bond portfolio purchased by its parent, the First Executive Corporation of Los Angeles. **********First Capital is generally considered to be in somewhat stronger financial condition than was Executive Life, largely because the default rate among its junk bonds has been lower than on those owned by Executive Life. First Capital Life has just over 40 percent of its $4.5 billion in assets invested in junk bonds. **********Mr. Garamendi stopped short of seizing control of First Capital, although he made clear that the regulators would be closely involved in managing the company. Regulators said seizure of First Capital Life was still possible, especially if the insurer's finances continued to deteriorate or were found to be in worse condition than now believed. **********\"The action I have taken is intended to stabilize and begin the process of rehabilitating the company,\" Mr. Garamendi said in a statement. \"It will give us the necessary time to develop a long-term strategy to return the company to financial health.\" **********Mr. Garamendi said he would continue efforts to sell the company's universal life insurance business, a transaction that the company said earlier this year could bring $150 million. He said he would keep trying to bring new capital into the company, including further negotations with Shearson Lehman, First Capital Holdings' largest shareholder, which this week came under intense pressure from Mr. Garamendi to inject new funds into First Capital Life. **********Shearson Lehman stopped short of rejecting the call for a capital infusion to First Capital Life but left unclear what financial aid, if any, it might be willing to provide. Neither Mr. Garamendi nor Shearson has said how much additional money would be needed to restore First Capital to health. **********\"We are confident that the company has the resources to meet at least the principal payments of its policyholders,\" said a Shearson spokesman who asked not to be identified. Apparent Backing Off **********The Shearson spokesman also appeared to back off from the company's earlier offer to the California regulators to guarantee payments to customers who bought annuities or other First Capital products through Shearson. Such a deal \"would invite an open-ended commitment, and we are in no position to make such a commitment,\" he said. **********Mr. Garamendi said he would try to reduce the percentage of junk bonds in First Capital's portfolio, presumably by selling them. Traders cited rumors that First Capital and First Executive were selling large quantities of investment- and lower-grade bonds as the reason for falling prices in the bond market today. **********The rumors were apparently unfounded. A spokesman for First Capital Holdings said no bonds had been sold today. **********The California action left uncertain the prospects for another subsidiary of First Capital Holdings, Fidelity Bankers Life Insurance of Virginia. Fidelity Bankers has about 37 percent of its $4 billion in assets in junk bonds. A spokesman for Virginia's Bureau of Insurance said no regulatory action had been taken against Fidelity Bankers, although examiners were monitoring the company's situation. **********First Capital said surrenders of Fidelity Bankers policies were up, but that they remained at a manageable level.  Peter Cohen a Director **********Mr. Garamendi said he would work with the president of First Capital Life, Fred A. Buck, and the outside directors of First Capital Holdings to resolve the insurer's problems. The four outside directors include several with close ties to American Express and Shearson Lehman. Among them is Peter Cohen, Shearson's former chief executive. **********Mr. Garamendi said at a news conference that the president of First Capital Holdings, Gerry R. Ginsberg, had been removed from oversight of the First Capital Life subsidiary by the board. The company's founder and chairman, Robert I. Weingarten, resigned in March after disclosing that declines in the value of the junk bond portfolio caused a fourth-quarter loss of $24.7 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/27/business/house-panel-approves-wider-bank-ownership.html": {"writer_name": "David Rosenbaum", "pub_date": "1991-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 666, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "House Panel Approves Wider Bank Ownership", "print_headline": "House Panel Approves Wider Bank Ownership", "body_text": " **********The House Banking Committee agreed today to permit industrial companies like retail chains and even automobile manufacturers to own banks. **********This gave a tentative lift to the Bush Administration's plan to overhaul the nation's banking system. But the overall measure that would also let commercial banks operate across state lines, merge with investment banks and in some cases sell insurance, would have to clear many further hurdles before it could become law. **********The committee plans to try to complete work on the measure tomorrow. It then must go to the Energy and Commerce Committee, where significant opposition has developed, before being taken up by the full House of Representatives. **********In the Senate, the Banking Committee has not begun work on the measure officially. Senate committees often do not begin drafting controversial bills in public until all the important deals have been struck in private. **********Still, the slow pace in the Senate makes it increasingly unlikely that broad legislation revamping the 60-year-old banking rules will be enacted this year. A Need for Expansion **********Since the Depression, banks have been limited basically to taking deposits and making commercial loans. The Administration and its supporters maintain that in today's financial world, banks can attract sufficient capital to compete and prosper only if they are permitted to expand into other lines. **********The legislation includes what its supporters say are thick \"fire walls\" that would separate banking from other businesses under the same ownership. For example, insured deposits could be used only in traditional banking activities, and banks could not lend money to their commercial affiliates. **********Nonetheless, opponents contend that savvy bankers and their lawyers will find ways to breech the fire walls, and that taxpayers will be left paying for the banks' bad investments. \"You're playing with fire,\" said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa. **********The key vote today came on a proposal by Mr. Leach to continue to prohibit ownership of banks by commercial concerns. The proposal was rejected, 32 to 20. **********There was no discernible pattern to how the lawmakers voted. Eleven Democrats and nine Republicans supported Mr. Leach; 20 Democrats and 12 Republicans opposed him. **********Some liberal Democrats, like Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, the committee chairman, and Joseph P. Kennedy 2d of Massachusetts, voted to prohibit industrial enterprises from buying banks. Others like Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn and Barney Frank of Massachusetts supported the Bush Administration, voting to permit such purchases. **********One proposal that was rejected tonight seems likely to provoke a partisan fight when the measure reaches the House floor. **********This was Mr. Schumer's amendment that would have created two categories: core banks offering insured deposits paying only a limited rate of interest and that could lend no more than 3 or 4 percent of their equity to any one borrower; and other banks operating with uninsured deposits that could pay higher rates of interest and lend as much as they wanted to any depositor. **********The proposal was rejected by a vote of 28 to 23, but Mr. Schumer vowed to offer it again to the full House. **********The Bush Administration and most Republicans opposed the idea, mainly on the grounds that it might stifle competition or cause banks to lose deposits. **********But many Democrats supported it as a way to guarantee that insured deposits were not used for risky activities like big loans to underdeveloped countries or for leveraged buyouts. That, the Democrats said, would lessen the likelihood of taxpayer bailouts. **********No other issue this year has generated so much lobbying. The meeting room was jammed with representatives from dozens of interests, the hallway outside was clogged, and proceedings were piped into another room on the floor above so lobbyists who were too late to get into the Banking Committee's room could hear what was going on. **********The ghost of the savings and loan disaster hovered over the debate today. Those who want to let banks get into other lines of business said that was the only way banks could survive and prevent another costly taxpayer bailout."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/08/world/war-in-the-gulf-lebanon-israelis-striking-plo-in-lebanon.html": {"writer_name": "Sabra Chartrand", "pub_date": "1991-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 531, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAELIS STRIKING P.L.O.

Link to the Gulf War **********The rocket attacks are viewed here as an extension of the gulf war, since the Palestine Liberation Organization has advertised them by saying it hopes to open a symbolic second front against Israel in support of Iraq. **********Officers in Israel's northern command said the army was now shelling and bombing Palestinian targets in southern Lebanon every night, using tanks, helicopter gunships, jets and ground troops. **********Military analysts here have speculated that the Israeli Army's fierce response to the Palestinian attacks is linked to frustration over being prevented from responding to Iraqi missile attacks on Israel.

Together we bought something very wonderful, a late 1800's historic home in Annapolis.\" **********Real estate experts say that more single people are buying homes together for a variety of reasons, including the fact that many people are marrying later and that home prices are out of the reach of many singles like Ms. Mullen, who develops educational programs for the Smithsonian Institution. At this time of year, many singles also consider looking for a partner to buy a weekend or summer cottage. **********Although these deals can work out well for both parties, there are lots of pitfalls. If you do not structure the deal carefully, it can turn into a financial and emotional disaster. **********\"You are entering a murky world and you may not be able to exit if you don't do things properly,\" said Nadine Gordon Lee, a partner at Ernst & Young in New York City. **********Two people who are not married to each other should always have a contract before they enter into a deal. It should address all aspects of running the household, taking care of maintenance, paying the bills, insuring the property and, eventually, selling it. **********\"I would want to know something about the other person's financial situation, too,\" said David A. Tane, a real estate lawyer with Gallet Dreyer & Berkey in New York, who has handled a number of such agreements for singles. **********Proper titling of the property is an issue, too. A husband and wife typically hold title to a home as \"joint tenants with rights of survivorship.\" If one dies, the property passes to the other. But that is not necessarily appropriate for two singles who may each want to pass the property on to his or her own heirs. Instead, title should probably be held as \"tenants in common.\" That way, you control what happens to your share. **********That's what Ms. Mullen and her sister, an account manager at a direct-marketing firm, did. Because her sister, Barbara Cullen, had some money for a down payment and because she would be making a home for her two children, she paid two-thirds of all expenses, including mortgage, utilities, food and insurance. Ms. Mullen paid the other third. (Ownership of the house is also split that way.) They had a contract drawn up by a lawyer and set up a household account to which each woman contributed her share of the money to run the household once a month. **********The two sisters took turns handling the household account, each a year at a time. \"That gave us both a better idea of what the expenses were,\" Ms. Mullen said. Each woman also purchased her own furnishings. They bought only one thing together: a chandelier that was designed especially for the house. Repairs came from the household account. **********Naturally, there were aggravations from time to time. \"It was hard to suddenly share one bathroom again and hard for my sister to go back to living with a sibling after being married,\" Ms. Mullen said. \"And I had to learn not to impose my feelings on the kids.\" But all in all, it worked out for everyone. \"I thought it was a very smart thing to do with my money,\" Ms. Mullen said. \"If I was bugged because someone squeezed the toothpaste in the middle, I got over it.\" **********Things haven't gone quite so smoothly for Joan Hamilton, a manager in the personal financial services group at Price Waterhouse. She and a friend bought a house in St. Louis in February 1988 for many of the same reasons. Although the two of them decided to split costs in half, they didn't think to draw up a contract at the time. **********Their informal agreement has worked for some things. \"I'll buy groceries one week and she'll buy the next week,\" says Ms. Hamilton, 26. But when the house needed major repairs, like a new roof, the friends ran into a snag. They hadn't provided for how decisions would be made and they found they couldn't agree. They got three estimates, with a range of $2,000 between the high and the low. **********\"We're at odds about how it should be done,\" Ms. Hamilton said. \"She wants to choose the cheapest one and I want the more expensive.\" **********Even more important, they didn't provide for a way out of the contract. \"I'm ready to sell and she's not,\" Ms. Hamilton said. Although they are working things through, \"it's not as efficient as it would have been if we had set it up up front,\" Ms. Hamilton said. **********Still, she doesn't regret the deal. \"I've loved it,\" she says. \"It's been wonderful to have an equity interest in something.\"WHEN IN DOUBT, SPELL IT OUT **********An agreement to buy real estate with a friend or relative should include the obvious financial details, like the portion of the purchase price supplied by each partner and who will be responsible for maintenance, utilities and insurance. **********But it should also address more subtle things, like who will take responsibility for and make decisions about decorating and keeping household accounts. For example, if one of the two travels a great deal and is counting on the other to take up the slack, spell it out. Will the homebody be compensated for this role? **********The agreement also should clearly address how you will dissolve the partnership. Will one person have the option to buy the property at a specific price? If not, what will trigger the sale? Should the property be sold if one person is transferred to another city, gets married, loses a job? If one of the partners dies, will the other have the first right to buy his or her share? **********Think, too, about how the sale price will be set. For example, you might get three appraisals and make the middle one the sales price. Or you might say you will put it on the market and take the best bid within a specified time period. **********If you have a particular time frame in mind, address that in your agreement. \"I've done agreements that say: 'In the fifth year of ownership, one or the other can force the sale,' \" said David Tane, a lawyer with the New York firm of Gallet Dreyer & Berkey. If you do not address these things, you may have to go to court and seek an action to partition the property, which could cost a great deal in legal fees. **********You might also specify in your contract that any dispute will be settled by the American Arbitration Association. \"Think of everything you could possibly disagree on and address that in the contract,\" Mr. Tane advises. **********Finally, \"unless you're really of the same mind about everything,\" Mr. Tane said, you and your partner should use different attorneys to draw up the agreement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/23/business/credit-markets.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;", "body_text": " **********The Massachusetts Health and Educational Facilities Authority entered the tax-exempt market yesterday with a $69.2 million issue of revenue bonds through Morgan Stanley & Company as senior manager. **********Underwriters tentatively priced the bonds, which are for the Fallon Health Care System, with a maximum yield of 7.075 percent for an issue due 2020. **********For serial bonds with shorter maturities, yields ranged from 4.8 percent in 1992 to 5.8 percent in 1996, 6.3 percent in 2001 and 6.7 percent in 2004.

Just that!\" **********As co-founder of the French group Doctors Without Borders, he has argued that repressive governments have no right to keep aid away from the needy. And during the Kurdish refugee crisis, the principle of \"humanitarian intervention\" was accepted by the United Nations. **********\"I think a universal conscience is taking shape,\" he said in a recent interview. \"It's beginning to demand a minimal respect for human rights. It is an important advance that people recognize that suffering belongs to everyone, that it is not affected by borders.\" **********A 51-year-old gastro-enterologistturned-politician, Dr. Kouchner can share credit for this change because, as the top French official for humanitarian affairs, a sub-Cabinet position, he helped bring the plight of the Kurdish refugees to the attention of the Security Council after the gulf war. **********On April 5, the Council approved a resolution demanding that Iraq give access to Kurdistan to international aid groups and instructed the Secretary General to mobilize United Nations agencies to help the refugees. **********The resolution fell short of creating \"a right of humanitarian intervention,\" but Dr. Kouchner believes it took a step in that direction. \"The United Nations has already approved a right to assistance requiring governments to provide access corridors for humanitarian aid,\" he said. \"Now we must codify the right to intervene.\" **********\"It may take 20 years, but it's a beginning. At Auschwitz, most people didn't know and nothing was done. In Biafra 25 years ago, people knew, they saw what was happening and they did nothing. Now in Kurdistan, people knew, they saw and they did something.\" **********When humanitarian intervention should be allowed is more complicated, he acknowledged. \"We can't start by saying, after 703 victims, we will intervene. And people will ask, why this country and not that country? But we can start by conditioning aid to human rights -- and that's intervention.\" **********But he also said that the famine in war zones of the Sudan and the Horn of Africa cannot await debate.

Inc. that permitted Sears to issue Visa cards pending the resolution of a lawsuit Sears has against Visa. **********The retailing giant contends that Visa has been trying to prevent it from issuing a Prime Option Visa card, which like Sears's Discover card would not carry a fee but would, the company says, have the cachet and wide merchant acceptance of the Visa name. **********The decision, which Visa asked the judge to reconsider yesterday, allows Sears to proceed with an ambitious plan to issue the no-fee Visa card next month to some seven million households that are Sears customers. **********Analysts said Sears's new card was a prime threat to the hold by banks on the issuance of Visa credit cards. Visa is an association of banks that issue credit to consumers through the Visa credit card. Recently, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company successfully issued its Universal Visa credit card, which competes with the Visa bank cards, and banks fear that their credit card business will be undercut by such well-capitalized non-bank competitors. **********\"This is a considerable and substantial threat to traditional bank issuers,\" said Allen R.

A.T.& T. and Sears are two giants at the gate of Visa, and they are a threat to all other issuers.\" **********David Brancoli, a spokesman for Visa, based in San Mateo, Calif., said the bank association opposed the new Sears card. He said that while competition among different Visa issuers would benefit consumers, consumers would benefit even more from competition among different brands of cards -- for instance, Visa cards vying against Sears's existing Discover credit cards, or Mastercards. **********\"The consumer benefits more from major brand competition than from competition within a brand,\" Mr. Brancoli said. **********James Flynn, a Sears spokesman, predicted that the Prime Option card would be a big deal because it does not carry a fee and because of a new repayment schedule about which he would not elaborate. **********But Mr. Flynn rejected the idea that Prime Option would compete with Sears's existing Discover card, which last year contributed $117 million to Sears's profits from about 40 million cards issued. \"It won't cannibalize our other card,\" he said. **********Sears plans to issue its new Visa cards through Mountainwest Financial,, a savings and loan association based in Sandy, Utah, that Sears bought last year from the Resolution Trust Corporation.

The arrangement also allows Mr. Nelson to keep at least $500,000 in profits from his new collection of songs to pursue a lawsuit against Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm that he claims gave him bad advice on some tax-shelter investments, according to Jay Goldberg, a New York lawyer who negotiated the deal for the singer. **********Mr. Goldberg says the I.R.S. views Mr. Nelson's lawsuit as a valuable piece of property that he will be unable to develop unless he has this money to cover expenses. \"The I.R.S. looked at it as a business decision,\" Mr. Goldberg said. \"They stand a chance of making more money if he wins the case.\" The I.R.S. is prohibited from commenting on matters concerning individual taxpayers, said Don Roberts, a spokesman. **********As a result of the lingering recession, accountants say they are seeing more and more clients with Mr. Nelson's problem, albeit with bills in the thousands rather than the millions. If you are one of them, you should not ignore the I.R.S. \"If the taxpayer digs in his heels and does nothing, then we begin enforced collection, seizing bank accounts, wages or property,\" Mr. Roberts said. **********If that happens, you could be on the street and still have your debt unresolved. \"If the I.R.S. seizes your house, they'll sell it at much below the market price -- maybe 50 to 60 percent of the value,\" said Robin F. Davies, tax manager at the accounting firm of McGladrey & Pullen in Schaumburg, Ill. \"They reduce your tax bill only by what they get. You still owe the rest. And you don't have a home.\" **********Here's what you should do, depending on the severity of your cash crunch. If you can avoid it, don't liquidate investments and trigger a big tax gain, which will only cause additional tax problems going forward. Look first at tax-deductible ways to borrow the money, such as a home equity credit line, which is tax deductible up to $100,000 in principal. But you must liquidate investments if you have no other way to come up with the money. **********If you can't borrow anything and have no assets to sell, you must try to work out an arrangement with the collections department at the I.R.S. Before you make an appointment, pull together a balance sheet and income statement. \"The burden is on you to show what you can afford to pay and to back it up credibly,\" said Larry Elkin, manager in charge of personal financial planning at Arthur Andersen & Company in New York. **********Being cooperative and showing evidence that you intend to pay is crucial, accountants say. It's not in the best interest of the I.R.S. to throw you out on the street if there's evidence that payment will be made. \"If you can show some means by which you will repay, they will be open to a discussion,\" Mr. Elkin said. After all, interest and penalties are accumulating, so the I.R.S. can afford to be patient. **********Before making a promise to repay though, look at your other debts and make certain that you will be able to maintain the repayment schedule. \"Somebody who has serious tax problems probably has serious financial planning problems in general,\" Mr. Elkin said. \"The fact that they could be exposed to such a liability means their finances have probably been on automatic pilot.\" **********If you have a lot of additional debt, you may need to work out a package deal to pay off all your creditors. \"Otherwise you may find that you've promised too big a share to the I.R.S. and you can be forced into bankruptcy by the weight of other people's claims,\" Mr. Elkin said. **********Suppose your situation is closer to Mr. Nelson's: You owe a whopping bill to the I.R.S. and you have absolutely nothing. For example, Ms. Davies has a client in this situation: he owes $65,000 and his total assets amount to $2,000. He has no home and he was recently in a bad automobile accident. **********Ms. Davies is working on an \"offer in compromise\" for her client. This is an offer to settle the debt for something less than what is owed. It might be a lump sum or it might be a lump sum plus payments over a specified period, like five years. **********\"The taxpayer might offer to settle for 10 or 20 cents on the dollar,\" said Mr. Roberts of the I.R.S. \"We review the offer based on the financial statement to see whether it would be accepted.\" **********Offers in compromise are far from common. Mr. Roberts said only 9,000 were received in 1990. He would not say how many were accepted. But he did say the amount offered must exceed the total value of equity in the taxpayer's assets. **********Offers in compromise that have been accepted are public information. \"You can read through them to see the initial liability assessed by the I.R.S. and what they settled for,\" Ms. Davies said. **********Finally, a bankruptcy filing can sometimes wipe out a tax debt. Bankruptcy judges have discretion to discharge tax debts that are more than three years old. **********\"That's one weapon you can use with the I.R.S.,\" Mr. Goldberg said: \" 'If you don't negotiate with me, I'll go bankrupt.' \"PONDERING AUTOMATIC EXTENSION **********The Internal Revenue Service has reversed an earlier decision to give most taxpayers an automatic extension on their filing deadline from April 15 until Aug. 15. The I.R.S. said it needed more time to study the proposed change, which was to have taken effect next year. **********About five and a half million taxpayers used Form 4868 to ask for the four-month extension this year, according to the I.R.S. The agency said it had proposed giving a so-called paperless extension -- dispensing with the need to formally request one -- to save time and money. The I.R.S. estimated that an automatic extension would save 7.6 million hours of taxpayers' time and $5.5 million in processing costs for the agency. **********The I.R.S. said a number of taxpayers and tax preparers had raised concerns about the proposed change. Therefore all taxpayers who seek an extension next year will again be required to file Form 4868 by April 15. **********Accountants say that many taxpayers are not well served by delaying their returns until August. For one thing, if you use a professional to prepare your taxes it costs more, perhaps 25 or 30 percent, according to Robin F. Davies, tax manager at the accounting firm of McGladrey & Pullen in Schaumburg, Ill. That is because the taxpayer must still make a good-faith effort to compute and pay all taxes by April 15 even though the return is not filed then. **********Further, those who have refunds due lose out on four months' interest. The I.R.S. says nearly 80 percent of the taxpayers who filed Form 4868 last year ultimately received refunds. -- MARY ROWLAND"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/11/business/mutual-fund-shortening-up-on-money-funds.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mutual Fund; Shortening Up on Money Funds", "print_headline": "Mutual Fund; Shortening Up on Money Funds", "body_text": " **********To make money market funds safer for investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission tightened standards on June 30, requiring these funds to shorten their average maturity to 90 days, from 120 days.

Just give us a chance to sell our goods for cold hard dollars, they insisted, and we will show you who comes out ahead. On Jan. 1 they got their wish, and they have rued the day ever since. **********Exports from the region's nascent capitalist economies to Moscow have collapsed, and imports from the Soviet Union, aside from oil and natural gas, appear to be down sharply. **********Since Jan. 1, the Soviet Union has been importing considerably fewer Eastern European goods than in previous years. It has said it does not have the dollars to pay for the goods. **********\"The Soviets are unwilling or unable to pay -- that is the crux,\" said Lazlo Lang, an economist at the Central European Research Center in Budapest. \"What they want is to squeeze out as much net hard-currency income from Eastern Europe as possible.\" **********Virtually overnight, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary and the region's other nations lost a leading market. **********Beef, sparkling wine, even thousands of tons of slaughtered geese are piling up in warehouses across Eastern Europe. Hundreds of thousands of workers have been furloughed and their pay reduced, as their factories, tailored to fill the Soviet demand, suddenly were bereft of customers or contracts. Economic planners from Budapest to Warsaw, still trying to cut the last of the Communist-era subsidies for domestic industries, are besieged with pleas for government bailouts.  'A Catastrophic Situation' **********\"I negotiated this new regime for trade for Poland,\" said Dariusz Ledworoski, the Minister for Economic Cooperation, \"and I would have to admit that we are in a catastrophic situation.\" **********Economists attribute the developments to confusion in the Soviets' lumbering trade bureaucracy, as well as a severe shortage of dollars. Some officials in the post-Communist countries, however, question whether the sudden halt in trade could also be Moscow's none-too-subtle method of underscoring warnings to its former satellites not to join NATO. **********Whatever its causes, the disruption has jolted the fragile economies of the Soviet Union's neighbors, all of which are struggling to foster free-market systems. In the last few weeks, senior officials from Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary have held frantic meetings with Western financial organizations, searching for bridge loans or other means to underwrite trade with the Soviet Union.  Moscow Spurns Pleas **********The officials have also suggested to the Soviets that the system of dollar payments be dropped in favor of barter, as was once the case, or some other mechanism. Moscow has spurned these pleas, even though the slowdown in trade appears to be causing equally disastrous consequences for Soviet industries. **********Poland's exports to the Soviet Union fell to about $440 million in the first quarter of 1991, Polish Government officials have estimated, a decline of 80 percent from a year earlier. Czechoslovakia's quarterly sales to the Soviet Union were estimated at $323 million; officials said that was a 36 percent decline. **********In Hungary, unofficial figures indicate that first-quarter exports totaled about $70 million, a decline of 85 percent from last year's approximate volume. Press reports in Bulgaria say only $57 million was exported in the first quarter to the Soviet Union, a small remnant of what was the country's most lucrative market last year. **********Precise calculations of the differences in trade are impossible because the transactions were conducted in rubles last year, and the Soviet Union had provided oil and natural gas at highly subsidized prices; now it sells them for dollars. Some Eastern European nations have paid cash and continued their imports, while others have cut back.  A Too-Rapid Pace **********The Eastern European countries had been planning on a much slower transition. They had hoped that over the next few years trade with the Soviet Union would serve as a useful cushion while companies gradually made themselves competitive in Western markets. **********Now Czechoslovakia, which was particularly tied to the Soviet Union, and other nations face an unexpectedly early test of how well they can survive largely on their own. **********During the Communist years, trade between the Soviet Union and its satellites was a particularly telling illustration of the inherent absurdities of centrally run economies. Under the umbrella of the Comecon trade organization, goods were produced and sold among the countries with little regard to quality or cost. Transactions were conducted in an artificial currency -- the transfer ruble -- that was of even less value than the Soviet ruble. **********One joke circulating in Poland summed up the system this way: \"One dead dog for two dead cats.\" **********Moscow continually contended it was the loser because it was not only trading oil at artificially low prices but was accepting shoddy products that could not be sold elsewhere. Poles and residents of other satellite nations acknowledged that their goods were not always the best, but said that they were cheated even more by the Soviet-set prices for raw materials.  Dealing With Dollars **********Western analysts agree that the unreformed Soviet economy was ill prepared to begin trade on a dollar basis. They said current exports earn Moscow barely enough money to repay Western loans and buy equipment for the decrepit oilfields that are the most important source of hard currency. **********Claus Wittich of the Vienna-based United Nations Economic Commission for Europe said the Kremlin's decision late last year to impose tight centralized controls on disbursement of the scarce hard currency further constricted trade. \"It was completely unclear who had the authority to spend from the new fund, which was apparently being decided at the level of the cabinet,\" Mr. Wittich said. \"It was a prescription for chaos.\" **********The effect of the slowdown in Soviet trade varies from country to country, but has exceeded expectations in every case. **********Poland, which has been among the most successful in reorienting its manufacturing and exports toward Western markets, expected a 25 to 50 percent decline in its Soviet sales. **********Mr. Ledworoski, the Minister of Economic Cooperation, said the 80 percent decline in exports to the Soviet Union was by itself responsible for Poland's $300 million trade deficit in the first quarter of 1991. About 200 companies, employing about 130,000 people, had subsisted on sales to the Soviet Union; Mr. Ledworoski acknowledged that many of them produced outmoded goods not suitable for sale anywhere else. **********\"Computer printers are one example,\" he said. \"In the world, they are very cheap. The Soviet Union bought from us because they didn't have to pay hard currency. If they do pay hard currency, why would they buy our old-fashioned machines?\" **********At the moment, most Polish companies have cut off further deliveries to the Soviet Union because Moscow is $130 million in arrears on items bought earlier this year.  A Meeting of Prime Ministers **********Poland is nonetheless eager to sell in the Soviet Union, particularly as the European Community continues to erect customs barriers. Recently, Prime Minister Jan Krzystof Bielecki of Poland went to Moscow and offered 100,000 tons of meat and a million tons of grain. Startled by the huge surplus, the Soviet Prime Minister, Valentin Pavlov, raised an eyebrow and asked whether Poland had some new connection to God. **********\"No,\" an aide quoted Mr. Bielecki as replying. \"For that we have the Pope. For this, we have economic reform.\" The Soviets have not yet said whether they would buy Poland's agricultural surplus. **********In Hungary, Mr. Lang, the economist, said many industries had temporarily shut production lines and furloughed employees. By fall, he said, these companies would exhaust their reserves and might be forced to dismiss as many as 150,000 workers. This would more than double Hungary's unemployment rate of 3 percent. Mr. Lang noted that the Hungarian economy, while strongly tied to the West, retained symbiosis in some respects with the Soviet Union. **********Right now, he said, 4,000 tons of slaughtered geese are sitting in warehouses. Until this year, the Hungarians did a brisk business. The goose's liver would be removed to satisfy Western demand for pate, and the rest of the bird would be sold to the Soviet market.

In the gulf crisis, this approach has alienated both friend and foe.  French Offer to Iraq **********During the countdown to the war, President Francois Mitterrand proposed that Iraq be offered the guarantee of an international peace conference on the Middle East in exchange for withdrawal from Kuwait. Washington and London immediately opposed \"rewarding\" Iraqi aggression, while Baghdad never even responded. **********But, with an eye to the future, the initiative nonetheless seemed to serve France's purpose of showing the Arab world that France's policy in the Middle East was very different from that of the United States or Britain. **********At the outbreak of war, France again risked annoying its allies when Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who was already known to oppose the use of force against Iraq, announced the signing of a \"protocol\" with Washington declaring that French troops would operate only in Kuwait. France's objective, he insisted, was to liberate Kuwait and not to destroy Iraq.  Giscard Critical of Curbs **********Opposition parties called for Mr. Chevenement's resignation, and former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing said acidly that it would have been as if allied forces in World War II had tried to liberate France without attacking Nazi Germany. **********After the first Scud missiles hit Israel last week, France faced a new diplomatic headache when a senior member of the Israeli Parliament, Eliahu Ben-Elissar, charged that France's huge arms sales to Iraq in the 1980's were \"in large measure responsible\" for Baghdad's ballistic missile ability and non-conventional weapons. **********Finally, in a hastily arranged television interview on Sunday, Mr. Mitterrand responded to his critics, stating first that while France's initial air raids into Kuwait were the result of a \"plan of action\" worked out among the allies, its air and ground forces were not forbidden to enter Iraqi territory. **********He stressed that France had sold weapons to the Iraqis during their war against Iran at the insistence of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, but that it never supplied missiles. He added that France had repeatedly rejected Iraq's requests for nuclear technology after Israel destroyed an nuclear plant outside Baghdad in 1981.  Public Support for Mitterrand **********Perhaps the only good news for Mr. Mitterrand in recent days has come from polls reporting that French public opinion, which was badly divided over participation in a gulf war before Jan. 16, is now supporting the Government. The latest poll showed 73 percent of those questioned approved of the President's handling of the crisis. **********But the mood in the country remains somber, with memories of terrorist bombings in Paris in 1986 feeding fears of reprisals by pro-Iraqi guerrillas and prompting a wave of panic-buying in the days before the war.

Acknowledging the formidable strength of pro-Israel lobbyists on Capitol Hill, the President raise the stakes in the confrontation on Thursday by promising to veto any early Congressional action. **********Mr. Shamir described the dispute as \"an internal American conflict,\" between the Bush Administration and Israel's Congressional supporters.

American Jews had been accused of not having done enough at the time to stop the mass killing of Jews in Europe, Mr. Shamir said, according to the Israel state radio. But they \"have learned a lesson from the Holocaust\" and therefore, he said, \"they are now united and very active, to the surprise of political circles in their country.\" **********Mr. Bush's veto threat, and perhaps even more the vehemence with which he delivered it, left Israeli Government officials and politicians variously stunned, bewildered, angry and hurt. Some were especially outraged by the President's comment that \"American men and women in uniform risked their lives to defend Israelis in the face of Iraqi Scud missiles\" in the Persian Gulf war. **********What Mr. Bush seems to have forgotten, they said, was that Israel's restraint in absorbing missile attacks without retaliation had helped keep the anti-Iraq coalition together. **********\"Look how cynical he is and how he pays us back,\" said Eliakim Haetzni, a member of Parliament from Tehiya, a right-wing party in the governing coalition. **********Government officials said they hoped to avoid a head-on collision with the Bush Administration and would discuss their grievances with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who is expected to arrive here on Monday to give the planned peace talks another jolt. But some commentators called this the most serious rupture between the two countries in 35 years, and warned that the ground for possible compromise had been greatly reduced by Mr. Bush's threat. **********Politicians on the right, including close allies of the Prime Minister, insisted that they had to be more aggressive than ever in pressing their case. It rests heavily on the argument, restated by Mr. Shamir today, that there should be no linking of the requested guarantees -- the \"humanitarian aid,\" in their view -- and peace talks that they see as a political matter. **********Some argued that American evenhandedness in the peace process had been compromised and that Mr. Bush in effect had given Arab leaders an unsolicited gift that would cause them to step up their demands at the conference table. Soviet and Baltic Immigrants **********\"The tendency here is to jump and say, 'This guy hates our guts -- how can you trust him?' \" said Dore Gold, a defense expert at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University. **********But other commentators and politicians, especially on the left, asserted that Mr. Shamir had brought the crisis on himself and perhaps in the process had imperiled financial aid that Israel says it badly needs to absorb hundreds of thousands of expected immigrants from the Soviet Union and the Baltic republics, which are now independent. **********Although Mr. Bush has not raised the matter explicitly this time, his irritation, they said, is obviously over Mr. Shamir's insistence that Israel will continue to build Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. While Israeli leaders say that none of the immigration aid will go to the territories, that money frees up Government funds to be spent there. **********\"Whoever thought it was possible to take billions from America and spit in America's face by establishing new settlements was deluding himself,\" wrote Rami Tal, a Washington-based reporter for Yediot Ahronot, the country's largest newspaper. **********\"George Bush has now dragged the Israeli Government, shouting and cursing, to its hour of truth.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/15/business/the-media-business-advertising-anarchy-at-another-show-no-just-a.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1991-07-15", "snippet": "ANARCHY reigned at yet another advertising awards show last week, with executives storming the stage and grabbing statuettes.\n\nBut unlike the disaster at the Clio Awards last month in New York, the pandemonium at the first annual Doggie Award show...", "word_count": 514, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;\nAnarchy at Another Show?

Hanson is an investor with an attitude. **********Under Mr. Hanson, the California Public Employees Retirement System, as the pension fund is formally known, recently assailed the ITT Corporation for the $30 million in compensation it gave its chairman, Rand V. Araskog, during the last four years when ITT's shares fell 10 percent. **********Mr. Hanson also shook up Sears, Roebuck & Company this spring by supporting the unsuccessful campaign of a dissident shareholder, Robert A. G. Monks, for a seat on the Sears board. Low-Key Prodding Preffered **********Calpers is not always so confrontational, preferring instead to rely on low-key, behind-the-scenes prodding when possible. Either way, Mr. Hanson has pushed Calpers, whose $58 billion investment portfolio includes stakes in some of the nation's largest corporations, to the forefront of a growing and increasingly successful effort to pry open board rooms and make corporate America more accountable to shareholders. **********\"We primarily view our corporate governance efforts as a fiduciary responsibility, no different than if we bought a building and the manager did not care for the building in a way we thought proper,\" said Mr. Hanson, who is 48 years old and takes issue only with companies in which Calpers owns stock. **********Making shareholders \"an equal side of the triangle\" with corporate management and directors can only help build value for the stock and for the Calpers portfolio, Mr. Hanson said. **********Of the 12 shareholder resolutions filed or proposed by Calpers during the annual meeting season this year, the pension fund won outright victories or forged compromise agreements on 10. Those results were a sharp improvement over the .500 winning percentage Calpers has typically posted on the dozen or so proposals it has made in each of the previous several years. **********Faced with a potentially messy fight with Calpers or other pension funds, more and more companies are listening closely when large shareholders seek their ear and their respect. **********Sometimes Mr. Hanson wants regular meetings with management when a company is performing poorly. Sometimes he wants companies to drop provisions that seem aimed at deterring a raider but often serve to entrench -- and enrich -- management at the expense of shareholders. Frequently, Mr. Hanson wants a company to change the composition of its board by installing more directors from outside the company, who are presumably more responsive to shareholders. **********Increasingly, Mr. Hanson said, Calpers will also focus on how much chief executives earn, an issue that he sees as cutting to the heart of whether companies are run for the enrichment of management or the benefit of shareholders. **********The ability of Calpers to advance an agenda, often without a public fight, has become clear in the last year in its relations with the General Motors Corporation. **********The company made the Calpers hit list last year when Mr. Hanson sent a letter pointedly asking what the company would do to forge closer ties to large shareholders, and how the board would evaluate the performance of the successor to Roger B. Smith, G.M.'s former chairman. **********Early this year, Mr. Hanson told a G.M. executive that Calpers was planning a shareholder resolution at G.M.'s annual meeting to insure that a majority of the auto maker's board continued to come from outside G.M. Mr. Smith had tried unsuccessfully several years earlier to expand the board by adding insiders. **********After his chat with the G.M. executive, Mr. Hanson got a call from Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s new chairman, who wanted to know more. Mr. Hanson told him that a commitment to maintaining a majority of outside directors would allow G.M. to signal that its board was intent on representing shareholders, not just management. **********Mr. Stempel thought about it -- and then agreed with Calpers. Mr. Stempel even offered Calpers lawyers an opportunity to help draft the change in G.M.'s bylaws. **********\"We were delighted,\" Mr. Hanson said. He added that Mr. Stempel's response was \"a breath of fresh air\" in the effort to bring together large shareholders and managements. **********Mr. Hanson, who took the top Calpers job four years ago after serving as the No. 2 executive of the Wisconsin state pension fund, still has detractors. Some corporate executives say activist pension funds like Calpers are often ill informed or unqualified to advise companies. **********Moreover, they say, the long-term investment philosophy that pension funds espouse is sometimes abandoned the moment a corporate raider comes along with an above-market offer for their shares, making the funds unreliable partners. **********But Mr. Hanson said he generally received positive responses from executives. \"Most of the companies we meet with, after they find out we don't have horns and a tail, find out we're fairly articulate and that we've spent a lot of time learning their company,\" he said. **********That Mr. Hanson seems to be getting across the message that he has no interest in meddling in the day-to-day management of the companies in which Calpers invests apparently has helped open the lines of communication for others. **********\"We're still seeing some companies that are very recalcitrant about any dialogue with shareholders,\" said Clifford L. Whitehill, the general counsel of General Mills Inc. who is also counsel to a task force on corporate governance formed by the Business Roundtable, an association of large corporations. \"But as a result of dialogue between a number of companies and a number of institutions, with Calpers at the forefront, we have come a lot closer to understanding our common goals.\" **********The Calpers role in shareholder rights grew from the anger felt by Jesse M. Unruh, the late California State Treasurer and a Calpers board member, over \"greenmail\" payments companies made to raiders to avert takeovers. Mr. Unruh helped to create the Council of Institutional Investors, a group of large public-sector pension funds, as a means by which large shareholders could flex their muscles in dealing with the companies they partly owned. **********Gradually, corporate America has felt Calpers's clout. Last year, when the investor Harold C. Simmons fought for control of the Lockheed Corporation, contending in part that the company was poorly managed, Mr. Hanson agreed with Mr. Simmons and voted Calpers's shares against Lockheed's board. **********Mr. Simmons lost, but Mr. Hanson succeeded in shaking up Lockheed's chairman, Daniel M. Tellep. \"When Calpers voted against us, that stung,\" Mr. Tellep said. \"Ultimately, I came to realize that we should never have gotten into a position where Calpers had to vote against us to get our attention, so I resolved to get to know them.\"  Bypassing the Analysts **********Mr. Tellep now meets with all of Lockheed's institutional shareholders instead of communicating only through Wall Street analysts, as Lockheed had done in the past. **********Lockheed also asked Calpers and others for suggestions when it elected three new outside directors last year. And in April, Mr. Tellep enthusiastically accepted Mr. Hanson's invitation to speak to the Council of Institutional Investors on his experiences in recognizing the role of Lockheed's large shareholders. Mr. Tellep entitled his speech \"The Painful, Rewarding Education of a C.E.O.\" **********In other cases, the outcome was more muddled. In response to a Calpers proposal, ITT changed its bylaws regarding the process of setting executive pay. But when Calpers voted against the incumbent ITT board to protest Mr. Araskog's compensation, the pension fund attracted little support from other shareholders. **********Sears agreed to meet twice a year with large shareholders after Calpers proposed a measure to establish a shareholder advisory committee.  Keeping an Eye on Sears **********Mr. Hanson said he remained concerned about Sears's performance, particularly the difficulty the company has had reinvigorating its retail business. The pension fund plans to continue to monitor the company's progress, and Mr. Hanson said he would like to see Sears's board at least consider revamping the company, perhaps by spinning off some or all of its financial-services businesses. **********Mr. Hanson also said Calpers was likely to take on more companies over the issue of executive compensation. He said his objection was not to huge paychecks in and of themselves. Rather, he said, directors have no place approving pay packages that enrich chief executives who preside over falling stock prices and eroding business prospects. **********\"This is going to be one of the big issues of the 90's,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/15/business/company-news-merger-talks-are-suspended.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Merger Talks Are Suspended", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Merger Talks Are Suspended", "body_text": " **********The military contractors Thomson-CSF and British Aerospace P.L.C. today halted three years of talks about merging their tactical missile businesses. **********Alain Gomez, chairman of Thomson-CSF, a French company, told reporters that missile makers were in a quandary over what weapons governments would select in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war and the crumbling of the Soviet bloc. **********Mr. Gomez said it would be 6 to 18 months before military choices would be clear enough to re-examine a possible deal. **********Thomson-CSF separately announced it had agreed to buy a 50 percent stake in the Pilkington Optronics unit of Britain's Pilkington P.L.C. for about $28 million. **********Thomson-CSF, which is majority owned by the French Government, is one of Europe's largest military electronics companies and makes a range of air, sea and ground-launched missiles."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/20/business/business-digest-438891.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 623, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********MARKETS **********Stocks dropped steadily, until late buy orders trimmed the losses.

Hills, today escalated a trade conflict with the European Community over its ban on practically all imports of American meat -- and at the same time suggested a resolution may be in the offing. **********The mixed signals came as the United States, the European Community and nearly 100 other countries are engaged in delicate talks over farm subsidies, trying to find a basis for resuming the talks that collapsed last month in Brussels. **********Trade officials said Mrs. Hills's action was intended to show the seriousness with which the United States takes the meat issue, and at the same time to leave room for the informal talks to continue. Inquiry Begun **********The escalation was an announcement by Mrs. Hills that she had opened an investigation of a complaint brought by the American meat industry that the European ban violated the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world's trade charter, and discrimated against American exporters. **********Such an investigation, which generally lasts a year, could lead to retaliatory action by the President. The United States is losing about $30 million a year in exports. **********The community justified its action on the ground that its meat inspectors had found that health standards were not adequate at American slaughterhouses -- a charge challenged by the American Government and meat industry. **********Washington has demanded scientific proof of the accusations, which the community has not produced. Washington maintains that the charges are a ruse to block meat imports in order to reduce a mountain of surplus European meat caused by big farm surpluses.

Baker 3d left believing that the republics' new commonwealth has little chance of long-term survival, and that Washington will soon be dealing with a dozen independent states with different policies and varied prospects for success. **********By that view, the former Soviet republics are now so enamored of the idea of independence that they cannot work together for long in a meaningful commonwealth, with joint economic and military policies, until they feel the real costs of coming apart. **********That assessment was given to reporters traveling with Mr. Baker as he prepared to return to the United States today to brief President Bush on his visit to Russia, Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, Byelorussia and Ukraine -- all of which will probably be recognized by Washington before the end of the year. Brittle Commonwealth **********Summing up Mr. Baker's overall impressions, reporters were told: \"Whether there is a commonwealth or not, we are going to end up dealing with sovereign, independent nations. Instead of dealing with one foreign minister, it might well end up being 12.\" **********\"The richness of our relationships will depend from republic to republic on the degree to which they embrace democracy and free markets\" as well as the republics' fulfilling their assurances to the United States on nuclear security, an official said. **********The \"only thing that is for sure,\" reporters with Mr. Baker were told, \"is that you should have gone out and bought some Rand McNally stock some time ago\" -- referring to the map company, which must revise its publications. **********Mr. Baker's visit, destined to be the last by an American Secretary of State to the Soviet Union, was a bizarre journey in many ways, turning up a few clues from three scenes in particular. **********The first scene could be called sauna diplomacy. **********Last Wednesday, Mr. Baker visited Kazakhstan, near the border with China. As he was meeting there with President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, the Kazakh leader suggested that he and Mr. Baker get away from the conference table for a more informal chat -- in his sauna. **********So at 1:30 A.M. the two men drove up to a villa in the mountains, stripped naked, and, with a State Department interpreter in tow, retreated into the sauna. There, as the snow fell heavily outside, the Kazakh from the steppes of Central Asia and the Texan from Houston, discussed the fate of the Soviet Union until almost 3 A.M. **********Earlier in the day, while Mr. Baker was visiting Bishkek, the capital of Kirghizia, the President of that republic dressed Mr. Baker in a multicolored Kirghiz robe and hat, so he could get a better feel for the local color. **********And Mr. Baker did see a lot of local color. In fact, if he drew one conclusion from his trip, it was that the United States is going to have to deal with a lot of different local colors -- probably too many -- from now on. **********Mr. Baker concluded that forces pulling the Soviet Union apart are so strong that the individual republics will soon be pursuing their own homemade economic policies -- with their own currencies, degrees of free-market drive and possibly protectionist practices. **********Republics like Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kirghizia, which are rich in natural resources, have quick-footed leaders eager to cut deals with Western businesses, and relatively homogeneous populations. But the prospects are less clear for republics like Russia, which has a high potential for infighting among the leadership and 100 ethnic minorities that could pull the republic apart further from within. **********In fact, reporters were told that Mr. Baker left Russia feeling that \"things have broken down there -- everything has broken down.\" The distribution system has collapsed, middle-class families are having to forage for food and crime is rampant. Without emergency food shipments, officials said, social unrest is likely in the cities before the winter is out. **********If the West is lucky, reporters were told, the commonwealth will be able to maintain at least a common defense policy that will allow for a single, unified command over nuclear weapons until they can be dismantled in every republic except Russia. But even that remains questionable. Toeing U.S. Line **********Another scene could be called the pro-American competition. **********Wherever Mr. Baker went on this trip, leaders seemed to be competing to see who could seem the most pro-American, pro-democratic and pro-capitalist. **********President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan told Mr. Baker that he now keeps a copy of the \"Baker five principles,\" in the top drawer of this desk. Those principles were laid out by Mr. Baker as a sort of informal yardstick for United States relations with the newly independent republics. They are very general principles -- things like \"we support democracy and the rule of law\" and \"the safeguarding of human rights.\" **********The leader who managed to seem most pro-American was Askar A. Akayev, President of Kirghizia, who said at his news conference in Bishkek with Mr. Baker: \"I think if one looks at the memorable speech of the Secretary of State that he gave on Dec. 12 at Princeton and those principles which he enunciated there, and also the fact that the United States has taken a leadership position in not only implementing those principles but also in all the programs and aid that the United States is heading up, this will give us an opportunity to make this transition thanks to the United States.\" **********Those extraordinary displays by former Soviet officials were at once encouraging and disconcerting to the Baker party. They were encouraging because the values the leaders were espousing were Western values instead of worn-out Marxist ones, but they were worrisome because some of the performances seemed as thin and empty as the apocryphal \"Potemkin villages\" the Russian field marshal supposedly built along the route of Catherine the Great's tour of the Crimea to impress her. **********Mr. Baker had a news conference in Kiev with President Leonid M. Kravchuk, during which Mr. Kravchuk seemed to say everything Mr. Baker wanted to hear. Later, Dora Chomiak, a recent Princeton University graduate who has been working in Kiev, commented on the coverage of the Baker visit by American correspondents. **********\"It's pretty funny,\" said Miss Chomiak, who works for the Ukrainian-American Renaissance Foundation. \"I mean, I hear you reporting that Kravchuk promised this and Kravchuk said that, and I have to tell you he says a lot of things that the people want to hear, but a lot of it never gets done. Or when it does, it's sort of slapped together. Right after Kravchuk signed the first commonwealth agreement in Brest, he came back to the Parliament here to get it ratified and it was really a farce. I mean, they didn't debate it. Half the members didn't even know what they were voting on.\" **********A third scene could be called Greetings and Farewells. **********When Mr. Baker's delegation got word that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia intended to meet them for the first time ever in the Kremlin, seated in the same room, at the same table and in the same chair in which President Gorbachev used to meet them, they bristled. They saw it as a crude attempt by Mr. Yeltsin to rub Mr. Gorbachev's nose in his political defeat. When Mr. Baker shook hands with Mr. Yeltsin that day in Catherine's hall, he looked stiff and uncomfortable. **********Eight hours later, Mr. Baker was holding a news conference with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. It was an emotional scene as they met in the building where they had done so much business together. Mr. Shevardnadze bear-hugged several members of Mr. Baker's staff when they left. Mr. Baker kept calling him \"my friend and colleague.\" **********Why will Mr. Baker miss Mr. Shevardnadze? Reporters traveling with the Baker party were told: \"I will miss him because he was a man of great integrity\" and because \"he's a very reasonable, rational person.\" **********American officials don't like Mr. Yeltsin. In part it is because they believe he is less predictable than Mr. Gorbachev and in part because he did in their friends. The terms they use to describe him are: \"crude,\" \"populist,\" \"peasant-like,\" \"impulsive.\" **********\"By the end,\" said an American official, \"Baker could deal with Shevardnadze as though he were an allied foreign minister. Yeltsin is more gruff, feisty, rude. Even though we like his politics more, we still find the man off-putting. The way he drove the final nails into the coffins of Gorbachev and Shevardnadze, with such alacrity, made us all shudder.\" **********The \"funny thing\" is, though, the official said, \"Yeltsin was always closer to our ideas of what needed to be done inside the Soviet Union than Shevardnadze or Gorbachev. He was actually listening while we were lecturing and the other guys were not. But it was like in deposing Gorbachev he deposed our friends, and it is going to take time to get over that.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/22/business/business-digest-948891.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 663, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********The Economy **********The House and the Senate passed legislation to replenish the deposit insurance fund.

Their decisions add to the already swollen inventories of available space while creating leasing opportunities at below-market rents for other tenants. **********Sango, a marketer of chinaware, stoneware and flatware, which now has offices and a showroom in Manhattan and a warehouse in Pennsauken in southern New Jersey, will consolidate most of those operations into the new Meadowlands space, said Lawrence Tannenbaum, vice president of the company. Sango, a unit of Kasuga Sales Ltd. of Japan, signed a nine-year lease with options for 10 more years. Neither Sango nor Gucci would discuss the terms. **********Sango is retaining its showroom in Manhattan's Giftware Building at 41 Madison Avenue at the corner of East 26th Street. Mr. Tannenbaum said the company also planned to open a retail outlet at the Secaucus site. **********Gucci will continue to occupy the remaining 200,000 square feet it leases for a distribution office and retail location in the low-rise building along Hartz Way, close to Route 3. Gucci would not comment on the reasons for the space cutback. **********The site is part of Harmon Cove, a 250-acre industrial complex with 16 million square feet of office, warehouse and retail space that Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus has been developing since the 1970's. **********The real estate recession has taken its toll on the Meadowlands region, which over the last two decades had been transformed from mostly empty marshlands into a bustling commercial, industrial and residential precinct. At 25 percent, the vacancy rate for industrial space in the 32-square-mile region, which takes in parts of 14 communities in Hudson and Bergen counties, has nearly doubled since 1988, according to the East Rutherford office of the brokerage firm Cushman & Wakefield. **********Of the 10.7 million square feet of available space in the region, 9.5 million are leased directly and 1.1 million are subleased, said Stanley Danzig, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield. Indications are that subleasing in the Meadowlands region will rise, Mr. Danzig said. **********At the same time, rents have dropped by 33 percent, to an average of slightly more than $4 a square foot, Mr. Danzig said, adding that sublet space could be as much as 25 percent lower. Meanwhile, the construction of new space has slowed, which will help bring supply back into balance with demand, he added. **********With only about 1,200 of nearly 20,000 Meadowlands acres left to develop, the emphasis for future growth will be on infrastructure improvements -- including a rail station to link the area to different parts of the state -- and on affordable housing, said Robert Grant, a spokesman for the state's Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission. The commission, along with the Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and the state's Department of Environmental Protection and the Sports and Exposition Authority, oversees development in the region. **********In the older industrial areas of the Meadowlands there will be opportunities for redevelopment, Mr. Grant noted. Despite the level of vacancies, leasing activity in the Meadowlands continues, albeit more slowly, as companies, looking for good deals, expand within or relocate to the area. The latter will \"always include firms that need to service Manhattan,\" and want to take advantage of the area's location as well as save on taxes, utilities and services, Mr. Danzig said. **********Another draw, he said, is that at some projects, companies are permitted to use 10 percent of their space for retail operations. **********Those factors were among the reasons for Sango's move. The company searched for a new location in the metropolitan area for 18 months before choosing the Gucci site, said Norman Sturner, general partner of the Murray Hill Properties Corporation, which brokered the lease. He said the site afforded the company not only one of the most accessible spots within the park, but also one of the most heavily traveled. **********It lies in a section of the park that over the years has become recognized as a retail outlet center. Besides Gucci, other businesses with outlets there include Liz Claiborne Inc. and the Mikasa Company. **********The move into one location will enable the company to operate more efficiently, said Mr. Tannenbaum of Sango, noting that the setting \"is exactly what we wanted.\" He said his company plans to relocate its offices into the space by December. No timetable has been set for the warehouse move. **********Ernest Christoph, a Hartz Mountain vice president, said the vacancy rate in the Harmon Cove complex was only 5 percent and his company was willing to make aggressive deals to draw tenants.

Little Discussed in West **********The plan, laid out two months ago by Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's Prime Minister and the steward of one of Asia's biggest economic success stories, has been little discussed in the West, but it has become one of the hottest topics in East Asia. **********It is still far from clear that Mr. Mahathir's East Asian economic grouping will ever come to pass, especially in a region that has never been able to translate its political alliances into economic ones. While his idea has attracted some support, its success hinges on the willingness of one participant: Japan, whose economy is the linchpin of the rest of Asia. **********So far, Japanese politicians are skittish about any economic alliance that would seem to pit it against Europe and the United States, which has developed a free-trade agreement with Canada and is working toward one with Mexico. **********The next few months will be crucial, as Malaysia completes its first round of explanations and seeks to create a formal trading body. It could pick up more support, especially if the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks fails, paving the way for fiercer direct competition.  Trade Barriers Common **********Many Asian countries are known for erecting huge trade barriers to protect their infant industries. Malaysia produces manufactured goods that it cannot sell to its closest neighbors, and it slaps huge taxes on imported cars and other goods. **********But Mr. Mahathir, who in 10 years as Malaysia's Prime Minister has become a powerful and sometimes feared figure in Southeast Asian politics, has clearly struck a chord with his idea for a more organized and aggressive Asian economic alliance. **********\"Singly, we will have no hope of arguing our case,\" he said. \"Only together will we have more bargaining power and be in a better position when negotiating for free trade.\" **********No one, not even some of Mr. Mahathir's Cabinet members, can define precisely what kind of economic bloc he is trying to form. Everyone seems to agree that it would include the six members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, or Asean: Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei and Malaysia. Mr. Mahathir has said that the group will also include Vietnam, Myanmar (formerly Burma), Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea. **********But the list excludes countries populated chiefly by non-Asian races, including Australia and New Zealand. For weeks, Malaysia's Minister for International Trade and Industry, Rafidah Aziz, has been traveling through Asia seeking members. **********\"What we are talking about is enhancing regional trade among countries with commonalities here in Asia,\" said Mrs. Rafidah, who supports Mr. Mahathir. **********The Prime Minister's plan has not been welcomed by everyone, and Malaysia has been amending parts of it. Indonesia has expressed no enthusiasm, and Taiwan and Hong Kong, among others, have been silent. **********The reasons for the objections are not clear, but some Asian officials say they fear that a poisoning of relations with the United States or Japan could hurt their best chances for export. Last week, Mr. Mahathir said he thought the United States was trying to influence some nations not to join the trade group, which American officials in Kuala Lumpur deny. **********In the last two months, since Mr. Mahathir took his Cabinet and neighboring nations by surprise with the proposal, the description of the trade grouping has begun to shift. He originally spoke of a trading bloc, immediately prompting fears that he was looking for a way to create trade barriers against countries outside Asia. **********The word \"bloc\" was then deemed offensive because it could scare away Japan and could raise the ire of American officials, who have not supported the plan. Malaysia now is speaking of a \"grouping\" that would work within multilateral trading groups, like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. **********Officials in Kuala Lumpur also insist it would \"complement\" other organizations, like Asean, a 24-year old political alliance that has never been effective as an economic entity.  The Plan's Objective **********The object, Malaysia says, is to turn Southeast Asia into a leading exporting force and an investment haven, to give it power to match Europe and America. So far, exporting is dominated by Japan and, to a lesser degree, the nations known as the \"four tigers\": South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Only Japan enjoys such political influence. **********\"The whole line is that this will not exclude anybody, as long as they look Asian,\" one Western diplomat here said. \"But no one can say what 'complement' means. And this is hardly a group of like-minded countries they are getting together.\" **********Indeed, it is a collection of nations at different stages of development. **********At one end of the spectrum are the \"tigers.\" They have grown so quickly in the last decade that they are looking for cheap labor and investment opportunities abroad. Then comes nations like Thailand, perhaps Asia's greatest success story in the late 1980's, though it has begun to show signs of choking on its overexpansion. Malaysia follows, a country that has quickly moved beyond the days of tin and rubber plantations to become a manufacturing center. **********But also in the group are countries mired in problems of economic reform, like China, Myanmar, North Korea and Vietnam, all of which have discussed various degrees of economic reform, but have actively resisted political liberalization. Each has considerable poverty and lack a skilled work force. Capitalists and Communists **********If they joined, it would be the first time that some of the world's most fervent capitalists, like the Singaporeans, joined some of its most unreconstructed Communists, like the Vietnamese, in a trading group. **********But the critical element to the grouping is Japan, which still has no formal relations with North Korea and is on strained terms with Myanmar and Vietnam. Some Japanese officials have suggested that Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu may be unenthusiastic about the proposal. **********So, at first, were most other countries. But Singapore changed its mind last month, and its new Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong, said the grouping would give small Asian countries a voice they now lack. The Philippines has also been mildly supportive, and China termed the idea interesting. Indonesia and Thailand, Malaysia's biggest competitors, have all but dismissed the concept. **********The United States has said little, but American diplomats in Asia seem unenthused, particularly because the United States would be excluded. **********\"It will take some time to fully develop a view,\" said one American diplomat here, \"because no one can quite figure out what the idea is yet.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/31/business/crossland-will-seek-a-merger.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1991-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 704, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Crossland Will Seek A Merger", "print_headline": "Crossland Will Seek A Merger", "body_text": " **********Crossland Savings, one of the largest savings institutions in New York state, announced yesterday that its losses from bad loans had accumulated to the point that it had agreed with Federal regulators to seek a merger with a stronger company. **********Until a partner is found, the Brooklyn-based savings bank will remain open for business, and its deposits will continue to be insured up to the maximum of $100,000 per account allowed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. **********Crossland, which changed its name in 1985 from Metropolitan Savings Bank to reflect its grand plans to expand nationwide, was a victim of the downturn in the New York real estate market.

Announces $123 Million Loss **********Yesterday, as a Federal bank examination neared completion, Crossland announced a second-quarter loss of $123.1 million, equal to $8.84 a share. Losses have totaled $741 million in the last two-and-one-half years. **********The company was unable to replenish its capital base as outside investor groups, like the Coast to Coast Financial Corporation, controlled by the Pritzker family of Chicago, shied away. By yesterday, its capital shortfall was so great that a proposed plan to convert debt and preferred stock to new equity would not have been enough to meet minimum Federal standards. **********Although Crossland is insolvent by the regulators' accounting rules, it will not be closed. \"By allowing them to remain open we have learned that you can avoid the deterioration in values that normally occurs with a Government conservatorship,\" said a senior official in the Office of Thrift Supervision, who insisted that he not be identified. He added, \"With core deposits of $6 billion, it is a very attractive company.\" Large Cost to Government **********Because any buyer of Crossland would accept only the financially sound parts of its business, however, F.D.I.C. officials estimate that a merger would cost the Government agency $500 million to $1 billion, making it one of the 10 most expensive bank collapses in history. **********Crossland, with $9.9 billion in assets, vies with the Dime Savings Bank, of Garden City, L.I., as the largest savings institution in the New York market. **********Regulators predicted that a buyer for Crossland could be found in two to four months, and said that the Republic National Bank of New York had already expressed an interest, as had two other unidentified banks. Republic, which acquired the Williamsburg Savings Bank and the Manhattan Savings Bank on favorable terms in the late 1980's, is one of the strongest banks in the country. **********\"Any of the large banks in the city would be interested in their branch network,\" said Gary Gordon, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. Other banks will shun Crossland's holdings of troubled real estate loans, he said, but he noted that the institution's branches were extraordinarily effective at collecting consumer deposits, which average more than $200 million a branch and exceed $300 million at some branches.  Dim View for Shareholders **********Howard Rosencrans, an analyst at H. D. Brous & Company, a securities firm in Great Neck, L.I., said he expected that Crossland's value to common shareholders, as well as to holders of its $330 million of preferred stock, \"will be wiped out by whatever merger occurs.\" Crossland's common stock fell 25 cents yesterday, to 50 cents a share, on the New York Stock Exchange, which plans to de-list the company's issues. **********Mr. Rosencrans said that as losses mounted in the last two years, prospects of a rebound grew dim \"and the main goal of management has been to prevent a run by depositors.\" Crossland's chairman, Maurice L. Reissman, who is 48 years old, will remain the company's top officer, at least until a merger is arranged. **********The slide in Crossland's fortunes was swift.

It featured experimental bicycles and cargo tricycles, high-tech electric go-carts and a solar-powered plastic car, a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of rain and heat, and a sense that a long evolutionary struggle lies ahead. **********If the automobile is the dinosaur, as the festival's organizers maintain, then perhaps these are the primitive mammals that will supplant it -- still scurrying in the underbrush for fear of being squashed, but confident that technology is evolving their way. **********In Washington, tourists gawked and Congressmen ignored them, but at least workers at the Environmental Protection Agency gave them an attentive welcome. Lightwheels, the New York group that organized the event, planned to proceed to New York under alternative power, keeping to the back roads. The idea was to somehow look inconspicuous, since there was no parade permit. **********But this morning, facing an expected high of 95 degrees and a shortage of riders, most of the vehicles went into the back of a lumbering second-hand U-Haul truck on the way to a display at Harford Community College in Bel Air, Md. **********Still, imagination and ingenuity were as powerful as internal combustion. John G. Tetz, a designer at Bell Laboratories, brought his redesigned bicycle, to which he had grafted the engine of a weed trimmer. Delivering two-tenths of a horsepower, it was not selected for speed, but to assist on hills without weighing the rider down when it wasn't running. **********Mr. Tetz rode (drove?) from Florida to New Jersey earlier this year on 107 ounces of gasoline. \"I only talk ounces,\" he said. For those who insist on talking miles per gallon, that comes to well over 1,000. **********A rider can supply far more energy over a day at moderate effort, said Mr. Tetz, so using the engine on hills aids human efficiency. The problem, he said, is that his device is for serious transportation, which is not what comes to mind when people see a bicycle married to a Weed Eater.   Ugly Duckling With Solar Cells **********Darrell E. Murphy, an electrical engineer at a Tennessee nuclear plant, brought a homemade electric car -- the Sundriver -- that charges itself with solar cells on the hood and roof. His car looks like an ugly duckling, he volunteered, and in the leading electric car race, the American Tour de Sol, he came in behind the General Motors entry this year and last. But G.M.'s car cost millions to develop, he pointed out; his budget was limited to \"whatever is in my pocket that day.\" **********The car, his sixth, cost less than $10,000 for materials, including $2,800 for the solar cells, he said. It carries four Sears lead-acid batteries of the kind commonly found on motorboats and goes 30 to 35 miles on a charge, whether by sun or house current. It had to come up from Sale Creek, Tenn., on a homemade trailer behind a factory-made Chevy pickup truck. **********The solar car is built mostly of plastic plumbing pipes. Freed from its trailer for a ride in the sunshine this morning, it squeaked down the road as a plastic car might be expected to -- but not loud enough to drown out the chirping birds. Because its range is so short, taking the electric car on the road is a two-man operation, with an assistant driving the pickup truck. **********For most of these eco-inventors, commercial production is a dream so far. Mr. Murphy hopes to mass-produce his car if he can patent the plastic frame and then find a rich, environmentally minded backer. Mr. Tetz is also looking for support; not even the McCulloch Corporation, which gave him the weed-trimmer motor, seems interested. **********George Bliss of New York City brought a cargo tricycle -- the \"Maxi-Loader Dump Trike\" -- with a capacity of more than 400 pounds, that his company, Human Power Research, has recently begun selling in Manhattan as an alternative to delivery vans. He built his first after the city towed his van and he could not afford to pay the parking tickets to retrieve it from the pound. **********He also brought a gaggle of pedicabs, or bicycle rickshaws, which are still awaiting a market. Some of the pedicabs have sidecars in which the passenger faces the person pedaling. \"Tandem bicycles are considered the height of romantic, but you can't have a conversation on them without turning around and endangering your life,\" Mr. Bliss said. **********As the former manager of a salvage shop, his creations incorporate some obviously recycled parts, like chaise longues. One has a rattan seat on a bentwood chair under a huge umbrella. It is the Whimcycle, Mr. Bliss said, inspired by the fanciful machines in Dr. Seuss's \"The Cat in the Hat.\"   Attention and Companionship **********It runs against the basic premise of the Industrial Revolution to substitute muscle for machine, but Mr. Bliss has found his pedicabs get warm public attention. He pedaled one on the Five Borough Bicycle Tour in April, his passenger a woman he had met at a party the previous evening. Spectators hailed him by shouting that chivalry was not dead. **********Other participants hoping to hit the mass market include John Benditt. He is lobbying the Department of Energy for a $150,000 grant to develop and begin manufacturing his Recumbent Electric Muscular Moped, an all-terrain vehicle that is a study in minimalism. His existing model looks like a high-tech go-cart, with three wheels and a fiberglass shell. He plans a four-wheel model with a plexiglass windscreen. **********A recumbent design lets the rider sit with legs stretched out to the pedals, a position that allows greater muscle efficiency and lower wind resistance than a conventional bicycle. Although Mr. Tetz's weed-trimmer bicycle also uses this approach, Mr. Benditt's version is assisted by an electric motor. A small battery can be charged on house current and by generating electricity from some of the energy the moped loses in braking. It can cover 25 to 30 miles at a top speed of 25 miles an hour. **********An energetic human would provide about 25 percent of the power, but someone who would settle for a shorter range would not have to pedal at all. Mr. Benditt plans to add solar cells to recharge the battery and a propeller to make his moped amphibious, among other refinements.   Mechanics and Philosophers **********Mr. Benditt describes himself as a mechanic and jack-of-all-trades, a description that fits most participants. In previous years, people like these might have built better mousetraps; in the biotech future, perhaps, a better mouse. Right now, in an era of rising pollution and oil imports, men like these focus on transportation. (All of the festival participants were men, although women have observed the benefits of alternative vehicles from the pedicabs' passenger seats.) **********But there is also an element of social engineering, especially by the organizer, Steve Stollman, a New York City cabinetmaker who calls cars anti-human. \"The automobile is the perfect expression of what not to do -- to poison people, threaten to kill them, and take up their space,\" he said. Cars isolate people from one another, too, he said. He says he doubts that Detroit can combine the environmental benefits of the bicycle with some of the creature comforts of the car. Reform, if it comes, will come from the bottom up, he said. **********The vehicles are scheduled to roll into New York on Tuesday. Lightwheels will exhibit some of them at the Urban Center of the Municipal Art Society, 457 Madison Avenue at 51st Street, from July 10 until Sept. 6."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/29/business/the-media-business-advertising-network-sales-executive-in-new-role.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1991-04-29", "snippet": "JERRY DOMINUS, the vice president of sales at CBS for seven years, had an unusual lunch partner recently -- Larry Hoffner, who runs sales at NBC.\n\n\"We found we had a lot to talk about,\" Mr. Dominus said with a laugh.\n\nThe reason: Jerome Henry Domi...", "word_count": 626, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;\nNetwork Sales Executive In New Role After 25 Years", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;\nNetwork Sales Executive In New Role After 25 Years", "body_text": " **********JERRY DOMINUS, the vice president of sales at CBS for seven years, had an unusual lunch partner recently -- Larry Hoffner, who runs sales at NBC. **********\"We found we had a lot to talk about,\" Mr. Dominus said with a laugh. **********The reason: Jerome Henry Dominus is scheduled to start his new job today as senior vice president and director of national television and programming in the United States for J. Walter Thompson. **********Executives often move back and forth between television and advertising, especially between television sales and agency media buying. After all, who would know more about how to strike a hard bargain with a network sales executive than a former network sales executive? **********But in the case of Mr. Dominus, the change seems particularly noteworthy. He ran all of CBS television advertising sales for seven years until 1989, when the company undertook a reorganization. Since then, he has headed prime-time sales, among other duties. **********By switching sides, the 52-year-old Mr. Dominus offers another reminder that there is a growing world beyond the original three networks. Indeed, the prime reason for leaving CBS, he said, is to \"broaden his palette\" and make advertising buying decisions in the cable and syndications markets, as well as with other networks. **********\"The networks are absolutely the single most powerful medium available to any marketer and will continue to be by a wide margin for many years,\" Mr. Dominus said last week. \"But they just are not where they were when I started the business.\" **********The change in the networks' status leaves network television work \"intellectually more stimulating and demanding,\" he said. \"And there are still many, many exciting and glamorous aspects of the business. But of course it's become much more competitive.\" **********His decision to leave comes at an important time for advertisers and clients. Every year around this time, the networks and advertising agencies who buy commercial time for clients begin what Mr. Dominus likes to call a \"multibillion-dollar crapshoot\" -- the negotiating of long-term advertising deals in the \"up front\" season in advance of the fall television season, and then later the filling out of advertising schedules in the \"scatter market.\" **********Last year, for the first time in years, demand for commercial time in the scatter market was weak, bringing prices down to the point that better deals were struck there than in the normally cheaper up-front market. **********Smart deal-making is crucial because the fluctuation in price for a typical 30-second network commercial during prime time can be staggering: from $80,000 to $300,000, many advertising and television executives say. The same piece of commercial time can fetch a dozen different prices. **********\"Everyone is trying to figure out a strategy,\" Mr. Dominus said. **********Many media buyers say some advertisers have gone ahead and quietly struck long-term deals, believing that tradition will return and the best bargains will be offered early. Mr. Dominus said that could be a smart move because if too many advertisers waited for the scatter market, demand would outstrip supply and prices would rise. Other buyers say they are determined to wait. **********Reflecting on his 25 years at CBS, Mr. Dominus said he was proud of several achievements, including the aggressive multimedia promotions CBS had undertaken. Among them was a contest giving away a full-sized replica of the house at Southfork Ranch on \"Dallas.\" **********The promotion linked the viewing of \"Dallas\" with coupons tied to the show that were placed in newspapers by \"Dallas\" advertisers. **********\"This re-enforced the value of network advertising for a payoff in another medium,\" he said. \"Finding other ways to expand on that relationship is one thing I'm looking forward to.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/29/business/leaders-of-plastics-industry-seeking-25-recycling-goal.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1991-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 358, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Leaders of Plastics Industry Seeking 25% Recycling Goal", "print_headline": "Leaders of Plastics Industry Seeking 25% Recycling Goal", "body_text": " **********Perceiving a strong public demand for environmentally sound products, leaders of the plastics industry said today that they would seek to recycle 25 percent of all plastic bottles and containers produced every year by 1995. **********The most recent figures from the Environmental Protection Agency show that only slightly more than 1 percent of all plastic products are currently recycled. **********John E.

All but 3 of his 33 students in the summer term have been evacuated from the Philippines, and Mr. Cataquian says he will soon be forced out of business.  'People Will Suffer' **********\"Some people say it will be a good thing if the Americans leave Clark,\" he said. \"I can tell you that people in Angeles do not believe that. If the Americans leave, there will be so many people out of work. People will suffer.\" **********Most of the 15,000 Americans have already left, driven away by Mount Pinatubo. With scientists saying eruptions may continue for several years, the economy of Angeles is already in grave peril. But a permanent shutdown of Clark would cost the jobs of 40,000 Filipinos employed at the base before the eruption and result annually in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue to local businesses. **********The Philippine Government once proposed that Clark be replaced by a civilian airport or by an industrial park, but those plans have been put on hold because of Mount Pinatubo. **********Angeles has long had a reputation among American servicemen as a city of vice -- of massage parlors and 24-hour honky-tonk bars -- and to some degree that reputation is deserved. **********The main streets of the city are lined with businesses that cater exclusively to the licentious pleasures of American air men. It is for that reason alone that some prominent Filipinos, appalled by the prostitution and public drunkenness around the base, are pleased at the prospect of an American withdrawal. Others see the bases as an unwelcome vestige of the days when the Philippines were a United States colony.  Streets Clogged With Ash **********Yet a walk through the city, along wide streets still clogged by the talc-like volcanic ash, would suggest that few critics of the base are to be found among the residents of Angeles. Directly or indirectly, most Filipinos who live here depend on Clark for their livelihood, and they are frightened by the American threat to pull out. **********\"The Americans have brought influences that are good and bad,\" said Carlos de la Cruz, secretary of the Clark Field Baptist Church, which is a few hundred yards from the entrance to the base, and a block from a cluster of saloons and a massage parlor. **********\"Personally, I believe there is much more good because of the Americans,\" he said. \"Isn't it good that the Americans can provide jobs?\" Since the eruption, the church has lost the American half of its 300-member congregation, and Sunday offerings are down from $1,500 a week to less than $300. **********The church's American pastor has gone home to the United States, and it is not clear whether a permanent replacement will arrive. Mr. de la Cruz said the church may soon have to lay off some of its six Philippine workers. **********Because of jobs created by the base, Angeles has long been an affluent city in a nation in which the per-capita income is less than $1,000 a year.  Pizza Hut and Dunkin' Donuts **********The American influence is everywhere in the city. There is a McDonald's, a Pizza Hut, a Kentucky Fried Chicken, a Dunkin' Donuts, a Bank of Boston branch office, a Goodyear auto center. All employ many Filipinos. **********\"I am very pro-bases,\" said Len Medina, a 27-year-old Angeles native who is the day supervisor at the Pizza Hut. \"These are good jobs we have.\" **********Residents of Angeles are conversant in the details of base negotiations between the Philippines and the United States. They seem well aware that the United States is closing military bases at home, and that many Americans are losing jobs because of Pentagon cuts. **********But Mariz de Jesus, a 35-year-old hostess at the U & I Canteen, said the plight of Filipinos would be far more bleak. \"It is not the same,\" she said. \"If the Americans leave from Clark, there is no hope for us.

Mr. Kravchuk has adapted by dropping the Russian language from his public appearances and speaking only Ukrainian. **********More painful for Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Kravchuk's Parliament has blocked the Soviet leader's hopes for early adoption of a treaty of national unity with the sovereignty-hungry republics. **********For decades the Ukraine has seethed with the memories of Soviet economic exploitation and wholesale terror. An estimated 10 million people perished in the famine that resulted from Stalin's policies 60 years ago. **********Nowadays, with politics opened up by the reforms of Mr. Gorbachev, the Ukraine seethes with outspoken ethnic groups and dozens of political parties that broadcast every variety of independence and sovereignty demands. **********A year after the republic's Parliament declared its sovereignty over the laws of the national Government, the Ukraine is taking the first steps toward forming the officer corps of its own army. Officials are trying to produce the first Ukrainian currency. **********Mr. Bush will find few stops free of controversy on his itinerary through this city, the third-largest in the nation, with 2.5 million people. **********Some Ukrainian Jews complain that the nearby memorial at Babi Yar, the Nazi killing ground that Mr. Bush will visit during his tour, offers scant recognition that tens of thousands who died there were Jews. **********The Parliament where he will speak still has a Communist majority, but it is one that recently scrambled to stay abreast of the sovereignty fever, rejecting the party's call to vote for the speedy debate sought by Mr. Gorbachev for the proposed union treaty. **********Instead, the Parliament, mindful of the public's growing militancy, has refused to even consider the measure until September.

That ban, formally accepted by the Baghdad Government, was among the terms set by the United Nations for a cease-fire formally ending the Persian Gulf war. **********The draft resolution would require Iraq to report on a range of scientific and industrial activity and provide detailed lists of any machinery, chemicals or other materials that could be used in weapons. It would also provide for highly intrusive inspections to guard against cheating by the Iraqis.

These documents indicated Iraq that hoped to produce up to 200 pounds of lithium 6 annually. But they did not show whether it has produced any yet. Mr. Blix said the amount of lithium needed for a hydrogen weapon was closely guarded secret known only to those powers who have developed them. **********Even as the Security Council is planning to monitor future military activities in Iraq, United Nations inspectors have been destroying its banned weapons that survived the gulf war air raids intact. **********Today, ballistics experts supervised the destruction of the smaller of Iraq's two \"superguns,\" which are huge cannons capable of hurling shells at least 400 miles away and which Iraq could have used to attack neighboring capitals. **********At a site in the mountains 110 miles north of Baghdad, the United Nations inspectors watched as Iraqi workers made slits and holes in the 150-foot barrel of the 350mm gun that stood in a well-camouflaged site, rendering the weapon inoperable. **********Iraqi officials told the United Nations team that they had test fired this gun at a range of 125 to 160 miles. That is more than twice the 75-mile range of Big Bertha, the huge cannon Germany used to shell Paris in World War I. **********On Tuesday, the inspectors verified the destruction of the much larger 300-foot gun, which Iraq was planning to build but never assembled. As they did today, workers had cut holes in sections of the barrel and removed the flanges or projecting rims, making it impossible to join the sections together. The bigger gun's range has been estimated at more than 400 miles. Iraq had plans to build five such cannons.  Explosive Is Blown Up **********The inspectors also blew up several tons of the specially imported Belgian explosive that was used in the guns. **********Iraq's supergun project was discovered last year after British customs agents blocked shipment of sections of the British-built barrels, which Iraq said were piping intended for a petrochemical plant. **********The 11-man team of ballistics experts is lead by Douglas M. Englund, an American Army colonel. The experts have also been flying around the western Iraqi desert in helicopters searching for undeclared scud missiles sites. In one day they found 16 such undeclared launchers.

Plans to Offer Faster Data Transfer", "body_text": " **********A.T.& T., the world's largest telecommunications company, announced yesterday that it was offering a new form of data transmission nearly 30 times as fast as current methods. **********Known as frame relay, the service will substantially speed the transfer of text, numbers and images among banks, hospitals, insurance companies and others whose fast computers have outpaced the capacity of telephone lines to transfer data quickly to remote offices. **********Frame relay's usefulness is confined to data transfer, so it is expected to appeal mainly to large business and institutional customers. But perhaps frame relay's real significance is as a transition technology to an emerging method known as cell relay, which is 2,770 times as fast as current methods. **********Cell relay, available in perhaps three to five years, can carry voice, video and data, and would make possible video-conferencing, conversations and the swift transfer of information simultaneously -- the \"multimedia\" promise of the Information Age that has been slow in coming.  Raising the Transfer Speed **********Current technology, known as X.25, transfers data at no more than 56,000 bits, or binary digits, a second. Frame relay works at 1.54 million bits a second and cell relay at 19.4 million bits. **********In a demonstration for reporters, American Telephone and Telegraph Company officials transferred the detailed color image of a living human brain from a hospital computer in Atlanta to the conference room in midtown Manhattan. A kind of X-ray without an X-ray, the magnetic resonance image took less than a second to arrive in New York. If the same image had been transferred by X.25, it would have taken more than an hour. **********A.T.& T. plans to make frame relay available early next year. Its principal competitors, MCI and U S Sprint, have already announced frame relay offerings for next year. Also, companies like Wiltel in Tulsa, Okla., and the giant BT, formerly British Telecommunications, are also offering such services. **********But A.T.& T. is by far the largest company in the nascent market and by that fact alone will sharply expand frame relay's availability. A.T.& T. has nearly 500 \"points of presence,\" or physical locations where business customers can link to its network. **********The Yankee Group, a high-technology consulting firm, estimates that the market for frame-relay service and equipment could total at least $721 million by 1995, but other analysts, like the Gartner Group, say the market may easily exceed $1 billion by then. **********By waiting for its long-distance rivals to announce their plans, A.T.& T. forced them to show their hands, while still making a frame-relay offering at the same time as its competitors, said Berge A. Ayvasian, an analyst at the Yankee Group. **********In the same news conference yesterday, A.T.& T. announced two other services, a telephone referral service now being tested by Domino's Pizza and an information access service for business executives and others with portable computers. **********The referral service, known as Store Locator, would allow a company to offer a single easy-to-remember telephone number nationwide beginning with the prefix 950. Domino's, which is still market-testing the technique, would use it to allow a pizza customer to dial 950-1430 anywhere in the country and get the nearest Domino's store. **********The laptop computer service, known as Information Access Service, would allow business executives on the road to dial a toll-free number, 950-1-ATT, and gain access to customized data bases. **********Separately, Alex J. Mandl, A.T.& T.'s new chief financial officer and group excecutive, told securities analysts that the company's financial performance in the fourth quarter, ending Dec. 31, was being hurt by the recession. \"We are disappointed with the sluggish economy and we are experiencing some effects from that,\" he said, but was not more specific."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/11/business/credit-markets-interest-rates-are-little-changed.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1991-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 769, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Interest Rates Are Little Changed", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Interest Rates Are Little Changed", "body_text": " **********Interest rates were little changed yesterday, as traders waited for some sign that the Federal Reserve would ease monetary policy and encourage lower interest rates. **********Although the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market slipped below 5 1/2 percent, its recent level during the afternoon, there was no signal from the Fed that it would supply the extra funds that would bring the overnight rate down on a sustained basis. **********Still, the decline in interest rates has already gone far enough that many high-quality companies decided that the time was ripe for selling new bonds. **********By late in the day, nearly $2.8 billion of new securities had been issued by such blue-chip borrowers as the Boeing Company, the Ford Motor Company and the General Electric Company. **********The flurry of new corporate issues came at a time when many investors and economists say that the economy is weak enough to justify at least one more push downward on short-term rates by the Federal Reserve. The drop in long-term Treasury bond yields to about 8 percent, from 8.48 percent as recently as July 23, is a sign, they said, that the financial markets do not expect a a resurgence of inflation. With inflationary expectations dampened, many analysts say the Fed has more leeway to reduce short-term interest rates. **********Many analysts expect the Fed's next move to include a cut in the discount rate it charges banks to 5 percent from 5 1/2 percent and a drop in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market to 5 1/4 percent from 5 1/2 percent. Another move by the Fed to lower short-term interest rates could also set the stage for a cut in the prime lending rate charged by banks to 8 or 8 1/4 percent from 8 1/2 percent. **********\"It's pretty clear that the economy has stabilized and is scraping along at a low level of activity,\" said Marshall B. Front, an executive vice president at Stein, Roe & Farnham, a Chicago-based investment management firm. \"I expect the Fed will ease one more time, but that long-term bond yields are at or near their lows for this cycle,\" Mr. Front said.  Gradual Rate Rise Seen **********Although Mr. Front does not expect Treasury bond yields to drop much below 8 percent, he said the rise in rates would be very gradual, and continue to cause many investors to seek longer maturities to earn higher interest rates than are available on money market instruments due in less than one year. **********Treasury notes and bonds were little changed yesterday. The 6 7/8 percent notes due in 1994 were offered at 100 28/32, unchanged, to yield 6.53 percent whle the 8 1/8 percent bonds due in 2021 were offered at 100 3/8, down 1/8 point, to yield 8 percent. **********Good quality corporate bonds are in strong demand from invesotrs like Mr. Front because their higher yields offer more a cushion to absorb the gradual price declines that will result when long-term bond yields turn up. Because the economy is improving, many analysts expect that credit ratings on many large companies that have borrowed recently will be stable. **********The Ford Motor Company offered two issues totaling $700 million yesterday through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. Both were noncallable, meaning the company cannot repay them before maturity, and investors can count on receiving the semiannual interest payments as long as they hold the bonds. **********Ford's $350 million of 9 percent securities due in 2001 were offered at 100, to yield 9 percent, or 1.28 percentage points more than 10-year Treasury notes. The companion issue of 9 1/2 percent securities due in 2011 were offered at 99.918, to yield 9.509 percent, or 1.5 percentage points more than comparable Treasury issues.

The triple-A rated notes were offered with a yield that was 36-hundredths of a percentage point more than seven-year Treasury notes. **********In other financing activity, the General Motors Acceptace Corporation issued $916 million of securities backed by car loans with an estimated average life of about two years at a yield of 6.91 percent through First Boston."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/24/business/all-about-golf-courses-can-builders-rely-on-a-fairway-view-to-sell-homes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1547, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "All About/Golf Courses; Can Builders Rely on a Fairway View to Sell Homes?", "print_headline": "All About/Golf Courses; Can Builders Rely on a Fairway View to Sell Homes?", "body_text": " **********Developers discovered during the 1980's that they could sell whole subdivisions built around golf courses as readily as the new residents could sink one-foot putts. But by now, they have built so many homes on the links that many projects have turned out no better than the slices into the woods. **********There are 13,951 operating golf courses in the United States, with hundreds opening each year as more people take up the sport.  The National Golf Foundation, a developers' trade group based in Jupiter, Fla., reports that 289 new courses opened last year; 561 are under construction and 781 are planned. **********Golf is a $20 billion-a-year industry attracting 25 million people playing at least one round a year.  The golf foundation counts 5.5 million golfers who play more than 25 rounds a year and 6.6 million who play 8 to 24 rounds. **********But turning these encouraging statistics into profitable developments is risky. Some golf course developers fear that they are going through the same cycle as hotel and office developers -- a rush to build followed by a glut and a crash. Scores of golf course developments have faced foreclosure or filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the last two years. Already, more real estate workout specialists are concentrating on golf courses in foreclosure or in the hands of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which holds property from failed savings and loans. **********The 200-Acre Amenity  Luring Buyers In a Slow Market **********Despite the hazards, some developers are profiting by building golf courses as giant amenities in the middle of new planned communities. Expensive homes on golf courses have a huge sales advantage when builders of ordinary subdivisions are being buffeted by weak markets and scarce financing. **********To be sure, a golf course is a more expensive amenity than a marble bathroom. An 18-hole course can use more than 200 acres. To help recoup their costs, developers charge large premiums on the homes. The premiums range from 30 percent to 100 percent over the cost of comparable homes.Homes on the links usually start at about $350,000 and often exceed $1 million. **********\"We are really community developers, and golf is to the community as a face is to a portrait -- it provides that sense of identity, place,\" said Gerald Barton, chairman of the Landmark Land Company, a leading golf course builder. **********Many developers would not think of building a course without homes. In Florida, homes lined 76 percent of courses opened in 1990; in South Carolina, 71 percent. \"On a stand-alone basis, golf is a money loser,\" said J. Steven Manolis, head of Salomon Brothers' real estate investment banking group and an avid golfer himself. \"But when the costs are allocated to each land lot it can be a big money maker.\" **********Easier said than done. Building a good course is very labor- and capital-intensive, requiring specialized designers. New courses usually cost from $1.8 million to more than $12 million, depending on location and features, according to Kent E. Crippin, a golf course development specialist with Grant Thornton, the accounting and consulting firm. Stephen Wynn, chairman of Golden Nugget Inc., built his own course in the Nevada desert more than a year ago at a cost said to exceed $30 million. **********A developer generally goes deep into debt building the course, the clubhouse, the pro shop, the watering system first, then adding the residential areas. The premiums charged to homeowners can return as much as half the cost of building the course, but the rest can only be recouped over time from greens fees, club memberships and pro shop sales. **********The course and the homes must be designed for either mass or class, Mr. Barton said. \"To me golf is like the restaurant business,\" he said. \"You make money at the bottom, like at McDonald's, and you make money at the top, like at Lutece. But you starve in the middle.\" U.S. Is 'Well Golfed'  Another Industry May Go Offshore **********A dearth of financing is the despair of developers who want to build residential courses, but may mend the industry by restraining supply. Despite claims by the National Golf Foundation that there is sufficient demand to add a new golf course every day, many, including some builders, point to a glut. \"The real future in golf is quality golf outside the U.S.,\" said Mr. Barton, whose company has built 3 of the 100 courses worldwide judged to be the best by Golf magazine. \"That doesn't mean that there won't be good business here, but we're pretty well-golfed here already.\" **********Unique properties like Pebble Beach, on California's Monterey Peninsula, which the billionaire Marvin Davis recently sold to a Japanese company for about $780 million, always hold their value. The fee to play there is about $170 per round, for those who can get reservations. But few layouts enjoy such spectacular scenery, design or reputation. **********Developers sometimes find that even if they can sell homes, the course fails to draw enough players to yield a profit. Many who buy houses on courses are drawn to the setting not the sport. **********Banks and private financing sources like the General Electric Credit Corporation and the Westinghouse Credit Corporation are scrutinizing golf developments. Mr. Crippin, who often reviews plans before builders seek financing, says builders are often unreasonably optimistic. He reviewed two plans recently that based income projections on 365 playing days a year -- for sites in Michigan. **********In determining how much revenue a course can generate, lenders look at the proximity of competing courses and the prosperity of the area. Golf is expensive, for players and developers alike. Most new golf courses built in the 1990's will require public financing, Mr. Crippin said. Local governments and private developers have already joined to build a few residential golf developments. Cities hope to put vacant land to good use and attract wealthy residents. Miamisburg, Ohio, formed a joint venture with private builders and financed a development with revenue bonds. **********The Eco-Noose Bearing the Cost Of Preservation **********Where developers see roughs and greens, environmentalists often see only pristine wetlands and wildlife habitats. The most scenic locations for golf courses are often the same natural vistas that conservationists most want to preserve. Golf developers may have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars changing their plans and negotiating with cities and states to win the necessary building permits. **********As environmental regulations become tighter, the added costs of meeting them ultimately mount into the millions. \"Being sensitive to ecological concerns is going to be a big issue,\" said Landmark Land's Mr. Barton. \"It's definitely going to be an added cost.\" **********Developers who have cleared forests for fairways must reckon with run-off problems that can turn brooks into rain-fed rivers. Insecticides may keep the courses in bloom, but they can also poison groundwater. And waterfowl often have legal protections that prevail over those who would destroy the birds' homes. **********Golf course designers are responding with courses that require less maintenance, with plants and lawns that can usually get by on rainwater alone. To minimize expense and environmental damage, they try to mold their layouts to the land. **********THE BOOM IS ABROAD **********WHen membership in a Japanese golf club can cost as much as $2.4 million, and tee times must often be reserved more than a month in advance, Japanese golfers often decide to fly to the United States. When they arrive, they are finding an increasing number of courses owned by investors from home. **********The sport's popularity is growing most rapidly outside the English-speaking countries. Golf Digest Almanac estimates that over the last 15 years, the number of golfers has more than tripled in Continental Europe and more than doubled in Asia. About 30 percent of the gains in Europe have come in Finland, Austria, Sweden, Belgium and Norway. American golf course developers say there are so few top-rated courses outside the United States, Britain and Ireland that they might look abroad for projects. \"The boom is more in Europe and in Asia in part because there isn't much quality in courses outside of English-speaking countries,\" said Gerald Barton of Landmark Land. **********In part because land for courses at home is so scarce, the Japanese have invested more than other countries in American courses. Japanese companies own or have interests in about 160 American golf courses, according to Golf Course News, an industry newspaper. The purchase by Japan's Cosmo World of the famous Pebble Beach course was only the most publicized deal. A few months later, Landmark Land announced the sale of most of its best courses for more than $739 million to a group of investors led by the Daiichi Real Estate Company. The sale includes the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club, PGA West, La Quinta, Mission Hills and the new Kiawah Island course in South Carolina.

Baker 3d said today that except for Syria, the nations of the anti-Iraq coalition were in agreement on the timing and necessity of force to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait after midnight Tuesday. **********Speaking to reporters at the end of his 10-nation tour, which involved talks with Washington's major military allies in the force against Iraq, Mr. Baker indicated that as far as the United States was concerned, both it and its allies were ready to open fire on Iraqi forces in Kuwait anytime after midnight Tuesday, Eastern standard time. **********No further consultations are necessary, save for the precise hour of attack, unless Iraq makes some serious gesture to leave Kuwait before the deadline, American officials indicated. **********\"As we conclude this trip,\" Mr. Baker said after his talks this morning with President Turgut Ozal of Turkey, \"it seems to me that the international coalition is well prepared politically, economically and militarily for any eventuality as we move toward midnight Jan. 15.\"  'No One Has Balked' **********\"No one has balked,\" a senior Administration official said of Mr. Baker's visit to Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Switzerland and Syria and to the exiled Kuwaiti leadership in Taif, Saudi Arabia. **********\"France will fight,\" the official said, \"if that is what it comes to.

In my opinion, France and other countries will want to do everything they can in order to try and achieve a political solution before midnight on the 15th of January. But if the balloon goes up, the French will be there.\" **********Although the Soviet Union has apparently decided to use the diversion of the Persian Gulf crisis to crack down on the Baltics, much the way Moscow used the 1956 Suez crisis to invade Hungary, Mr. Baker did not appear to be particularly concerned now that events in the Soviet Union would disrupt the Administration's gulf strategy. **********The senior Administration official traveling aboard Mr. Baker's aircraft said Washington saw no signs that events in the Baltics were either diminishing the Soviet commitment to see Iraqi troops out of Kuwait or were leading President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to conclude that he could now more easily defy the international coalition.  Incentive for Gorbachev **********If anything, the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, now has more incentive than ever to toe the American line in the gulf, in hopes that this might reduce the negative impact and publicity that his Baltic crackdown is generating with the American public and American decision-makers. **********At the same time, though, the Bush Administration is clearly going to calibrate its response to the crackdown in Lithuania to make sure that Washington does not alienate Moscow to the point where it diminishes its support for America's gulf policy. **********Still, juggling two full-blown crises at once is clearly taxing senior Administration policy makers. Mr. Baker telephoned the President three different times from three different countries on Saturday and at least twice on Sunday as he traveled from Turkey to London. **********The senior Administration official said that of the 28 nations with \"ground forces\" in Saudi Arabia, only Syria's 15,000-man force is not certain to take part in any offensive action to dislodge Iraqi troops from Kuwait and Syria would prefer instead to confine its role to simply defending Saudi Arabia.  Defending Palestinian Cause **********President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, American officials said, has become concerned about how Mr. Hussein has successfully depicted himself as the leading defender of the Palestinian cause, a role that Mr. Assad believes rightly belongs to him, and is therefore leery about siding with Western powers in an offensive against Iraq. **********The Syrian leader feels that going beyond using his troops to defend Saudi Arabia could undermine his Arab nationalist credentials, although he is still considering Arab requests for a more offensive role. **********The official said that while France, like others, was doing all that it could to find a political solution -- even dangling an international conference before Mr. Hussein as a face-saving cover for him to withdraw from Kuwait -- President Francois Mitterrand has assured Mr. Bush that his forces will be engaged if and when the fighting has to begin after Jan. 15. **********The official said some countries that have sent only small naval or air units to the gulf and no ground forces were not certain to take part in any fighting because their units were originally sent either to defend Saudi Arabia or to help impose the United Nations naval embargo on Iraq and their legislatures have not taken action yet to reassign them for offensive purposes.  Major Deployments by 4 Nations **********Nevertheless, these small naval and air units, from countries like Greece, have virtually no military significance, since in the event of a war the vast majority of air and naval power will be deployed by the United States, France, Saudi Arabia and Britain. **********The key points from the perspective of American officials is that all the countries that have committed ground forces have signaled their willingness to use them. **********The Administration official would not comment on limitations that President Ozal has imposed on the use of Turkish bases in a war to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, limitations that Mr. Ozal reiterated to Mr. Baker in their talks today. **********The Turkish public remains highly ambivalent about the gulf crisis and their Government's involvement. **********These reservations are based in part on a neutralist tradition in the Turkish Army, but even more on a concern by Turks that if Iraq is devastated by war, a power vacuum would be created that would generate chaos on their eastern frontier, which has been unstable for years because of the presence of millions of Kurds seeking independence."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/25/world/congo-political-conference-gives-africa-a-democratic-model.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 745, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Congo Political Conference Gives Africa a Democratic Model", "print_headline": "Congo Political Conference Gives Africa a Democratic Model", "body_text": " **********It seemed somehow appropriate that when a national conference on the political future of this Central African country ended recently, all 1,500 delegates solemnly took turns dipping their hands in the reflecting pool outside the Congolese national assembly hall. **********The ceremony was meant to symbolize the washing away of the bile that often marred deliberations at the three-month conference. It was also an act of reconciliation, and a way of affirming the momentous changes that had taken place in what political leaders are calling Congo's democratic coup. **********In the process, the conference forced the 12-year-old Government of Gen. Denis Sassou-Nguesso to name a new Prime Minister, dismiss a Cabinet, rewrite the Constitution and schedule the nation's first free elections for the second half of 1992. **********The conference also adopted a new national anthem, changed the colors of the flag and removed the word \"people's\" from the country's formal name, the People's Republic of Congo.  Change in Past Practices **********And although General Sassou-Nguesso remains President, the perquisites of the office are greatly diminished. He is forbidden even to travel outside the country without first getting approval from leaders of the transitional Government. **********By African standards, the conference was probably the most sweeping repudiation of past practices since the early days of independence three decades ago. **********Before the conference, Congo was among Africa's most determinedly Marxist-Leninist countries and a close ally of Cuba, the Soviet Union and what used to be East Germany. Today, as a result of policies adopted at the conference, the country could soon become free and democratic. **********\"The remarkable thing is that the revolution occurred without a single shot being fired,\" a Western business executive said. \"And if it can happen here, it can happen anywhere.\" **********Indeed, President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo announced recently that he would hold a national conference similar to Congo's. Could Be Used as a Model **********Elsewhere, opposition leaders in more than a dozen other African countries -- including Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Zaire -- have said they hoped to use the Congo conference as a model for democratic change. **********\"The Congo was a very, very important example for us,\" said Buana Kabwe, chairman of the Zaire League of Human Rights. \"And if the same thing doesn't happen here, then Mobutu could be in trouble,\" he predicted. **********The events leading to the conference began last fall after an eruption of mass demonstrations and strikes. That led to a showdown between the Government and leading trade unions, with General Sassou-Nguesso demanding an end to the turmoil. The unions, in turn, called a general strike that all but shut down the country and that, diplomats say, showed that the Government had totally lost control. **********The turning point, though, came when General Sassou-Nguesso agreed to the national conference to chart Congo's political future, a concept that had been tried only once before on the continent, in Benin. There, in January 1989, conference officials stripped then-President Mathieu Kerekou of most of his powers, replacing him with a new Prime Minister and a transitional Government.  Echoes of the Past **********From the beginning, the conference here appeared headed in the same direction as opposition leaders used the forum as an indictment of the Sassou-Nguesso Government. At one point, in fact, the President and his predecessor, Gen. Yhombi Opango, were accused by several delegates of being responsible for the death of Congo's first President, Marien Ngouabi, in 1977. **********Another opposition leader, Albert Roger Massema of the Cause movement, asserted that the Government knew in advance about the bomb that killed 171 people on a flight of the French airline U.T.A. from Brazzaville, the Congolese capital, to Paris in September 1989. The plane exploded over Niger, after making a stopover in Ndjamena, Chad. **********Several conference delegates also called for the foreign bank accounts of all senior officials to be frozen and their assets returned to the country. Indeed, as allegations of official misconduct increased, an order was issued from the conference forbidding all high-ranking officials from going abroad. **********To those who watched the deliberations here, it was also a reminder that people can eventually find a way to resolve their differences in a way that takes traditional African values into account. It was often remarked here that the conference was like a village meeting where elders reach agreement through a long process of debate and consensus. **********\"Without any question, it's a uniquely African process for resolving problems,\" said James Phillips, the United States Ambassador here. \"This is how they do it in the villages.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/12/world/yeltsin-now-says-gorbachev-is-ally.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 598, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "YELTSIN NOW SAYS GORBACHEV IS ALLY", "print_headline": "YELTSIN NOW SAYS GORBACHEV IS ALLY", "body_text": " **********After months of criticizing President Mikhail S.

Fear of Crumbling Union **********Mr. Yeltsin acknowledged that his relationship with Mr. Gorbachev had indeed been quite strained, but he said that such a \"personal question\" should not be allowed to \"overshadow the fact that we are the leaders of two state structures: Russia and the Union,\" and that \"unless we combine our efforts, the Union may just fall to pieces.\" **********Tense personal relations between the two leaders at times have clearly added fuel to the country's political conflagrations in recent years. Mr. Yeltsin was fired from the Communist Party Politburo in 1987 when he broke with party precendent and criticized Mr. Gorbachev, Yegor K. Ligachev and other leaders for moving too slowly to enact the perestroika program. **********Mr. Yeltsin, who won seats in the union and Russian republic parliaments by wide margains, has standing in popular opinion polls now several times higher than Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Yeltsin quit the Communist Party last July. Until their latest reconciliation, many people here believed that the country would continue to flounder unless the two leading politicians found a common language.  Breakthrough at Plenary Session **********The breakthrough moment came last month, on the eve of a Communist Party plenary session. Expecting strong criticism from his party colleagues, Mr. Gorbachev compromised with the nine republican leaders promising them greater powers, including the right to control their own exports and properties. The leaders of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldavia, Armenia and Georgia refused to sign the declaration. **********In exchange for Mr, Gorbachev's compromise, Mr. Yeltsin, a populist who has great authority with the country's millions of disgruntled workers, was able to settle a strike among Soviet coal miners that had threatened the already disintegrating economy with further collapse. On May Day, Mr. Yeltsin met with miners in Siberia and announced a plan that will transfer control of the Russian mines to the republic authorities, who have, in turn, promised to allow the miners to privatize their coalfields if they wish. **********Mr. Yeltsin, who is also the nominal head of the country's pro-democracy, opposition groups, has drawn fire from some of his colleagues who believe he reversed field too quickly with Mr. Gorbachev. **********Some leaders of the Democratic Russian opposition movement, including Yuri N. Afanasyev, the historian, said that while they will support Mr. Yeltsin in June's popular election for the Russian presidency, they are wary of any deals with the Soviet leadership. **********\"We must finally admit that Gorbachev's day is over,\" Mr. Afanasyev said at a recent meeting of Democratic Russia. \"There should be no nostalgia.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/03/business/canada-economic-index.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 29, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canada Economic Index", "print_headline": "Canada Economic Index", "body_text": " **********Canada's leading economic indicator fell 1 percent in January after a revised seven-tenths of 1 percent drop in December, the Government statistics office said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/10/business/company-news-ford-layoff-hint.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford Layoff Hint", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Ford Layoff Hint", "body_text": " **********The possibility of further layoffs in the Ford Motor Company's salaried work force cannot be ruled out, the auto maker's chairman said. \"I would like to think that we will experience the additional reductions in employment as a result of normal retirements or attrition,\" Harold A.

They closed on Friday at $11, up 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Are these early warnings of an approaching catastrophe for Convex, or just the rough edges of a temporary setback before orders and sales revive in 1992? Probably the latter, analysts say, but Convex has some harsh realities to wrestle with. **********The first is that it will be dueling more frequently with Cray at the lower-price end of supercomputing. And sooner or later, Convex must contend with inroads from a growing crowd of companies like Sun Microsystems Inc. that make ever-more-powerful computer work stations used primarily for engineering and scientific computing. **********Buyers of engineering work stations now can knit together several machines, each priced at $10,000 or less, into systems whose performance can compete on some tasks with Convex's older models, which are priced near $300,000. **********Convex built a solid reputation in the last six years by dominating smaller rivals like Alliant Computer Systems and Floating Point Systems, as well as by outwitting the Digital Equipment Corporation with faster designs and more flexible software for minisupercomputers. Typical users of those machines were military and university researchers, corporate scientists and engineers, but many of their budgets were crimped this year by recession and declining Pentagon spending. **********\"It's a very unforgiving market out there right now,\" said Gary Smaby, president of the Smaby Group, a research firm in Minneapolis that specializes in supercomputers **********Still, Convex, which is based in Richardson, Tex., near here, is considered a company with \"a very strong management team and will be a long-term, viable player,\" said Jeffry Canin, an analyst at Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco who covers the market for scientific and engineering computing. **********\"But now Convex has to go into the big leagues against Ditigal, I.B.M. and, more ominously, Cray,\" he said. He estimates that Convex will lose $8.3 million in 1991; until late September, he had figured it would break even. He and Richard Edwards, an analyst at Robertson, Stephens & Company in San Francisco, both said the company should earn 50 cents a share next year. **********Cray Research, based in Minneapolis, has for years assembled the industry's fastest and most expensive machines, priced as high as $30 million. But Cray has been slower than Convex in marketing and may be bloodied before it learns to deal in a more freewheeling market for computer sales. **********Analysts expect both companies to generate sales growth approaching 10 percent next year, but they are counting on a revival in capital spending. **********\"This whole industry has become a highly speculative\" recommendation based on levels of capital spending in 1992 and 1993, said Joseph Payne, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons. \"We're putting Convex in the hottest category, but more because of the quality of their systems software than the new products themselves. People now are more concerned about systems software features than raw computing performance.\" **********Convex seems to have laid the groundwork for a solid recovery next year, analysts said. Its financial health is good, with little debt and more than $90 million in cash, and technical problems with gallium arsenide circuits in its new C3800 and C3400 supercomputers appear to have been solved. **********The company's chief executive, Robert J. Paluck, and its chief technical officer, Steven J. Wallach, gambled that research with gallium arsenide circuits had advanced to the point where the speedy computer chips could be mass produced at high quality. **********They calculated that the chips would prove faster and generate less heat than conventional silicon chips. So to obtain more speed and power, Mr. Wallach designed as many as eight processors with gallium arsenide circuits into the new C3800 model, compared with a maximum of four in previous models. **********It was problems earlier this year at the Texas Instruments Corporation and Vitesse Semiconductor, makers of the chips used in the C3400 and C3800 models, respectively, that forced Convex to delay shipments. **********But output of the chips and new Convex models should pick up before the year ends, said George E. Lindamood, director of high-performance computing at the Gartner Group, a research firm in Stamford, Conn. \"They have taken the handcuffs off their salesman, saying it's safe now to go out and sell these things,\" he said. **********Convex installed two C3800 computers, at more than $2 million each, on schedule late last month. The company also outdueled Cray two weeks ago in winning a $14 million order from the Air Force for four new C3800 machines. **********Cray is expected to throw a counterpunch before the end of the month, though, with \"subcompact\" supercomputers priced below $500,000. Convex customers have withheld orders that might already have been booked until they get a look at the Cray model, some analysts said. **********Cray Research once vowed never to use its resources to build a computer priced below $5 million, but the company had to change course as Convex began stealing orders in the low-price range of supercomputing in the last few years. Cray agreed to pay $3.25 million last week to acquire some assets of a defeated Convex rival, Floating Point Systems, which is now known as FPS Computing. FPS entered bankruptcy reorganization proceedings last week. **********\"These guys are going to see each other quite a lot in the days and months ahead,\" Mr. Lindamood said of Convex and Cray. \"There is going to be a lot of blood on the floor on the issue of price and performance.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/16/business/company-news-reynolds-net-drops-65-on-slack-demand.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1991-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 368, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reynolds Net Drops 65% on Slack Demand", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Reynolds Net Drops 65% on Slack Demand", "body_text": " **********The Reynolds Metals Company, citing lower prices for fabricated products, said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings plunged 65 percent.

C. Olivetti & Company, the Italian computer company, of wrongdoing.

The Vatican Bank had issued guarantee letters for the loans. **********Mr. de Benedetti was notified in 1987 that he was being investigated for possible extortion in connection with the sale of his 2 percent share of Banco Ambrosiano shortly before its collapse. The prosecutor had contended that Mr. de Benedetti had received favorable financial terms for the sale after threatening to disclose how the bank was administrated. **********When he was cleared in 1989, Mr. de Benedetti said he had \"always acted in the full respect of the law\" and carried out his duties as administrator \"with transparency.\" When he was questioned last year by the appeals court, he said he informed it of \"the total honesty of my behavior.\" **********The financier was named Banco Ambrosiano's vice president in November 1981, when he became a shareholder, but sold the shares two months later. **********The appeals court, in indicting Mr. de Benedetti today, rejected the prosecutor's contention that extortion was involved in the sale of the shares and indicted him instead on the bankruptcy charge. **********Mr. de Benedetti resigned his position after selling his stake.

Barrett has had a gruelling two-year tenure as chairman of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Since he took over, Goodyear, once known by its rivals as The Gorilla because of its dominance of the world tire business, has lost the lead to France's Groupe Michelin. And the tire business has taken a turn for the worst. **********None of the top companies -- not Michelin, Goodyear or Japan's Bridgestone Corporation -- is faring well. And the uncertainty over oil prices, the unending price cutting and chronic overcapacity among tire producers, plus anemic auto sales, are likely to keep the industry in a tailspin. **********There are simply too many tires chasing too few buyers. Despite consolidation of the industry into the hands of a few global companies over the last decade and the idling of dozens of plants, producers have been unable to raise prices as industry costs have increased, leaving them little choice but to cut their own costs to make money. **********And here, no company has been any more aggressive than Goodyear. As the only publicly traded tire company among the top five, which also includes Germany's Continental and Italy's Pirelli, Goodyear is under greater pressure from investors than its rivals to post quarterly improvements. **********Mr. Barrett and his top managers decided last summer to slash the company's capital spending and flatten the layers of management in its North American operation. Over the next two years, Goodyear expects to lay off about 3,000 employees, nearly 3 percent of its work force worldwide -- the largest layoff in its history. **********\"We have taken some actions that have been difficult, but they will help this company compete,\" said Mr. Barrett, a plain-spoken man from Topeka, Kan., who has been with Goodyear for 37 years, principally in manufacturing. \"These are difficult times for us. And I get a little impatient that we're not moving as fast as we should in some areas.\" **********With up-to-date plants that are as efficient as any in the industry, Goodyear may now be poised for an improvement. Indeed, since the company announced the restructuring, its stock price has climbed. It is trading at around $20, up from $14 in November. Still, that's well down from the $50-plus range of 1989 and last week, the Standard & Poor's Corporation said it was considering downgrading some of the company's ratings. **********\"A lot of what they're doing is positive, but it's not payting off yet,\" said Dennis Byrne, a professor of economics at the University of Akron and a tire industry consultant. **********Harry W. Millis, an independent tire analyst in Cleveland, said \"Oil prices will probably be lower than people expected and Goodyear has done a lot of cost cutting that will show up in the next year,\" He expects the company to earn $120 million this year. That would be well below its performance in 1989, when it netted $206.8 million on sales of $10.8 billion, but better than 1990. The company has yet to report results for all of last year, but analysts project a net loss of at least $30 million on sales of more than $11 billion. **********Tire makers are being tarred in part because they are captives of the auto market. The slump in auto sales has already caused auto makers to slash the price they're willing to pay for new tires by about 20 percent. At the same time, competition in the replacement market, which accounts for about two-thirds of the industry's roughly $47.5 billion in worldwide sales, is forcing companies to cut prices so deeply that profits are thinner than they have been in decades. **********\"The industry just doesn't seem to make any sense,\" said Professor Byrne. \"It seems as though the major goal among the tire companies is to get market share and they will do anything to sell more tires than the next guy.\" **********Earnings might have been healthier if companies had been shouldering less debt. Each of the top five has taken on a mountain of debt in the last five years either to make an acquisition or, in the case of Goodyear, to fend one off. For instance, Michelin, which recently said that it would report a $400 million loss for 1990, assumed $800 million in debt in its purchase last year of the Uniroyal Goodyear Tire Company. The acquisition vaulted it into the market-share lead, but brought its debt to $6 billion. **********Goodyear is the only top-tier tire maker not to have merged in the last decade. Still, it has yet to recover from a 1986 takeover attempt by Sir James Goldsmith, the British investor. To fight off the pursuit, Goodyear sold its highly profitable aerospace division to the Loral Corporation for $650 million and took on $3.8 billion in debt, largely to finance a $2 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's ratio of debt to equity soared to more than 70 percent, from 30 percent, and has since fallen back only to the 60 percent range. **********And Goodyear has suffered other headaches that rivals have not. A big one: The unprofitable 1,750-mile crude oil pipeline between California and Texas that it bought in 1985 as a way to diversify. Although the pipeline is designed to carry more than 400,000 barrels of oil a day, it is handling only about 100,000 barrels. **********\"The revenues are probably not running more than 10 percent of what they had anticipated,\" said Mr. Millis. \"What should have been a $100 million-a-year positive is a $110 million to $120 million drag on earnings.\" **********War in the Persian Gulf, should it push oil prices up, might yet make the pipeline pay.  \"The question is how good a project it turns out in the long run,\" Mr. Barrett said. \"It has the possibility of doing what we projected.\" On the other hand, he added, \"I'm not saying it's a great investment.\" And an oil-price rise would hit its basic business hard (box, lower right). **********Mr. Barrett is putting more faith in the measures he has taken to retread Goodyear's tire operation. Under his management, the company has established 28 regional offices that report directly to headquarters here. Previously, 43 district offices reported to five regional divisions, which in turn reported to headquarters. In addition to realigning the company's divisions, Goodyear slashed its capital spending budget by about $125 million, to about $575 million last year. And it expects to cut the capital budget further, to $450 million this year. **********But the retrenchment has zapped morale of Goodyear's 109,000 workers. Said one senior-level executive, who asked to remain anonymous: \"People see the layoffs coming, which have never been part of the Goodyear tradition, and wonder when it's going to end. Employees are feeling a sense of fear of the future that is unusual around here.\" **********When will Goodyear be able to raise prices and lift profits? \"I don't see anything in the short term that's going to change and improve conditions in the industry,\" said John J. Nevin, now retired, who was chairman of Firestone until it was acquired by Bridgestone four years ago. \"You've got a recognition on the part of tire makers that, to survive, they have to maintain strong positions around the world.\" **********Professor Byrne contends that 15 to 20 percent of the worldwide tiremaking capacity needs to be shut down before supply and demand come into line. Michelin announced in December that it would close some old Uniroyal-Goodrich capacity. And Goodyear said it is considering some shutdowns of plants. Overall, though, tire makers have been slow to mothball plants. **********Some industry executives hope that further consolidation will improve conditions. Fifth-place Pirelli S.p.A., which purchased the Armstrong Tire Company of New Haven, Conn., in 1988 but is still considered a regional southern European player, last year proposed a merger with fourth-place Continental A.G. of Germany. That would create an $8.4 billion company with about 14.5 percent of the world market. Continental said in January it had no interest in such a move. But Pirelli, which claims it can muster more than half the voting shares of Continental, said it will take the issue before shareholders next month. **********Mr. Barrett, meanwhile, seems only mildly daunted by the prospect of resuscitating the old gorilla. \"I think you're going to see some improvements for the industry,\" the Goodyear chairman said. \"I feel that Goodyear is a position to maybe improve at a better rate than the rest of them.\"  OIL PRICES ANOTHER PROBLEM **********One wild card in any recovery scenario for the tire industry is oil prices. Higher oil prices after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait put a dent in tire markers' margins. Tom Barrett, Goodyear's chairman, said their costs have increased at least 3 percent since August because of the oil price increases. **********That, some analysts say, could mean the difference between making or losing money. The average passenger tire takes about seven gallons of oil or derivative products to produce. **********\"Under those circumstances you get killed on the cost-price relationship,\" said Harry W. Millis, an independent analyst in Cleveland. \"You can only squeeze out a little black ink, if you're lucky.\" **********Dealers have been resistant to increases in the price of tires, balking at the latest attempt by tire makers to raise prices last fall.  Even when they do stick, price hikes are not always helpful. When Goodyear raised prices in the fall of 1988 by about 15 percent, dealers rebelled: Its share in the United States replacement market dropped to about 26 percent, from about 30 percent. Only after lowering prices to match the competition did market share climb back to nearly 30 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/27/business/market-place-a-lull-for-mutual-funds-is-brief.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1991-11-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 791, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; A Lull for Mutual Funds Is Brief", "print_headline": "Market Place; A Lull for Mutual Funds Is Brief", "body_text": " **********The sharp fall in stock prices in mid-November caused only a mild tremor among mutual fund investors, fund managers said yesterday. Although some funds saw a brief outflow of money after the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 120 points on Friday, Nov. 15, the cash resumed pouring in soon after. **********\"When we had the down blip, sales slowed,\" said Robert Leo, director of mutual funds for Shearson Lehman Brothers, referring to the drop in stocks. \"But redemptions were a non-event. People almost take these 100-point days in stride now.\" **********The Janus Group saw more than twice as many buy orders for stock funds on Monday, Nov. 18, as on any day in the fund group's history, said Jack Thompson, an executive vice president. \"We continue to see steady purchasing of equity funds. Our hope is that they have become long-term investors.\"  A Good October **********Over all, many fund groups said the flow of money into stock funds this month was lower than in October, but was still good. Figures released yesterday by the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, showed that $4.8 billion flowed into stock funds last month, the most for any month since April 1987. **********\"The momentum in equity funds has slowed this month, but has remained relatively positive,\" said Steve Norwitz, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price Associates. He said sales slacked late in the month, but that there was no increase in redemptions. **********November has also been a good month for bond funds, managers said, with investors especially interested in funds that invest in bonds that mature in five to 10 years. Such bonds still produce relatively high yields, despite the fall in interest rates. **********This year has been a banner one for mutual fund companies in general, with cash pouring into both stock and bond funds as investors react to rising stock prices and falling interest rates. Substantial amounts of money have been moved out of bank certificates of deposit and out of money market mutual funds. **********In October, bond funds took in a net $9.6 billion, the most in any month since March 1987, just before bond prices fell, and more than the $9.3 billion cash inflow in all of 1990. Through the first 10 months, $56.7 billion has flowed in, more than in any full year since 1986, when $108.6 billion came in as interest rates plunged. **********For stock funds, the picture is even more graphic. Through October, those funds have taken in a net $27.5 billion, more than in any previous full year. The old record was set in 1986, when $21.9 billion poured in. That pace picked up in 1987, with $29 billion coming in during the first nine months. But $10 billion flowed out in the final quarter of that year, as investors reacted to the October stock market crash. **********Since then, many investors have come to believe that falling prices provide a buying opportunity, not a reason to panic, although prices have generally continued slipping since the sharp drop in mid-November. **********Mutual fund investors were buying more shares this fall despite a general decline in consumer sentiment. In a survey by the University of Michigan for Fidelity Investments, the level of consumer sentiment about the future of the economy fell for the fourth straight month in November, Michael Hines, a Fidelity spokesman, said. **********But that same survey found that many more investors intended to buy stock funds in the next quarter than had planned to do so last summer, when sentiment was much higher. **********That apparent contradiction may be explainable by an investor perception that with good returns no longer available on short-term investments, more risk must be taken. That has caused many to move into stocks, which have performed well this year. **********The professionals who manage stock funds were a bit less optimistic than their investors in October, putting only a part of the flood of new money to work. As a result, the percentage of stock fund assets that was in cash in October rose to 8.7 percent, from 8.2 percent in September and a low of 8 percent in August. In October 1990, when stock prices were bottoming, 12.9 percent of stock fund assets was in cash. **********But optimism among managers of junk bond funds appears to be running at a high level. At the end of January, those managers had 12.4 percent of their assests in cash. But junk bonds have performed well this year, and the cash portion in junk portfolios has been at 5.5 percent for the last two months, the lowest since September 1987. **********In October, $317 million came into junk funds, bringing the total for 1991 to $2 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/11/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-baker-and-saudi-king-talk-about-timing-of-an-assault.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1991-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 886, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Baker and Saudi King Talk About Timing of an Assault", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF; Baker and Saudi King Talk About Timing of an Assault", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State James A.

The Saudis and Americans have an understanding that no war will be launched from Saudi territory without the prior agreement of King Fahd and President Bush. **********As Mr. Baker flew to Saudi Arabia from Geneva, after his fruitless talks with Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, a senior official aboard his jet said the Secretary of State wanted to get King Fahd's \"views and ideas\" on when to move militarily against Iraq after Jan. 15, in order to communicate those views to Mr. Bush. **********A senior Administration official said Mr. Baker told King Fahd that the United States was expecting Saudi Arabia to continue its financing of American troops in Saudi Arabia during 1991, and that since the number of American forces had grown considerably in recent weeks, the assistance would have to be greater than the $5 billion committed by the Saudis for 1990. Saudi Troop Money for '91 **********A senior Saudi official said King Fahd told Mr. Baker that his country had a commitment to \"responsibility sharing\" and would support American troops in Saudi Arabia during 1991 just as it did last year. In 1990, the Saudi Government paid virtually all of the \"in country\" costs of the American military, including fuel, food, water, transportation and communications bills. **********Mr. Baker scheduled a meeting for early Friday with the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, to discuss precise amounts of money and how they will be paid out in the coming year, American officials said. **********After that meeting, Mr. Baker is scheduled to go to Abu Dhabi to meet with leaders of the United Arab Emirates, then to Taif, Saudi Arabia, where he will see the exiled Kuwaiti leadership before ending the day in Egypt. On Saturday, he will get the views of the Syrian leadership and Sunday he meets with the Turks, British and Canadians before returning to Washington. **********After Mr. Baker and King Fahd held their larger meeting with full delegations, Mr. Baker asked to speak to the King privately. They went to a small room in the King's Riyadh palace, where at one point Mr. Baker asked Lieut. Gen. Howard Graves, representing the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to join him and the King. U.N. Chief's Baghdad Effort **********While no details of their talks were made available, officials indicated that it was at that private session that the timing of a possible war after Jan. 15 was discussed. **********Administration officials said Mr. Baker also read to King Fahd the letter that Mr. Bush had tried to send Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, through Foreign Minister Aziz. Mr. Aziz refused to accept the letter, which has not been made public. **********Before leaving Geneva today, Mr. Baker emphasized to the Iraqi leadership that they still have five days to withdraw from Kuwait unharmed. **********\"I am very pleased,\" Mr. Baker said, \"that the Secretary General of the United Nations is going to Baghdad to make an effort on behalf of the international coalition to find a peaceful, political solution to this crisis. I continue to believe that peace is possible. We certainly continue to strongly prefer a peaceful and political solution. I believe that the path to peace is open. The choice is that of the Government of Iraq, and I hope that they will choose the path to peace.\" Impression on Aziz **********Administration officials said the visit by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to Baghdad on Saturday was an important 11th-hour mission after Mr. Baker's failed talks with Mr. Aziz. American officials said the important thing now about the Aziz-Baker talks was not what Mr. Aziz brought to Geneva -- which was nothing -- but what assessment he will give to President Hussein about America's intentions and resolve. **********If Mr. Baker succeeded in impressing on the Iraqi diplomat Washington's willingness and ability to attack after the Jan. 15 deadline, and if that impression has any effect on Iraq's willingness to compromise on Kuwait, American officials say it should become apparent in the meeting between Mr. Hussein and the Secretary General. **********\"If Iraq is going to comply with the U.N. resolutions, given the history of Saddam Hussein, they will do so only at the last minute,\" the senior American official said. **********The official hinted that if Iraq is already in the process of moving out of Kuwait, but not fully out by Jan. 15, the United States would probably hold its fire, at least long enough to see if the withdrawal was serious or just a ruse. **********\"Midnight on the 15th is a very important time,\" the official said. \"We will have to see what the situation is at that time, and I can't speculate on that in advance.

German political leaders and economists said the Bundesbank's tight monetary policies, tough anti-inflation stance and political independence would remain, regardless of who succeeded Mr. Pohl. The Bundesbank policies have occasioned differences with Washington and other Western allies, as well as with the Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. **********\"There is no plausible reason to expect the Bundesbank's monetary policy to be any easier because of Mr. Pohl's departure,\" said Norbert Walter, chief economist for Deutsche Bank A.G. in Frankfurt. **********Chancellor Kohl said on Wednesday: \"We will not do anything that will endanger the stability of the German currency. We will not follow a policy of easy money.\" **********Hans Tietmeyer, 59 years old, a member of the bank's seven-man board, is the front-runner by virtue of his extensive international experience and friendship with Mr. Kohl. He is also a Christian Democrat and was state secretary in charge of international monetary affairs at the Finance Ministry from 1982 until late 1989, when he joined the Bundesbank. Mr. Kohl promptly called him back to be his personal adviser on monetary union with East Germany last year.The Second Candidate **********The other leading candidate is Helmut Schlesinger, currently the Bundesbank's vice president, but he is a less likely choice because he is to retire in December 1992. Mr. Schlesinger is the primary architect of the Bundesbank's rigid anti-inflation policy. **********Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d was quoted in November 1987 as saying of the Bundesbank's policy-making: \"It's a little clique headed by Helmut Schlesinger. They are rigid monetarists bent on zero inflation, no matter what.\" **********But some Germans say it is the institution itself that shapes the policy and the person. When Mr. Pohl, a former financial journalist, was appointed head of the Bundesbank by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in 1980, he brought with him a reputation as a Social Democrat who supported expansionary monetary policy. \"Instead, he adopted the Bundesbank's policies,\" Mr. Walter said. **********That pragmatism, combined with a deft public relations touch, an easy-going style and a sense of humor, helped Mr. Pohl promote -- and occasionally defend -- the Bundesbank's views on strictly controlling inflation, if necessary by repeatedly raising interest rates. The bank flourished under his guidance and he was reappointed to a second eight-year term in 1988 by Mr. Kohl, head of the conservative Christian Democratic Union. A Powerful Post **********\"Whoever takes the job steps into leadership of the most powerful central bank and economy in Europe,\" said Jonathan Hoffman, an international economist with Credit Suisse First Boston in London. \"No matter how capable he ma be, no other European central banker can claim that.

Gorbachev returned to Moscow early this morning to reassert control. **********Mr. Gorbachev landed at Vnukovo Airport on his return from his summer retreat in the Crimea, where he had been placed under house arrest early Monday at the start of the short-lived putsch. **********In impromptu remarks to Soviet television that were aired later on a morning news program, Mr. Gorbachev appeared weary but clearly angered by the efforts of the conspirators to get him to surrender power. 'The World Should Know' **********\"The whole world should know about this, what exactly was being plotted,\" he said upon arriving at the airport, \"and what it is that they did not succeed in getting from me.\" **********Mr. Gorbachev described the coup leaders as \"a miserable group\" that had tried to \"break\" him and \" to influence his family\" by surrounding them with troops and isolating them for 72 hours. **********The Soviet President congratulated the Soviet people for having had the \"responsibility and dignity\" to resist the takeover. **********He particularly thanked the President of the Russian federated republic, Boris N. Yeltsin, for standing up to the coup leaders. **********Mr. Gorbachev was expected to meet with the Russian leader later today.  'In Full Control' **********Mr. Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, was also shown on morning television disembarking from the plane at the airport while holding a small child wrapped in a blanket. The Gorbachevs left for their country house in a Moscow suburb. **********The Soviet President had said in a statement reported Wednesday by the evening television news program Vremya that he was \"in full control of the situation\" and that he would resume his full duties within a day. **********The evening program also reported that he had restored contact with the Cabinet and the Defense Ministry -- both under acting chiefs now that their leaders were disgraced -- and to have talked by telephone with Mr. Yeltsin and President Bush. **********Only one of the coup leaders -- the K.G.B. chairman, Vladimir A. Kryuchkov -- was reported under arrest early today. It was the first time a K.G.B. leader had been arrested since Lavrenti P. Beria was detained, tried secretly and shot in 1953 in the power struggle that followed the death of Stalin. **********Reuters reported from Moscow that two other coup leaders, the Defense Minister, Marshal Dmitri T. Yazov, and Nikolai I. Tizyakov, had been detained, according to Sergei Stankevich, a member of the Soviet Parliament and an adviser to Mr. Yeltsin. But this report could not be independently confirmed. There were also unconfirmed reports that the other members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency would be put on trial. **********The coup crumbled Wednesday as abruptly as it began, without any formal announcement from its leaders, who sent tanks into Moscow on Monday and declared themselves in command. **********It seemed simply to fizzle under the disdain of masses rallying to the summons of Mr. Yeltsin, who rose to condemn the coup almost from the moment it became known, and the irresolution of plotters who failed to garner support or even to maintain the loyalty of their forces. Communist Party Denounced **********On Wednesday, Mr. Yeltsin declared that the Communist Party had been \"the organizing and inspiring force\" behind the coup, and the implication was that with its last, desperate rear- guard action the once-formidable force that had controlled the Soviet Union for more than 70 years might finally be exhausted. **********It remains a question whether Mr. Gorbachev, after his ordeal, will bolt the party he heads, as have Mr. Yeltsin and other former Gorbachev aides. **********The awareness that the coup had failed came with the first gray light of dawn, when it became evident that army tanks had not moved against the headquarters of the Russian republic's government in the capital. Focus of Resistance **********Relief spread among the thousands of Muscovites who had spent two drizzly nights at makeshift barricades around the building, called the \"White House,\" a wedding-cake-like building on the banks of the Moscow River, from which Mr. Yeltsin marshaled the anti-coup forces. **********Within hours, reports swept through a jubilant Moscow that the members of the Emergency Committee were in flight, and long columns of tanks and armored personnel carriers began to leave the capital, some decorated with Russian flags, to the cheers of jubilant Muscovites. **********Like the marchers in Leipzig or the demonstrators in Prague who had brought down Communist regimes through the sheer force of their determination, Muscovites, even those who had not directly taken part in public demonstrations, felt a personal satisfaction in facing down forces that had held them so long in thrall. 'Weren't We Great?' **********\"Weren't we great?\" exclaimed one woman, capturing a joyous sense that the nation had united to thwart the long-awaited counter-offensive by the forces of the former Communist dictatorship. \"Leave, just please leave,\" another woman shouted at the tanks. **********According to the spokesman for the Russian republic's government, the Russian vice president, Aleksandr Rutskoi, and its prime minister, Ivan S. Silayev, along with other members of the Russian government, flew to the Crimea Wednesday evening and met with Mr. Gorbachev. While they were there, two members of the Emergency Committee -- the Defense Minister, Marshal Yazov, and the K.G.B. chairman, Mr. Kryuchkov -- flew there with the chairman of the Soviet Parliament, Anatoly I. Lukyanov, and the deputy chief of the Communist Party, Vladimir A. Ivashko. **********The spokesman said that in the course of a long talk between Mr. Gorbachev and the Russian delegation, Mr. Gorbachev was informed about the siege and the attempt to seize the Russian republic's headquarters. Mr. Gorbachev received Mr. Ivashko and Mr. Lukyanov but refused to receive Marshal Yazov and Mr. Kryuchkov. Then Gorbachev, who was in good health, after a rest, flew back with the Russian delegation, thanking members of the Russian government and condemning members of the Emergency Committee. **********Mr. Kryuchkov flew back with Mr. Gorbachev and the Russians, and was arrested at Vnukovo airport by the Russian Interior Ministry. Mr. Ivashko, Mr. Lukyanov and General Yazov were reported to have returned on another plane. **********There was no immediate information on other members of the committee, except for Prime Minister Valentin S. Pavlov, who was in the hospital with hypertension. The independent Interfax news agency quoted Mr. Rutskoi as saying that the other members of the coup leadership would be arrested later, and that they would all be tried. **********Vremya said Mr. Gorbachev expected that the \"adventurists\" would carry \"full responsibility\" for their actions, and the Soviet Prosecutor General's office announced it had opened an investigation of the Emergency Committee on charges of committing a \"state crime.\" It was not known if the investigation would extend to others. Wednesday, Mr. Tizyakov was stripped of his job by his organization because of his role in the coup. **********But even as Moscow waited for Mr. Gorbachev to reappear, it was evident that the balance of power and the course of the Soviet Union's history had shifted, that the Communists who had fought a rearguard action against change had suffered a potentially fatal blow, that Mr. Gorbachev himself was now beholden to the anti-Communist forces that had rescued him, and above all to Mr. Yeltsin. **********Mr. Yeltsin was the indisputable man of the hour, and the advocates of economic and political reform were clearly ascendant. **********It was Mr. Yeltsin's dramatic condemnation of the coup virtually at the same time as the rebellion first became known early Monday morning that roused resistance across the Soviet Union and made his headquarters on the Moscow River into a rallying point of the opposition.  Symbol for Foes of Coup **********The image of Mr. Yeltsin addressing supporters from atop one of the tanks that had come over to his side became the icon of resistance. His statements were published by liberal papers across the Soviet Union and read out at mass rallies from Kamchatka on the Pacific Coast to Leningrad on the Baltic. **********Thousands of Muscovites heeded his call and formed a cordon around White House, sealing approaches with makeshift barricades of buses, trucks and building materials. All across the nation, liberal politicians and supporters of Mr. Yeltsin organized demonstrations and mass meeting. **********He issued decrees declaring the actions of the junta unconstitutional and assuming temporary control over all government and security forces on Russian territory. **********Addressing the Russian Parliament on Wednesday, Mr. Yeltsin declared that it was the defection to his side of several military units that had prevented the junta from interning the Russian government. **********Mr. Yeltsin said that instead of obeying the coup leaders' orders, the Tulskaya Division had protected the Russian parliament from attack. He expressed gratitude to the troops and their commanders for their action. **********The normally fractious Parliament repeatedly rose to unanimously cheer Mr. Yeltsin as he denounced the coup in ringing tones: \"This is an impudent coup, unprecedented in the conditions of a genuinely developing democratic society.\" **********One immediate consequence of the curbing of the far-right forces was the virtual certainty that the union treaty, the radically new federal organization that the Communist had tried to block through their coup, would quickly come into effect. The treaty, negotiated between Mr. Gorbachev and 9 of the 15 republics, would devolve many of the powers of the center to republican governments in a \"Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics.\" **********Flexing his new muscles, Mr. Yeltsin declared that since Mr. Gorbachev had intended to sign the union treaty on Tuesday, he would henceforth consider it in force and was immediately declaring Russian federated republic economically sovereign and master of all its resources. **********The developments also portended an end to efforts to bring the independence-minded Baltic states to heel. Reports from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia said that Soviet forces had begun lifting their siege of radio, television and communications centers, including centers that had been held by Moscow-controlled forces since January. Backing and Filling **********Elsewhere, the collapse of the coup precipitated frenzied efforts by officials, institutions and news organizations, many of which had lain low for two days, to demonstrate their disgust with the plotters in a day-long flurry of news conferences. **********The Defense Ministry, now under Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, the chief of staff, the Cabinet, now under Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir I. Shcherbakov, and the Soviet parliament all issued statements declaring fealty to Mr. Gorbachev. **********Leaders of the Communist Party declared that the coup had been \"inadmissible\" and that from the outset they had demanded a meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, without success. At the same time, a Central Committee secretary, Sergei Kalashnikov, warned journalists against using the term \"junta,\" arguing that leaders of the plot were \"people who made a blunder in the estimation of a difficult situation.\" **********Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh and Mr. Ivashko, the deputy chief of the Communist Party, separately explained their silence over the past two days by saying they were sick. No Change in Foreign Policy **********Mr. Bessmertnykh told a news conference that Soviet foreign policy would remain unchanged. \"It is the same as was formulated by the President of the Soviet Union,\" he told a press conference. **********The tone of official news organs changed radically through the day. Vremya, the main evening news program that had toed the junta's line, now portrayed the collapse of the coup as a great triumph for constitutional order and showed long portions of Mr. Yeltsin's speech to the Russian parliament. The Russian republic's radio and television stations, silenced for two days, returned to the air. **********The Presidium of the Soviet Parliament quickly issued a resolution declaring the removal of Mr. Gorbachev illegal. **********The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Aleksy II, pronounced anathema against the leaders of the coup.  Impact on Liberalization **********Already in the immediate aftermath of the short-lived coup, questions surfaced about its significance for the future of the tumultuous process of perestroika that Mr. Gorbachev had launched six years earlier. **********In his speech to the Russian republic's Parliament, Mr. Yeltsin described the putsch as the last gasp of an order doomed by the union treaty. **********\"Objectively the new union treaty would strip virtually each of the architects of the putsch of their offices, and herein lies the secret of the conspiracy and the main motivation behind the actions of the parties to it,\" he said. \"Their demagoguery about the fate of the homeland is little more than trickery concealing their personal selfish interests.\" **********In the future envisioned by the union treaty, the central Government would lose many of its powers, and it would also be subject to new elections in which Communists would stand little chance of survival.  A Boost for Gorbachev? **********For Mr. Gorbachev, however, the coup also held out hope of a political boost at a time his fortunes were rapidly ebbing. His resistance to the plotters, who had tried unsuccessfully to involve them in the declaration of a state of emergency, restored his credentials and promised at least a brief new public acceptance. The many expressions of allegiance, including Mr. Yeltsin's, also contributed to Mr. Gorbachev's legitimacy. **********In the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, a swirl of celebrations was marred when an unidentified vehicle tried to breech the barricades around the parliament. One of two occupants got out of the truck and shot a Lithuanian security guard to death. **********Security guards wounded and seized one occupant before the truck escaped. Officials said he was a member of the special Interior Ministry troops that have been responsible for most of the previous acts of violence in the republic. **********At the peak of the coup, Estonia defiantly joined Lithuania and Latvia in declaring independence. **********The slain Lithuanian joined three unidentified Muscovites who were killed Tuesday night in a skirmish with Soviet tanks, and an unidentified person who was reportedly killed in Latvia on Monday. The victims were commemorated in several memorial services in Moscow and in other cities Wednesday, and the melee was shown repeatedly on television. **********In a little-noted footnote to the coup, the Moscow military commandant lifted the 11 P.M. to 5 A.M. curfew announced on Tuesday. The curfew had been universally ignored."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/05/world/democrats-wary-on-baker-s-planned-trip-to-china.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Wines", "pub_date": "1991-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 606, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Democrats Wary on Baker's Planned Trip to China", "print_headline": "Democrats Wary on Baker's Planned Trip to China", "body_text": " **********Congressional Democrats today offered muted criticism of Secretary of State James A.

Monthlong Rebel Offensive **********But, parallel to the peace talks, the guerrillas mounted a monthlong offensive that has killed 108 people and has caused millions of dollars in economic damage. **********The guerrillas recently planted 16 sticks of dynamite at an interior heliport where Colombia's President, Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, was scheduled to land. The police found the bomb hours before the President's arrival. **********\"These incidents worsen the climate for dialogue,\" President Gaviria said in an interview here. \"In Colombia today, there is no reason to keep fighting.\" **********Two weeks ago, guerrillas killed two policemen in an unsuccessful attempt to kidnap the Mayor of Cali, Colombia's third-largest city. Oil Exports Decrease **********The guerrillas recently toppled 11 power pylons, cutting electricity to half of this nation of 33 million people. **********Disrupting land traffic, the guerrillas have cut railroads and have damaged or blown up 11 road bridges. And the guerrillas dynamited a multi-million-dollar radar station, depriving Colombia's Caribbean coast of air protection. **********The other day they blew a hole in the airport tarmac of the Caribbean port city of Cartagena.

Compared with the same period last year, oil production dropped 5 percent and the country lost $87 million in oil export revenues. **********As civic protests against the violence are planned in Colombia's major cities, the guerrillas say they are reacting to an invasion of their mountain headquarters in December. **********\"The army offensive against us has been permanent, so as a necessary response, the guerrilla developed its own offensive,\" Alfonso Cano, a commander of the revolutionary armed forces, said in a telephone interview from Caracas. **********But many analysts here say the guerrillas are trying to strengthen their hands in negotiations, which are expected to resume this month.

The other known Liechtenstein unit is Swico Anstalt, or Swico Establishment. **********Long the object of intense conjecture, the secretive units appear to hold a key to the unresolved question of how much money the Maxwell family still has -- and to whether there might be more money for Mr. Maxwell's debtors to recover. **********The foundation is said to have existed for more than 20 years. And in June 1988, Mr. Maxwell told one of his own newspapers, The Daily Mirror, that he had accumulated $:1 billion, or about $1.9 billion at the current exchange rate, in Liechtenstein. He did not elaborate as to how. **********While no actions have been taken against the foundation, the Maxwell creditors are trying to peer over the high walls surrounding the foundation. Even as the creditors move closer, however, lawyers representing the foundation are already stiffening their guard. **********\"Creditors certainly have absolutely no rights on assets held in the Maxwell Foundation,\" warned Werner Keicher, the lawyer responsible for Mr. Maxwell's affairs in Liechtenstein. The terms of the foundation precluded such claims, he argued. **********His remarks appeared to herald a possible conflict with the many officials seeking to recover assets to pay off the more than $4.4 billion of debts left behind by Mr. Maxwell, whose media empire collapsed this month after he died under mysterious circumstances in early November. One of the issues involved may well be whether Mr. Maxwell really controlled the assets, which seems likely, in the eyes of many analysts. **********In any case, the creditors will be examining the possibility of tapping the assets of the foundation. \"As in any insolvency, I have to look for every route by which assets can be realized,\" John Talbot, the Arthur Andersen & Company accountant now in control of the Maxwell private companies, said in a recent interview. He could not be reached for further comment on Mr. Keicher's statement. **********But the very secrecy being used to protect the foundation is seen as a signal that there is something of value there. \"I doubt that Mr. Keicher would be posturing so quickly if the coffers were empty,\" said Peter Phillips, a partner in the Buchler Phillips accounting firm, which is acting as the receivers of Mr. Maxwell's personal estate. \"We intend to find out if his claim is legally correct.\" Stakes in 2 Companies **********According to a report on the Maxwell holdings completed by the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte and submitted to creditor banks on Dec. 3, the foundation and Swico directly hold 14.96 percent of the Maxwell Communication public company and 24.8 percent of the private Robert Maxwell Group, whose properties include The Daily News in New York and a host of newspapers from Nairobi to Budapest. **********On the basis of the 14.96 percent Maxwell Communication Corporation holding, the Liechtenstein units would have received dividends of more than $25 million last year alone. **********But they may have received more. The last Maxwell Communication annual report stated that the \"Maxwell Foundation and its subsidiaries\" held 37.7 percent of the company. It gave no further details. **********Under Liechtenstein's law, the terms of a foundation like Mr. Maxwell's are confidential. The founder, or settlor, asks a local trust company to establish the foundation and then passes assets to it. Once this is done, the foundation becomes an independent legal entity run by its board, which usually consists of three people. Although he may be named as a beneficiary of the foundation, the settlor is no longer the owner of its assets. **********\"The assets belong to the foundation, whose sole organ is the board,\" said the director of a large trust company called Prasidial-Anstalt (which has no relation to the Maxwell entities). \"The settlor no longer has any part of it once the bylaws have been established which set out how the assets and their yields should be employed.\" Wide Range of Benefits **********For Mr. Maxwell, this setup had obvious advantages. For tax purposes, he was not the owner of whatever assets were controlled by his foundation. Moreover, for the purposes of intercompany transactions within his group, which were frequent, he could contend that units controlled by the foundation were not controlled by him. (There is little question, however, that the other Liechtenstein entity, Swico, was directly controlled by Mr. Maxwell.) **********The glossy prospectus of Mr. Keicher's General Trust Company also states, \"In the case of family foundations the founder may determine that creditors may not deprive foundation beneficiaries of acquired foundation benefits by means of injunction, levy of forced execution or bankruptcy proceedings.\" **********The director of Prasidial-Anstalt, who insisted on anonymity, said that in practice, the assets of a foundation should be impregnable to creditors if it was set up on a bona-fide basis at a time when the founder had no reason to expect bankrutpcy. **********\"But if it was done at a moment when the settlor knew he was in danger of losing his money to creditors, the creditors may have a case in court,\" the director said. **********In the case of Mr. Maxwell, the foundation seems to predate his financial worries, though his swashbuckling style led to extreme highs and lows throughout his business career. The 'Liechtenstein Defense' **********Just why Mr. Maxwell chose to operate through Liechtenstein was something the late businessman never cared to discuss. But as a Czechoslovak-born Jewish immigrant, he was sensitive to claims from some British critics that his holdings showed he remained an outsider. Employing what became known as the \"Liechtenstein defense,\" some directors of British companies that Mr. Maxwell had sought to take over successfully used gibes about the mysterious Liechtenstein connection to fend him off. **********There is evidence that in the last year of his life, Mr. Maxwell sought to overcome such criticism, perhaps in anticipation of floating some of Maxwell Communication's businesses in the United States. **********The last Maxwell Communication annual report states that control of the board of a subsidiary of the Liechtenstein-based Maxwell Foundation was passed to one of Mr. Maxwell's British holding companies, Headington Investments. As a result, the report said, Headington became Maxwell Communication's ultimate parent. **********But the holdings of the Liechtenstein entities apparently remained considerable to the last -- as underlined by the Coopers & Lybrand report to banks as well as by Mr. Maxwell's unusual decision to visit the principality this year. It seems that only if investigators can penetrate them will the truth about the Maxwell finances be known. **********To date, the Maxwell interests have been well protected. Because the economy of Liechtenstein relies heavily on its reputation as an impenetrable place for the wealthy to place their assets -- 2,500 of the country's 28,000 people work in trust companies or banks -- circumspection is a national trait. **********Indeed, when Mr. Maxwell made a rare and little-publicized visit here on April 24, the one local newspaper that covered the event did not even mention his Liechtenstein interests in a report that focused on how the \"media Czar\" had been charmed by the principality. Support for Share Price **********That April visit coincided with what Mr. Talbot of Arthur Andersen called a peak moment in Mr. Maxwell's attempts to support the price of shares in his Maxwell Communication public company that had been pledged to banks as collateral. The price-support plan, which is being investigated by Britain's Serious Fraud Office, was run through offshore investment trusts, which funneled more than $236 million into Maxwell Communication."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/24/business/company-news-flour-tax-refund-will-improve-net.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Flour Tax refund Will Improve Net", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Flour Tax refund Will Improve Net", "body_text": " **********The Fluor Corporation said today that it will receive a Federal income tax refund, plus interest, that will add more than $12 million, or 14 cents a share, to second-quarter net income.

Steinberg, the daughter of Saul Steinberg, who is chairman of Reliance Group Holdings, and Jonathan Tisch, president of Loews Hotels. Mr. Tisch is the son of Preston Robert Tisch, president of the Loews Corporation, and the nephew of Laurence A. Tisch, the chief executive of CBS. **********This was no match, it was a merger, the Wall Street wags said. At the couple's engagement party in 1987, a Tisch family member is said to have joked: \"If they get married, it will have to be cleared by the S.E.C.\" **********The Securities and Exchange Commission really does have to clear the latest Steinberg-Tisch family project. Jonathan Steinberg, Saul's son and chairman of a publishing company called Financial Data Systems, is taking his company public. Brother-in-law Jonathan Tisch, a board member, and the elder Mr. Steinberg are helping out. **********Also assisting, although they may not know it yet, are the public shareholders of Reliance Group Holdings, which is 80-percent owned by the Steinberg family. This deal is so speculative it carries the underwriter's warning that \"no person should consider investing in the securities offered hereby who cannot afford to lose his entire investment.\" Yet Reliance's insurance unit is investing $1 million in this risky venture. **********That $1 million investment of Reliance stockholders' money should be put into perspective. It is about half the amount the Steinbergs are estimated to have spent out of their own pockets on the 1988 nuptuals. But it is also one-fourth of the entire net profits of $4.1 million reported by Reliance Group Holdings in the first half of this year. **********Even those meager profits were wiped out in the third quarter. On Thursday, Reliance reported that a $103 million addition to its insurance reserves and a $63 million investment write-down had produced a loss of $161 million for the first nine months of this year. Past profits at the company have been erratic, bouncing from $126 million in 1987 to just $22 million in 1989 and then back to $118 million last year. **********Profits of any sort, erratic or not, have been elusive at Financial Data Systems, the company that young Mr. Steinberg is offering to the public. **********Mr. Steinberg, who is 26 years old, attended the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and worked from 1986 to 1988 as a mergers and acquisition analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company before striking off on his own. He built the base for Financial Data System in October 1988 by purchasing the Penny Stock Journal, a small-stock investment newspaper. He changed the journal's name to Individual Investor -- a nameplate that has provoked some unresolved complaints from the American Association of Individual Investors, a nonprofit group in Chicago. In 1989, he added two specialty investment newsletters to the fold. **********But growth is expensive. While revenues were inching up, Financial Data lost $1.24 million in 1989, $1.19 million in 1990, and $247,852 in the first half of 1991. However, the preliminary prospectus filed with the S.E.C. blames some of the company's past weakness on its inability to spend money promoting its publications. With the $3.78 million from the public offering, Financial Data could boost advertising, increase its circulation, and possibly make some acquisitions. **********Indeed, the proceeds from the proposed offering are essential if the company is to simply keep itself afloat long enough to fulfill Mr. Steinberg's ambitions. He and his father have extended more than $1 million in loans to the company, and have guaranteed the company's borrowings from National Westminster Bank, whose chairman, Thomas J. Stanton Jr., is an outside director of Reliance Group. \"It is unlikely that the company would be able to borrow additional funds\" from the Steinbergs \"or that they would be willing personally to guarantee the company's debt in the future,\" notes the meticulously candid prospectus. **********In fact, financial hardships forced the company to cancel the July issue of Individual Investor. Fortunately, Jonathan Tisch stepped up with an equity investment of $100,000 in August, the prospectus reports, and the company raised another $400,000 in September by selling a private note issue to a small group of investors, including Barbara Steinberg, the young Mr. Steinberg's mother. **********But family ties cannot erase all business considerations, of course. The September note issue will be fully repaid out of the public offering, and Jonathan Steinberg has personally promised to protect Mr. Tisch from any loss on his shares. According to the prospectus, Mr. Tisch can require his brother-in-law to repurchase his Financial Data shares anytime after Aug. 7, 1992, for a price equal to the $100,000 he originally paid plus $20,000 for each year he continues to hold the shares. **********That arrangement does not apply to the shares to be offered to the public or to Reliance. Financial Data plans to sell the public 360,000 units, each priced at $9 and each consisting of three common shares and two warrants to purchase additional shares in the future. Simultaneously, it will sell an additional 111,111 units at the same price to Reliance.

They said the company must still deal with a number of environmental, regulatory and economic issues related to building in an increasingly congested urban area. **********The company built Disneyland in Anaheim 36 years ago, when Orange County, south of Los Angeles, was largely strawberry fields and orange groves. The area is now heavily developed and choked with traffic. **********Today Disney executives seemed to be dangling the prospect of a huge influx of jobs and tax dollars into Southern California's battered economy if state and local governments would cooperate on plans for the $3 billion, 470-acre Anaheim project. **********The project, called the Disneyland Resort, would open at the end of the decade and would include a new theme park known as Westcot Center, as well as hotels, a huge lake and a shopping mall. **********If completed, Disney said, the new project would create nearly 28,000 new jobs, and would generate $55 million a year in additional taxes and fees for the city of Anaheim and Orange County, and $70 million a year in new tax revenue for the state. **********\"We've never built a mega-project like this in an existing urban environment,\" said Peter Rummell, president of Disney Development, the subsidiary in charge of the project. \"The economic feasibility of the project still has to be proven.\" **********Disney is now putting the final touches on Euro Disneyland, outside Paris, and it also operates Disney World in Florida. The company licenses its name to Tokyo Disneyland in Japan. **********The centerpiece of the new project is the Westcot Center, a complex inspired by the highly sucessful Epcot Center at Disney World. it would contain themed pavilions about foreign countries, the human body and other subjects. The project would also include an elaborate system of parking lots and people movers to cope with the traffic it would create. **********Disney has long been interested in a second theme park in Southern California. For the last several years, it has been openly considering both Long Beach and Anaheim. Some analysts said the company had been playing the two cities off against each other to get the best possible deal for itself and to minimize regualatory objections. **********In ruling out Long Beach today, the company said that the time and expense of winning the necessary approvals for that site made the project unfeasible. The Long Beach project would have been built partly on landfill along the city's harbor, and that plan raised questions among state and regional agencies about its effect on the harbor and the Pacific Ocean. Delighted and Excited **********Officials in Anaheim said they were optimistic the project would be built. \"The City of Anaheim is delighted, excited and enthusiastic about the decision to build a second attraction here,\" Anaheim's City Manager, Jim Ruth, told The Associated Press. \"We think we have arrived at a plan that is environmentally and economically sound.\" **********Still, Disney must make a final decision about the Anaheim project at a time when its theme parks are suffering from the economic downturn and a decline in tourism."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/07/business/company-news-little-room-for-error-in-chrysler-s-future.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1991-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1233, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Little Room for Error In Chrysler's Future", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Little Room for Error In Chrysler's Future", "body_text": " **********It has long been the case at the Chrysler Corporation that whenever auto sales turn sour, the margin for error becomes razor thin. **********So when reports emerged recently about serious defects in an automatic transmission that Chrysler has used in some of its most popular models, including its vaunted mini-vans, Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, put on the warning lights. Declaring that the problem could crush the company, he ordered an unusual campaign to cater to disgruntled owners and minimize any damage to the image of the No. 3 auto maker. An Unanswered Question **********Thursday morning, in a board meeting in New York, Chrsyler directors will hear that the worst of the transmission trouble is over. That will surely be welcome news for a company trying to shore up its balance sheet and peddle showrooms full of warmed-over models during a sales slump. But the question of how long Chrysler can last in such a treacherous market will probably not be answered at the meeting. **********Only a year ago, Mr. Iacocca said it would take a \"nuclear war\" for him to recommend a dividend cut; that war appears to be at hand. Financial analysts predict that a cut in the quarterly payout from 30 cents to as little as 5 cents a share is likely to be announced at the meeting because Chrysler is pressed for cash. The General Motors Corporation set a precedent for the Big Three auto makers earlier this year by halving its dividend. **********\"I don't think Chrysler will omit the dividend altogether, since most state and local pension funds aren't allowed to own stocks that don't pay dividends,\" said Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. **********A dividend cut would represent little more than a prudent cost-cutting measure, since it would save the company only $67.5 million a quarter. But, like faulty transmissions, it is one more indication of how vulnerable Chrysler has become in a relatively short period since regaining its health in the mid-1980's. **********One reason that profit has been poor, automobile analysts say, is that Chrysler has not spent enough money on new vehicles in recent years; no new models will be ready until next year's introduction of a new Jeep and a new midsize car, code-named L/H. With few exciting products, expensive rebates have been necessary to support sales. **********Critics of the company say Chrysler wasted time and money in the mid-1980's on non-automotive projects like buying back $2 billion worth of stock and acquiring Gulfstream, an aircraft manufacturer. **********While Chrysler has been grappling with its transmission woes, it has also tried to shore up a weak balance sheet caused by two years of eroding profit margins. Executives are searching for a buyer for an equity stake in the Chrysler Financial Corporation subsidiary and are conferring with a consortium of 38 banks on new financing.   More Modest Credit Line **********Chrysler's bankers, led by the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, are busy redrawing the terms of a new, more modest credit line of about $1.7 billion to replace a $2.6 billion loan agreement. Under the proposed new loan, about $1 billion would be available to Chrysler and about $700 million to Chrysler's financial unit. With a smaller financial cushion, Chrysler will have to hope that the overall market turns quickly and that its new 1992 models are big hits. **********The recent lowering of the quality ratings on the debt of Chrysler and Chrysler Financial to \"junk bond\" status has precluded both units from borrowing in public debt markets. But Chrysler hopes that if it can sell a minority stake in Chrysler Financial to a stronger company, the rating agencies will upgrade Chrysler Financial's securities to investment-grade status, which will permit it to borrow from the public at favorable rates.  Much-Needed Capital **********A sale of an equity stake in the financial unit could also provide Chrysler with several hundred million dollars of capital at a time when it is pressed because of slow sales and heavy outlays for new vehicles. **********Financial analysts say they believe Chrysler has a list of more than a dozen financial-services companies it believes could be potential buyers. **********During the last week, Chrysler dealers have reported that telephone calls by company officials and other measures designed to satisfy customers have quieted consumer worries about the balky transmission, known as the A-604 Ultradrive. It is used in several car and mini-van models powered by Chrysler's 3.3-liter V-6 engine. **********Since Ultradrive first appeared in 1988, Chrysler has replaced 19,000 of the transmissions, many of which shifted permanently into second gear or had trouble shifting in cold weather. The company dealt with complaints case-by-case, rather than with a public recall. **********Late last year, after two years of technical changes, Chrysler declared that design and manufacturing problems with the 1991 Ultradrive were virtually nonexistent. But when Consumer Reports, the product-testing magazine, reviewed a 1991 New Yorker sedan, the transmission problem cropped up again. **********As a result, the magazine dropped its recommendation on Chrysler's new mini-van models on Jan. 24, since many of the vans are equipped with Ultradrives. Since half of Chrysler's 1991 operating profit may come from mini-vans, according to financial analysts, Mr. Iacocca warned dealers and company officials that the problem was a potential wildfire that threatened the company.  Help for Customers **********Frank De Joseph, service manager for Potamkin Chrysler-Plymouth in Miami, said that since late January, he had been flooded with suggestions from Chrysler about how to placate any customers who have transmission problems. **********\"Anything they need, whether it's dropping the $100 deductible or renting them a car, the company's attitude is, 'Just do it,' \" Mr. De Joseph said. In the last month, he said, only one service customer had inquired about Ultradrive. No one has brought an Ultradrive in for repair and few, if any, new-car customers tell the franchise's salespeople they are concerned, he said. **********Chrysler dealers all over the country who had repaired or replaced numerous Ultradrive's on 1989 and 1990 models are saying that the scare about the 1991's is over. Moreover, a Chrysler spokesman said 50,000 phone conversations with owners in recent weeks suggested that few, if any, had experienced transmission problems. Meeting With Testers **********Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's president, visited Consumer Reports engineers in Yonkers this week to deliver results of Chrysler's engineering research into transmission problems and explain why he thinks the current models are improved. Chrysler executives would not say what they had hoped to gain from the private meeting, but a spokesman said he presumed Mr. Lutz would ask Consumer Reports to consider restoring the recommendation on mini-vans. **********Another predicament that directors may have to face this year is executive succession. In the last 18 months, Chrysler has lost several key executives because of retirement and because some, disillusioned over the auto maker's long-term prospects, took other opportunities. Mr. Iacocca's heir apparent, Gerald Greenwald, left last summer to organize an employee buyout of United Airlines, which failed. **********Mr. Iacocca, who is 66 years old, has hinted at retirement and then changed his mind. Mr. Lutz and Robert S. Miller Jr., vice chairman, are likely candidates to succeed him. **********At one point, Mr. Iacocca was working under an employment contract until the end of 1991. But last September, the board changed that to an open-ended agreement and a spokesman said Mr. Iacocca was working on a quarter-to-quarter basis."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/08/business/talking-business-with-kramer-author-insurance-study-comparing-risks-banks-vs.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1991-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 705, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Interview", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Talking Business with Kramer, Author of Insurance Study; Comparing Risks: Banks vs. Insurers", "print_headline": "Talking Business with Kramer, Author of Insurance Study; Comparing Risks: Banks vs. Insurers", "body_text": " **********The rising trend of insurance failures in the 1980's, coupled with the nationwide slump in commercial real estate, has led to increased concerns that insurers might be vulnerable to some of the same problems confronting the banking industry. **********A recent study commissioned by the Insurance Information Institute, \"Rating the Risks, Assessing the Solvency Threat in the Financial Services Industry,\" concluded that the insurance industry's problems were not nearly so severe as those in banking. Orin S. Kramer, a consultant based in New York, discussed the study, which he wrote. **********Q. What are the problems shared by banks and insurance companies? **********A. Over the past two decades, each sector has experienced declining profitability, the loss of attractive customers to alternative markets, rising risk levels and increased insolvencies. Each of the sectors also suffers from excess capacity. But the similarities should not obscure the fact that there are sharp differences among individual institutions and between the sectors. **********Q. Banks are suffering mightily from problems with real estate loans. How much expo sure do insurers have in real estate? **********A. Real estate and mortgages represent only 3 percent of assets for property and casualty insurers and 22 percent for life companies. But at least relative to the banks, there are three factors that mitigate the life insurance real estate exposure. **********First, over the 1980's commercial real estate investment by insurers declined, whereas for banks it was the fastest-growing loan category. Consequently, most insurers have a more seasoned loan portfolio. Second, banks are more heavily involved at the riskier front end of the real estate financing process, making loans for construction and providing financing until long-term lenders are found. Nonperforming commercial real estate as a percentage of assets is more than 60 percent higher for banks than for insurers. **********Q. What are the other major risks for insurance companies? **********A. For the property and casualty sector, the major risks arise out of public policy. For example, there is the risk that the courts will impose significant environmental cleanup liability, the threat of more restrictive rate regulation and the absence of a Federal backup facility to handle a severe earthquake. **********Q. What about the life insurance companies? **********A. Beyond real estate, their higher-risk category of assets is \"junk bonds,\" where there are a couple of companies that have excessive exposures and are now paying the price. But for the sector as a whole, non-investment-grade bonds represent under 4 percent of assets. A substantial share of those bonds are private placements, which have special covenants and tend to be well secured. **********Q. How did you compare the risks of industries as different as banking and insurance? **********A. Except under the most extreme scenarios, whatever solvency threat that may exist is limited to the weakest players. One test we did was to ask how long it would take for the bottom 20 percent of companies in each sector to exhaust their capital, assuming they continued to earn or lose money at the average 1987-89 rate. **********The bottom fifth of the property and casualty industry was profitable every year from 1987 to 1989. But the bottom fifth of the life industry had negative income in two of the three years and would exhaust its net worth in the year 2028 if those results continued. For banks, the losses in 1987-89 of the bottom fifth of the industry were great enough that they would exhaust their capital by the end of 1994. **********Q. Is a solvency crisis likely for any of the three industries you studied? **********A. It is important to distinguish between theoretical possibilities and realistic probabilities. While I can imagine conditions that might produce insolvency for a major insurance company, I think that is extremely improbable over the next several years, and a generalized insurance solvency crisis is even less likely. For the banking industry, there will clearly be enough trouble to require a replenishment of F.D.I.C. resources. **********Q. What should regulators be doing? **********A. If I had to cite a single theme, they should aim to preserve the stability of the financial system, not avoiding failures per se. The long-term health of the financial system requires that it be cleansed of excess capacity, and failures are part of the short-term price to be paid for a healthier system over the long term."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/25/business/top-pay-listed-at-la-gear.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 161, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Top Pay Listed At L.A.

But stocks took off in January when war became a reality, and they have barely looked back. The Dow has now risen more than 15 percent since the war began on Jan. 17 and has regained all the 534 points it lost in the months after the invasion.  A Sense of Optimism **********In addition to optimism on the war's outcome, the surge is a clear sign of confidence that recent moves by the Federal Reserve Board to bring interest rates down will pull the economy out of recession relatively soon and restore consumer confidence. **********The Dow is now less than 100 points away from its record high of 2,999.75, reached on both July 16 and 17, and one of Wall Street's most influential analysts expects further gains. **********\"I still believe we're going to go higher,\" Steven G. Einhorn, co-chairman of the investment policy committee of Goldman, Sachs & Company, said yesterday. But he declined to predict how high the market would go. **********A week ago, Mr. Einhorn became one of the most important voices in the investment community to sound the beginning of a bull market by saying he thought the bear market was over. **********Almost every important market barometer climbed yesterday above the levels they had set before the Iraqi invasion. **********The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, representing the most important stocks, advanced nearly 2.6 percent to a new high for the year and is now less than a point away from the record high it set on July 16. The New York Stock Exchange composite index, covering roughly the same group of companies, rose 2.4 percent to a new 1991 high and is now also less than a point away from its July record. **********Allowing for the possibility of a decline, but still exceptionally enthusiastic about stocks, Mr. Einhorn said, \"If on a short-term basis we may have gotten too far too fast, any correction should be small and there's still time and price left in the bull.\" **********Traders said Wall Street money managers, hoarding a huge pile of cash running into the billions of dollars, met over the weekend or early yesterday morning and decided to commit hundreds of millions of dollars to stocks over the next few days. **********With so much money pouring into the market, short-sellers were forced to rush in to avoid huge losses, and their buying, of course, drove stock prices still higher. Short-sellers borrow stock and hope to profit by replacing it later at a cheaper price, if the market drops. **********Acknowledging that there is skepticism about the advance, Mr. Einhorn said, \"There's no bad news affecting the market, and slowly but surely it's forcing the money managers into the market.\" **********Based on figures compiled by Indata, an investment service in Stamford, Conn., 54 mutual funds it surveys pumped some $165 million into stocks in the week that ended Friday. On the strength of yesterday's strong advance, new money going into stocks now and in coming days should continue strong. **********To the casual investor, yesterday's picture of the rise in the Dow looked like the side of a mountain. At 10 A.M., the Dow was ahead 10 points, by 11 it was up 30 and by noon, 40 points. By 2:30 the market had climbed 55, momentarily fell back and then climbed sharply the rest of the day.  A Surge in Volume **********Trading volume, which had been a strong 187.8 million shares on Friday, soared to 265.4 million, the fifth-highest volume so far this year. **********Birinyi Associates said seven heavy waves of program buying lifted the Dow 28 points. **********To prevent the market from feeding on itself, the New York Stock Exchange intervenes whenever the Dow rises or falls 50 points or more. Officials of the exchange intervened at 2:09 P.M. yesterday, preventing program buyers from buying on an uptick, that is, from buying when the last sale was at a price higher than the previous one. Program buying generally subsides after such intervention. **********And in the credit markets, interest rates kept sliding yesterday, with long-term rates now at their lowest levels in more than a year. **********The New York Stock Exchange said 4.4 stocks advanced for every one that fell, the highest ratio since the war started. **********While not setting records, 162 stocks reached highs for 1991, from I.B.M., Johnson & Johnson and A.I.G., the insurer, to Merrill Lynch, Gillette and International Flavors and Fragrances. **********I.B.M.'s shares, which are recognized leaders of Wall Street thinking, climbed to a new high for the year of 132 1/2, closing at 132 3/8, up 2 7/8. Johnson & Johnson, just one of several drug stocks to score new highs, rose 2 5/8, to 79 7/8, a new 1991 record. A.I.G., one of several insurance stocks to hit new highs, jumped 2 5/8, to a new high of 90. **********Merrill Lynch, the investment house, which is expected to reap big benefits from the market rally, climbed 2 1/2, to 29 1/4, after hitting a new high of 29 1/2. Gillette, the razor-blade maker, hit a new high of 70, before ending at 69 3/4, up 2 3/8. International Flavors, responding to a strong year, jumped 4 3/4, to a new high of 86 1/2. **********Mr. Einhorn of Goldman, Sachs said he was committed to growth stocks, like drugs, tobacco, specialty retail companies, technology, household products, personal-care products and food, and was urging the sale of cyclical stocks, like chemicals, paper and some metals. **********As to whether the upturn in cyclical stocks would last much longer, he said, \"I don't think it will.\" He urged investors to \"use the relative strength of the cyclicals to move away from them and buy growth stocks.\" **********With the market so strong, it was difficult to find a segment that did not move higher. But gold prices slid $3 an ounce, to $367.10, in New York, depressing gold shares. Newmont Gold dropped 1 5/8, to 35 1/2.  Strength in Transportation **********Even though crude oil prices were up 55 cents a barrel, to $22.50, raising the possibility of higher fuel prices, the Dow transportation index nevertheless jumped 2.3 percent, lifted by strong gains for AMR, the parent of American Airlines; Delta Air Lines and Federal Express. **********In an impressive rally, 27 of the 30 Dow industrials moved higher, with Minnesota Mining ahead 3 1/4, to 90 5/8, and Alcoa ahead 3 1/8, to 68 3/8. Gains of two or more points were scored by I.B.M., Merck, Procter & Gamble and Philip Morris. Others climbing at least a point were Woolworth, Westinghouse, Sears, Eastman Kodak, International Paper, Coca-Cola, Exxon, McDonald's, American Express, Du Pont, General Electric, United Technologies, Primerica and Texaco. **********The three Dow stocks to decline were General Motors, which cut its dividend last week, and fell 3/8, to 36 7/8; Boeing off 5/8, to 51 3/8, and Allied-Signal, down 1/8, to 30. **********Reflecting the exceptional rise in bank stocks, the New York Stock Exchange's financial index jumped 3.02 percent.

In dramas and documentaries, the Japanese have watched this week as their fathers and mothers made a futile effort to steer the country away from war, as a small group of military leaders drove a peaceful people to ruin, and as their country rose from its defeat to be as technologically powerful as the nation to whom it eventually surrendered. **********Perhaps the clearest cleavage of interpretations came in the studios of NHK, the giant semiofficial broadcaster, which struggled for months with producers from ABC over a documentary that was aired this week in both countries. Although American and Japanese viewers saw nearly identical film, they heard very different scripts, and they were differences that went beyond the imprecision of translations. 2 Views of Rape of Nanking **********In an 18-second clip about Japan's 1937 capture of Nanking, the then capital of China, ABC reported that \"Japan's claim it was liberating China was ludicrous to Americans, particularly when hundreds of thousands of Chinese men, women and babies were murdered in what was called the Rape of Nanking. The U.S. sent China $50 million in war relief.\" **********But in Japan, where the Rape of Nanking is not mentioned in textbooks and the country's right wing contends that the incident was a fabrication, viewers heard nothing about war atrocities. **********Though NHK's version of the documentary showed vivid footage of Chinese being shot in a ditch, the voice-over said simply, \"In a totalitarian attempt to grab land and wealth, the Japanese military had led the country into an eight-year war in Manchuria and China,\" an invasion that caused tension with the United States. **********At a luncheon with foreign correspondents on Friday, Mikio Kawaguchi, the chairman of NHK, said there had been no effort to rewrite history for a Japanese audience, simply an attempt to explain things differently to American and Japanese viewers, who \"have a different way of looking at history and life.\" **********\"Even though both sides were sincere in their efforts, the methods they wanted to employ to portray what they saw as truth were different,\" Mr. Kawaguchi said of his company's joint venture with the American network. \"There were perception gaps. The two sides had such disagreements that they feared they might be headed into a second Pearl Harbor.\" A Weeklong History Lesson **********Without question, Japan learned a lot of history this week. Many young people said that until the flurry of programs, they had not been certain why Pearl Harbor prompted such strong emotions in America. At the same time, the tone of much of the coverage paralleled the tone of the little that is taught about the war in schools: Japan was more a victim than an aggressor. **********Several broadcasts explored the internment of Japanese-Americans in the United States. Several reported arguments that President Roosevelt had known about the attack in advance and done nothing to stop it. Others found a simple answer for Japan's ultimate defeat: The country was simply outproduced by the United States. A lengthy program today, \"The Secret Story of the War Over Steel,\" showed how the giant American steelmakers that provided the hardware for Japan's defeat later fell to Japanese competition. **********Japanese television warmed to another popular theme here: that the Japanese military, rather than the Japanese people or even political leaders, was solely responsible for plunging the nation into war. **********On Friday night, for example, viewers tuned into a vivid drama called \"Defeat in Showa 16,\" a title suggesting that Japan lost the war as soon as it began in 1941. The Japanese calendar begins anew with the ascension of each new emperor, and 1941 was the 16th year of the Showa era, Emperor Hirohito's reign. Shouting at the War Institute **********Based on fact, the drama was the story of a railway executive, a bureaucrat and other Japanese who were drafted into the Government's \"Total War Research Institute.\" The institute was charged with determining what would happen if the country gave everything -- from its steel works to its samurai spirit -- to the cause of \"liberating\" the country from encirclement by Dutch, British and American colonialists. **********In the show, the young men of the institute concluded that the Government's war plans were madness. There were frequent shouting matches with the military brass, but the young men's voices were drowned out. Many historians and older Japanese say that the spirit of such dramas is accurate. **********\"Everyone knew that relations were at a critical position, even though there was no indication war would be coming so soon,\" said Junnosuke Ofusa, who joined The New York Times bureau in Tokyo in 1930 and helped guide the newspaper's coverage of Japan for the next five decades. Mr. Ofusa, who retired several years ago, said that \"no one said outwardly that it was a bad idea, because the military police were everywhere. But the Japanese people knew there was little chance of winning the war.\" **********At the same time, some Japanese bridle at placing all of the blame on the military, because the argument is often used to absolve the rest of the country. **********\"Of course the military had much of the power,\" Seiki Nishihiro, a former Deputy Defense Minister, said the other day, discussing the coverage of the anniversary. \"But the mass media and everyone else followed, so not only the military was responsible.\" **********Bubbling just beneath the surface of the coverage was the question of whether, and how, Japan should apologize for the Pearl Harbor attack. **********Government spokesmen, who have spent much of the last year fretting about the anniversary celebrations, were openly distraught. While they were issuing statements of \"regret\" or \"remorse\" or \"self-reflection\" -- a great deal of time was spent trying to figure out which word best described Japan's position -- Parliament was going in the other direction, scuttling any parliamentary apology altogether. **********\"Why should we fling mud at the history of Japan?\" Masayuki Fujio, a senior politician, asked the other day, in a remark that was quoted in the Japanese news media throughout the weekend. **********But the week was so painful that this country, which planned no formal events to commemorate Pearl Harbor, seems eager to have the anniversary behind it. \"In a sense it is a kind of Pearl Harbor week anyway,\" said a weary-looking Taizo Watanabe, the Foreign Ministry's chief spokesman. \"So many questions asked, so many answers and apologies from us.\" **********With one more apology on early Sunday morning here, after President Bush's address at Pearl Harbor, the Japanese hope it will be all over, so they can go back to topics that are easier to discuss. **********\"Ask me about anything else,\" a senior Government official said the other day. \"Ask me why the trade deficit is getting bigger again. Ask me about why we are so slow to open the rice market. Just don't ask me about Pearl Harbor.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/02/business/key-rates-822591.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-10-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/17/business/japan-s-top-securities-firms-report-a-big-drop-in-profits.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1991-05-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 380, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan's Top Securities Firms Report a Big Drop in Profits", "print_headline": "Japan's Top Securities Firms Report a Big Drop in Profits", "body_text": " **********Japan's major securities houses today reported their worst earnings in years, reflecting last year's stock market crash and a near-cessation in new issues of securities. **********The so-called Big Four -- Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi Securities -- reported declines in net income ranging from 52 percent to 67 percent.

Palestinian's Fate in Question **********\"What we do with him depends on whether we find these two Kuwaitis,\" said the Kuwaiti officer, First Lieut. Tariq al-Amiri. \"If they are dead or have disappeared, we will send him to the General Command headquarters, where those accused of war crimes are held.\" **********In the last two weeks, life for the estimated 150,000 Palestinians who remain in Kuwait, out of about 450,000 who once lived here, has become fearful and uncertain. Kuwaitis say the anger against Palestinians is such that there is little chance most of those who left during the seven-month occupation can ever come back to live here again and relatively few of those remaining will be able to stay. **********Palestinians and other foreigners forced to leave Kuwait have said that they had been tortured by the Kuwaiti authorities while detained under suspicion of collaboration. The Washington Post today quoted three former detainees, among hundreds expelled by Kuwaiti troops at the Iraqi border in recent days, as saying that they had been beaten and tortured. A Rumor Mill **********None of the Palestinians interviewed here made such statements, though reports and rumors of abuses have proliferated in Kuwait's chaotic postwar atmosphere. **********While many Palestinians are said to have collaborated with the Iraqis, many others are said to have protected their Kuwaiti neighbors and expressed strong hostility toward the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, Yasir Arafat, for his support of Iraq throughout the gulf crisis. Nevertheless, the outlook for Palestinians seems dim. **********\"If I were a Palestinian, I wouldn't want to be here,\" said a senior Cabinet minister, a member of the ruling Sabah family, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. \"We will protect them. We will give them their due. But they will be pushed out because life will unquestionably become difficult for them.\" **********Ordinary Kuwaiti citizens are, by and large, hostile to the Palestinians and far less restrained in their comments about what should be done with them. **********\"The only Palestinians who can stay here are the ones that are absolutely necessary, and only for a few years, not forever,\" said Abdelaziz Abu Abbas, a retired official of the Defense Ministry. \"I think we should abolish this business of permanent residence for Palestinians. When all is said and done, I do not think more than 30,000 Palestinians should live in Kuwait, and they should be the ones that proved to be absolutely faithful to Kuwait throughout the occupation.\" **********That, a European ambassador said, is easier said than done. Shopkeepers and Bureaucrats **********Palestinians once were a vital element of Kuwait's economy, running many of the small shops and service industries owned by Kuwaiti citizens and also filling the need for doctors, engineers and aides in Government ministries. Of the estimated two million people in Kuwait before the Iraqi invasion, only about 700,000 were native Kuwaitis and most of the rest were expatriates. Of these foreigners, the Palestinians constituted the largest and most skilled group. **********\"The reason things are going very slowly now is that when a Kuwaiti minister pushes the button on his desk, the Palestinian aide is not there to respond,\" the European ambassador remarked. \"It is not easy to operate the first floor when the ground floor is missing.\" **********Kuwaitis say Palestinians leaving the country will be able to move to Jordan, since most Palestinians who live here carry Jordanian passports. Such emigration would likely add to Palestinian nationalist passions and to unemployment in Jordan, where the Palestinians already make up 55 to 60 percent of the population. **********At the Jabiriya police station Mr. Ismail on Tuesday denied having been mistreated, and he bore no signs of physical abuse, nor did three other detained Palestinians who were observed there today.  Telltale Register **********Mr. Ismail's fate was sealed the day after the Iraqis were driven from Kuwait. Lieutenant Amiri, who was himself a member of the Kuwaiti underground, found a register left behind by Iraqi security officials who had used the station as a headquarters. In the register, an Iraqi intelligence officer identified as Said al-Ito jotted down testimony given by Mr. Ismail on Sept. 17, a month and a half into the occupation. **********In that testimony, which Mr. Ismail acknowledges to be true, the Palestinian identified two Kuwaitis who were clients of his mechanic's shop as members of the underground. **********\"Sir, I was forced to tell by the Iraqis, after they threatened to pull out my nails,\" Mr. Ismail said. He was interrupted by Lieutenant Amiri, who said the Palestinian was \"fraternizing\" with the Iraqis for months, received liquor from them, and that he was found living with an Iraqi woman when the police went to get him at his apartment. **********\"Isn't that true?\" Lieutenant Amiri asked Mr. Ismail. The Palestinian lowered his gaze and murmured that he was sorry. Then he stood silently against a wall smeared with traces of blood from people who Lieutenant Amiri said were Kuwaiti victims of Iraqi torture in the stationhouse. Iraqi Torture Device **********Next, Lieutenant Amiri opened his drawer and pulled out an electrical cord that looked somewhat like a stethoscope -- except that it had stripped wires to be placed in the ears, and a plug on the other end to go into a wall socket. **********\"This is what the Iraqis used on Kuwaitis denounced by Palestinians like this guy,\" the lieutenant said, pointing to Mr. Ismail, who appeared to melt into the wall he was leaning against. **********A few miles away, in a largely Palestinian neighborhood called Al Hawali, Yosra, a 39-year-old Palestinian woman, sat in her living room telling of her anxiety about possibly having to leave Kuwait. She recalled that this is the country where she has lived since she was 13, where she married a Palestinian man who works at Kuwait University, and where her 16- and 20-year-old daughters were born and raised. **********She gazed at her best frind, Soheila, a Kuwaiti woman, and said she was deeply troubled by what had happened on Tuesday at a checkpoint when the two of them ventured out. Riding in the Kuwaiti woman's car, the two women, who spoke on condition that their family names be withheld, were stopped by a Kuwaiti Army officer, who asked for their identification papers. Bad for Everyone? **********\"The officer told Soheila, 'You shouldn't ride with this woman,' when he saw that I had a Jordanian identity paper,\" the Palestinian woman recalled. \"Today I heard at supermarkets they gave food to the Kuwaitis, but told Palestinians with Jordanian identity cards to return tomorrow. It's getting very bad in here.\" **********Her Kuwaiti friend interrupted, saying that the officer at the checkpoint was joking. She added that the supermarkets had little food for anyone. **********\"You are exaggerating, Yosra, as you always do,\" the Kuwaiti woman said. \"The country is in a mess -- that's all.\" **********While the attitude toward the Palestinians is overwhelmingly hostile, Kuwaiti officials dispute a P.L.O. assertion that they have arrested about 6,000 Palestinians since the occupation of Kuwait ended on Feb. 26. And they say that they will do their best to protect those who are still here. But even senior Kuwaiti officials do not disguise their antipathy toward Palestinians and the P.L.O. Reduced Role in the Future **********\"We are not interested in the present leadership of the P.L.O., which has lost sight of the Palestinian cause,\" said Suleiman al-Mutawa, Kuwait's Planning Minister, in a conversation the other day. **********\"I think we will need some Palestinians, but they will have to be those who have not abused Kuwaiti hospitality,\" Mr. Mutawa said, \"and clearly, from now on, only Kuwaitis will occupy key positions in the country's businesses and Government offices. I recognize that in order to accomplish all this in a civilized fashion, we must restrain the popular sentiments about Palestinians, which are quite hostile. We will need wisdom, firmness and understanding.\" **********Many Kuwaitis say that despite many instances of Palestinian collaboration with the Iraqis, other Palestinians performed heroic deeds to protect them. **********For instance, everyone here concedes that the director of the P.L.O. office in Kuwait, Auni Batash, issued false Palestinian and Jordanian identification cards to Kuwaiti Army officers to protect them from the Iraqis, until Iraqi officers ordered Mr. Batash to leave the country for Jordan. Perils of Generalization **********\"The picture is mixed,\" said Adel Qabazad, a Kuwaiti engineer who participated in the discussion in the house of the Palestinian woman, Yosra. \"What is happening to the Palestinians at checkpoints used to happen to Kuwaitis, but many Palestinians proved to be more than good neighbors. They brought us food when we could not get out and they protected us. Others were traitors and collaborators.

Mr. Smith had built a solid track record managing Fidelity's Over-the-Counter Fund, they noted, so it made sense to give him a chance with Magellan. **********One year later, the question posed to a half-dozen experts is: What now for Magellan? Buy, sell or hold? The experts are split. **********Mr. Smith took the helm on June 1, 1990, and Magellan dropped 8.1 percent in the next six months, finishing 1990 down 4.5 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., which tracks mutual funds. It was the first year the fund had lost money since 1974, before Mr. Lynch's tenure. But the showing was still better than a 5 percent drop in the Lipper Growth Fund Index for the year. **********And after one full year on the job, Mr. Smith has steered Magellan to a return of 17.2 percent, compared with a jump of 11.7 percent in the Lipper index for the year that ended on May 31. Since the beginning of 1991, Magellan has risen 26.7 percent, compared with 21.4 percent for the index. **********Jack Bowers, editor of Fidelity Monitor, an investment newsletter based in Rocklin, Calif., said Mr. Smith \"is off to a great start in continuing the Magellan legend.\" **********Mr. Bowers rates the fund a \"solid buy,\" but he -- like nearly everyone else who recommends Magellan -- says there are limits to how well such a large fund can perform. **********Even under Peter Lynch, the amount by which Magellan beat the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell as the fund's assets grew. In each of the last four years of Mr. Lynch's stewardship, Magellan beat the S.& P. 500 by no more than 6 percentage points. That is a respectable showing, but a far cry from his 15- and 20-point spreads in earlier years, when the fund was easier to maneuver. **********Theory has it that a large fund has so much money that a great deal is left over after buying the manager's favorite small stocks. As a result, the fund must hold a large chunk of blue-chip stocks, and this causes it to track the broad market more closely. **********John Rekenthaler, senior analyst at Morningstar Inc., the Chicago-based mutual fund consultants, concludes, \"If you're looking for a fund that has a good chance to perform roughly like the broad market, perhaps a couple of percentage points better, Magellan is clearly a solid core holding.\" **********But Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor, in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., says it is time to switch out of Magellan. Mr. Jacobs compared its performance with 14 other Fidelity aggressive growth and growth funds. In all cases, he concluded that Magellan's performance had been average. **********Both Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Bowers say that for investors who want growth and are willing to accept slightly more risk, there are better choices. They recommend Fidelity's Contrafund, Emerging Growth, Stock Selector and Growth Company funds instead. **********One caveat: Investors who have large unrealized gains in Magellan must pay taxes on their gains if they sell, Mr. Jacobs warns. Unless there are offsetting investment losses elsewhere, it may not pay to switch. **********Investors in search of higher growth probably should look elsewhere, but they should also take into account the 3 percent front-end sales charge that they paid when they bought their shares, says Eric M. Kobren, editor of Fidelity Insight, a Wellesley, Mass., investment newsletter. After paying a sales load to buy a Fidelity fund, investors can switch into another Fidelity fund without paying another sales charge. So investors leaving Magellan can minimize their costs by buying shares in another Fidelity fund or by parking the money in a Fidelity money market fund, he said. **********Norman G. Fosback, editor of the Fund Forecaster in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., strongly recommends Magellan on the basis of past performance. \"We haven't noticed any significant change in volatility or relative performance since Peter Lynch left,\" he said. **********But Robin L. Carpenter, director of the Economics Office, a Cambridge, Mass., concern that analyzes money manager performance, says Mr. Lynch and Mr. Smith differ significantly in management styles. **********For one, he says, the fund's beta has risen from an average of 0.86 under Mr. Lynch to 0.97. Beta measures a fund's volatility compared with movements in the S.& P. 500-stock index. A fund with a beta of 1.0 rises or declines at the same rate as the S.& P. 500. A fund with a beta of 1.5 moves up 15 percent for every 10 percent rise in the S.& P. or down 15 percent when the S.& P. drops 10 percent. The change in Magellan's beta suggests that while the fund is still not subject to violent swings, it is a bit more volatile under Mr. Smith than under Mr. Lynch. **********While the difference is small, it is statistically significant, Mr. Carpenter says. He also points to the fact that Magellan's beta has actually been greater than 1.0 for the last three months, the longest stretch in the last five years. This higher level has paid off so far, because the stock market has been strong. Of course, it could hurt in periods of market declines."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/19/world/leading-belgian-politician-slain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 269, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Leading Belgian Politician Slain", "print_headline": "Leading Belgian Politician Slain", "body_text": " **********Andre Cools, a leading politician in the French-speaking eastern part of Belgium, was shot dead today on a street in Liege. **********Mr. Cools, 64 years old, had been a Deputy Prime Minister of Belgium and chairman of the French-language part of the Socialist Party.

The woman, who was wounded in the attack, was identified as Marie-Helene Joiret, 31 years old, a Socialist City Council member in Flemalle, where Mr. Cools was Mayor. The woman also headed a government-financed center for contemporary art. **********Without elaborating, the Liege judicial police said they were working on the assumption that the killing was a \"personal matter,\" although possible political motives were not ruled out. **********Mr. Cools, the son of a miner and trade-union activist, rose to prominence in the 1950's when Socialists eroded Catholic power in Wallonia. He had been a member of the national Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of congress, since 1958 and had headed the French-language Socialist Party from 1973 to 1981. He retired from ministerial functions a year ago but remained a local power in Wallonia. **********His party was involved in a scandal in Liege last year when the Mayor was accused of taking bribes from a parking-meter company and resigned."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/28/business/company-news-warner-lambert-meets-with-fda.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Warner-Lambert Meets With F.D.A.", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Warner-Lambert Meets With F.D.A.", "body_text": " **********The Warner-Lambert Company met with officials from the Food and Drug Administration to discuss Cognex, its Alzheimer's drug.

A key issue in the minds of many bankers is whether heavy losses in the federally guaranteed deposit insurance program will be seen as a reason to control banks more tightly rather than grant them the power to enter new businesses. **********\"If we bankers are going to bear the burden of financing Federal deposit insurance, it is important that we get some quid pro quo in the form of changes in regulations that allow us to compete in the modern world,\" said John Rau, president of LaSalle National Bank in Chicago. \"I'm worried that the people in Congress will want us to shoulder the losses of the F.D.I.C. but then say it is too risky to let banks broaden their activities.\"  'Sound, Sensible Package' **********Richard L.

The chairmen of Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and J. P. Morgan all issued statements yesterday supporting the proposals. 2 Groups Speak Up **********But among smaller banks, and at firms whose businesses would become more open to competition from banks, the Treasury proposal was criticized. The small banks that make up the Independent Bankers Association of America, for example, do not like the idea of allowing nationwide branches. And the Securities Industry Association, which represents Wall Street firms, again warned that bank activities financed with insured deposits should be kept separate from securities trading. **********Some of the strongest complaints of bankers concerned a proposal to limit a customer's insured deposits at a single bank to $100,000 for ordinary accounts and to $100,000 for an Individual Retirement Account. **********Thomas E. Hales, chief executive of the Union State Bank in Nanuet, N.Y., warned that the proposal \"is going to kill the small banks.\" \"Even before this gets to Congress,\" he said, large depositors at small banks will begin shifting funds to Treasury securities or to larger banks, \"which will still be perceived as too big to fail.\" **********Jeffrey Gerhart, president of the First National Bank of Newman Grove, Neb., also said deposit insurance limits should not be narrowed. \"People want to put their money where they live and feel safe about it.\" **********Edward Yingling, the top lobbyist for the American Bankers Association, said he expected the Treasury proposals to be supported by banks of all sizes. \"We are getting rid of the idea that some banks are too big to fail,\" he said. Opposition From Insurers **********The Treasury sugggested that Federal prohibitions on the sale of insurance by banks be removed and that states be allowed to set rules for such sales. **********Insurance agents, who have long fought to prevent banks from entering their business, are sure to fight the Treasury proposal. Banks have long sought a bigger piece of the brokerage fees and commissions paid to insurance agents for property and casualty insurance, which amounted to more than $23 billion in 1989, saying it is a low-risk business that is a natural extension of banking activities. Life insurance products like annuities are also incresingly attractive to banks, because they are an alternative to ordinary savings accounts or certificates of deposit. **********The Treasury proposal to allow industrial companies to own banks drew criticism even before the Treasury study was issued. **********E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said late last week that he doubted whether Federal regulators could keep a tight rein on potentially abusive practices if a banking company was controlled by a nonfinancial corporation, and questioned the accuracy of claims that the banking industry needs access to the capital of these companies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/31/business/short-term-yields-fall-a-bit-more.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 288, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Short-Term Yields Fall A Bit More", "print_headline": "Short-Term Yields Fall A Bit More", "body_text": " **********Yields on short-term certificates of deposit continued the downtrend of the previous week.

While most merchants had been prepared for a sluggish season, many said sales turned out to be even worse than expected. Even the last-minute shopping frenzy was not enough to give merchants anything to cheer about. **********As recently as a month ago, many retailers had hoped to exceed last year's sales by 5 percent. But results through the close of business on Monday indicate that spending will be flat or up slightly in December. The major retail chains are scheduled to release their final monthly sales results next week. **********\"We are disappointed with the season,\" Stephen E. Watson, president of the Dayton Hudson Corporation in Minneapolis, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. 'Too Little Too Late' **********Business surged in the final days, and a number of retailers said that Monday was the busiest day of the year. But Mr. Watson said, \"In our view, it's really been too little too late.\" Dayton Hudson, which relies on California for one-third of its business, was hit hard by the slowdown in that state's economy. **********This is the third consecutive sluggish Christmas shopping season -- the make or break season for retailers -- and many analysts say this year's dismal results are likely to force thousands of companies into bankruptcy. **********The economy received most of the blame for the weak sales, but retailers also said they had no hot product this year. The wave of layoff announcements in the last two months did not help either. Bad News From G.M. **********The General Motors Corporation said last week that it would close 21 plants and lay off more than 70,000 workers, striking directly at consumer's already flagging confidence. **********\"That was not helpful,\" said Mr. Watson of Dayton Hudson, which has department stores and Target discount stores in Michigan. Going into the Christmas selling season, Dayton Hudson had planned for sales to increase by as much as 7 percent over last year. But Mr. Watson said sales at the nation's fourth-largest retailer, would be flat or show a small gain for December. **********Lasker M. Meyer, vice chairman of Specialty Retailers Inc. in Houston, which operates 165 Palais Royale and Bealls department stores, also felt the announcement by General Motors put a damper on sales in the final week. \"It could be totally coincidental, but news like that really makes a strong impression on people,\" Mr. Meyer said. \"It makes them start worrying about their own jobs.\" Predictions Fall Short **********The chain started the holiday sales season predicting a 5 percent sales increase over last year, but Mr. Meyer said its sales for the period would only equal those of 1990. **********In addition to grappling with a drop in consumer confidence, merchants said they lacked a \"must have\" new product to draw people into stores. One telling sign of the lack of fresh merchandise could be found in the notoriously fickle toy aisles where Ninja Turtles remained a hot product for yet another year. **********\"It was probably the least exciting merchandising Christmas in recent history,\" said Julian M. Seeherman, chairman and chief executive of Venture Stores Inc., a Midwestern discount chain with about $1.5 billion in sales. \"This year in particular you needed something new to try and break the consumer apathy.\" Venture's sales are likely to be better than last year, but not up to expectations. **********Sales at Sears, Roebuck are also expected to be flat or down slightly for the month, analysts said. Long Lull in December **********Sears, like other retailers said business was strong at Thanksgiving and in the last few days, but quiet for much of December. \"For the first two and a half weeks in December, we were soft and somewhat below our expectations,\" said Matt Howard, senior vice president of marketing for Sears. The stores had a strong finish. \"Monday was exceptionally strong,\" he said. **********Mr. Howard said consumers were out in force, but they were simply buying less. \"The size of the ticket over all for most retailers is probably smaller this year,\" he said. **********Nonetheless, the number of customers shopping at Sears, and the number of transactions the company processed were up for the fourth quarter. Some Bright Spots **********There were bright spots. With consumers searching for bargains, discount retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the K Mart Corporation are expected to post solid gains. \"K Mart had a very good month,\" said Robert Roth, a retail analyst with Merrill Lynch. The company did booming business on Monday and said it expected sales to be up by 8 or 9 percent compared with December last year. **********\"Everybody is talking recession and depression; in this store that's not been the case,\" said Curtis Williams, general manager of a K Mart store in the Altanta area, near Marietta. Business jumped 25 percent on Monday, compared with Dec. 23 last year, he said. **********A Wal-Mart spokeswoman said, \"We are pleased with sales for the holiday season this year.\" **********The Gap, with its tables full of $36 jeans, $20 turtlenecks and $35 cotton sweaters, is also expected to do well this Christmas. **********Merchants like the Gap and Wal-Mart benefited from the twin themes of value and the desire for basic merchandise, both emerged early and dominated consumers quest for gifts this year. **********Mr. Howard of Sears said sheets, towels, portable electric tools, exercise bikes, jeans, turtlenecks and terry cloth robes had sold well. **********J. C. Penney scaled back its hopes for the month after \"business fell apart the beginning of December,\" said Harvey McCormick, a company spokesman. He said the company expected sales for the month to be flat or slightly better than a year earlier, although analysts felt that Penney's might be down for the month. Last-Minute Rush Is Slow **********Cheryl Engstrom, a spokeswoman for Nordstrom Inc. in Seattle, said sales had not picked up as sharply as the company had anticipated. Although there has been an uptick in sales over the last couple of days, the results are not likely to meet the company's projections for the holiday selling season. \"Shoppers have been slower than ever getting off the dime this year, and it looks like some of them may never take off,\" Ms. Engstrom said. **********She said Nordstrom's specialty apparel stores had not done as well as its outlet divisions, Nordstrom Rack and Place Two. \"Those have been doing great, which just reinforces the trend that our customers are shopping for price,\" Ms. Engstrom said. **********In a season marked by many sales, retailers continued to cut prices aggressively up until stores closed on Christmas Eve. Sales Before Christmas **********At a Bombay Company home furnishing store at the Oakland Mall near Detroit, the after-Christmas sales tags were being hung on items earlier than planned. \"We're pulling out all the stops,\" said the store manager, Kathy Gurtek. **********Such last-minute price-cutting was widespread. \"If a competitor's price goes down, we'll tag our price down,\" said Wayne Inouye, vice president of merchandising for the Good Guys Inc. He said that a competitor, had recently dropped the price of a popular Sony camcorder to $600, which is $100 less than the advertised price a month ago. Good Guys matched that cut and others, a policy that has caused the company's stock price to drop recently. **********Even though retailers ordered merchandise carefully this year, they are gearing up for huge after-Christmas sales. Sears will run extensive advertising for its post-Christmas \"Best Week to Buy\" sale. **********Still, some chose to give the most practical gift of all this year, cash. Barry Levine, a 44-year old talent manager in Los Angeles, gave money to his brother, an unemployed engineer. \"You can't eat a sweater,\" Mr. Levine said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/11/world/confrontation-gulf-war-peace-sampling-debate-capitol-hill.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 4461, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "War and Peace: A Sampling From the Debate on Capitol Hill", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF; War and Peace: A Sampling From the Debate on Capitol Hill", "body_text": " **********Senator George J. Mitchell Democrat of Maine **********Today the Senate undertakes a solemn constitutional responsibility to decide whether to commit the nation to war. In this debate, we should focus on the fundamental question before us: what is the wisest course of action for our nation in the Persian Gulf crisis. **********In its simplest form, the question is whether Congress will give the President an unlimited blank check to initiate war against Iraq at some unspecified time in the future under circumstances which are not now known and cannot be foreseen.                . . . **********This is not a debate about whether force should ever be used. No one proposes to rule out the use of force; we cannot and should not rule it out. The question is should war be truly a last resort when all other means fail or should we start with war, before other means have been fully and fairly exhausted. **********This is not a debate about American objectives in the current crisis. There is broad agreement in the Senate that Iraq must fully and unconditionally withdraw its forces from Kuwait. The issue is how best to achieve that goal. Most Americans and most members of Congress, myself included, supported the President's initial decision to deploy American forces to Saudi Arabia to deter further Iraqi aggression. We supported the President's effort in marshaling international diplomatic pressure and the most comprehensive embargo in history against Iraq. **********I support that policy. I believe it remains the correct policy, even though the President abandoned his own policy before it had time to work. The change began on Nov. 8, when President Bush announced that he was doubling the number of American troops in the Persian Gulf to 430,000 in order to attain a credible offensive option. The President did not consult with Congress about that decision; he did not try to build support for it among the American people. He just did it. **********In so doing, President Bush transformed the United States' role and its risks in the Persian Gulf crisis. In effect, the President, overnight, with no consultation and no public debate, changed American policy from being part of a collective effort to enforce economic and diplomatic sanctions into a predominantly American effort, relying upon the use of American military force. **********Despite the fact that his own policy of international economic sanctions was having a significant effect upon the Iraqi economy, the President, without explanation, abandoned that approach and instead adopted a policy based first and foremost upon the use of American military force. As a result, this country has been placed on a course toward war. This has upset the balance of the President's initial policy, the balance between resources and responsibility, between interest and risk, between patience and strength.                . . . **********It may become necessary to use force to expel Iraq from Kuwait, but because war is such a grave undertaking, with such serious consequences, we must make certain that war is employed only as a last resort. Representative Robert H. Michel Republican of Illinois **********I speak from the prejudice of being a combat veteran of World War II. And those of our generation know from bloody experience that unchecked aggression against a small nation is a prelude to an international disaster. **********Saddam Hussein today has more planes and tanks and, frankly, men under arms, than Hitler had at the time when Prime Minister Chamberlain came back from Munich with that miserable piece of paper -- peace in our time. I'll never forget that replay of that movie in my life. **********And I have an obligation, I guess, coming from that generation, to transmit those thoughts I had at the time to the younger generation who didn't experience what we did. Saddam Hussein not only invaded Kuwait, he occupied, terrorized, murdered civilians, systematically looted and turned a peaceful nation into a wasteland of horror. He seeks control over one of the world's vital resources, and he ultimately seeks to make himself the unchallenged anti-Western dictator of the Mideast. **********Either we stop him now, and stop him permanently, or we won't stop him at all. **********Now the President has clearly presented the reasons why we can't stand by idly. In his words, and I quote them -- we're in the gulf because the world must not and cannot reward aggression, and we're there because our vital interests are at stake. Now we're told by some that we must show patience. We must wait for sanctions to work. **********We must wait six months or a year before forces are used. We must stay the course. My question is this -- stay what course? A course that allows Saddam to know he is freed from surprise attack, free from sudden offensive movement for six months or a year or more? And I guess to you who advocate that course, I would have to ask you to do -- what you would do about the attitude of the American people in that interval period of time? How long is the American people -- will the American people put up with that? Senator Strom Thurmond   Republican of South Carolina **********Mr. President, how much longer can we expect them to maintain their combat readiness? How much longer can we expect our soldiers' families to carry on under the tremendous burdens they are carrying? They are not only dealing with the uncertainty of not knowing how much longer their loved ones will be gone from home but also with anguish that war could break out at any moment. **********Mr. President, the Congress must act and let its voice be heard. The time to end the debate is now. I implore this body to demonstrate to the world and especially Saddam Hussein that we are behind our President and the United Nations. A vote in support of the President is a vote for peace. I urge my colleagues to stop the debate and show our solidarity with the President and resolve to get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. Solidarity, we need it now, not division, but solidarity. Senator Edward M. Kennedy   Democrat of Massachusetts **********I urge the Senate to vote for peace, not war. Now is not the time for war. I reject the argument that says Congress must support the President, right or wrong. We have our own responsibility to do what is right, and I believe that war today is wrong. **********War is not the only option left to us in the Persian Gulf. The President may have set Jan. 15 as    his    deadline, but the American people have not. Sanctions and diplomacy may still achieve our objectives, and Congress has the responsibility to insure that all peaceful options are exhausted before resort to war. Unless we reach that stage, Congress ought not to authorize the President to use force. **********At this historic moment, it may well be that only Congress can stop this senseless march toward war.                . . . **********Let there be no mistake about the cost of war. We have arrayed an impressive international coalition against Iraq, but when the bullets start flying, 90 percent of the casualties will be Americans. It is hardly a surprise that so many other nations are willing to fight to the last American to achieve the goals of the United Nations. It is not their sons and daughters who will do the dying. Most military experts tell us that a war with Iraq would not be quick and decisive, as President Bush suggests; it'll be brutal, and costly. It'll take weeks, even months, and will quickly turn from an air war to a ground war, with thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands, of American casualties. **********The Administration refuses to release casualty estimates, but the 45,000 body bags the Pentagon has sent to the region are all the evidence we need of the high price in lives and blood that we will have to spare. Military experts have used Israel's two recent desert wars as reliable indicators of the casualties we will suffer. In the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel suffered 3,300 casualties out of a force of 300,000, including 7,000 dead. In the heavier fighting that lasted 20 days in the 1973 war, Israeli casualties were 11,000 out of a force of a similar size, with 2,600 dead. **********In other words, we're talking about the likelihood of at least 3,000 American casualties a week, with 700 dead, for as long as the war goes on. Senator John C. Danforth   Republican of Missouri **********The one and only chance to accomplish our objectives without war is to maintain sanctions accompanied by a credible military threat. Without a credible military threat, our alternative is sanctions followed by nothing at all. The key to peace is maintaining a credible military threat, and this is precisely the point our pending votes will address. **********Those who would give sanctions a chance before military action is even possible would decouple the two components which must be kept linked if we have any chance of getting Iraq out of Kuwait without a fight. They would foreclose any possibility of a just peace. **********This is why I cannot vote for sanctions alone. This is why I cannot vote to deprive the President of the credible threat of force. It is indeed a supreme irony that it is only through the threat of force that a stable world can be maintained. But that is an irony that we have recognized ever since World War II. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan   Democrat of New York **********Suddenly, on behalf of Kuwait, in opposition to Iraq, we see the largest array of armed force since the -- mankind has seen since the Second World War. And we see a President declaring -- assserting that he has the right to send those armed forces into battle independently of any judgment of the Senate. . . . **********Now how could this happen? The first post-cold-war crisis, as we have had it described. I'd like to suggest, Mr. President, and I hope this might help us think about the subject -- I'd like to suggest that despite the assertions that this was the first post-cold-war crisis, and the way in which we've proceeded in that mold and which manner obtained the universal support of the country, and the Senate here -- or as near to it as makes no matter -- suddenly there is an institutional lurch back in to the manner and mode of the cold war.                . . . **********Then the assertions we have heard in the past months, after the lurching from a defensive, deterrent position -- which we responded to very well -- into an offensive position, on Nov. 8; a measure taken in secret and that certainly suddenly turned what had been a collective security operation, with the complete support of the country and the world, into a crisis situation. And all through those things, the President as Commander in Chief, secretly moving to create the ongoing permanent Orwellian crisis.               . . . **********What we find here is a kind of time warp in which we don't -- we're acting in an old mode with response to a new condition. I find it, for example, extraordinary that the President should so personalize the encounter with this particular thug in Baghdad -- the most recent thug in Baghdad, not the last by any means; there'll be others, they'll succeed each other. We are not in an international crisis in the sense that events that took place on Aug. 2 necessitate the confrontation of the largest set of armed forces since World War II. Nothing large happened. A nasty little country invaded a littler, but just as nasty, country.                . . . **********Mr. President, our armies have been on the Rhine for 45 years, and that is to stop a Roman legion. I mean, we're still at Panmunjom. We have had naval force with some land facilities -- a base facilities -- in the gulf since the Second World War. **********Well, 12 months have passed, 18 months have passed, life will go on and we will not have the wrenching Constitutional crisis that will come about with the President committing a massive use of our armed forces in a distant region of the world without the specific declaration of war by Congress. Senator Orrin G. Hatch   Republican of Utah **********Mr. President, I have been watching this debate with a great deal of interest today and frankly I'm very concerned about some of the comments that have been made. I think President Bush has gone the extra mile in trying to avoid the use of force. I don't think there's any question about that. And I think it's time for Congress to help rather than hinder the President. **********I think it's time for the Congress to join with the President and get behind him and our young men and women over there sitting in the sand and show that we're willing to back the use of force. I never thought I'd see the day when a timid organization like the United Nations would come out and agree and authorize the use of force by Jan. 15 and all members of Congress are unwilling to back their resolution, some of them. **********Unless Saddam Hussein believes that the threat of war is real, he will not budge. I think we've learned that. The only way to avoid war, in my opinion in this particular situation, is to be prepared to go to war and to show that our resolve is for real. If Hussein won't even accept a letter from President Bush, he certainly is not going to accept Congressional clues that Iraq pull out from Kuwait. Our actions should be decisive. **********If we back the President overwhelmingly we will maximize the pressure on Iraq, we will enhance the chances that we can avoid war. If the vote is close, Saddam Hussein can conclude that he can divide our country if he will only hold out. If we fail to back the President, war will become inevitable.  Senator Bill Bradley   Democrat of New Jersey **********President Bush and Secretary Baker apparently have not addressed these four most probable outcomes from using massive military force. They have not apparently thought through how to deal with the potential power vacuum in Iraq, or how to cushion the negative Arab reaction to the use of massive force or how to resist pressure from our Arab coalition partners to sell out Israel, or how to prevent an isolationist reaction to a bloody war whose purpose has been inadequately explained. **********Because they have not prepared for tomorrow's reaction, they should not commence offensive action today.  Senator Claiborne Pell   Democrat of Rhode Island **********As amongst those who've served their country in war, and one who has pressed in the United States Senate for the toughest possible nonmilitary response to years of Iraqi lawbreaking, I believe that at this time, peace and the continuation of comprehensive sanctions is the wisest course, strongest course, best course for our nation.  Senator Arlen Specter   Republican of Pennsylvania **********I personally remain hopeful, Mr. President, that war will be avoided. But it seems to me that the best way to avoid a war is to put Iraq squarely on notice with a very strong support by the Congress of the U.N. resolution and the President that we mean business and we're prepared to fight. **********We wonder about the state of mind of Saddam Hussein. We wonder if he's a madman, Mr. President, and I submit that he is not. Senator Shelby and I had an opportunity to visit for an hour and 20 minutes with President Saddam Hussein just about a year ago today and I found him very poorly informed about the U.S. policy, very poorly informed about Western attitudes, did not have an understanding of our attitude about the problems of the Mideast. But he was certainly far from a mad man. **********And there was later another Senate delegation with Senator Dole and Senator Metzenbaum and Senator McClure, Senator Murkowski, Senator Simpson and those senators also had a discussion with President Saddam Hussein and concluded that he was not a mad man. And we wonder what is his calculation. **********It seems to me that if the current course is followed and force is used, that President Saddam Hussein will lose his country but he must have some other calculation. He may have a calculation of involving Israel in a war. He may have a calculation of trying to bring the coalition into disintegration so the Arabs will fight the Israelis. Or what he really may have in mind, and it's obviously speculative to try to figure out what is President Saddam Hussein's state of mind, he may have in mind the state of mind of the United States Congress. And that is a more perplexing state of mind than the mind of Saddam Hussein. **********The comments have been made, I think it was the distinguished majority leader who raised that question about what was the will of Congress, doubt about the will of the Senate, always doubt about what we are undertaking, but if we unequivocally put Iraq and its President on notice of our intentions by a solid vote, it is my judgment that we will have an excellent chance to avoid that war.  Representative Richard A. Gephardt   Democrat of Missouri **********I want to say tonight that if Saddam Hussein listens to this debate -- and we're told that he does pick up some American television -- I hope that he will take no comfort from this debate. We are united in our purpose in this country and in this Congress. Some have expressed concern that when there is a division of opinion even on strategy, that that lends help to the other side. I hope that we'd never mistake disagreement on means as disunity within our country. I can't remember a time when our country has been as unified around a set of goals, as focused on what we're trying to do, in as much agreement and unity as I think we are tonight.  Representative Patricia Schroeder   Democrat of Colorado **********I rise in support of the gentleman from Indiana and Congressman Gephardt's resolution. I think it fits exactly what we know about leadership. What we have learned over and over and over again about leadership is first you commit the nation and then you commit the troops. Tonight we're talking about are we going to go even further and commit the troops way beyond where the nation is committed. I think the Hamilton-Gephardt resolution fits exactly where we are in our commitments. **********No. 1, it protects U.S. forces. It allows use of force if our U.S. forces overseas are attacked. That's very important. **********No. 2, it keeps our commitment to defend Saudi Arabia and use force if Saudi Arabia is attacked. The American people support that, and that makes sense. **********Then it also allows for use of force if the sanctions are violated in any manner, and that's our commitment, and that makes sense. What it does not do is say that we're going to put everything out there and go for it on the 15th. I do not know why we cut off our options and decided that on Jan. 15 we had to give the President what is the equivalent of a declaration of war.  Senator William V. Roth Jr.   Republican of Delaware **********The fact remains, such a united coalition is truly historic. A coalition that reflects the worldwide concern about Saddam Hussein, his belligerent character and frightening objectives. This alignment is the result of several important factors, factors that we must consider as we debate the resolutions before us. **********Perhaps the first and foremost factor concerns Iraq's growth in both quantity and quality of military power. It continues at a threatening pace, despite the fact that Hussein's war with Iran is long ended. **********Let no one be caught sleeping. To close an eye now would allow him the deadly latitude to consolidate his power and amass a nuclear arsenal. He is willing to bend any law and make almost any sacrifice toward these ends. He is an unpredictable as a desert storm and as deceptive as a mirage. **********One can only imagine what devastating consequence would fall should his dominance be allowed in the oil-rich Middle East. And this is the second reason why he must be stopped. When I speak of the danger that would result from his control of this region, I'm not talking about consequences to major oil companies -- quite simply, I'm talking about jobs. I'm talking about the raw material of human endeavor. **********Oil runs the economy of the world. It fuels our factories, heats our homes. Carries our products from manufacture to market. It's as basic to the economy as water is to life. And the free trade and international supplies is critical, not only for the industrial democracies, but the fragile third world nations that depend on this precious resource even more than we do. **********Any attempt to disrupt these supplies will send a devastating quake to these economies, lengthening unemployment lines, boosting inflation in the industrial democracies and crushing the economies of developing countries where day to day existence depends on imported energy sources.  Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.   Democrat of Delaware **********If there's a war, 95 percent of the casualties on the world's side will be American. If there's a war, we will prevail, we will win the battle, but 95 percent of the enmity of the Arab world outside of Iraq, to the extent there is any, will be directed at the United States.                . . . **********In light of this, Mr. President, it seems almost impossible to believe that we're having a serious argument in this country today about whether under the Constitution the President alone can take a nation to war. The Constitution's language says that the war powers rest with the Congress. And from James Madison to John Marshall, the Constitution's fathers all understood this to be a key principle of the republic. **********And lest anyone in this body or anyone listening wonder why I'm raising this question since there's already a resolution before us, I'm raising it because the President continues to insist he does not need, does not need the will of the people spoken through the Congress as envisioned by the Constitution to decide whether or not to go to war. **********On Tuesday President Bush asked this Congress to debate and decide whether to take the nation to war yet unfortunately the President stopped short of abandoning his previous claim that he has the power acting alone to start a war. **********And just yesterday, as I mentioned earlier, the President himself said that he alone has the constitutional authority to initiate war. No President before him has ever said anything like that. No President in our history has ever made such an assertion. To put it simply these views are at odds with the Constitution. They may accurately describe the power of leaders of other countris, but they do not describe the power of the President of the United States.                . . . **********If the President, at least in his statements, appears willing to violate our Constitution to achieve those objectives, if this crisis is really about upholding the law of nations, I suggest the President acknowledge that he start here by upholding the law at home and clearly acknowledge that only the Congress can take this nation to war.  Senator Paul D. Wellstone   Democrat of Minnesota **********I rise to speak in this chamber for the first time with a very heavy heart. I wanted my first speech to be about children and education and health care and a credible energy policy and the environment. I never thought that the first time I would have an opportunity to speak in this chamber the topic would be such a grave topic -- life and death, whether or not to go to war, to ask America's men and women, so many of them so young to risk life and limb, to unleash a tremendous destructive power on a foreign country and a far away people. This is the most momentous decision that any political leader would ever have to make and decide we must. **********And let no one doubt that the Congress has the responsibility to make this decision. The Constitution is unambiguous on this point: Congress declares the war, not the President.               . . . **********The policies that I am afraid the Administration is pursuing, the rush to war that I am afraid is so much of what is now happening in our country and the world, will not create a new order, Mr. President, it will create a new world disorder. What kind of victory will it be? What kind of victory will it be if we unleash forces of fanaticism in the Middle East and a chronically unstable region becomes even more unstable further jeopardizing Israel's security?                . . . **********Some causes are worth fighting for, some causes are worth fighting for. This cause is not worth fighting for right now. We must stay the course with economic sanctions, continue the pressure, continue the squeeze, move forward on the diplomatic front and Mr. President, we must not, we must not rush to war.  Senator Paul Simon   Democrat of Illinois **********Mr. President, there is a grim mood here in Congress as I do not recall. When you and I were elected to the House, Mr. President, in 1974, we were already involved in the Vietnam War but it was being pulled down and I have not experienced this kind of a mood before in Washington D.C. We face unprovoked aggression. No question about it. And there is no question in the minds of anyone here that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi troops have to get out of Kuwait, one way or another. **********When you grow up in rural America and live in rural America you learn something very simple: don't corner a rattlesnake. Give the rattlesnake a way to get out. And that's what we have to do in the situation over there. But I have to say the diplomatic option looks very, very difficult. **********The second option is the economic option, sanctions. This was imposed by the President, and the President and the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense appear to have all but given up on this. And I suggest the evidence is pretty overwhelming that this has a chance to succeed if we stick with it. No one can guarantee it but I think it has a chance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/01/business/key-rates-752591.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/14/business/company-news-a-new-fight-over-lockheed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A New Fight Over Lockheed", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; A New Fight Over Lockheed", "body_text": " **********Harold C.

Pamela Adkins, a spokeswoman at Merck headquarters in Rahway, N.J., said the joint venture was \"studying additional opportunities\" in Europe. **********Analysts said Johnson & Johnson-Merck planned to plunge heavily into Europe, where the market for over-the-counter drugs would be twice as large if Europeans could be persuaded to buy antacid and aspirin pills as frequently as Americans do. **********The joint venture, established in 1989 to adapt Merck prescription drugs for the over-the-counter market, is also in a race with the SmithKline Beecham Corporation in the American market for Government approval to sell over-the-counter versions of their strong-selling anti-ulcer drugs. The joint venture hopes to have a version of Merck's Pepcid, which has prescription sales of $300 million a year, on drugstore shelves by 1994. SmithKline is trying to hit the consumer shelves first with a version of Tagamet, a drug with sales of $1 billion a year. **********Viren Mehta, an analyst with Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Research, in New York, said the joint venture company would pay about $90 million for Woelm, which makes cough and cold medicine, laxatives and vitamin brands that have total annual sales of about $40 million. The deal does not include Woelm's popular garlic-based medicine, Ilga-Rhoja, or the Armour blood products line. **********Mr. Mehta said Johnson & Johnson-Merck, in another European move, was also one of several companies talking with the Sara Lee Corporation, which is auctioning two consumer medications with combined sales of $200 million. The products are Rennie, which Sara Lee said was Europe's largest-selling antacid, and Aspro, a popular aspirin product in Europe and Australia. **********Spokesmen for Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Sara Lee said they did not comment on rumors of mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Mehta said the Sara Lee products would attract bidding in the $600 million to $800 million range. A European Nucleus **********Buying Woelm will provide Johnson & Johnson-Merck with a European nucleus, including cash flow, a factory and expertise in getting drugs approved by European government agencies, Mr. Mehta said. \"It will act as a magnet to speed up their acquisition strategy,\" he added. **********Johnson & Johnson-Merck has about $125 million in sales, mainly of Mylanta, an antacid that the joint venture obtained early last year from ICI America Inc., a unit of Imperial Chemical Industries P.L.C. of Britain, in a $450 million deal. Merck said that Mylanta became the best-selling American liquid antacid earlier this year, overtaking Maalox. **********Denise Stovell, a Sara Lee spokeswoman, said her company got Aspro and Rennie in 1984 when Sara Lee acquired the Nicholas Kiwi Company's line of pharmaceuticals, household products and shoe polish."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/02/business/business-diary-may-26-31.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Kurtzman", "pub_date": "1991-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1718, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business Diary/May 26-31", "print_headline": "Business Diary/May 26-31", "body_text": " **********COMPANIES Akers Rattles a Few Cages at Buttoned-Down I.B.M. **********Rarely does the International Business Machines Corporation reveal its inner workings to the world. But last week it did when the contents of a tough speech given to a group of managers by John Akers, I.B.M.'s chairman, leaked out. It was an accident, the company said. Initially, investors did not like what they saw. I.B.M.'s stock dipped to $104.25 from $105.12 while the market rallied to new highs. Later, investors had a change of heart. The speech showed Mr. Akers struggling to do exactly what Wall Street wants: toughen up the company's country-club culture. According to the notes of the speech, Mr. Akers said I.B.M. had \"too many people standing around the water cooler.\" Mr. Akers also said he would tolerate no further loss of market share. By the end of the week, the tough talk sank in. Big Blue's stock closed on Friday at $106.12. The only question now is whether the accidental release happened on purpose. A Fast Train for Texas?  Japan's bullet trains cruise at 150 miles per hour and France's TGV -- for Train a Grande Vitess -- was clocked at 320 m.p.h. American coaches lumber along at less than 100 m.p.h. That may change. Last week, the Texas High-Speed Rail Authority voted to award GEC Alshom of Paris -- the builder of the TGV -- and the Morrison Knudsen Corporation of Boise, Idaho, a construction company, a contract to build a 200 m.p.h. rail line between Dallas and Houston by 1998. San Antonio would be added later, creating a 620-mile triangle. There is one catch: The consortium has to raise its own money to build the system, at a hefty estimated cost of $5.7 billion. So far, the companies have just $167 million in capital. Will they be able to raise the rest? \"There is a feeling of confidence that the TGV consortium can pull it together,\" said Steven Polunsky the Texas High Speed Rail Authority. Macy's Inexplicable Strategy  R. H. Macy & Company has big plans. The retailing chain figures if it opens 11 new stores over the next five years it can increase sales from $2.2 billion last year to $3.6 billion. That is a gain of 41.6 percent. It also wants to invest in technology and a new advertising campaign. Very aggressive actions in such a sluggish market. The trouble is, Macy's has little cash -- less than at any time since a leveraged buyout took it private in 1986. And it has a storeroom full of debt, $3.4 billion. It is losing money too -- $100.9 million last quarter -- as sales slide and margins thin. This has the analysts scratching their heads about Macy's plans. They are concerned about opening new stores \"I am concerned about Macy's acceleration of store openings at a time when it is so important to gain existing-store productivity.\" said Walter F. Loeb an independent analysts in New York. The big store's creditors are getting nervous. A Disney Bails Out L.A. Gear  L.A. Gear Inc., the athletic footwear maker, grew quickly by spotting fads on the playground. But now it's stumbling badly. It lost $12.5 million in the first quarter on sales of $171 million on top of losing $9.1 million in the final quarter last year. L.A. Gear's creditors, jittery from the losses, cut its credit line to $300 million from $360 million. The company needed cash. Last week it got it. Roy E. Disney, said he would buy 30 percent of the sneaker company for $100 million. The deal is the first for Trefoil Capital Investors, a $450 million investment fund formed by Mr. Disney's firm, Shamrock Capital Advisers Inc. of Burbank, Calif., to rescue ailing companies. In exchange for the money, Mr. Disney gets control of the compay's operating plan. Ameritech Spruces Up  The Ameritech Corporation, based in Chicago, provides local telephone service in five Midwestern states. Pretty ho-hum, as businesses go, but a good provider of cash. Last week the company decided to dump its dowdy image and said it would buy Cybertel for $512 million from JMB Reality of Chicago and its partners. Cybertel is one of two companies providing cellular telephone service in St. Louis. Analysts think Ameritech cut a good deal. It will pay $195 for each \"pop\" -- slang for a cellular customer. Prices have been as high as $350. Best of all, Cybertel has only 40,000 customers, plenty of room for growth.  That gives Ameritech's image an overhaul.  A Challenge to T.W.A.  To pare down some of its $2.7 billion in debt, Trans World Airlines Inc., sold its routes to London to American Airlines for $445 million. Last week the sale was put in doubt. The city of St. Louis, T.W.A.'s hub and its unions asked the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal to reverse the sale. The challenge is moot, T.W.A.'s lawyers said. The deal is already done. T.W.A. negotiated a deal to buy back some of its debt from Connecticut National Bank at 77.5 cents on the dollar. The bank was threatening threatening to reposses 10 airplanes and 62 engines.  INTERNATIONAL **********Resistance to Favoring China  ast week, President Bush told the graduating class at Yale University that he would renew China's trade privileges for another year. But he added a disclaimer. He was trying to \"chart a course through a world of lesser evils,\" he said. Maybe so, but getting Congress to agree that China is a \"lesser evil,\" will not be easy. Three measures have already been introduced to revoke China's most-favored-nation status, which grants its goods low tariffs. China has not changed policies since 1989 when it cracked down on political activity, the bills' authors say. To mollify Congress, Mr. Bush said exports of supercomputers, missiles and nuclear technology would be restricted. Not enough to stop a fight in Congress. \"The issue is joined,\" said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York. Mr. Bush may lose the fight.  A Reward for Egypt  uring the gulf war, Egypt's crippled economy lost billions of dollars. But now it is being rewarded for having joined the fight against Iraq. The United States and other Western creditors agreed last week to forgive $20.2 billion of Egypt's Government debt -- almost half of Egypt's $50 billion in debt. Welcome relief for this struggling nation. But what will follow forgiveness? Most economist say more borrowing. Primakov on a Mission  Yevgeny M. Primakov, the wily Soviet envoy who tried (and failed) to get Saddam Hussein to quit the war, saw President Bush last week. He said he thinks Washington will come up with $1.5 billion in credits so the Soviet Union can buy grain. The Administration is not so sure. It wants to see a reform plan for the Soviet economy it can believe in. So far it has not. The last plan called for more (not less) central control. Precisely the wrong direction. The latest plan, Mr. Primakov said, will do the opposite. But it is not quite finished. The Administration wants to see more before it gives the nod. THE ECONOMY Good News, With a Caveat  There was optimism but it was tinctured with a dash of gloom. Sales of existing homes were up 3.4 percent for April, the third increase in a row according to the National Association of Realtors. The Commerce Department confirmed the good news. Sales of new homes climbed 1.2 percent in April. These figures indicate the housing slump may have reached its final days. But the Mortgage Bankers Association cast some doubt. It said 4.95 percent of the nation's homeowners were at least 30 days late on their mortgage payments in the first quarter, a sign that tough times remain. The delinquencies rate was 4.71 percent in the fourth quarter. Before the recession hit, the rate was 4.41 percent. Rising delinquencies mean future foreclosures -- bad news for the nation's home lenders. \"The economy is staging a recovery,\" said Richard Peach, deputy chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. \"But we don't expect it to be terribly strong.\" The Factory-Orders Omen Factory orders rose 1.8 percent in April, according to the Commerce Department, the first increase in six months. Spending increased for both durable and nondurable goods. It was a better showing than most analysts had expected and followed declines of 2.9 percent in March and 0.6 percent in February. The new figures, released last week, show that inventories are shrinking and companies are ordering new goods. The Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, last month said an increase in factory orders would indicate that the economy is turning around. But economists caution the lag can be long between a pickup in orders and employment growth. **********The G.N.P. Inches Back  The gross national product fell by 2.6 percent in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said last week. Everybody already knew that. But they did not know that the G.N.P. was down two-tenths of 1 percent less than the department's original estimate. The recession may be deep, but it's no Grand Canyon. Even better, the Commerce Department reported that corporate profits in the first quarter fell less than in the two preceding quarters. They were down three-tenths of 1 percent following declines of 1.9 percent and 3.9. The recession may have reached its nadir. **********Hope From Consumers Consumer spirits remain up, but they are not as buoyant as before. \"We got dancing in the streets when the war was over,\" said Fabien Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. \"That is giving way to a somewhat more sober assessment.\" Nothing to worry about -- so far.

Because he reportedly lost an eye in an earlier bomb blast, the suspect also has the nickname \"One-Eyed Jack.\" **********Mr. Gandhi, who was campaigning to regain power as prime minister, died in the explosion at the rally in Sriperumbudur, a village in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The police believe that a woman in her 30's detonated the bomb around her waist as she bowed to touch Mr. Gandhi's feet in a gesture of respect. The woman, believed to belong to a suicide squad of the Tamil Tigers, was among those killed with Mr. Gandhi.  Tigers Deny Involvement **********Security officials decline to discuss the motive for the assassination, or even to confirm that the plot was planned and carried out by the violent group seeking a separate state for the Tamil minority in northeast Sri Lanka. Officials of the Tamil Tigers, which has carried out bombings and assassinations in Sri Lanka, have denied any involvement in the Gandhi killing. **********Privately, officials speculate that the group plotted to kill Mr. Gandhi before his probable election as Prime Minister in large part because security for him during the campaign was relatively light. Mr. Gandhi had sought to keep his campaign security at bay partly because of criticism that in his earlier losing campaign in 1989 he had traveled excessively by helicopter and kept aloof from crowds. **********Officials believe that the Tamil group may have meticulously planned the killing at its highest levels out of concern that Mr. Gandhi's policies would seek to destroy it if he was re-elected. As Prime Minister from 1984 to 1989, Mr. Gandhi sent Indian troops to neighboring Sri Lanka to try to end the years of ethnic strife between the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority. Indian troops engaged in violent clashes with the militants for more than two years, and were pulled out in March 1990, a few months after Mr. Gandhi left office. **********A widely read news magazine, India Today, said in an account of the assassination that the decision to kill Mr. Gandhi was made in November by the head of the organization, identified as Pirabhakaran, who summoned four key associates, including Shivarasan, to the jungles of Jaffna, the Sri Lankan base for the militant group. **********While Shivarasan was assigned to plan the assassination, the other three were given tasks such as preparing a back-up team to arrange shelter for the assassins before and after the killing, and to prepare a base in Madras to insure proper communications and couriers for messages. **********Indian security officials refuse to discuss the specific details disclosed by the magazine, as well as by other Indian publications, but acknowledge that they believe that the killing was carefully planned and involved a substantial number of Sri Lankans and Indians. At least two dozen senior security officials are working full time on the case, mostly in Madras and New Delhi. Officials said hundreds of police officers, mostly in Tamil Nadu, were engaged in the hunt for susspects.  Still in India, Officials Say **********Security officials said on Friday that they believe Shivarasan as well as two accomplices -- a 22-year-old woman called Subha, and a 19-year-old unidentifed man -- remain in southern India. **********Security officials have released photographs of Shivarasan, as well as a highly detailed description of him based on interviews, interrogations and photographs. **********The description notes that Shivarasan wears a white cyanide capsule around his neck -- a practice that one official described as not unusual for a commando of the Tamil group. There are no known details about Shivarasan's personal life or background. **********Details about the woman who killed herself in the bomb blast are also hazy, although there have been reports that she harbored a deep hatred of Indians because two of her brothers had been killed by Indian forces in Sri Lanka. There have also been reports that the woman, called Dhanu, had been raped by Indian soldiers during the Sri Lankan operation. Indian officials declined to discuss the reports. **********Security officials acknowledge that the photos taken at the assassination by a photographer, Hari Babu, and later recovered, were pivotal in the identification of the suspects. The slain photographer's camera was recovered with the film intact.  Last Photo of Blast Flame **********Officials believe that the 21-year-old photographer was assigned by Shivarasan to take photos of the campaign event, in line with the militants' tradition of recording its operations. But the photographer moved too close to Mr. Gandhi, depriving the militants not only of their documentation but providing security officials with major clues. His pictures included shots of the woman who was apparently carrying the bomb, Shivarasan posing as a journalist and other suspects in the crowd. His 10th and last photo was one orange-flame frame of the explosion. **********In recent weeks, the police have seized about a dozen Indians and Sri Lankans, all believed to be linked to the Tamil Tigers. Those under arrest are suspected of organizing shelter for Shivarasan as well as the woman with the bomb. Other suspects are being held for setting up communications equipment and working on the bomb. **********Security officials in New Delhi indicate that Shivarasan may be seeking to flee to Nepal, but they believe that he remains in southern India, in hiding."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/29/business/credit-markets-job-data-are-not-expected-to-affect-fed-rein-on-rates.html": {"writer_name": "H.

The report is scheduled to be released Friday morning. **********But this is no ordinary period because no matter how many more nonfarm jobs vanished this month, the Federal Reserve last week repeatedly signaled that it had no intention of lowering interest rates in the foreseeable future. **********The signals were sent when the Fed intervened six times in seven business days to drain reserves from the banking system in an effort to prop up the Federal funds rate. Not only is the funds rate the only one that the Fed controls with any degree of certainty, but it is also the rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans and is the rate from which most other interest rates are scaled upward. Banks Amply Supplied **********Specifically, the consensus among money market analysts is that the Fed wants the funds rate to be 6 percent. That would make it the same as its discount rate, which is what the Fed charges banks for loans. But commercial banks have indirectly been sending their own signals -- that they are amply supplied with lendable reserves. Indeed, the Federal funds rate traded as low as 5.5 percent last week while the Fed was draining bank reserves. Last Friday, the funds rate traded at 5 7/8 percent for most of the day before briefly touching 6 percent at the close. **********As for the employment data due out before the markets open on Friday, consulting economists at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei Inc. believe that the figures will show another drop of 200,000 nonfarm jobs and that the nation's unemployment rate will thus rise by two-tenths of a percentage point, to 7 percent.  A More Narrow Focus **********But investors and traders in Treasury and other fixed-income debt issues tend to have a more narrow focus. Late last week, many credit market participants were speculating over what effect, if any, yesterday's meeting in Washington of the Group of Seven industrialized nations would have on interest rates and the value of the dollar and, by extension, values of Treasury and other fixed-income debt issues. **********The next tests of the fixed-income market are due on May 7, 8 and 9, when the Treasury will auction what is expected to be a record amount of notes and bonds. The Treasury will announce the size of the auction on Wednesday afternoon. **********In the Treasury securities market last week, two successful auctions were completed. One consisted of $12 billion of two-year notes and the other was $9 billion of five-year notes.  Rise in Price of Long Bonds **********One measure of the market's satisfaction was seen in the rise in price of the Treasury's benchmark long bonds. The offered price of the 30-year bonds rose to 96 9/32 from 95 29/ 29 during the week, while its yield declined to 8.20 percent from 8.24 percent. **********\"Perhaps the Bank of America sent the clearest signal when it reversed an earlier cut in its prime lending rate to 8.75 percent and lifted it back to 9 percent,\" said John G. Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service. \"Perhaps the big West Coast bank acted on the expectation that a near-term easing of Fed policy was significantly less likely than originally thought when it cut its prime earlier in the week.\" **********Major commercial banks have asserted that they have to rebuild their profit margins and become more prudent in their lending practices. Still, Mr. Lonski summed up the view of many money market analysts last week, saying, \"Until banks seek out loan customers more aggressively by way of narrower spreads between their prime rates and their basic cost of funds, this recession may be far from over.\"  A More Optimistic View **********A somewhat more optimistic view was offered by Eugene J. Sherman, senior vice president and chief economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. \"On one hand, the monetary policy has been, and is likely to continue to be, mildly restrictive,\" he said. \"For example, the growth of the money supply since 1987 has been half the rate of growth that prevailed in the prior 17 years. Looking ahead, we believe that the Fed will not squander the investment in conservative money management it has made over the last four years by easing excessively in the months ahead.\" **********But Mr. Sherman said he did expect an economic pickup to put some upward pressure on interest rates in the second half of 1991. The Federal funds rate, which has been ranging from 5.75 percent to 6 percent so far in the first half, may be allowed to go as high as 6.25 percent in the second half of the year, he said. He also expects the discount rate on 90-day bills to range from 5.85 percent to 6.20 percent in the second half. In recent weeks, the bill rate has moved from 5.90 percent to 5.65 percent. **********Mr. Sherman said he also expected long-term Treasury bond yields, as measured by the 30-year bond, to decline to 8 percent or 7.5 percent in the second half from the current level of 8.20 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/10/business/forum-wanted-an-investmentled-recovery.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence Chimerine", "pub_date": "1991-11-10", "snippet": "Last Tuesday's election results confirm what recent polls and confidence surveys have shown: Voters believe the recent downturn was far worse than many in the Administration say.

It is clear that there is substantial economic distress and that conditions are not improving. **********Some Administration officials now admit that the strategy of relying on the post-Persian-Gulf-war euphoria and the Federal Reserve to turn things around has not worked. The recent \"beat up on the regulators\" strategy will not work either. Pressuring banks to make more loans will have little or no effect because many banks are unwilling or unable to do so because of their high numbers of nonperforming loans and eroding capital positions. And economic malaise will most likely continue -- unless we speed the recovery process and simultaneously deal with our long-term problems, like weak productivity growth and the loss of international competitiveness. **********This can best be accomplished by generating a public and private investment-led recovery that emphasizes long-term investments to increase productivity and add capacity. Our investment needs are enormous: We must upgrade factory equipment, reduce dependence on foreign oil, upgrade our infrastructure and build communications and data-handling systems for the future. **********Creating an investment-led recovery will not be easy in light of weak profits, poor sales and the overleveraged conditions of many companies. And we must avoid programs that will widen the already mind-boggling budget deficit. **********Unfortunately, many proposals now on the table avoid the long-term problems, provide little stimulus and actually deepen the deficit. For example, the apparent centerpiece of the Administration's growth package is a reduction in the capital gains tax. But that would cut revenues over time by giving large tax cuts to those who had them in the 1980's and didn't sufficiently alter investment behavior and spur economic growth. **********An effective investment-led recovery program -- offering substantial incentives for new investment without raising the deficit -- should: **********1. Restore the old investment tax credit, which has an excellent track record in stimulating investment. A relatively large credit -- 20 to 25 percent -- is needed to provide a big incentive for new investment. Only investments in productivity-enhancing equipment that would be incrementally above the historical pattern of investment during a selected base period would be eligible. For instance, the average of investment during the last three years could be used, or 90 percent of average to allow for recession-related slippage. This means that the credit would not apply for most investment that would have occurred without it. **********2. Adopt a sliding-scale capital gains tax. This would incorporate a sizable increase in the capital gains tax rate on assets held for short periods, with the rate declining to almost zero for investments held five years or longer. The relatively low long-term rate would apply only to investments in productive assets and not to vacation homes and other unproductive investments. The new tax should apply only to new investments, to avoid losing substantial tax revenues for investments made in the past. This, plus the higher rate on short-term gains, will prevent any significant increase in the deficit. **********3. Incorporate tax changes to stimulate consumption and thus improve the investment climate. This can be done without widening the deficit by shifting the tax burden more to the upper income groups, providing purchasing power to those more likely to spend. Shifting the structure of personal income taxes (for example, Representative Dan Rostenkowski's proposal of new taxes and credits) or raising the Social Security wage ceiling and lowering the tax rate in a revenue-neutral manner, would achieve this objective. These changes would provide tax cuts for the majority of American families, provide a modest stimulus and make the tax structure more progressive. **********4. Increase public investment. A much-needed rebuilding and upgrading of our infrastructure is essential to accelerate growth and improve competitiveness. This can be financed by $10 billion to $20 billion raised by privatizing parts of government-owned energy facilities. For example, privatizing a small part of the Tennessee Valley Authority could help finance high-speed rail in the South. **********This program will help the economy in both the short and the long term without widening the deficit. And it would address the fairness issue more effectively than programs that have come from the Administration."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/26/world/gorbachev-appoints-new-finance-minister.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gorbachev Appoints New Finance Minister", "print_headline": "Gorbachev Appoints New Finance Minister", "body_text": " **********President Mikhail S.

The Government of Abu Dhabi and its ruler, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan, own 77.4 percent of the bank. The emirate protested the seizure of the bank in July, contending that it was not consulted and that the shutdown occurred as it was proceeding with a rescue plan for B.C.C.I. **********But Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, testified before a parliamentary committee on July 23 that one reason the British central bank pushed for a closing of B.C.C.I. was that \"representatives of the main shareholders\" were involved in the \"massive and widespread fraud.\" **********Representatives of Abu Dhabi insist that Sheik Zayed and his Government were vigilant in trying to get to the bottom of the fraud. Last December, the Abu Dhabi Government created a \"board of investigation\" composed of the emirate's financial experts and outside auditors to scrutinize the bank's troubles. **********\"The Government of Abu Dhabi has been investigating this matter for a long time in cooperation with other authorities around the world,\" said W. Caffey Norman 3d, a partner at Patton, Boggs & Blow, a Washington law firm representing the Abu Dhabi shareholders. **********The detention of B.C.C.I. executives began on Sunday, when about 20 officials were summoned to the bank's Abu Dhabi offices, questioned for seven hours in a conference room and then carted away in vans to an undisclosed place, according to a Reuters report from Abu Dhabi.

Top Officials Detained **********The bank executives being detained include top management personnel, senior regional executives and some internal auditors. It was not clear yesterday whether any of them were formally charged, nor how long they will be detained. Reuters quoted a banking source that it did not identify as saying that families of the executives were told that the abrupt detention was part of an effort to complete the B.C.C.I. inquiry quickly. **********American investigators were somewhat puzzled by the timing of the Abu Dhabi move yesterday. They noted that the central figure, Mr. Naqvi, has been in Abu Dhabi for the last eight months, essentially under house arrest.

Although Abu Dhabi has no extradition treaty with the United States, the Manhattan District Attorney's office is preparing documents to request that Mr. Naqvi be sent to the United States. **********One explanation for the roundup, a banker in Abu Dhabi said, is that Sheik Zayed, after some debate within the Government, has sided with the advocates of more forceful action in the B.C.C.I. case. A British court has given Abu Dhabi until December to decide whether to bail out the bank or allow an institution with more than one million depositors worldwide to be liquidated. **********\"They have to get to the bottom of the problem -- the size of the losses and the extent of the misconduct -- before they decide what to do next,\" the banker said.

On the Catholic side, the events have provoked disappointment and even exasperation. **********The actions surrounding the Glemp visit have also revealed contrasting and sometimes conflicting differences among Jewish groups about how to conduct interreligious conversations. On Monday, Seymour Reich resigned as head of the International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultations, protesting what he described as the group's inability to reach a consensus about meeting with Cardinal Glemp. The committee is an umbrella group of Jewish organizations established to carry on dialogue with the Vatican and other religious bodies.

A similar trip planned for 1989 was canceled after the reaction to his sermon raised the likelihood of demonstrations. **********The gesture by Mr. Reich, a past president of B'nai B'rith International, was a setback to extensive efforts by Catholic and Jewish officials to smooth the Cardinal's trip. **********On Aug. 23, the Cardinal made public a letter to Archbishop Adam Maida of Detroit expressing regret for having suggested in the 1989 sermon that Jewish demonstrators who scaled the walls of a convent at the site of the Auschwitz death camp intended harm to the nuns. He also called anti-Semitism an evil \"contrary to the spirit of the Gospel.\" **********Reversing an earlier stance, Cardinal Glemp has supported the shift of the convent to the site of a center for interreligious discussions, now being completed several miles from the former concentration camp. In January he also signed a letter from all Poland's bishops denouncing anti-Semitism and expressing sorrow for past injustices to Jews. **********Prominent Jews like Rabbi Jack Bemporad and Rabbi A. James Rudin, although believing that Cardinal Glemp has still not addressed other aspects of his 1989 sermon, said this week that his more recent statements and actions constitute sufficient \"first steps\" and evidence of good intentions. **********\"I don't see how not meeting with someone would in any way help the relationship between Catholics and Jews,\" said Rabbi Bemporad of Temple Israel in Lawrence, N.Y., who is co-chairman of interreligious affairs of the Synagogue Council of America, which represents Reform, Conservative and Orthodox Jews. Rabbi Rudin oversees interreligious affairs at the American Jewish Committee. **********Other leaders disagree with this \"quiet diplomacy\" approach. Besides Mr. Reich, Abraham H. Foxman, director of the Anti-Defamation League, said Cardinal Glemp should explicitly repudiate for each specific statement he made in his speech, including a historical reference to \"the Jewish innkeeper who got peasants drunk\" and a suggestion that Jews held the mass media at their \"disposal in many countries.\" **********Rabbi Avraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, who led the group invading the convent's grounds in 1989, said on Monday that he was going to pursue a suit for defamation against Cardinal Glemp. **********A paper for the visit written last month by Bishop Henryk Muszynski of Wloclawek, Poland, contrasted \"widespread development in the dialogue between Christianity and Judaism\" with \"increasingly disturbing statements in the United States against the church and the Primate of Poland.\" **********Bishop Muszynski's concern is considered significant because he heads the Polish bishops' Committee for Dialogue with Judaism and is known to be a major force in getting Poland's hierarchy to issue January's statement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/17/world/the-soviet-transition-dissident-is-seized-in-soviet-georgia.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1991-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 506, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DISSIDENT IS SEIZED IN SOVIET GEORGIA", "print_headline": "THE SOVIET TRANSITION; DISSIDENT IS SEIZED IN SOVIET GEORGIA", "body_text": " **********The Georgian Government authorities arrested the leader of the non-parliamentary opposition tonight, an aide said, after thousands of people demonstrated in the streets against the popularly elected authoritarian President of the Caucasus republic. **********President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who has declared Georgia independent of the Soviet Union, ordered a Moscow-bound plane carrying Georgi Chanturia, head of the National Democratic Party, to return to the airport in Tbilisi, where the police drove him and two aides away, according to one of his assistants. **********\"They were going to hold a press conference in Moscow on Tuesday,\" said Berian Bendelyani, reached by telephone at the party's headquarters. \"We don't know where they've been taken.\" The headquarters is on Tbilisi's Rustaveli Boulevard, which has been blocked by barricades for the last week by the growing opposition to Mr. Gamsakhurdia's rule.

Gorbachev's struggle to hold the polyglot Soviet empire together, the Azerbaijani people here perceive an old vendetta mushrooming in less theoretical forms. **********In the tree-shaded tea shop here, one of the centers of political life, they talk of threatened mountain water rights, tragically crossed ethnic roots and fear of the \"bearded ones\" -- the armed settlers and guerrilla experts who supposedly came from neighboring Armenia and made aggressive enclaves of the few remaining Armenian villages here in Azerbaijan. **********Such an aggressor's role and intent is denied by the Armenian republic, which charges that the Gorbachev Government unfairly sided with pro-Moscow Azerbaijani authorities in directing tank and troop attacks against two minority Armenian villages, Chaykend and Martunashen. **********The villages were flashpoints in a growing pattern of violence in which more than 30 people, including a number of soldiers and police officers, have died in recent raids and ambushes along the border. **********\"All this has deep roots and the invisible hand of the Kremlin,\" said Yusip Akhperov, a local Azerbaijani wary of the Kremlin's military support here lately even though it is directed against armed bands protecting Armenian villages. \"This struggle turns on the larger question of whether to keep the union.\" **********\"For us, you see, union has come to mean the same thing as prison -- a psychosis of propaganda in which the Kremlin fills our heads with their needs, not ours,\" he continued, sipping tea with a half-dozen colleagues.  'We Have to Believe' **********Vaghif Khasumu said across the tea table: \"No, no, we have believed in the union for years. We have to believe. Everything comes from the center.\" **********The Azerbaijani republic has endorsed Mr. Gorbachev's plan for maintaining union while the Armenian government has rejected it. **********The eruption of local village violence saw all the Armenians -- more than 4,000 people -- flee in a matter of days from the two remote villages, 30 mountainous miles south of here. Armenia charged that Soviet and Azerbaijani soldiers, trailed by local looters and rabble-rousers, used a passport check as a provocation to drive the Armenians out in a de facto resettlement. **********But the Gorbachev Government charged that Armenian gangs were the provocateurs in destabilizing the region and refusing to obey the Kremlin's year-old order to disarm. **********The village fighting was part of a pattern of violent resegregation, a great cross-stream of hundreds of thousands of Armenians and Azerbaijanis who began clearing out of each other's home republic because of rising conflict in which hundreds have been killed in the last four years. 100,000 Flee City **********This city of 350,000 itself echoed a year ago with the unrest of the anti-Armenian pogroms in Baku and saw at least 100,000 Armenians flee Gyandzha to safer ground in Armenia and Russia. Underlying all this is the ancient dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, the large Armenian mountain enclave within Azerbaijan, which, in the Gorbachev era of openness, has been pushing for incorporation with Armenia. **********Government authorities declared the two latest afflicted villages out of bounds to foreign correspondents, and details of this episode remain elusive beyond the initial account of heavy machine-gun fire and rocket attack spreading terror across the landscape. **********The two sides offer accounts differing in all crucial points and totally absolving themselves of blame. But as it now stands, the two villages emptied of Armenians are to be filled with Azerbaijanis who themselves were made refugees in earlier bouts of violence. **********In their conversation in the Gyandzha tea room, the men regularly cited past instances of intermarriage and coexistence with the Armenians. \"But since war has come here, it is better to answer to it,\" said Fikrat Babev. **********\"The Armenians thought Soviet power had become a toy, and now they know they were wrong,\" said Mr. Akhperov, betraying satisfaction with the Kremlin's suddenly active military role in this part of the inter-ethnic strife. But he still contended that the violence was more a phenomenon of modern Communism than ancient vendetta. \"We must remember we are 70 years behind civilization because of the Bolsheviks,\" he said, \"and right now Christian Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis are simply incapable of living as neighbors.\" Regional Leaders Meet **********MOSCOW, May 12 (AP) -- President Mikhail S.

These companies allow customers to reach their long-distance carriers at prices considerably lower than the access charges imposed by local telephone companies. Access charges account for about 40 percent of the cost of long-distance service. **********Over the long term, the measure represents an important step in chipping away at the near-total domination of traditional telephone companies in their local markets. Large corporations have begun to consider the newer services in developing local private networks to link their offices. Issues Are Unresolved **********F.C.C. officials said they considered the measure a priority although many issues remained unresolved, particularly those concerning rates that telephone companies would charge for making connections. **********The heart of today's proposal is a requirement that telephone companies with revenues greater than $100 million a year let the aspiring rivals set up switching equipment on or very near their premises. This will cover most local phone companies that serve mid-sized and large cities. At the moment, bypass companies account for less than 1 percent of the local telephone market. **********The measure will mean that a fiber optic company can run lines directly to the neighborhood switching stations and then use the telephone company lines to reach individual customers.  Deeper Market Penetration **********Under the proposal, the telephone companies will have to offer special rates that reflect the narrowed use. As a practical matter, the change will make it economically feasible for the bypass companies to penetrate much more deeply into local markets than they can now. **********At the moment, these rivals serve only customers who are connected directly to their fiber optic lines. These lines are analagous to superhighways: They are excellent for relaying heavy volumes of traffic along a busy corridor, but they do not offer the equivalent of backroads that reach throughout a community. **********Today's proposal will address this \"last mile\" problem by allowing new providers to run high-speed lines to the telephone company's neighborhood substations scattered around a city. Customers will use the telephone company only for a tiny segment of their service, and use the bypass company for the rest of the service. **********The proposal was greeted enthusiastically by Metropolitan Fiber Systems of Oak Brook, Ill., which operates fiber networks in 11 cities, including New York, and had proposed the new rule. \"Over all, we truly do applaud the F.C.C. on the action they have taken,\" said Royce Holland, chief executive of Metropolitan Fiber. \"This is a giant step in opening up this last bastion of monopoly control to competition.\" **********It was also applauded by long-distance carriers, including both A.T. &T. and the MCI Communications Corporation, which stand to benefit from lower access charges. \"This will speed the day when there are more choices for consumers at the local level,\" said John Houser, an MCI spokesman. \"This will speed the day when access charges will be lower,\" **********The regional Bell companies had mixed reactions. Some have long predicted that competition is inevitable, but some expressed concern about being forced to encourage competition when their prices reflect obligations imposed by state utility commissions. **********\"What we're worried about is that we're still restricted as to what markets we are allowed to expand into, while others are now expanding into our markets,\" said William F. Adler, executive director of Federal regulatory relations in the Washington office of the Pacific Telesis Corporation. Local Companies Restricted **********Unlike their new competitors, who can choose to provide service only through the most lucrative high-traffic areas, the local telephone companies are obligated by state and Federal governments to make service available to everyone in their jurisdictions and to keep prices for residential customer comparatively low. **********The upshot is that prices to residential customers are frequently artificially low, while prices for large corporate customers artificially high. **********Metropolitan Fiber Systems is considered the largest player, with plans to add nine operations by the end of 1992. Other significant providers are New York Teleport of New York City and the Institutional Communications Company in McLean, Va. **********Thus far, competing providers have tended to push down prices on business lines in the markets they have entered. Mr. Holland, of Metropolitan Fiber, said his company usually charged about 10 percent to 20 percent less than the local telephone company, but those prices were eventually matched. **********Mr. Holland said about 18 cities now had a competing provider of local telephone service and that the market would be saturated if his company simply expanded according to its current plan. If the rule is adopted, however, bypass companies would probably be able to generate profits in as many as 50 more cities. **********The F.C.C. took another action intended to lower customers' bills, this one for calls made from the United States to foreign countries. The F.C.C. has long contended that state-owned telephone companies in Europe and Latin America charge excessive prices for receiving calls and that these charges currently drain about $3 billion a year from the United States. **********In the action today, the F.C.C. ordered American long-distance companies to negotiate rates with foreign telephone companies that reflect the declining cost of new technology. If the negotiations do not result in lower rates, F.C.C. officials said they would consider prohibiting Americans from paying rates higher than those it considered fair. **********In moves concering radio broadcasters, the F.C.C. proposed relaxing rules that currently limit a company from owning more than 12 AM and 12 FM stations, as well as rules that bar a company from owning both an AM and FM station in one market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/14/business/business-and-health-the-drug-makers-defense-on-costs.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1991-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 748, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business and Health; The Drug Makers' Defense on Costs", "print_headline": "Business and Health; The Drug Makers' Defense on Costs", "body_text": " **********PHARMACEUTICAL executives jousted with Government economists last week over a draft report to Congress that questions the drug industry's main justification for charging thousands of dollars per patient annually for some drugs. **********The companies say they have to set high prices to recoup heavy costs of finding and testing a new drug and obtaining Food and Drug Administration approval. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a trade group, often cites a 1987 estimate of $231 million. **********Economists at the Office of Technology Assessment, a Congressional advisory bureau, said in the draft report that such numbers were unverifiable, if not meaningless. Critics say the estimates involve guesses about the rates of success and failure in finding new drugs, the time expended, and the cost, in theory, of borrowing money. **********At a meeting last week of the technology office's Advisory Panel on Pharmaceutical Research, drug industry spokesmen insisted that the high estimates were basically correct, even if they could not be verified. \"You do know the order of magnitude,\" said Judy C. Lewent, chief financial officer and vice president with Merck & Company, the world's largest drug company. **********\"Success rates are highly dependent on the state of knowledge about a compound at the start\" of a research project, said Jacob Stucki, who retired as vice president for research at the Upjohn Company. He said drug companies often had a \"much greater success rate with compounds acquired from outside\" laboratories. The up-front costs for such drugs and royalties later are not counted with research in company financial statements. **********Ms. Lewent and George B. Rathmann, the retired chairman of Amgen, a biotechnology company in Thousand Oaks, Calif., conceded that not enough was known about the cost of developing a drug. \"By the time you get the story right, it's out of date,\" said Mr. Rathmann, who has moved on to found Icos, a start-up biotechnology company. **********Another panel member, Lewis A. Engman, a Washington lawyer and former president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said that he had often cited the estimates of research costs, but that even ball park figures were enough to show that the number was large. \"Granted that there are many variables and we don't know what they are,\" he said, \"does it matter if the estimate is $250 million, or even $400 million?\" **********Nancy L. Buc, a Washington lawyer who is a former chief counsel with the F.D.A., identified the political stakes: \"If the number is seen as really big, it is less distressing to politicians to allow returns that are seen as perhaps too big.\" Otherwise, she said, Congress might decide to \"tinker with taxes\" paid by drug companies. **********At a time of rising alarm about health-care costs, these are not idle concerns. Robert B. Helms, a former executive director of the American Pharmaceutical Institute, an industry-sponsored policy group, said there was talk in Washington of adopting European-style controls on drug prices or even subjecting pharmaceuticals to \"public utility regulation.\" To discourage such ideas, he said, the technology office report should cite the savings that drugs permit by taking the place of even more costly hospital care. **********Economists say the companies spend heavily for research because the payoffs can be enormous. Ms. Lewent of Merck said increased profits would be \"chased by research and development costs\" as long as the companies had the money. Merck plans to spend $1 billion this year for research and development. Mr. Rathmann, who recently helped raise $30 million for Icos from investors, said they hoped for a return in 10 years of \"42 percent compounded.\" He added: \"If there had not been profitability, there would not be a biotech industry today. The products would not be out there.\" **********Dr. M. Leigh Thompson, a group vice president with Eli Lilly & Company, said medical needs, not economics, were the starting point for drug research. He added that spending on research and development by the drug industry, which was $9.2 billion last year, was less than 2 percent of the $676 billion in national spending on health care. **********Ms. Lewent said, \"The science opportunities that the industry now sees are orders of magnitude greater than have been seen for a long time.\" She added, \"The hard core issue\" is that pharmaceuticals are \"an industry that shows itself to be adding to social returns in a competitive environment.\" **********But Jeffrey Levi, a representative of AIDS Action, a patient advocacy group, said the Congressional technology office economists should ask: \"Are the companies producing drugs that are accessible to the people who need them?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/09/business/washington-memo-trade-issues-enter-crucial-political-phase.html": {"writer_name": "David Rosenbaum", "pub_date": "1991-04-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1429, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trade Issues Enter Crucial Political Phase", "print_headline": "WASHINGTON MEMO; Trade Issues Enter Crucial Political Phase", "body_text": " **********At their meeting Thursday, President Bush warned Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu that Congressional concerns over Japanese trade practices could damage the relationship between the two countries. In Houston Sunday, Mr. Bush presumably told President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico that American lawmakers would require Mexico to adopt stronger environmental measures and perhaps take other steps before Congress would accede to a bilateral free-trade pact. **********In part, this is an age-old dance: Lawmakers, prepared to accept a trade accord eventually, appease local interests by threatening to block the agreement. And Presidents, stepping in tune with the music, emphasize the Congressional threats when they try to win overall trade concessions from other countries. **********But these days, beyond the familiar two-step is a genuine political tension between the President and Congress, and it will reach a critical point soon after Congress returns today from a two-week recess. One of the most important orders of business will be the request by Mr. Bush that Congress extend his authority to conduct trade negotiations without line-by-line Congressional review. **********National leaders may disagree about the economic benefits of removing trade barriers, but few doubt that doing so leads to smoother diplomatic relations. President Bush, like every President since World War II, Republican and Democrat, has been a strong advocate of free trade. **********Members of Congress tend to be parochial. If tariffs or import quotas help businesses and protect jobs in their states and districts, lawmakers generally support them, regardless of their international effect. **********It is not coincidental, for example, that South Carolina's Senators -- Strom Thurmond, a Republican, and Ernest F. Hollings, a Democrat -- men who could hardly be less alike in temperament, politics and ideology, are the leading Senate opponents of renewed international trade talks. If those talks are successful, textile imports would probably increase, hurting a major South Carolina industry. **********Two big trade issues are on the table. The first is the resumption of international trade-liberalization talks, which broke down in December but seem ready to resume soon. The talks are held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The second is President Bush's desire to negotiate a free-trade pact with Mexico like the one President Ronald Reagan made with Canada. **********The outcome of both issues turns on whether Congress extends the \"fast track\" procedures, which will automatically be extended for another two years unless the House or the Senate votes by June 1 to discontinue them. Under these rules, in effect since the 1970's, the President must consult with Congress before entering into a trade agreement, and Congress has the authority to approve or disapprove the eventual agreement, but Congress may not amend it. **********An unusual Congressional coalition is trying to block extension of the rules: ***********Democrats who are on shaky ground after the Persian Gulf war and want to look tough on a foreign-policy issue. ***********Lawmakers from the Rust Belt who fear that a Mexican trade agreement would encourage manufacturing companies and jobs to move across the border. ***********Those from farm and textile states who believe the GATT negotiations will reduce the protection American farmers and textile companies now have. ***********Those (primarily from Florida and California) who want to avoid competition from Mexican fruit and vegetable growers. 'Point of Leverage' **********\"Fast track is the only point of leverage that exists now, because the Administration needs it to proceed,\" Representative Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, said in an interview. \"So all of us who oppose one thing or another have joined forces.\" **********Mr. Dorgan, who bows to few others in adhering to liberal principles, is worried about his home-state farmers. He is the principal sponsor of the House resolution to stop continuation of the fast-track rules. **********One anomaly is that the issue has pitted liberal Democratic politicians against the majority of liberal Democratic economists, who consider the law of comparative advantage as fundamental. This precept holds that a nation should specialize in producing and exporting goods that it can make at a relatively lower cost and import goods for which it is a relatively high-cost producer. **********\"Protectionist measures usually rob from the many to give to the few and harm the efficiency of the world economy in the bargain,\" wrote Alan S. Blinder, a prominent economics professor at Princeton, in his 1987 book, \"Hard Heads, Soft Hearts.\" **********Increasingly, politicians are taking issue with liberal economic doctrine. \"Academics are just out of touch with the everyday concerns of working families,\" a Democratic strategist said. \"They are indifferent to who makes the laptop computer on which they compose their free-trade arguments.\" **********Charles L. Schultze, a top economist in the Johnson and Carter Administrations who is now at the Brookings Institution, dismisses arguments like that with the observation that politicians invariably go out of their way not to inflict direct harm, even if the indirect harm they spread is much more severe. **********In the last decade, a small number of prominent economists, many of whom have ties to organized labor, have developed the view that free trade may be an outdated notion. After all, they note, Japan has fared pretty well with one of the most restrictive trade policies in the world. **********One of these economists, Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research center in Washington, says the law of comparative advantage only holds when there is full employment and thus a new job for anyone who loses one.  The Effect on Jobs **********\"When you look at the history of people who have been knocked out of jobs by imports,\" Mr. Faux said in an interview, \"they haven't climbed the ladder into better, more productive jobs. They've stayed out of work or moved down the ladder to worse jobs.\" **********For their part, politicians tend to be swayed by constituents, not theories. Take Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee. He has not been averse in his career to carrying the legislative water for important constituents, like oil and gas producers. Now he is a strong advocate of a Mexican free-trade pact. Why? Largely, his colleagues say, because the Texas border towns, among the poorest communities in the nation, would benefit from increased commerce. **********Mr. Bentsen, whose committee handles trade matters, is expected to call for a vote in the next few weeks on a measure sponsored by Mr. Hollings that would block the fast-track procedures. But Mr. Bentsen's colleagues say he will do so at a time when the Hollings measure is sure of losing rather than allow Mr. Hollings to bring it to a vote at a time more favorable to him.  Gephardt's Role **********On the other side of Capitol Hill, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, is a leader in the fight for trade restrictions. Mr. Gephardt comes from St. Louis, which is threatened with the loss of manufacturing jobs to Mexico, where the average wage is one-seventh of that in the United States. **********Over the years, Mr. Gephardt has metamorphosed from being a back-bench Congressman who rode the trade issue to prominence to being an unsuccessful Presidential candidate in 1988 who based his campaign on the trade issue to his current status as House majority leader with considerable influence over trade legislation. Many colleagues believe he is planning another run for the Presidency next year. **********Given President Bush's popularity and the support he enjoys on the trade issue from House Republicans, opponents of the fast-track rules have an uphill fight. They almost certainly cannot win unless Mr. Gephardt takes a prominent role, and even then the odds are against them. **********The prevailing view in the Capitol is that Mr. Gephardt will continue to speak out on trade, but that when push comes to shove he will probably back off and not support the Dorgan resolution. **********\"If Gephardt is going to do something to take on the President,\" said one Democrat who has talked to him about the matter, \"he wants to win. He doesn't want to go head to head with Bush and lose.\" **********Some lawmakers suggested that the Ways and Means Committee might bottle up the disapproval resolution so that it never reached a vote by the full House. **********\"They'd be complaining on the floor and thanking me in the cloakroom for not making them vote,\" said Representative Sam M. Gibbons, a Florida Democrat and a committed free-trader who heads the trade subcommittee. **********\"Down deep in their bellies,\" Mr. Gibbons said, \"they know free trade is the right thing.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/07/business/the-media-business-loss-at-tv-broadcaster.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Loss at TV Broadcaster", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Loss at TV Broadcaster", "body_text": " **********Pinelands Inc., the parent company of the television station WWOR, said today that it lost $2.1 million in the first quarter despite a 5.8 percent increase in revenues.

The Jews are black Africans and members of Beta Israel, or the House of Israel. In 1973, Israel traced their ancestry to biblical times, establishing their right to immigrate to Israel, but the Ethiopian Government barred their departure for political reasons.  Schedule Is a Secret **********Because of fears that the safety of the Jews could be imperiled by those who resent their free departure and envy the benefits that they have received from the Israeli Embassy while waiting to go, the schedule for their evacuation had been a closely held secret. **********The complex logistics for the flights had been in place for weeks, but Israeli officials said today that a letter from President Bush to the new Ethiopian leadership on Thursday provided the breakthrough that persuaded officials here to allow the Jews to leave all at once. **********Early this morning, Israeli relief workers went to the neighborhood where the Jews have been housed since being brought here beginning last August from traditional areas outside the capital. The Israelis entered the mud huts, waking families to tell them that the time had come for them to go.  A Moment of Panic **********A near panic broke out as the Jews were told to board buses for the Israeli Embassy, where they were assigned flights for the 1,800-mile journey to Tel Aviv. But Israeli guards in plainclothes and Ethiopian soldiers bearing Kalashnikov assault rifles and sticks managed to calm the crowd. **********Among the first aboard the buses to the airport was a boy born only a few hours earlier. The mother said she named him Israel. **********Demelash Aysheshin, a 21-year-old Ethiopian Jewish teacher, compared the exodus to the departure of the ancient Jews from Egypt, led by Moses. \"Isaiah's prophecy has finally been fulfilled,\" he said. \"All Israelites can now return to Canaan, the land of our forefathers.\"  'It's a Miracle' **********\"It's a miracle,\" said Asher Naim, Israel's Ambassador to Ethiopia. **********With the position of the Ethiopian Government deteriorating in the last month, the Jews had essentially become bargaining chips. Before his flight into exile on Tuesday, President Mengistu Haile Mariam ordered their emigration slowed, hoping to gain arms from Israel and perhaps aid from Washington in exchange for a controlled departure. **********Israeli diplomats said the bottleneck ended after President Bush sent a letter to the Acting President, Lieut. Gen. Tesfaye Gebre-Kidan, saying that the United States would help mediate a settlement to the civil war in return for the immediate emigration of all the Jews. **********In a last-ditch attempt to hold the line against the steady rebel advance and negotiate something other than an unconditional surrender, General Gebre-Kidan agreed, diplomats said. State Department and White House officials also pressed representatives of the rebels to halt their advance on the capital until the Jews were safely off the ground. The rebels reportedly agreed shortly before midnight on Thursday. Mass Emigration Began in 1984 **********The mass emigration of Jews from Ethiopia began with a clandestine airlift in 1984. In that effort, called Operation Moses, 12,000 Jews were relocated until disclosure of the operation brought Ethiopia under criticism from Arab neighbors, causing Addis Ababa to halt the airlift. **********The flow of Jews from Ethiopia resumed in 1989 at a rate of a few hundred a month, when Israel and Ethiopia restored diplomatic ties after a 16-year hiatus. Ethiopia cut off the flow intermittently in an effort to obtain Israeli arms. The current effort is called Operation Solomon, after the ancient King of Israel. **********Ethiopian Jewish tradition holds that the Jews descended from the leading families of Jerusalem who accompanied Menelik, son of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, on his journey to Africa. **********The origins of the Ethiopian Jews is still debated. Some biblical experts suggest that they are descendants from the lost tribe of Dan, while anthropologists say they might have migrated from Egypt or Yemen. In the 18th century, they faced the threat of death for their beliefs, but by the 20th century their freedom of religion greatly improved.  Religious Practices From Bible **********Their religious practices come from the Bible, and until recent years they were unaware of Jewish practices derived from the Talmud or relatively modern rabbinical teachings. Ethiopian Jews sacrifice goats and lambs at Passover, and Saturday Sabbath services incorporate rituals unknown to Jews outside Ethiopia. **********On one of the buses leaving today, an 18-year-old boy named David Degafan said that, once he reached Israel, he would study to be a doctor. \"In the letters we receive from our families, they tell us to come quickly,\" he said. \"They say Israel is a beautiful country.\" **********Around him, mothers dressed in ornate shawls and embroidered pleated dresses calmed their babies with tin cups of milk and water. A few men waved off flies with traditional swatters made from the bleached white hair of monkey tails. **********The Jews later huddled on the airport tarmac surrounded by Israeli guards with pistols tucked in their pants and larger-caliber weapons hidden in backpacks. As the Ethiopian Jews waited for their El Al and Ethiopian Airlines charter flights, in the distance Ethiopian soldiers unpacked sacks of grains from military cargo planes.  'You Have to Hold Their Hands' **********\"I am very anxious to see Israel for myself,\" said Shemlis Bitaw, a 65-year-old man who wore a copper hoop earring and a bright orange and green scarf around his head like a turban. \"I want to find a patch of land and plant cabbage as a farmer.\" **********Israeli officials said two planes an hour -- C-130's, Boeing 747's, Boeing 727's and Boeing 757's -- would work through the Jewish Sabbath until all the Jews were gone. **********Ethiopian Jews have worked as blacksmiths, weavers and potters.

Boschwitz, the former Minnesota Senator who was serving as the President's envoy to Ethiopia at the time and was charged with two missions: to try to arrange a conference between the Ethiopian Government and rebel groups and to deliver the letter, Mr. Fitzwater said. **********The conference will be held in London on Monday. **********The United States also had been working behind the scenes with the Israeli Government, Mr. Fitzwater said. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel telephoned Mr. Bush about 11 A.M. today, while the President was aboard Air Force One, \"to thank him for the American role in the release\" of the Jews, he said. **********\"We have been informed that the operation is proceeding smoothly,\" Mr. Fitzwater said, adding that Mr. Bush was \"delighted\" by the news. \"We want to express our appreciation to Acting President Tesfaye Gebre-Kidan of Ethiopia,\" he said, adding that the White House understood that the Ethiopian decision to allow the Jews to leave \"was taken in reponse to a letter from President Bush.\" **********Mr. Fitzwater said the United States had not talked to Israeli officials about where the Ethiopian Jews would settle.

They assert that Israel had no choice but to strike pre-emptively and to destroy the Arab air forces on the ground, opening the way to an incredible six-day defeat of Egypt, Syria and Jordan and leaving Israel in control of the Sinai, the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank of the Jordan and east Jerusalem. **********But the Arab nations deny that war was inevitable and argue that Israel's pre-emptive strike against them actually meant that Israel started the war and gained control over all that territory through aggression. Ambiguity Was No Accident **********Resolution 242, adopted in November 1967, was the result of months of negotiations in which the United States and the Soviet Union played major roles. It was an effort to come up with a document that met the Arabs' desire for the return of their captured lands, and Israel's insistence that it was now time for the Arabs to end their state of war with Israel and to recognize it. For this resolution to pass, it was necessary that it be ambiguous. **********The resolution calls for \"withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict.\" But because the resolution calls for withdrawal of Israel \"from territories,\" Arabs have remained free to insist that Israel must pull out of all of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. But the vagueness of the sentence also lets the Israeli Government say the resolution means only that they have to return parts of the occupied territories -- something they say they have already done by giving the Sinai back to Egypt after the 1979 peace treaty. **********In this, the Israelis are supported by Arthur J. Goldberg, who was the United States representative to the United Nations in 1967.

Quandt, a former National Security Council official and now an analyst with the Brookings Institute, a study center, said \"one thing everyone agreed on at the time was that the phrase referred to territories on each front of the war -- the Egyptian, the Jordanian and the Syrian fronts -- and was not just relevant to Sinai. **********\"Israel knew that perfectly well,\" he added. \"It was only when the Likud party came to power that it redefined it as only referring to Sinai.\" **********Israel's present Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, heads the Likud party that first came to power in 1977.  A Shot at Prevailing **********Since this week's peace conference is being framed around Resolution 242, the Israelis and the Arabs alike have agreed to attend, in part, because each believes it stands a chance to win vindication if its view of the resolution is transcendant. **********But the divergent views of Resolution 242 were never plainer than when Palestinian and Israeli leaders spoke about this on Sunday on the ABC News program \"This Week.\" **********Haider Abdel-Shafi, the Gaza Strip doctor who leads the Palestinian delegation, said Israeli \"withdrawal should be almost total from all the occupied territories.\" **********He continued, \"And the argument that the withdrawal from Sinai would be enough or it is substantial -- well, Sinai is one thing and Palestine is something else.\" **********But the Israeli Defense Minister, Moshe Arens, insisted that \"Resolution 242 talks about withdrawal from territories and not 'the' territories.

Please?\" **********[ In Washington, a senior State Department official said that not only had the Palestine National Council not met the original American conditions, but that the United States refusal to talk to the P.L.O. was also based on that group's support for Iraq in the Persian Gulf war.  ] **********Mr. Arafat said the Israeli conditions set down for the convening of a peace conference were unacceptable, but refused to say whether the conditions, if adhered to, would result in a P.L.O. condemnation of the U.S.-brokered meeting. Arafat Re-elected President **********The Israeli Government has demanded that any Palestinian delegation be part of a joint Jordanian delegation. Israeli officials refuse to meet with anyone formally linked with the P.L.O., which they brand a terrorist organization. The Israelis also refuse to accept Palestinian delegates from East Jerusalem or the notion of land for peace as a precondition for any conference. **********These demands were bitterly denounced by Mr. Arafat, who was re-elected president of the State of Palestine at the conference. **********\"If the American Administration, because of the Israeli lobby, says yes to Israeli conditions, fine,\" Mr. Arafat said, \"but I don't have to say yes.\" **********\"Give me an example in history when your opponent names your delegation?\" he asked. **********He said it was the job of the Americans to curb the demands of their \"spoiled, naughty baby Israel.\"  Jordan Could Be Partner **********Although he demanded that the P.L.O. name any delegation, Mr. Arafat did not rule out the possibility of a joint delegation with Jordan. **********\"This is still under discussion,\" he said. **********Palestinian officials in Algiers are optimistic that the P.L.O. will eventually sanction the participation of Palestinians in a peace conference. They also hope to wrest as much as they can from the Bush Administration during the preliminary talks now being held between Palestinian leaders from the West Bank and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. **********\"We give our hand as a brave people,\" Mr. Arafat said. \"We do not surrender to Israeli conditions, which our people and the people of the Arab countries refuse.\" No Demand on Settlements **********\"They want to make peace with whom?\" he asked of the Israelis. \"Qatar?\" **********Mr. Arafat, while calling for an end to the building of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, did not demand a freeze on the construction of settlements as a precondition for any conference. **********He said he was simply voicing his support for the Bush Administration's policy on settlements. **********\"When we call to stop settlements, we call to stop an illegal operation,\" he said. **********In an effort to reach out to liberal sectors in Israeli society Mr. Arafat praised a letter he received from 28 members of the Israeli Parliament expressing a desire for peace. Mr. Arafat said he knew there were leaders who did not share the hard-line position of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Housing Minister Ariel Sharon."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/19/business/briefs-972991.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 278, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt City of Hamilton, Ohio's $60 million water system mortgage revenue bonds, 1991 series A, will be priced today through Morgan Stanley & Co. *********** State of Connecticut's $72.7 million issue of general-obligation bonds, negotiated by Dillon, Read, will be offered one day this week.  * GE Capital Corp., Stamford, Conn., priced $99.2 million of tax-exempt securities, backed by installment contracts with state and local governments, through Kidder, Peabody & Co.

But the hottest travel destinations are swarming with tourists. Getting away from the crowds has become a mission impossible. And that's not the only price society is paying for the explosion in world travel. **********There is the sewage backup into the Mediterranean to consider and the desiccation of East African game parks because of heavy tourist traffic. Plan on venturing into the central valley of the Yosemite National Park in July or August? Your experience may be more akin to a stroll down Madison Avenue during lunch hour. **********The solution is simple, but hardly welcome: restricting access. Some United States national parks have already been forced to close temporarily during the day to allow crowds to thin. And such closures are likely to become more widespread. **********\"It used to be that if one area was built up, you could always move on to somewhere else,\" said Martin Brackenbury, president of the International Federation of Tour Operators in London. \"But increasingly we are not in a position to escape the mess we've created.\" **********The trend is playing into the hands of theme park owners. Disney World, for one, attracted more people than Britain last year. Last year, 28.5 million visited the park, making it the fourth-largest tourist destination after France, the United States and Spain. Many vacationers figure they can escape pollution, if not the crowds, yet get an enriching experience in Disney's ersatz foreign lands. **********The hotel industry has taken some pointers from Disney. To please -- and control -- the dense crowds, hoteliers and resort operators have learned how to simulate cultural experiences. A Calypso band evokes the spirit of the Caribbean, flamenco dancers give guests a taste of Spain. The gimmicks, used perhaps most heavily in the country of origin, lead some to question the authenticity of any travel. **********By at least one measure, tourism is the world's largest industry. While it is the third-largest household expenditure after food and housing in most industrial nations, it employs more people than any other single industrial sector, according to figures compiled by Wharton Economic Forecasting Associates. **********And it is growing fast. The industry, which includes spending on lodging, transportation and restaurants, has an infrastructure worth $3 trillion, estimates WEFA. In 1989, the latest year for which figures are available, the industry invested nearly $360 billion in new structures and capital equipment, up from $276 billion in 1987, according to WEFA. **********Today, the industry employs 112 million people, or one out of every 15 workers worldwide, and is expected to maintain a healthy 8.7 percent growth rate through 1992. The potential is clearly enormous, considering that only about 10 percent of all Americans hold passports. **********The growth is remarkable for an industry that is 40 years old. Before World War II, traveling for pleasure was the province of the rich, a characteristic that is still played up in advertisements. But improved standards of living and the ready availability of flights have enabled more people to indulge. \"The growth in tourism is a function of increased disposable income and increased leisure time,\" said Paul Turk, an analyst at Avmark, an air travel consulting company in Washington. **********The trouble is, too many people are converging on too few places. More than 425 million people -- about 10 percent of the world's population -- traveled from one country to another in 1989, according to the World Tourist Organization of the United Nations. Mr. Brackenbury estimates that half the world's population will be traveling by the year 2000. **********That kind of traffic has helped defeat an essential purpose of travel. \"Once tourists begin to show up, it immediately changes the character of the place and the original experience is gone,\" said Douglas Frechtling, associate professor of tourism at George Washington University. \"From then on, it's just a matter of degree.\" **********For example, the south of France, which millions of tourists visit every summer, has adjusted after a few disastrous years, when its infrastructure sagged under the strain and sewage overflowed into the once-azure sea. Now, the problem is sewage discharged from a growing fleet of pleasure boats, Mr. Brackenbury said. **********The east coast of Spain, known affectionately as the Costa Concrete in honor of its tourist sprawl, has also cleaned up its act. Benidorm, long considered the overbuilt nadir of the Spanish tourist industry, has won several awards for the cleanliness of its beaches. Spain derives 25 percent of its export earnings from tourism, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, a consulting group in London. **********But the Italian coast of the Adriatic Sea has never gotten over the publicity surrounding the sudden growth of brown algae in 1989. \"It was like swimming in brown mucous, not exactly anyone's idea of holiday pleasure,\" said Mr. Brackenbury. **********The problems of pollution are most noticeable at places whose draw is their supposed pristine condition. The Grand Canyon has banned small planes from flying below the canyon rim, but the local airport is still the third busiest in Arizona, after Phoenix and Tucson. And at the height of the summer, about a quarter of a million people crowd onto the floor of the Yosemite Valley every day. Duncan Morrow of the National Park Service said he sees more parks closing for increased periods, waiting for their parking lots to empty. **********Overseas, the garbage tossed out in the foothills of the Himalayas by tourists has become legendary. And some of the East African game parks are being turned into dust bowls by the tourists ferried around in four-wheel drive vehicles. \"You think you're seeing the animals in the wild, but by definition you're not because tourists are looking at them,\" said Dr. Frechtling. **********Circumstances like the destruction of the Brazilian rain forest, the depletion of the ozone layer and the oil spill in Alaska have driven home the fragile state of the world, sensitizing many to the adverse cultural, social and physical effects of tourism, he added. **********But even those places that have tried to control the growth of tourism, the demand to keep masses of people content in a confined area inevitably leads to an experience that is somewhat manufactured. So why not, the thinking goes, have an entirely manufactured experience. \"In a sense, the Montmartre experience is in the eye of the beholder,\" said Dr. Frechtling. **********Disney argues that in offering a small slice of a foreign culture, it will whet people's appetites for travel. Yet spending two weeks in Maui hardly represents a close encounter with traditional Hawaiian culture. **********\"The difference is that it's not in a compact area and not operated by one company,\" said Dr. Frechtling. \"The trick is to manage large numbers of people while giving them a quality experience that they will treasure when they go home. Disney does that very well.\" AMERICANS ARE STAYING TOO CLOSE TO HOME **********The crowds at Yosemite might be worse than usual this summer. That is the natural conclusion to be drawn from a recent survey of Americans' travel plans. **********According to the study, released last week by the United States Travel Data Center, a Washington-based consulting firm, Americans will make almost as many trips this summer as the nearly 326 million trips 100 or more miles from home that they took last summer. The recession -- and, to a lesser extent, safety concerns lingering from the war in the Middle East -- will keep people closer to home this season and force them to cut corners in other ways. More people are driving instead of flying, taking shorter vacations and staying with friends and relatives rather than in hotels, concluded the study, which is based on interviews conducted with 4,500 Americans over three months. **********International travel fell during the war, helping push International Leisure Group, a giant British holiday tour company, as well as Eastern Airlines into bankruptcy. While the war victory initially spurred Americans' travel plans, the recession quickly cooled their interest, according to separate surveys by the consulting firm of D. K. Shifflet & Associates in McLean, Va. In March, in the wake of the war, 76 percent of the 300 people interviewed said they planned to take at least one trip in the next six months, up sharply from 51 percent in February. But by April, that figure fell to 58 percent. **********\"The economy has been, in terms of domestic travel, a far greater factor than the war,\" said Richard Hebert, a spokesman at the American Automobile Association. \"Things got better in April, but the feeling is things didn't get better enough.\" **********In Hawaii, for example, incoming tourist traffic declined by 12 percent in April from a year ago, according to Gene Cotter of the Hawaii Visitors Bureau. That is a big deal for a state that earned 40 percent of its gross national product last year from its seven million tourists. \"It's recession-related and war-related, but probably more on the recession side,\" Mr. Cotter said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/23/world/war-in-the-gulf-war-summary.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 240, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "War Summary", "print_headline": "WAR IN THE GULF; War Summary", "body_text": " **********BUSH GIVES IRAQ A DEADLINE **********President Bush demanded that Iraq begin pulling out of Kuwait by Saturday noon or face an allied land invasion.

But the White House tactic, first sounded a week ago and reiterated yesterday by the President, stirred up a fuss this week among the supervisors, who insist that they are not at fault. **********Banks are not making more loans, regulators and bankers say, mainly because demand for loans has fallen and not because regulators have clamped down too much. In addition, many bankers acknowledge that they have voluntarily raised their credit standards in the last year or so to eliminate potential borrowers who might not be able to repay their debts. **********The Administration's position, spotlighted at a much-publicized White House meeting last week, is that excessively cautious regulators are inhibiting bankers, who then turn away too many customers.  Longtime Customers Hold Back **********\"I think the regulators are not being treated completely fairly at this time,\" said Robert Hawkins, president of Southern Commercial Bank in St. Louis and president-elect of the Independent Bankers Association, which represents many midsized banks. \"They are entitled to a portion of the blame. But bankers can't be busy making new loans when they are busy trying to collect bad ones already made. And we are not seeing many good loan applications. The good borrowers are holding back.\" **********Mr. Hawkins says, for example, that he would love to lend to some of the small machine shops and retailers in south St. Louis whose owners are his longtime customers. But they don't ask, he said. **********\"They've basically cut back,\" he said. \"I'm thinking of a guy I helped put into business 25 years ago: he has very little debt; he knows what he is doing. He makes pulleys for trucks and farm machinery. But he's not seeing strong demand, and he says the machinery he now has in his shop he can live with for a few more years.\" **********Indeed, a monthly survey of 2,000 small companies by the National Federation of Independent Business shows that only 36 percent are borrowing regularly from banks, one of the lowest percentages in a decade. The group says the biggest reason for the decline is that people are not asking for money because the economy is too weak. **********The White House, hwever, is putting the blame on bank regulators, much to the regulators' irritation. \"I respect the Bush opinion, but I happen to disagree with it,\" said Paul Fritts, executive director for bank supervision at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which not only insures deposits but also regulates small and midsized banks. \"The examiners can't speak out, and they are easy targets.\" **********His boss, L. William Seidman, the F.D.I.C.'s chairman, agreed. \"If we could cure the credit crunch by sending all the field supervisors on a world tour, we would,\" he said. \"It would be a very low-cost solution. There aren't that many supervisors, only about 8,000 of them.\"  Applying Pressure to Take Risks **********The White House campaign reflects the Administration's concern that the incipient economic recovery might fail to materialize in time for the 1992 election. The Federal Reserve has been pushing down interest rates, and might continue to do so, but the lower rates have not increased bank lending as they did in the early months of past recoveries. So the White House appears to be putting pressure on the banks -- largely through the regulators -- to take more lending risks. **********\"If we are going to get a pickup in economic activity, then that vast portion of the economy that depends on banks to finance inventories and receivables -- unpaid bills -- has to get credit, or the recovery could possibly stall out,\" said John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor and the chairman of the Fed's committee on bank supervision. **********Although Administration officials acknowledged in interviews that weak loan demand and timidity among bankers were factors in the credit crunch, the White House nevertheless made the regulators the focus of concern at last week's meeting of the President's Economic Council. Overregulation is also likely to be the theme at a White House meeting set for early next week -- in a fresh debate about who is most responsible for the cutbacks in bank lending: the bankers, the borrowers or the regulators.  Banks Buy Treasury Issues **********Rather than make loans, commercial banks have increasingly invested deposit money in safe Treasury securities, and more than $510 billion of these are now held by banks, an increase of $60 billion since the end of last year. The banks' outstanding commercial and industrial loans, on the other hand, have fallen gradually, to about $620 billion. **********The Administration, in effect, is jawboning the regulators first and the bankers second to reverse this trend. The chief beneficiary would be the thousands of small companies -- operations with annual revenue of less than $30 million and fewer than 100 employees -- that rely on bank credit to stockpile goods and to cover wages and other expenses until overdue bills are paid. **********\"A major cause of the credit crunch is overregulation, and there is no doubt about it,\" Robert A. Mosbacher, the Secretary of Commerce, said in an interview. \"The regulators are intimidating bankers, so that in many cases the bankers have not been able to use their experience to work with lenders.\"  Going Straight to Washington **********Somewhat less bluntly, other officials are suggesting that an appeals system might be created so that bankers could go over the heads of field supervisors, to top regulators in Washington. Or capital requirements might be eased; that is, ways might be found to make it easier for banks to meet a new standard, effective on Jan. 1, that will require them to keep on hand enough capital -- essentially cash in reserve -- to equal 7.25 percent of outstanding loans. **********To meet the requirement, many banks have called in loans or slowed lending in some areas. One is auto leasing, in which a bank, working through an auto dealer, purchased a car and then leased it to a consumer. Since many banks have withdrawn from this field, the business is going to huge private lenders like GE Capital, which has $75 billion in outstanding loans of various kinds. **********GE Capital is as concerned about creditworthiness as the banks are, said James A. Park, the senior vice president for finance. \"But we are finding that we can acquire safe lending segments, like auto leasing, that banks want to get out of,\" he said. **********Whatever the final decision on capital requirements, the Administration's effort is directed at getting the regulators to be \"more balanced,\" as John E. Robson, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, put it in an interview. \"We have a lot of incidents in which we believe the regulators have been too harsh,\" he said. \"And we also know that the bankers are willing to use regulators as an excuse when they don't want to give a loan.\" **********Susan Krause, senior deputy for bank supervisory policy in the Office of the Comptroller, which regulates large banks, shifted most of the responsibility for credit cutbacks to the bankers. \"They are getting out ahead of the regulators in their caution in making loans,\" she said, although she agreed that her field supervisors were sometimes overly cautious in one important area: valuing real estate that serves as loan collateral. Downgrading of Real Estate **********A developer might owe, for instance, a $900,000 construction loan for an office tower appraised in the late 1980's at $1 million. He might be making regular payments on the loan, but if the office building's value is marked down to $800,000 because of the current glut of unoccupied office space, the loan might be downgraded, particularly if future rental income seems problematic to the regulators. The downgrading can make a bank seem weaker than it may actually be. **********Bankers say that pressures from regulators make them gun-shy, even when dealing with someone like Harry E. Featherstone, chief executive of the Will-Burt Company in Orrville, Ohio, a manufacturer of metal parts for various industries. **********Mr. Featherstone last month obtained a $500,000 loan from Society Bank in Cleveland to buy a German-made laser that cuts steel. It was a big loan for a company with less than $20 million in annual revenue and $1.5 million in debt already outstanding. **********\"We went into immense detail with the bank, which we have not had to do before,\" said Mr. Featherstone, who remembered that in 1985 he once borrowed $3.5 million on his signature. \"We practically had to dissect the machine for the bankers and to explain how much it would save us. Now they call me every two or three weeks to ask me how things are going. They are nervous, and I don't blame them.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/05/world/guerrillas-in-peru-kill-16-in-capital.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1991-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 374, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GUERRILLAS IN PERU KILL 16 IN CAPITAL", "print_headline": "GUERRILLAS IN PERU KILL 16 IN CAPITAL", "body_text": " **********In this capital's worst massacre in five years of political violence, unidentified hooded gunmen invaded a downtown chicken barbecue here on Sunday night, shooting 16 highland Indians to death and wounding 4, the authorities said. **********Today, several police officials blamed the massacre on the Shining Path, a radical movement which first launched its campaign of bombings and violent attacks a decade ago. **********But one official in the Attorney General's office said the attack here appeared to be the work of a paramilitary death squad.

Some long-term Treasury issues rose more than 3/8 point, with the 8 1/8 percent bonds due in 2021 rising 14/32 to 97 23/32, to yield 8.33 percent, down from 8.37 percent yesterday. **********Price gains were smaller for shorter maturities, with five-year notes rising 7/32 to 100 19/32 and a yield of about 7.73 percent. As recently as July 24, the five-year issue was auctioned at an average price of about 99 30/32, to yield 7.89 percent. **********Although the volume of Treasury securities purchased by investors has not been heavy in the past week, securities dealers said the demand had been steady. Because securities dealers typically establish large \"short\" positions in advance of Treasury financings, meaning they sell securities they do not own, planning to buy them at the Treasury auctions, even a small amount of buying can cause prices to rise as dealers scramble to buy the securities needed to fill customer orders. **********\"The market has been fairly quiet, but there have been good consistent bids that keep prices firm,\" said Allan R. Leslie, vice president at the Discount Corporation of New York, a primary dealer in Treasury securities. He said the modest buying had been enough to keep traders and speculators from focusing heavily on signs of some strength in the economy, which is ordinarily bad for bond prices. **********For example, an increase of five-tenths of one percent in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators for June was shrugged off yesterday. While the increase was a reminder that the economy is now recovering from a recession, other data showed that the pace of the recovery remained slow. A 1.4 percent decline in new factory orders for June, and a drop in order backlogs of 1.1 percent are not enough by themselves to show that the recovery is faltering. But if orders and backlogs continue to fall, the recent increases in industrial production, which are key to economic recovery, may not be sustainable. **********The most important economic report for the credit markets, analysts said, will be the July employment numbers scheduled for Friday. A survey by Money Market Services, an economic analysis firm, showed that an increase in non-farm payrolls of 50,000 workers is expected. **********In the corporate market, prices of outstanding bonds improved modestly, in line with the Treasury market. In one sign of solid investor demand for new issues, underwriters led by Salomon Brothers increased the size of a 40-year debenture offering by Arco to $200 million from $150 million. The 9 1/8 percent debentures, which are not callable, were offered at 99.20, to yield 9.20 percent. **********In government agency financing, the Federal Home Loan Banks offered $100 million of three-year bonds at a yield of 7.31 percent, or 16 hundredths of a percentage point more than comparable Treasury notes. A $100 million five-year issue was offered at 8.02 percent, or 265 hundredths of a percentage point more than comparable Treasury notes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/07/business/company-news-japanese-criticized-by-chip-makers.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1991-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 490, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japanese Criticized by Chip Makers", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Japanese Criticized by Chip Makers", "body_text": " **********As Administration negotiators near a trade agreement with Japan on computer chips, Sematech officials said today that American chip makers faced long delays, or higher prices, in trying to buy advanced equipment from five Japanese companies. **********Chip makers in the United States have complained privately for several years about Japanese companies withholding their best technology from American buyers as a tactic for giving chip makers in Japan a head start in adapting their methods to the latest advances. **********The complaints came as trade negotiators from Japan and the United States are set to meet Wednesday and Thursday in Washington in a fifth session of talks on a new chip agreement to replace a five-year pact that expires this summer. Difficult to Prove **********Past accusations by American chip makers against Japanese equipment suppliers have proved difficult to verify, often because American companies feared Japanese reprisals, like order cancellations. **********But Sematech, whose members include 14 powerful domestic chip producers and users, said today that it had evidence that Japanese companies were withholding new technology \"as part of their nation's strategy for worldwide domination of the critical semiconductor industry.\" **********It said Hitachi, Canon, Nikon, Tokyo Electron and Dai Nippon Screen were making equipment sold openly in Japan that was either not available to manufacturers in the United States or available after months of delay. Sematech is the research consortium financed by Congress and large computer makers since 1988 to develop advanced methods for the American chip-making industry to overtake competitors in Japan. **********In a separate report completed last month, the Commerce Department said that the United States' share of worldwide sales for chip-making equipment had declined to 49 percent in 1988 from 75 percent in 1980, while Japan's share had risen to 39 percent from 18 percent in the same period.  'Negative Repercussions' **********The report said the domestic industry would suffer \"negative repercussions\" if allegations of foot-dragging in sales by Japanese equipment makers were true. **********The General Accounting Office is investigating the new Sematech allegations as part of a report on the semiconductor industry complaints it expects to complete by August.

Defending the outlay of \"a considerable sum\" -- more than 100 million rand -- to limit Swapo's election victory, Mr. Botha noted that South Africa had just fought a bitter counterinsurgency struggle against the organization.

W. de Klerk intends to ride out the scandal rather than give in to demands that some of his ministers be dismissed. **********Mr. Botha said the secret payments were part of a broader campaign against international sanctions, which he said had cost South Africa about $28 million over the last five years.

These politicians had maintained that the appeal of the fundamentalists had been damaged by what was described as their lack of success in administering local municipalities, where they won significant election victories in 1989. Watched by Neighbors **********Despite the stadium turnout, Government officials and many of the country's recently sprouted independent newspapers say they have no clues to the outcome of the elections, set to begin on Thursday. **********The Governments of neighboring Tunisia and Morocco, where Islamic fundamentalists have posed a significant challenge but have not been allowed free expression of their views, are watching the election here with some apprehension. They fear that it may bring pressure on them to democratize their systems and remove curbs imposed on the fundamentalists. **********The Algerian elections, in which 5,712 candidates are contesting 430 seats in Parliament, are also being watched with anxiety in the more distant reaches of the Arab world, where free and honest elections are very rare. **********Today's strong show of public support by the Islamic Salvation Front, and equally impressive gatherings staged by another important Islamic fundamentalist party, the Hamas movement, have caused some officials from the governing National Liberation Front to worry about the possibility of losing power by the time a second and decisive run-off is completed on Jan. 16. Hamas Stresses Democracy **********\"I think Islamic voters will overwhelm everyone,\" said Rashid Kheloufi, an adherent of the Hamas movement, which calls for an Islamic state in Algeria but, unlike the Islamic Salvation Front, has not advocated taking power by force and insists on assuming leadership only through democratic practices. No such assurances have been made by the Islamic front. **********The National Liberation Front has governed Algeria since it won independence from France in 1962 as a single party and is now widely discredited as corrupt and inefficient.

The fate of Romania's Jews, killed because they were Jews, was never acknowledged, although few other Romanian civilians died except in acts of war. **********The facts, widely known elsewhere, were never acknowledged here: that a great number of Jewish men, women and children were killed in pogroms of a brutality that sometimes shocked even the Germans, pogroms carried out by the Romanian military and the police. Or, the Jews worked, starved or froze to death in concentration camps established and run by Romanians. **********As a result, many Romanians have professed unawareness that the killing of the Jews was also a Romanian matter. **********\"They were murdered twice,\" Chief Rabbi Moses Rosen said in an address in the ornate Choral Synogogue. He poured into it all the passion pent up in the years beginning with the Bucharest pogrom of January 1941 -- a total of 400,000 deaths that could be spoken of only abroad or to Jewish audiences here.  Cabinet Members Attend **********\"They were murdered in the Holocaust of the Jewish people, and we were forbidden to weep for our dead,\" said the Rabbi, who is now 78 years old. **********The ceremony today had the blessing of the Government of President Ion Iliescu and Prime Minister Petre Roman, although neither attended. Mr. Iliescu had agreed to speak, but he and Mr. Roman went to Prague for the final meeting of the Warsaw Pact leaders. **********Both sent messages of sympathy through senior associates, and Mr. Iliescu had a wreath placed at the monument in the synogogue's forecourt. Several Cabinet members attended, and the head of the governing National Salvation Front, Ion Aurel Stoica, spoke, calling the fate of the Jews \"a tragedy for the whole Romanian people.\" **********Rabbi Rosen drew gasps followed by ringing applause for the candor with which he condemned the Government's inaction in the face of open anti-Semitism. He said he had told Mr. Iliescu and Mr. Roman that there was an atmosphere of \"terror and fear.\" **********\"You can't fight fascism with fear,\" he said he told them. \"This is the time of truth.\" He demanded that people here be told of the full Romanian role in the killing of the Jews and denounced the recent rehabilitation of Marshal Ion Antonescu, the wartime leader and ally of Hitler, who was executed as a war criminal.  The Danger of Fear **********\"The Government is afraid, I'm sorry to say,\" he said. \"It can be fatal to a young democracy.\" **********The Rabbi said that in recent days, Romania's lower house of Parliament had struck the word \"anti-Semitism from the draft of a police law that would bar \"racism, anti-Semitism, fascism and xenophobia.\" The Romanian Senate has restored it, he said, but the lower house has not acted a second time. **********The monument, unveiled with patriotic music by a military band, is a stark bronze candelabra posed on a block of marble, whose inscription specifies that 400,000 Jews fell victim to \"German, Romanian and Hungarian fascists.\" **********Along a wall flanking the forecourt, separate tablets were put up listing the various places of death and the numbers of those killed. Mr. Wiesel unveiled the plaque commemorating the 130,000 Jews of his native northern Transylvania, which Hitler detached from Romania in 1940 and incorporated into Hungary. **********Mr. Wiesel said he had come because Rabbi Rosen had told him of the new wave of anti-Semitism. **********\"I address my words to the leaders of this country,\" he said. \"I hope you know that your representatives have great difficulties in the world to mobilize sympathy, political and economic support for your country. Your image is not the best. You must know that. **********\"You must know that unless these anti-Semites are shamed in society, you will suffer. You will be isolated. The world is following this with astonishment, dismay and outrage.\" A Warning to Enemies **********American Jews, notably Israel Singer, general secretary of the World Jewish Congress, and Rabbi Arthur Schneier of the Appeal for Conscience Foundation, denounced the new wave of anti-Semitism. Mr. Singer challenged those \"who think it's open season on Jews again.\" **********\"Take heed!\" he said. **********Mr. Wiesel closed with an appeal to Romanians. Much of his writing, he noted, draws on his hometown of Sighet, in the Carpathian Mountains. Despite the end of his childhood, which took him from Sighet to Auschwitz, he said, \"I somehow think about it with fondness.\" **********\"I plead with you,\" he said. \"Allow me in the future, too, whenever I speak of the geography of my childhood, to speak of it with fondness.

Bakatin Chairman of K.G.B. **********Vadim V. Bakatin, who takes over the K.G.B. without any known background in the intelligence and internal security agency, is among the most liberal figures in the Soviet leadership. His appointment appears to presage a major overhaul of the agency and the dismantling of much of its secret police operations, American officials say. **********Administration officials expressed enthusiasm for Mr. Bakatin's appointment, characterizing him as a man of great intelligence and candor who has repeatedly shown loyalty to the cause of reform even when his progressiveness stood in the way of his career advancement. **********Mr. Bakatin had been one of the main proponents of glasnost and perestroika until he was dismissed as Interior Minister late last year during a resurgence of the right in the Communist Party. He is known as an proponent of due process of law and of radical economic reforms, including the attraction of foreign investment and the steady elimination of subsidies and price controls. **********\"He is going to clean up the K.G.B., no doubt about it,\" said an Administration official who monitors Soviet intelligence agencies. \"He'll get rid of the cowboys and insist the K.G.B. follows the law.\"  Promoted U.S. Exchanges **********As Interior Minister, Mr. Bakatin promoted personnel exchanges between his ministry and the United States Justice Department, as well as between Soviet and American local police forces. **********Condoleezza Rice, a political scientist at Stanford University, said, \"He sought out Western ideas on how police forces should behave in a democracy.\" Ms. Rice, who met Mr. Bakatin briefly last year when she served as a staff member in the National Security Council, said, \"He is open and outgoing and easy to talk to.\" **********A civil engineer by training, Mr. Bakatin comes to the K.G.B. as an outsider to the security force, although he has spent most of his career in law enforcement. As Interior Minister he worked closely with the K.G.B. fighting crime and corruption, but Western analysts said he had never been a member of the K.G.B. and had no known record of political repression. **********Born in 1937 into a middle-class family in the Siberian coal mining town of Kiselevsk, Mr. Bakatin graduated from a technical institute and worked on several construction projects before he went to work for the Communist Party in the early 1960's.  Taste for Things Western **********He is known for his taste for things Western -- ranging from his love for tennis to a fondness for be-bop jazz, the Beatles and Elvis Presley. **********Mr. Bakatin worked his way through the ranks of several regional party organs before he was promoted by Mr. Andropov to be an inspector of the Communist Party Central Committee. He returned to regional party work in 1985, serving as first secretary of the party in the cities of Kirov and Kemerovo. **********His active support for Mr. Gorbachev led to his appointment as Interior Minister in 1990. Though he was removed from his post, he continued to serve as a member of the Soviet Security Council. **********In an interview with the Soviet press in May, Mr. Bakatin identified himself as a \"radical centrist.\" **********Mr. Bakatin ran against Boris N. Yeltsin for President of the Russian federated republic, campaigning for even more radical change, but came in third place in the election.  Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov Defense Minister **********Col. Gen. Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov, the new Defense Minister, had been commander of the Soviet Air Force, and his refusal to obey orders from the coup committee helped bring about its downfall. **********One of his first acts as Defense Minister was to resign from the Communist Party. **********Administration officials said they were pleased with General Shaposhnikov's appointment because he seemed to be the kind of officer who would support a sweeping reform of the Soviet economy and reducing the size of the Soviet military. In speeches over the last year, they said, he has argued in favor of giving priority to economic development as a matter of national security. **********American officials compliment him for accepting the demise of the Warsaw Pact as a development that could not be avoided, and they say they believe that he will work to remove Communist Party influence from the armed forces. \"He can be expected to move toward a smaller, more professional military,\" an Administration official said. Approved by Yeltsin **********A State Department official said his appointment was approved by Mr. Yeltsin because \"Yeltsin believes he will support what needs to be done to the military, a reduction in the size and a conversion to an all volunteer force.\" **********Stephen Foye, an analyst of the Soviet military for Radio Free Europe, said General Shaposhnikov \"is very forward-looking.\" **********\"He has spoken very favorably of increased competition in the defense industries,\" he said. **********An American military intelligence official described the general as \"hard-charging, a fighter pilot's fighter pilot.\" He reportedly works about 75 hours a week, but is also known for hard living, including chain smoking and hefty eating.  Unusually Young for Post **********At age 49, he is unusually young to have risen to the Soviet high command, a point American analysts make to explain his fresh approach to many issues. He was born in 1942 in a small Russian village to a working-class family. At age 21, he joined the Communist Party and graduated from the Kharkov Aviation Institute, after which he served as an air force pilot. **********After serving in East Germany, he was appointed first deputy commander of the air force in 1988, and then was elected to a seat on the Communist Party Central Committee. He was promoted to air force commander in July 1990. His principal priorities for the service were better training and more efficient and economical equipment. 'Substantial Cuts' Seen **********\"His appointment probably means a more rapid transition that could bring substantial cuts in the armed forces and less holding back by the old guard,\" he said. **********General Shaposhnikov's ascendency does not mean that conservatives will no longer have a place in the military. **********His new principal deputy, the General Staff chief, is Gen. Vladimir Lobov, a hard-liner who has long called on the Soviet Union to seek military superiority over the West. Last posted as Chief of Staff of the Warsaw Pact military alliance, he is one of the Soviet Union's leading strategic theorists. General Lobov, who is 56, has tended to bend his political philosophy with the leadership and has not overtly opposed President Gorbachev. **********The new No. 3 man in the armed forces, the Deputy Defense Minister, is Lieut. Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, 43, a liberal. As commander of Soviet paratroops, he refused to deploy his forces in support of the coup committee this week. He served for five years in Afghanistan during the war, an experience that apparently made him skeptical about deploying military force abroad. Viktor P. Barannikov Interior Minister **********Viktor P. Barannikov, the new Interior Minister, is a close ally of Mr. Yeltsin, who has long worked to make the Russian police independent of the central Soviet authorities. **********In his former post as chief of the Russian federation's Interior Ministry, Mr. Barannikov concentrated on criminal investigations and eradicated Communist Party cells from his agency. Administration officials said they expected him to continue his reform policies. \"His priority will be to make an effective crime-fighting unit out of the Interior Ministry as opposed to an instrument of internal repression,\" an Administration official said. **********Mr. Yeltsin promoted Mr. Barannikov, who at the time was first deputy minister of internal affairs in the Russian republic, to become the chief police officer in his Government late last year. Least Known to Washington **********Of the new appointees, he is the least well known to the Bush Administration. A State Department official said it was not even known whether he is married or has children. He is believed to have been born in 1941, and he has been involved in regional and national police work since 1961. **********American officials said they were pleased about his appointment because he struggled in his former post against hard-liners in the Soviet Interior Ministry who wanted to subordinate his agency. He insisted that the militia of the Russian federation be commanded by Mr. Yeltsin and not by Moscow."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/14/business/top-japanese-executive-to-step-down.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1991-01-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 291, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Top Japanese Executive To Step Down", "print_headline": "Top Japanese Executive To Step Down", "body_text": " **********Seiji Tsutsumi, founder and chairman of the Saison Group, said Saturday that he planned to step down from active management of the large Japanese conglomerate and hand over authority to a collective leadership. **********Mr. Tsutsumi, 63 years old, has been slowly withdrawing from day-to-day management of Saison, which operates Japan's largest department store chain, Seibu.

Other attacks came at the hands of low-ranking Kuwaiti troops and armed civilians at roadblocks. **********\"We're putting severe pressure on them that 'you don't want to look like Iraqis,' \" said Col. Ron Smith of the 352d Civil Affairs Command, which is working with the Kuwaiti police. The command has taken over much of the day-to-day running of Kuwait and is also giving advice on the reconstruction of the country.  Palestinians Abducted and Slain **********The pressure, say diplomats and Palestinians, appears to have made a change from the early days of liberation, when resentment of the Palestine Liberation Organization's support for Iraq led to abductions, beatings, arbitrary jailings and at least 10 deaths, according to accounts by human rights organizations, journalists and Western diplomats. Many Palestinians, who served as the major work force here before the war, were rounded up and expelled from the country. **********Nevertheless, as recently as last Wednesday night, Lieut. Col. Ed McCarty, a legal officer with the Civil Affairs Command, found the bodies of two men identified as Palestinians in a garbage dump. **********There was \"clear evidence of their having been tortured before they were killed,\" he said. **********\"What really upsets us is the indifference to finding the murderers,\" said Colonel McCarty, a reservist who is a Nassau County judge in civilian life. \"These bodies cry out for justice.\" **********Ambassador Edward Gnehm of the United States is known to have personally warned Crown Prince Saad al-Sabah that human-rights abuses against Palestinians and other foreign Arabs would lessen international support for Kuwait. **********\"There is credible information there have been some abuses,\" Mr. Gnehm told reporters. \"I have furnished the Government with the names of places and people. The Government has never denied that these things are going on.\" Crown Prince Warns Family **********The Crown Prince, a diplomat said, has warned the group of younger sheiks in the Sabah family that if their activities continued, he would \"hang them from the lampposts.\" **********A Western diplomat working closely with the Kuwaiti Government said; \"We're not getting the same number of reports of detentions. Some of the things we've been trying to press on the Government have been working.\" **********Top-ranking Palestine Liberation Organization officials here, meeting privately a few days ago with a long-serving European diplomat, said that the situation appeared to have improved over the last two weeks and that they did not want to make any public statements for fear of stirring up trouble. **********United States Army officers have several times dissuaded the Kuwaitis from conducting an armed sweep through the main Palestinian neighborhood, Hiwali, to search for weapons, believing that it would almost inevitably lead to gunfire and deaths. **********The Hiwali district -- called \"Little Palestine,\" the home of the middle-class professionals, technocrats and Government servants who once kept Kuwait functioning -- is a tense, fearful place these days, surrounded by roadblocks and barricades of bulldozed earth. **********As Palestinians stood in a long bread line the other day to get five round pieces of Arab bread -- half the ration of Kuwaitis -- a few came over to whisper to a reporter of beatings of their relatives. \"They are taking the Palestinians and dumping their bodies in the desert,\" a man said, looking nervously over his shoulder. Vendettas Become Apparent **********The attacks on Palestinians, predictable in this part of the world where tribal vendettas are a way of life, became apparent soon after American-led allied forces chased the Iraqis away. **********A Western diplomat briefing journalists soon after liberation told them there had been no human-rights abuses, then listened in mounting dismay as journalist after journalist around a long table gave accounts of what they had seen and heard. **********Some reporters found bodies dumped in vacant lots. Others saw Palestinians being beaten at roadblocks. Palestinian doctors and nurses in the hospitals told of beatings and deaths, and gravediggers of nameless bodies buried in the cemetery. **********The human-rights group Middle East Watch estimates that at least 10 people were killed, possibly more, and some 2,000 abducted or imprisoned. Diplomats gave credence to the report. **********A major goal of the Army's civil affairs team from the planning stages, along with Special Forces troops serving as advisers to the Kuwaiti Army, officers said, has been to try to protect the Palestinians and others from vengeance. In one case, Colonel McCarty recalled, Special Forces troops saved a prisoner from a mob trying to kill him, while in others they stopped beatings or torture. Astonishing the Authorities **********\"Frankly, we've been very, very fortunate because the Kuwaiti society is so passive,\" said Colonel Smith, the police adviser. \"Which is not to say that there haven't been bodies turning up.\" **********In many cases, the Americans' insistence on such niceties as due process seems to be met with amused astonishment. **********As Colonel Smith and Sergeant Damico made their rounds the other day, a police general stared at them, stroking his mustache, his impassive face sometimes betraying the hint of a shrug as he listened to reports of alleged police misconduct.

Those are key characteristics of the work done by the San Francisco-based agency for clients like Royal Viking Cruise Lines, the National Basketball Association and The San Francisco Examiner. **********Finlandia's new campaign is the latest change in ad plans in the fiercely competitive $450 million market for imported vodkas, one of the few types of liquor still enjoying sales growth. **********Last month, Stolichnaya, the Russian brand that outsells Finlandia but lags well behind the leader, Absolut from Sweden, introduced a radically revamped campaign from Calet, Hirsch & Spector based on puns like \"Stolar system.\" And later this month, Wyborowa, the Polish vodka that Joseph E. Seagram & Sons hopes to build into a best-selling brand, will introduce a revised campaign from DDB Needham Worldwide with the theme \"If you can't say it, you can't have it.\" (It's pronounced Vee-ba-rova). **********Finlandia's previous campaign \"wasn't provocative enough,\" said Chester Brandes, president of Finnish National Distillers (ALKO) Inc., in an interview yesterday. His company markets Finlandia in the United States. \"In this category, you need some really terrific advertising to get people interested,\" he added. The previous campaign, with the theme line \"The final word in vodka,\" used pun-filled presentations like the headline \"The Finnish line\" next to a line of Finlandia bottles. **********Research showed that consumers' reaction to the \"Finnish\" references was to say, \" 'Drink up, it's closing time,' \" joked Andy Berlin, principal and managing director of Goodby, Berlin, who joined Mr. Brandes for the interview. Still, linking the brand and its country of origin is a smart strategy, Mr. Berlin said, because once consumers learn more about Finland, \"they like it. They say, 'Way up north, cold, pure . . . That's a good place for a vodka to come from.' \" **********So the new campaign dubs Finlandia \"vodka from the top of the world.\" The first three advertisements, photographed in Finland, have striking shots of frosted landscapes and ice-blue skies.

The company said that because of past trends, it expected traffic to double worldwide over 15 years. Figures Under Scrutiny **********Some analysts questioned Boeing's optimism, noting that even short-term predictions have been difficult because of unstable fuel prices and huge drops in traffic because of fears of terrorism. They noted that strong carriers like American, United and Delta had shown unexpectedly heavy losses in the fourth quarter because of the big increase in the cost of fuel and a downturn in traffic. **********\"They're a little too optimistic with respect to the number of aircraft to be delivered and the financing that would be available,\" said Peter L.

Gorbachev. **********Soviet Army tanks and troops moved against Lithuanian independence demonstrators Monday morning with a brutality recalling brutal episodes of Bolshevik autocracy. They left 14 dead, as well as the clear and frightening implication that, at a critical moment in Soviet history, Mr. Gorbachev, like his predecessors, ultimately chose to sacrifice notions of change and popular free choice to satisfy cravings for a sense of order that continue to be expressed in corridors of the Kremlin, and in much of the exhausted empire that lies beyond. **********Today, Mr. Gorbachev said he learned of the deadly assault after the fact and he contended the Lithuanians themselves were to blame in bringing down the army on their heads. His ministers attempted to spare him personal blame, contending that there was no direct order from the Kremlin for the attack. **********They talked as if the central Government's army had somehow come under control of a hurriedly cobbled Communist front group in Lithuania that operated with neither the knowledge nor blessing of Mr. Gorbachev's office. Question of Responsibility **********Such an explanation only further sapped Mr. Gorbachev's faded prestige. For by any logic, he had to be either responsible or irresponsible in the Vilnius tragedy. Either he had opted to demonstrate the Kremlin still has fist enough to retain the old Czarist empire, or he had let the critical issue of domestic sovereignty and peace slip from his hands into the clutches of a still vague coterie of local military officials and loyalists of the Communist patronage machine in Lithuania. **********Either way, Mr. Gorbachev's image as the herald of national change was badly tattered. The powers of persuasion that he had demonstrated as the one-time optimist of perestroika were shown to have evaporated as his government turned more to force. **********In the case of the Vilnius attack, Mr. Gorbachev, who had been unavailable to the alarmed Lithuanian leadership at the height of the confrontation, waited more than 36 hours after the event to comment. And when he did, he spoke as if he had been on the sidelines, observing violence he contended was unavoidable because of the Lithuanians' refusal to abandon their independence claim. **********The effect could not be reassuring to Mr. Gorbachev's supporters in the world, including President Bush, who watched for evidence that he is both on top of events in his nation and keeping some distance from the more hard-line elements within the army and party, and other institutions of the Soviet system that he once vowed to transform through democracy. **********The Gorbachev Government's action in Vilnius comes at time when he is trying to deal with two contrary forces in the nation. One is the increasing need to project a sense that someone is ultimately in charge amid the daily morass of political and economic uncertainties. The other is the insistence from the 15 Soviet republics that they must have far more self-rule if the union is to have a chance of healthy survival and popular support. **********Between these pressures, Mr. Gorbachev, even in days when his prestige was higher, has always backed the concept of the current centralized union and insisted the constitutionally guaranteed independence for the constituent parts was an unthinkable option, even for the Baltic republics that were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. **********The action in Vilnius, in accord with this position, stood as a demonstration, frightening to the other Baltic lands and separatist republics elsewhere in the country, that eventually the army will still be used to defend the Kremlin's political will. Only a Partial Coup **********But for Mr. Gorbachev, the political mess has only been compounded by the use of tanks. On the pragmatic level, the Soviet military did not fully carry out a coup in Lithuania, for it left the elected Parliament still sitting in Vilnius and apparently more popular than ever. If the present confusion of authority continues there, the Kremlin may feel further threatened by a growing popular suspicion that it has grown so inept that it can no longer even impose martial law. **********The Soviet leader also suffered politically by severely embarrassing the more independent and influential members of his new Federation Council, an advisory committee of the 15 republic leaders that Mr. Gorbachev crafted last month in an attempt to regain some credibility among the sovereignty-hungry republics. He had invited them to come forward as political mediators during a smiling Kremlin meeting even as the Soviet military was preparing for its night raid in Vilnius. **********This was the worst possible beginning for his promised new era of more open and conciliatory relations with the republics. With military force now an established option in his political dealings, the deaths in Vilnius mark a new, far tougher time in Mr. Gorbachev's once-promising reign."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/17/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-944991.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-06-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; People", "body_text": " *********** Joseph Philport has joined Young & Rubicam Advertising, New York, as senior vice president and director of media research worldwide.

NCR is exchanging $520 million worth of A.T.& T. stock for the company, the Teradata Corporation. **********Teradata made its name in managing data, and its largest customer is the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which last year spent nearly $100 million on its services. It is one of the largest and fastest-growing companies in the field. **********A.T.& T. now uses Teradata systems to keep track of long-distance customers' addresses, telephone numbers and billing charges, as well as for market research. Teradata also handles some of A.T.&T.'s financial chores, as well as \"network provisioning,\" which governs how the telephone network is repaired and maintained. **********Based in El Segundo, Calif., Teradata designs computer systems that use parallel processing to divide up big tasks into many smaller ones so they can be solved simultaneously, and therefore more quickly. For an analogy, say someone is asked to look through a 52-card deck and find a royal flush. Thirteen people with four cards each can do it in less time. **********But breaking up a problem into these smaller tasks is difficult, so the parallel-processing market has remained tiny compared with the multibillion-dollar market for huge mainframes made by companies like I.B.M. Most of Teradata's customers come from the 200 largest corporations in the country. For example, American Airlines, the nation's largest airline, uses a Teradata system to administer its frequent-flier program. **********Teradata's systems, like the company's top-of-the-line DBC 1012, can cost up to $20 million. Like the computer system, the company's name comes from the exponential term meaning 10 to the 12th power, or one trillion. A terabyte, meaning a trillion bytes of data, is equivalent to three million copies of \"The Great Gatsby.\"  Analysts Not Surprized **********Analysts did not find the deal surprising. \"Ever since A.T.& T. considered buying NCR, it was only a matter of time before it bought Teradata,\" said Wayne T. Kernochan, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group, a computer and telecommunications industry research firm in Boston. \"NCR and A.T.& T. had to steal a march on the high end, to make some technical leap, like parallel processing.\" **********But Mr. Kernochan speculated that A.T.& T. could someday apply parallel processing to telephone switching systems, like the huge modernization program involving Signaling System No. 7, which could make \"picturephones\" and other complicated digital telecommunications possible. \"If the Teradata deal works out, boy is it worth it,\" he said. **********A one-time restructuring charge and disappointing sales in the September quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30 forced Teradata to consolidate some of its operations and lay off 200 workers, or 12 percent of its work force. Teradata improved in the subsequent three quarters, although not enough to post a profit. Loss of $2.4 Million **********In the year ended June 30, Teradata lost $2.4 million on annual revenue of $257.8 million. It has about 1,600 employees worldwide, compared with the 54,000 employees of NCR, based in Dayton, Ohio, which is the nation's fifth-largest computer company. **********In March 1990, NCR bought about 1.4 million newly issued Teradata shares, or about 9.4 percent of outstanding shares, for about $26.27 a share. **********Teradata is scheduled to be merged next year into NCR, subject to approval by Teradata holders. **********Under the agreement announced yesterday, A.T.&T. would exchange $30.25 worth of A.T.& T. common stock for each Teradata share. Teradata's share price jumped $5.125 yesterday, to $28.875. With 2.7 million shares traded, it was the second-most-active over-the-counter stock. On the New York Stock Exchange, A.T.& T. slipped 12.5 cents, to $36.25.  The Ratio of Exchange **********The ratio of exchange would be based on the average closing price of A.T.& T. common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days that end five trading days before Teradata's shareholders meet to vote on the deal. That meeting has not been set, but it may be scheduled for late January. **********In a statement, Gilbert P. Williamson, NCR's chairman, said the Teradata acquisition was a logical extension of NCR's earlier purchase and joint-venture agreement because Teradata would now have access to more money for marketing and distribution, as well as general-purpose computing and communications technologies. **********A.T.& T. bought NCR in a $7.5 billion deal earlier this year to take advantage of the growing symbiosis between computers and telephones."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/18/world/wide-ranging-afghan-talks-urged-by-kabul-government.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 194, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wide-Ranging Afghan Talks Urged by Kabul Government", "print_headline": "Wide-Ranging Afghan Talks Urged by Kabul Government", "body_text": " **********With a cutoff of its Soviet weapons supply only weeks away, the Government called today for wide-ranging peace talks to bring about a political solution to the 12-year civil war. **********The appeal came in response to a joint statement issued Saturday in Moscow after talks between Soviet officials and a delegation from the American-backed Afghan rebels. **********The Soviet officials and the Muslim guerrillas called for an undefined \"Islamic interim government\" in Afghanistan and supported a United Nations peace plan in which an interim administration would oversee elections. **********In a statement, the Afghan Foreign Ministry said that \"a comprehensive solution\" to the civil war could only be achieved \"through an intra-Afghan dialogue.\" **********But a ministry spokesman, Abdul Wahid Qayoumi, said \"the war will go on\" if an Islamic interim government excludes President Najibullah and his Homeland Party.

And no one seems willing to predict when that will be. **********This town is beyond the range of electronic jammers operated by the Saudi Government to prevent broadcasts from occupied Kuwait and Iraq from reaching Saudi ears. Here, the nonstop fulminations of Iraqi broadcasters come through loud and clear. \"Saddam Hussein,\" one singer rhapsodizes in Arabic song and verse, \"you are the smile on the lips of the young and the old. You are the moon over Mesopotamia.\" **********The police who patrol the empty streets do not listen to the voice of the \"aggressor,\" as Iraq is called. And despite the absence of any immediate threat here, any suspicious activity is monitored. When two journalists snapped a picture of a deserted street, the police promptly pulled alongside their car and admonished them about it. Identification forms were duly checked. And then the police, unwilling to abandon Saudi hospitality, invited the guests to dinner."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/13/business/producer-price-report-is-encouraging-on-inflation.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-09-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 784, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Producer Price Report Is Encouraging on Inflation", "print_headline": "Producer Price Report Is Encouraging on Inflation", "body_text": " **********In a heartening report on inflation, prices at the producer level rose two-tenths of 1 percent in August, a modest increase caused mainly by higher oil prices that have since subsided, Labor Department figures showed today. **********The report, which was somewhat better than expected, touched off a rally in the market for fixed-income securities as investors and traders viewed it as increasing the chances of a new and prompt easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. **********\"The economy would benefit from additional monetary stimulation, and there's very little chance of stirring up inflation by doing so,\" asserted Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. The trade group's members closely follow the Producer Price Index since it reflects transactions with their suppliers. Expectations of the Fed **********The Federal Reserve generally seeks to avoid appearing to respond to any particular piece of economic news but analysts said today that the next, long-anticipated round of rate cuts could come at any time. On Friday morning the Government is to publish its comprehensive report on retail sales during August and on inflation at the consumer level. Both are expected to reflect sluggish economic conditions. **********\"This prepares the way some more for the Fed to ease,\" said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist for Fuji Securities in Chicago. Comparing a cut in short-term rates to an apple fully ripened on a tree, he said, \"Today, tomorrow, we know it's going to fall.\" **********The most recent Fed easing came in early August on the heels of weak employment data. **********The two-tenths of 1 percent rise in the index for finished goods followed modest declines for June and July, but analysts noted that prices would have been unchanged if energy prices are excluded. They added that political uncertainty in the Soviet Union, the world's biggest oil producer, was a chief factor for a 4.6 percent jump in gasoline, which had dropped 5.5 percent in July. Oil Prices Letting Up **********Recently, oil prices have eased and economists said they did not expect overall energy prices -- up 1.8 percent last month -- to prove an obstacle to further reductions in inflation. **********The so-called core rate of inflation, which eliminates food as well as energy, also rose two-tenths of 1 percent in August. This was the same pace as in July and in May, with June unchanged. The Labor Department revised downward today the pace of inflation it reported earlier for April and May. **********Of further encouragement to analysts was the fact that the producer price indexes for goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production were also held in check. Intermediate goods rose four-tenths of 1 percent over all, but just one-tenth without energy; crude goods were unchanged over all, but 1.1 percent lower without energy. **********A dress or suit of clothes would be an example of a finished good, an item that will not undergo further processing and is ready for sale to the final user, either an individual consumer or a business. In this case, a bolt of cloth would be the intermediate good and the raw cotton or wool the crude good. 'Inflation Is Under Control' **********\"These figures conclusively demonstrate that inflation is under control,\" said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, noting that core inflation at the producer level has remained at about 2.5 percent since February. **********The 1.8 percent jump in finished energy prices last month, which included a decline in residential natural gas, was significantly offset by a four-tenths of 1 percent decline in consumer foods. Beef and veal fell 4.7 percent, and prices also fell for fish, fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, soft drinks and pork. **********But passenger cars and tobacco prices both advanced 1.1 percent as did women's apparel, household appliances, prescription drugs, glassware and textbooks. Automobile prices fell four-tenths of 1 percent before seasonal adjustment. Prices for Manufacturers **********Among intermediate goods, materials for nondurable manufacturing, like paint and chemicals, rose three-tenths of 1 percent, the first increase for this category since November, the report showed. Materials for durable manufacturing, like copper and brass mill shapes, fell seven-tenths of 1 percent following a one-tenth of 1 percent decline in July. **********Finished capital equipment rose one-tenth of 1 percent for the second straight month, as increases for cars, civilian aircraft, agricultural machinery and construction machiner more than offset lower prices for computers, oilfield machinery and trucks. **********For the first eight months of the year, prices of finished goods have fallen at an annual rate of 1.1 percent, the report also showed.

As an entrepreneur, she sought the sense of personal achievement that had eluded her during her years at other computer companies. But after eight years, she realized that 60- and 70-hour work weeks brought no more satisfaction than the corporate rat race. She liquidated her business and now, at 45, works occasionally as a consultant. **********\"My sense of joy,\" she says, \"comes from being able to look at my business and say, 'That's not what I had in mind' and walk away from it.\" After two unsuccessful marriages and a failed love affair, she now devotes more time to personal relationships and to a longstanding passion, opera. **********It is a path that would have been unthinkable to her father, one of men profiled by William H. Whyte in his groundbreaking 1956 book, \"The Organization Man.\" But it is one that we found trod, over and over again, as we tracked down the adult sons and daughters of many of Mr. Whyte's subjects and other children of the men who bought into corporate America in the 50's and 60's. **********Obviously, the corporate landscape has changed since those \"Ozzie and Harriet\" days -- and quite a few of the men profiled by Mr. Whyte retired saying that they felt troubled by the antagonism and anxiety stalking corporate offices in the wake of the mergers and downsizings of the 80's. Quite a few were fired during corporate layoffs, and their feelings of betrayal are even greater. **********But how their grown children react is critical for American business because they are poised to take leadership roles and chart the direction for the next generation. **********The 80's, with its mergers, buyouts and restructurings, brought the end of corporate loyalty. But devotion to a profession -- as opposed to a company -- remained. In the 90's, however, even that bond grows more tenuous every day. Just when American businesses must become more competitive or face extinction, an entire generation of Americans is psychologically withdrawing from its commitment to work. **********In the mid-80's, when we began a follow-up study to \"The Organization Man,\" this phenomenon hardly existed. With the help of Mr. Whyte and a small team of researchers, we interviewed more than 175 men from his original study and 125 of their sons and daughters and other \"organization offspring.\" **********In the ensuing years, we watched as these sons and daughters transformed themselves, in rapidly increasing numbers, from people who lived to work into people who work to live. This shift took even them by surprise. **********\"I've felt my values changing,\" said a bank executive, Dale Radcliff, who, in his late 30's, was on the brink of starting a family. \"I don't know what to make of it.\" **********Since the 60's, these 19 million organization offspring have been in the forefront of an individualism that ran the gamut from earnest self-development to sheer selfishness. Celebrated as sensitive souls or castigated as yuppies, they have followed self-fulfillment with abandon. Many took those values into the workplace, demanding that their jobs fulfill their needs for self-expression. Many made work the center of their lives. But unlike their fathers, they refused to give loyalty to any one organization. **********Now as their fathers retire, they are poised to assume responsibility in virtually every kind of public and private enterprise. Well-educated and ferociously competitive, they survived the Darwinian struggle for achievement inevitably imposed on every large generation -- and theirs is the largest in American history. **********But huge numbers of them are turning their attention to other matters, mainly to their families. As the torch is being passed to them, they appear to be handing it back. **********AS Nancy Caton, a foreign exchange trader, put it: \"I feel I'm ready to make some sort of commitment to something, and I don't really want to make it to a corporate entity to which I feel no particular loyalty.\" **********But it is not that they do not want to work. They want to work differently. They want a new balance in their compact with the organization and they will walk if they don't get it. **********In the mid-80's, Scott Myers's work at Memorex left him little time to spend with his two infants. He was frustrated but his work provided a satisfying challenge. When Unisys acquired Memorex, however, his project was ended and he left the company. A gifted software developer and son of one of the Whyte organization men, he and a partner now run a business out of their homes. **********\"Some people are out to make lots of money, but not me,\" he said. \"I am in it for the challenge. I have found something I like, plus this new job has allowed me to be with my wife and our new daughter and it has been great.\" **********Why has the corporate world become so irrelevant to people like Scott Myers? For many, the short answer is family. **********In 1990, there were 4.2 million births, a level not seen since the peak years of the baby boom. Of the 3.7 million babies born in 1988, the most recent year for which detailed figures are available, 35 percent were born to women between the ages of 30 and 44 -- a quarter of a million of whom were managers or professionals. This is to say nothing of managerial-professional fathers, for whom figures are not available. **********The same managers who used to seek raises and promotions now demand parental leave, flex-time and home-based work. **********BUT the roots of the psychological withdrawal reach into the childhoods of the organizational offspring. The affluence in the suburban enclaves settled by the organization man and his wife enabled their children to focus on emotional gratification. **********The organization man and his wife, however, inadvertently launched their children on their long, often lonely, search for self-fulfillment -- a search that ended in disillusionment for many. As a result, many are seeking to re-establish old values through new families, but doing so with a much-chastened sense of their own self-sufficiency and a determination not to put career ahead of family as their fathers did. **********This waning of interest in work by our most talented and best-educated workers is likely to be the most pressing crisis facing American businesses in the coming decade. **********Unsympathetic employers could presumably try to screen them out, but there are simply too many of them: Ten million of the roughly 19 million organization offspring are managers or professionals between the ages of 35 and 45. **********Moreover, such a course would mean lowering the educational level of the organization relative to competing organizations and spurning the personality type -- autonomous and anti-hierarchical -- best suited to performing the kind of intellectual-based \"knowledge work\" that is crucial to global competitiveness. **********Leadership, it is often said, can rectify the mistakes of arid managerialism and restore loyalty and commitment. For companies, however, success in the 90's will lie not in finding models for leadership, but in understanding who is to be led. **********These are people whose former appetite for work, far from being selfless in the manner of the organization man, was motivated by the desire for self-expression. Less competitive and more cooperative, they will be pouring more psychic energy into family and community. **********To tap some of that, smart organizations -- and the list ranges from big companies like Levi-Strauss and Corning to young, small companies like On Technology and Next Inc. -- will have to provide something that money, inspirational corporate philosophies, manipulative human relations programs, even flex-time, cannot buy. They will have to provide a sense of shared purpose among individuals whose devotion to self-expression has led them to see that their fierce commitment to work was too self-centered."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/18/business/real-estate-a-manhattan-building-gets-a-face-lift.html": {"writer_name": "Rachelle Garbarine", "pub_date": "1991-12-18", "snippet": "AFTER sitting nearly half vacant for the last three years, a 320,000 square-foot-office building at 16 East 34th Street is being remodeled and brought back on the market at reduced rents, providing another lift to one of Manhattan's major commerci...", "word_count": 832, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Real Estate;\nA Manhattan Building Gets A Face Lift", "print_headline": "Real Estate;\nA Manhattan Building Gets A Face Lift", "body_text": " **********AFTER sitting nearly half vacant for the last three years, a 320,000 square-foot-office building at 16 East 34th Street is being remodeled and brought back on the market at reduced rents, providing another lift to one of Manhattan's major commercial centers. **********The 21-story Art Deco structure is half a block from the Empire State Building, a commercial stalwart, and directly across 34th Street from the empty former B. Altman department store, part of which is to be turned into a 650,000 square-foot-design center. A division of the New York Public Library will fill the remaining 200,000 square feet. **********The site is not far from the former Ohrbach's department store, just west of Fifth Avenue, which has been fully rented since its renovation and conversion into an office building in 1989. Three tenants have leased all 377,000 square feet of office space there. **********Now 16 East 34th Street, erected in the late 1920's, has an assured future. The building was acquired in the fall by S. L. Green Real Estate Inc. of Manhattan and a group of Hong Kong investors who plan to spend $2 million to $3 million over the next 10 months to renovate it. **********The work, following plans by JCS Design Associates of Manhattan, includes refurbishing the 1,600-square- foot lobby and elevator cabs, as well as replacing the windows. And to make the building more visible, the facade will be embellished by extending the ornamental bronze work that now frames the entrance to the second floor. **********Bathrooms will also be remodeled, and new air-conditioning and electrical systems will be installed on the vacant floors, which have from 13,900 to 17,000 square feet. That work is to cost $35 a square foot, Stephen L. Green, chairman of S. L. Green, the managing partner in the joint venture, said. **********Asking rents for the available space, depending on the floor, are $21 to $23 a square foot, he said. Two years ago, he noted, rents per square foot in the unrenovated building were in the high $20's. **********Throughout the Grand Central District -- from 32d to 47th Street and from Fifth Avenue to the East River -- the average asking rent for older, prewar secondary buildings, which includes 16 East 34th Street, is $23.46 a square foot. Concessions like six to 12 months' free rent are still common there, as in the rest of Manhattan's sluggish office market. The vacancy rate in such buildings is 14.4 percent, up from 13.8 percent a year earlier, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage firm. **********\"The driving force in the market today is price,\" said Noel Berk, a Cushman & Wakefield broker. \"And tenants nearing the end of 15-year leases are moving around to make good deals.\" **********Mr. Green said he was confident that the lower rents for newly renovated space being offered at 16 East 34th Street would draw some of those shoppers. A lease for a full 16,000- square-foot-office floor is to be signed at the end of this month. One for the building's 10,000-square-foot-street-level storefront is to close in January. **********Mr. Green and his partners hope to continue to draw garment industry tenants needing showroom space, as well as law and accounting firms and nonprofit organizations. Among the current tenants are Playtex undergarments and Monet costume jewelry. **********The partners are able to offer lower rents because of the favorable deal they struck with the Bank of New York to buy and renovate the building. The previous owner, 1634 Associates, a partnership between Joseph Neumann, the general partner, and some limited partners including Beriss Ford Properties, a major British real estate company, said it was unable to continue. The bank held a loan of more than $40 million on the building, which it subsequently wrote down to $19 million. **********The building, once fully occupied, began to lose tenants as uncertanity over its ownership persisted. The lingering market slump also took its toll. After the building's problems became apparent, the lender and the previous owner agreed in the summer to sell it at a bankruptcy auction, but the opening bid of $22 million was not matched, and the bank took it over. **********The building was then sold for $24 million to the current owners, who financed one-third of the purchase price with their own equity, Mr. Green said. As part of the deal, the bank provided favorable acquisition and renovation loans. **********The transaction, commercial brokers say, is an example of the situation in today's market. Joseph McCluskey, a vice president at the Helmsley-Spear brokerage, said many buildings now on the market were purchased at high prices with big loans that cannot be carried at the lower rents now prevailing. **********Mr. McCluskey and other brokers said that the number of such buildings would grow over the next two years as they worked their way through the bankruptcy and foreclosure process. They also warned that the lower rents offered at the marked-down buildings would put pressure on healthy properties to do the same, making a tough market even tougher."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/02/business/business-people-ex-officer-of-chrysler-gets-dillon-read-job.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1991-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 455, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Officer of Chrysler Gets Dillon, Read Job", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Ex-Officer of Chrysler Gets Dillon, Read Job", "body_text": " **********After a career in the automobile industry and a fling of participation in a major buyout, Gerald Greenwald is hanging out his shingle on Wall Street. **********Mr. Greenwald, the former vice chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, who had once been considered a likely successor to Lee A.

Those who accept, like all retirees, face a crucial decision: how to take their pensions. The choice they make can play a big role in determining their financial security and that of their families. **********The most popular choice for married people is a 50 percent joint and survivor annuity. It reduces the retiree's pension payments, but if the retiree dies a surviving spouse will continue to receive payments equal to 50 percent of the benefits. **********Under Federal law a retiree can elect to receive the full pension, known as a straight life annuity, which would leave a surviving spouse with nothing, only if the spouse signs a waiver of consent. Experts sometimes recommend doing just that. **********Joel S. Isaacson, a partner in Weber, Lipshie & Company, said that often when the pension cannot be taken in a lump sum it may be better to take the life annuity and use the after-tax difference in those monthly benefits, compared with the joint and survivor annuity, to buy life insurance. **********Insurance provides greater flexibility in naming beneficiaries or cashing in the policy, and depending on the insurance chosen and the health of the retiree, it may be financially advantageous to take the life annuity and buy insurance. Also, insurance payments are not subject to income tax. **********Experts emphasize, however, that decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis. **********\"A spouse should not waive the right lightly, and should even consider legal counsel,\" Mr. Isaacson said. \"It should be planned out in advance. Once the decision is made, it's irrevocable.\" Also, he said, the decision should not be made until the insurance is in place. \"I have one client who is holding up on receiving his pension until he is sure he has the insurance.\" **********Mr. Isaacson encourages clients in their 50's, which he called the peak cash-flow years, to buy insurance for this reason. \"It is something of a forced savings program,\" he said. \"The house is paid for; the kids are grown. They can get insurance then and pay up by 65. Then they can take the higher annuity and have the insurance to protect the spouse. If they wait until retirement, often the insurance rates are higher, and there is a greater possibility that someone is uninsurable.\" **********Donald R. Levy, who retired in 1985 as vice president of human resources at the U.S. Tobacco Company and is now a consultant at Maxwell Macmillan, formerly Prentice Hall Information Services, bought insurance and chose a life annuity. His first wife, who had cancer, died two years after he retired, and he was then able to name his children as beneficiaries of the insurance. **********\"If I had taken the joint and survivor annuity, I would have a lower pension today and no insurance for others in the family,\" Mr. Levy said. \"I was able to finance this whole thing with the saving on my pension.\" **********Mr. Levy said that \"the big thing was being able to pass the physical\" examination required for insurance. Rates on policies are actuarily determined, he noted, as is the reduction in the pension to provide the survivor annuity. The difference is that \"the pension plan takes all comers, sick and well,\" he said. The uninsurable or high-risk person who would have to pay higher insurance premiums might well do better with the survivor annuity. **********To decide which option to take, a retiree needs to look at the numbers for his or her particular pension plan and see whether the extra money from the life annuity, after taxes, can buy enough insurance to replace the survivor annuity. **********Mr. Isaacson cited this example: A retiree could get a life annuity of $2,400 a month. The payment would be cut to $2,000 if he chose the 50 percent joint and survivor annuity, and if he died, his wife's monthly payment would be $1,000. After taxes that might be $9,000 a year, Mr. Isaacson said, calculating that $150,000 of insurance invested in tax-exempt securities yielding 6 percent would provide a replacement income.

Yeltsin, President of the Russian federated republic, ordered a halt to the publication of Pravda and other party newspapers, sealed the headquarters of the Central Committee and suspended the activities of the Russian republic's party branch while an investigation takes place into party support for the coup. **********The city of Moscow had already moved to close its party committee on Thursday, and today district party offices were locked and empty. In some cases, their signs had been stripped off. The city party chief, Yuri Prokofiev, was detained and taken to the prosecutor's office for questioning. **********The Russian Information Agency tonight reported that a group of Muscovites who had ringed the Central Committee building stopped an attempt to carry documents out of the building. The documents, the agency of the Russian Government said, concerned the Communist Party's foreign business dealings, in particular the sale of a party-owned Black Sea resort.  Deathwatch for the Party? **********Covered in disgrace and on the run, the Soviet Communist Party is on the verge of extinction, Aleksandr Rutskoy, Vice President of the Russian republic and a Communist who had tried to reform the party from within, said in an interview with the alternative newspaper Kuranti. **********\"It can no longer call itself the people's party,\" he said. \"Its place is where the Communist parties of Eastern Europe ended up.\" **********As the party apparatus seemed to near collapse, people in Moscow and other cities took to the streets to remove once-sacred symbols of Communism. **********In the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, thousands cheered at the toppling of a statue of Lenin. In Moscow, crowds that had watched as a monument to Feliks Dzerzhinsky was removed from the square in front of K.G.B. headquarters on Thursday moved on today to dismantle a statue of Yakov M. Sverdlov, a Bolshevik leader, across the square from the Bolshoi Theater. **********The flight of the Communists happened so fast that party members were caught off guard. Answering the telephone at the Central Committee headquarters on Staraya Ploshchad, someone said, \"No one is here.\" **********In the city of Kaliningrad, 60 miles from the capital, the city party secretary put down the telephone and then turned to a visitor to say that the phone call had been from Moscow, telling him to pack and leave. **********In Vilnius, party leaders fled their headquarters in four Soviet Army personnel carriers, followed minutes later by Lithuanian national guardsmen, armed with an arrest warrant, who found coffee still warm in the cups.  Revenge Is Acted Out **********In some regions, the reaction to the coup provided cover for actions, in some cases vendettas, by democratic forces caught in longstanding struggles against the Kremlin. **********In Latvia, Parliament voted an outright ban on the Communist Party and ordered criminal proceedings against its leaders. In the southern republic of Moldavia, the nationalist government arrested Communist leaders in Gagauz, a territory trying to break away, as \"adherents of dictatorship\" because they had sent a telegram of greetings to the coup leaders. **********The Lithuanian police last night seized the headquarters of the Communist Party in Vilnius and regained control of all major public buildings occupied by Soviet troops in the violence in January that left 13 people dead. **********In the Russian republic, under Mr. Yeltsin's order, party cells, which had been used as the leash to exert central control over once-powerful state agencies, dissolved at the K.G.B., at the official press agency Tass and at the national radio station Mayak. There, the acting party secretary resigned from the party altogether, and according to a report from the independent news agency Interfax, no one came forward to take his place.  Anger's Wide Geography **********From the once-loyal republic of Kirghizia in Central Asia to the breakaway republics on the Baltic coast the party was accused of \"cowardly and unscrupulous\" behavior during the coup. **********The party leader in Uzbekistan announced that he was leaving the Politburo, while Vladimir Zyukin, the head of Komsomol, the Communist youth organization, said he had withdrawn from the Central Committee \"in connection with the full disassociation of the Komsomol from the line taken by the Communist Party leadership, its criminal position and its betrayal of all honest Communists.\" **********Except from Communists themselves, there were no protests against some of the peremptory moves taken against the party. Nor did those party leaders who quit their positions on leading councils explain why they had not, as individuals, spoken out against the coup. **********To some observers, the lack of debate in the three days of the coup was a troublesome sign that all criticism of the prevailing political line would be considered suspect. **********At a news conference today, a deputy editor of Pravda accused Mr. Yeltsin of using \"the same unconstitutional methods as the so-called state emergency committee.\" The editor, Gennadi Seleznev, said there was no legal basis for the suspension of Pravda, a daily newspaper of three million circulation that has been the authoritative voice of the Soviet leadership since the days of Lenin. **********Speaking before the Russian Parliament today, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is not only the Soviet President but also General Secretary of the Communist Party, warned against \"anti-Communist hysteria.\" **********\"We should separate out those who participated in the first stage, and who afterward supported\" the coup, he said. \"But by all means, we should prevent this from turning against the rank-and-file citizen, the workers, peasants and intelligentsia of the party.\" **********\"No one has the right to set the task of banishing socialism from our country,\" he said. \"This is just another utopia, and notorious witch hunting.\"  'Handful of Adventurers' **********In a statement tonight, the ruling council of the Communist Party Control Commission expelled the coup leaders from the party and condemned their \"unlawful actions.\" But the commission protested against \"attempts to hold the entire party responsible for criminal actions of a handful of adventurers.\" **********But with hard-liners paralyzed by the failure of the coup, the leaders of forces supporting fundamental change in the Soviet Union struck hard and fast to take advantage of the Communists' weakened position. Although the party itself remained silent during its coup, all eight leaders of the coup committee were members of the Central Committee, and the party-controlled press, radio and television fell into line without a pause. **********On the streets and from speakers' tribunes, people said over and over again that now was the time to break the party's back, in case it managed later to regroup and reassert control. **********The aborted coup was only the latest offense to be laid at the party's door by such speakers. The outburst of revulsion against Communists drew from a longer history of undeserved privileges, abuses of power and going further back, to terror conducted under its name. **********In recent times, the Communist Party has suffered repeated blows to its once all-powerful status. In 1990, it was stripped of its monopoly as the Soviet Union's only legal party, and in local and republic elections, it has repeatedly lost to nationalist and democratic insurgent forces. **********This summer, Mr. Yeltsin, elected over fierce Communist Party opposition, moved to ban party cells in factories and offices, cutting a vital link that tied the economy to the party apparatus. That attempt was challenged as illegal by the party, and until now, has been enforced only sporadically.  Yeltsin Bans Many Papers **********After his victory over the coup, Mr. Yeltsin has taken his ban further -- ordering the party out of armed forces serving on the Russian republic's territory, and now, moving to take control over the party-owned press. **********Besides suspending the publication of Pravda, Sovetskaya Rossiya, Glasnost, Rabochaya Tribuna, Moskovskaya Pravda and Leninskoye Znamya -- all official papers that during the coup, were allowed to publish -- Mr. Yeltsin placed publishing houses and printing plants within Russia under the control of the republic's Ministry of the Press and Mass Media. **********On its front page today, Pravda criticized its own \"lack of objectivity\" in reporting on the coup. The paper also changed its logo today, from the \"Organ of the Central Committee of the Communist party,\" to the \"General Political Newspaper\" of the party."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/06/business/rjr-nabisco-s-losses-are-slashed.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Ramirez", "pub_date": "1991-02-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 599, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RJR Nabisco's Losses Are Slashed", "print_headline": "RJR Nabisco's Losses Are Slashed", "body_text": " **********Two years after it emerged from history's largest leveraged buyout, RJR Nabisco has made significant progress toward becoming, as one analyst put it, \"just another operating company.\" **********The latest evidence came yesterday when RJR, still burdened by heavy debt, said it slashed its fourth-quarter loss to $13 million, from $144 million a year earlier. **********Quarterly sales advanced 4.2 percent, to $3.69 billion, from $3.54 a year ago.

'Awfully Big Numbers' **********Mr. Mally said those figures were somewhat overstated, partly because there was no agreed definition of free cash flow. Mr. Mally estimated free cash flow in the quarter totaled $493 million and full-year cash flow totaled $2.1 billion. \"They're still awfully big numbers however you slice it,\" he said. **********Mr. Mally defines free cash flow as earnings before interest, depreciation, amortization and subtracting preferred dividends, capital expenditures and other expenses. \"It's the dough you need to pay off what you owe,\" he said. **********Full-year losses totaled $429 million, down from the 1989 loss of $1.15 billion.

Stock traders took their cue from the drop in bond prices, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 51.36 points, to 2,976.74. **********S.E.C. chairman Richard Breeden professes a deep belief in the disclosure rules, and vows that he will not allow large foreign companies to be traded publicly in this country without disclosure. He correctly points out that when international companies use different accounting rules, it can be impossible to compare them. **********Consider, for example, companies run by press barons. Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation tapped the American capital markets before the S.E.C. made it easy, and investors can see just how little net worth it has under American accounting rules. But Robert Maxwell's Mirror Group Newspapers raised $84 million from American investors last month, and made no comparable disclosure. What little the company did disclose -- to institutional investors only -- showed that, under the American rules, it probably had no net worth. **********The double standard shown by that situation can be expected to grow, as more and more companies become comfortable with private placements and as institutional investors grow accustomed to trading them. Eventually, those companies that comply with the rules will begin to feel more and more like fools, and will demand equal treatment. And the American standards of financial disclosure could wither away. **********If Mr. Breeden is not careful, that may end up being the legacy of his term as S.E.C. chairman."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/02/world/nairobi-street-children-play-games-of-despair.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1991-01-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1573, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nairobi Street Children Play Games of Despair", "print_headline": "Nairobi Street Children Play Games of Despair", "body_text": " **********As night fell, a group of girl prostitutes emerged from the squalid plastic and paper hutches they call home and ambled toward the luxury tourist hotel a few steps away. **********For this group of 6- to 16-year-olds in dirt-speckled clothes, business, the search for a $5 trick or a 20-cent handout, was about to begin. A few blocks away, a gang of homeless boys had started hustling, sidling up to European visitors, hands outstretched, asking for money. **********The number of street children abandoned by their parents and living by their wits has increased in Nairobi and other major sub-Saharan cities in recent years, a product of the breakdown of the extended families and village culture that were pillars of African life. By some estimates, 50,000 children roam this city's streets, often because their parents cannot afford the fees at Government schools. **********The streets of Nairobi are now divided into turfs, with gangs of girls run by what in Western terms would be considered pimps, and gangs of boys ruled by an older boy who enforces discipline. **********One gang of boys, led by Benson Matende Chero, claims the sidewalk outside a seedy pick-up joint, the New Florida Nightclub. Friday nights, with their array of diplomats, businessmen and adventurous tourists, are especially lucrative for Benson's beggars. The nightclub has the attraction of being a few blocks from Benson's headquarters, a stretch of litter-strewn grass hidden by trees in a city park. **********The gangs, generally not armed, are more juvenile support and self-protection groups than street gangs in the Western sense. **********Somewhat respectful of each other, the gangs do not resort to the kind of warfare common among Western street gangs. There are fights over turf, but not many. Too much time is spent on sheer survival: collecting money, scavenging food, fetching cooking water or washing clothes at a burst water main in a city park. **********The members decide on a method of survival -- begging and prostitution as is the case with the girls in the alley, or parking cars for a fee, or collecting trash. Then, with the leader in charge, they divide the daily proceeds among themselves. **********One of the denizens of the hutches in the alley, Elizabeth Wanjiru, 12, a tattered blue skirt and tee-shirt hanging from her spare frame, said she had been on the streets for a year. She came to Nairobi with her mother from their rural village to stay with her grandmother, she said, in a husky voice, the result of malnourishment. **********Her mother, who could no longer afford the fees for the school \"building fund\" -- an ostensibly voluntary but in practice mandatory contribution necessary to enroll at a Kenyan Government primary school -- went back to the countryside, abandoning her in Nairobi. The grandmother then chased her away. **********Neither the mother nor the grandmother could afford the $25 annual school cost. The Kenyan minimum wage amounts to about $480 a year, but many families have seven or eight children. **********Elizabeth said she could earn 100 Kenyan shillings by sleeping with a man, or about $5. She would give 20 shillings to one of the pimps, she said. She liked the pimps -- speaking in Swahili, she used a friendly term for \"man,\" alluding to the protection that the four pimps offered -- because they did not force her to have sex with them. **********The most seasoned of the gang's prostitutes, Mercy Wanjiru, who is not related to Elizabeth, said she was 16. With a winning smile that flashed perfectly white teeth, Mercy looked more like 13 or 14. **********\"Except for the disease, it's not a bad life,\" she said.  And Now, V.D. **********Mercy said she was upset because her genital sores had become so painful that she could no longer work. She was unafraid of AIDS, she said, because she slept only with African men, whom she considered safer than white men. She usually stayed near the 20th Century Cinema, the plushest movie house in Nairobi, waiting for a client to drive by. She would earn as much as 200 shillings a client. **********But her venereal disease now meant that she could only attract the clients and pass them on to other girls in the gang, who were less experienced and yielded only 100 shillings. Thus, she said, the men at the head of the gang were becoming abusive, even hitting her. **********A few streets from the alley of the girls, Benson runs a gang of 32 homeless boys who have found a home in the city park across the road from a new slick black marble monument venerating Kenya's President, Daniel arap Moi. Benson showed a visitor his bed, a battered steel packing case swathed in an outer layer of plastic sheeting and hidden among litter in the center of the tree-studded park. **********One of 11 children, he said he never knew his mother. He left his rural village eight years ago, driven away by the violence that surrounded a second marriage of his father, a bus driver. He said begging was the best means of survival for his gang because it left it less vulnerable to the law than other street activities.  Parking Boys and Beggars **********Selling parking spaces or offering to watch parked cars, a common way for Nairobi's vagrants to raise money, left his gang members too vulnerable to the petty crimes of other parking boys. For example, a gang member could be charged for stealing a car mirror when in fact he had not done it. Collecting garbage also left one open to charges of theft, he said. **********With begging, he had developed routines. His favorite targets were white tourists -- \"millionaires,\" he said in one of his few words of English -- many of whom do not understand the value of Kenyan money. **********So far, social workers say, the peddling of drugs, a mainstay of Western street gangs, has not permeated juvenile street life in Nairobi. But sniffing glue, a substance used by sidewalk shoe repairers, is a popular high among the children. Glue costing the equivalent of 50 cents a hit increased his motivation, Benson said. **********\"You can even dare to rob.\" Benson said he had been arrested so many times that he could not keep track. But one charge stuck: he spent 10 months in a juvenile center for \"snatching,\" he said, followed by 18 months in Government schools of detention before \"escaping.\"  Social Workers Wonder **********The problem of street children leaves social workers struggling for answers. \"There's a big increase in street kids, especially in the number of girls,\" said Jones Muchendu, a social worker with the Undugu Society, a private Kenyan group that helps street children. **********\"It's because of the economy,\" he said. \"Most people in the slums are unemployed, most parents are single parents. Life in the city is very expensive. Everything depends on cash, even water. Now the girls are even sent to the streets by the parents to look for money and they become prostitutes.\" **********The Undugu Society says that Nairobi, a metropolitan area some estimate at two million people, has several thousand \"hard core\" children with no parental supervision and 50,000 other children who roam the streets because their single parents cannot afford the fees at Government schools. **********Nearly 25 percent of Kenya's population, now about 24 million, live in cities, compared with less than 10 percent at independence in 1964, according to the World Bank. Similar increases have occurred in all the major cities from Lagos in Nigeria to Lusaka in Zambia. **********The United Nations estimates that 40 percent to 75 percent of squatter families in Nairobi are headed by single women, a phenomenon that it described as \"symptomatic of the breakdown of the traditional family structures and the increasingly ambivalent role of the male in the household.\" **********For the child vagrants of Nairobi, the Christmas and New Year holidays present a period of danger. The city authorities, intent on an upbeat image for tourists, stepped up the number of police squads. Arrest and detention in an overcrowded, often brutal juvenile center are about the only remedies that the economically stretched Kenyan Government offers to the problem of the street children.  Government Is Embarrassed **********The harsh attitude of the Kenyan authorities is a combination of callousness and economic limitations. The children are considered an embarrassment and a blight on Nairobi, the Government's public showcase. And many of the social services now considered a basic right in developed countries have long been considered the duty of the family in Africa. **********To counter these punitive attitudes, Undugu Society, founded in the mid-1970's under the auspices of a Dutch missionary, has a network of social workers, four schools with a Government-approved curriculum and a reception center. Now run by a Kenyan staff, the society has reunited some street children with their rural families. **********But even some of the charitable endeavors of the Undugu Society -- the name comes from the Swahili word for \"solidarity\" -- have been ripped up by the authorities. In April this year, because of the overwhelming numbers of homeless children, the society added to its services a temporary school and shelter, in a squatter settlement, walking distance from downtown. **********By giving poles and plastic and mud for the walls, the society persuaded the boys to build the school themselves. There, Benson learned some trade skills. The boys slept at the shelter at night. During one of its zealous slum clearance campaigns, the city council bulldozed the shelter, scattering the boys back to the parks and alleys."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/03/business/mcdonnell-and-irs-settle.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1991-12-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 353, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "McDonnell and I.R.S.

And after that, they said, the hole will only grow deeper. **********The projection by the Office of Management and Budget, made in the budget request the White House will send to Congress on Feb. 4, is the first official estimate to become public that suggests that the bank insurance fund could be insolvent as early as 1992. The White House projection is that by the end of next year, the fund will have a deficit of $4 billion and that by 1995 the shortfall will be $23 billion. **********A taxpayer rescue could be averted through increased industry contributions, but the insurance fund's troubles would still be felt by bank depositors and other customers through increased fees and lower rates paid on deposits. **********The fund has posted three consecutive years of losses, and is now at its lowest ratio of insurance to deposits since its creation in 1934. Because of the growing number of failures of large banks, the fund is expected to show record losses for both last year and this year, totaling $9 billion. That would leave it with about $4 billion by the end of this year. Fears of Another Bailout **********Administration officials have struggled in recent months to distinguish the plight of the fund and the commercial banking industry from that of the nation's savings and loans. The bailout of that industry could cost taxpayers as much as $500 billion over 40 years. But the latest estimates on the bank fund and the failure of the banking industry to agree on a solution provide the strongest indication so far that a bailout to protect bank deposits may also be needed. **********\"The Treasury is looking at a budget that has a black hole and saying our first job is to fill that black hole,\" a bank lobbyist said. \"If the economy and the real estate markets do not turn around soon, then it is clear we will not be able to make up the difference.\" **********Industry representatives have been meeting with regulators and Treasury officials this week to try to find a way to rebuild the insurance fund through industry contributions in a way that would not cripple banks, many of which have been posting anemic profits. **********\"They are still far from any agreement,\" said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. He added that within the next month, the F.D.I.C. would probably be considering another increase in the premiums that banks pay to the insurance fund.   Rising Premiums **********On Jan. 1, the premium paid by banks to the fund rose to 19.5 cents for every $100 in deposits, from 12 cents. Lobbyists are predicting that it could soon be increased again, to at least 23 cents. For the first nine months of 1990, the industry earned about 60 cents for each $100 in deposits. **********The White House estimate is based on the expectation that the premium will increase to 23 cents, an 18 percent jump over the current payments and a 92 percent rise over the 12 cents paid last year. Its projections for losses are based upon an economic model that compares the capital and quality of assets of banks with the trends shown by similar institutions that failed. **********A similar method has been used by the Congressional Budget Office, which will present its latest forecasts on the health of the insurance fund at a Congressional hearing on Tuesday. The budget office projection is also expected to show a deficit, even assuming an increase in industry contributions. **********Mr. Seidman said the F.D.I.C. was in the process of calculating how it would fare in 1992, and he questioned the reliability of long-range forecasts. Within the last year, the F.D.I.C. has been forced several times to increase its estimates of the amount it expected to lose. **********The Administration is preparing to release its proposals for overhauling the banking industry next week, shortly after the President's State of the Union address on Tuesday.   Activities Are Restricted **********The proposals will call for the elimination of barriers that have prevented the merger of commercial and investment banks, have sharply limited interstate banking and have prohibited industrial enterprises from owning commercial banks. The Administration will also recommend a significant reorganization of the regulatory structure that oversees banks and savings associations. **********But officials said today that the package might not include specific details on reorganizing the bank insurance fund because bank trade groups in Washington had been unable to agree among themselves on how to proceed. **********A senior official at the Treasury Department said that despite the disagreements, the Administration would support some significant principles in next week's report. **********\"We think our plan ought to take care of the future and rely on the industry,\" said the official, who insisted on anonymity. \"But it ought not break the backs of the banks.\" **********\"It ought to have the industry's leadership behind it, but that is complicated to achieve,\" the official continued. \"To bring together an industry as diverse as banking is a very, very tough job.\"  Sizing Up the Contributions **********The official said the Treasury Department did not know how much the industry would be able to contribute without damaging some banks and leading to sizable failures. **********One proposal under discussion is for banks that are more secure to set up a fund to invest in weaker institutions. But officials and industry representatives said there were substantial disagreements over the size of such a fund and its structure. Of particular concern to some banks, especially the smaller ones, is whether the fund would be used only to prop up the larger institutions. **********Another proposal being discussed is the issuing of zero-coupon bonds backed by bank assets to raise $25 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/22/business/media-business-advertising-3-marketers-are-packaging-film-tie-ins-kiddie-style.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1991-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 670, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 Marketers Are Packaging Film Tie-Ins, Kiddie-Style", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 3 Marketers Are Packaging Film Tie-Ins, Kiddie-Style", "body_text": " **********SOME of the nation's largest consumer-prodct companies are choosing sides in the battle that begins today between two animated Christmas-season films, \"An American Tail: Fievel Goes West\" and \"Beauty and the Beast.\" **********Hoping that the appeal of the films' cartoon characters will animate sales of their products, marketing giants like Colgate-Palmolive, Nabisco Brands and Pizza Hut are spending tens of millions of dollars on elaborate promotional and advertising programs tied to the movies. **********Universal Pictures is opening \"An American Tail: Fievel Goes West\" in about 1,400 theaters nationwide.

When he was leaving his brief news conference he stumbled and nearly fell before being assisted to a waiting car. Few Public Comments **********American officials who met with Mr. Turner described him as \"lucid\" and \"chatty.\" But the released hostage made few public comments, they said, because of his fear that he might jeopardize the release of the remaining hostages. **********There are now eight Westerners believed held hostage in Lebanon, including four Americans, two Germans, an Italian and a Briton. **********When Mr. Turner was asked if he had knowledge of other hostages in Lebanon he looked toward the American Ambassador, Christopher Ross, for guidance, whispered a comment to the diplomat, and then declined to answer.

Members of the Party of God, the largest Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim faction in Lebanon, battled a local Lebanese clan in the town of Baalbek in the Bekaa until close to midnight. Clashes Cause Delay **********Mr. Turner was apparently taken out of the town, which serves as the Party of God's headquarters and is where many of the remaining Westerners are believed to be held, only after Syrian troops moved in to impose a cease-fire, Western diplomats said. **********Baalbek is the main town in the Bekaa, which is under Syrian military control. But Syrian troops are not allowed to enter the barracks and training centers belonging to the Party of God, which is believed to be the umbrella organization for all of the groups holding Western hostages. Its operations in Baalbek are supported by a force of several thousand Iranian Revolutionary Guards. **********Mr. Qaddur said Syria would \"continue to exert all its efforts\" to get the remaining Western hostages out of Lebanon. **********United Nations officials, seeming buoyed by the resumption of prisoner exchanges in Lebanon, say they expect to announce new releases soon. **********Those officials said Mr. Turner's release was the outcome of an \"intensive stage\" of negotiations between Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar's special envoy, Giandomenico Picco, and a hostage negotiator identified as Abu Abdullah, described as the \"special envoy of the organization that holds the hostages.\"  Pact on Freeing Captives **********The Israelis hold about 300 Arab prisoners, including Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, a Party of God leader who was kidnapped from his home in southern Lebanon by Israeli commandos on July 28, 1989. **********Israel released 15 Arabs on Monday after receiving hard information about the fate of one of its missing servicemen, Pvt.

That is about $3.50 above current levels for crude oil from the gulf. But oil experts say the meeting could grow tense when the ministers debate how much production should be cut, and by whom, to re-establish the $21 price. **********\"There is a tremendous desire among all OPEC countries to prevent an oil-price collapse,\" said Mehdi Varzi, a London-based oil analyst with Kleinwort Benson Securities Ltd. \"They all recognize they have to cut output collectively for the second quarter. But how they do it? That's where the problems arise.\" Crippled Export Capacity **********Since the oil-production and export capacities of Kuwait and Iraq are crippled, many analysts say it should not be difficult for the 11 other OPEC members to carve up their production into a new system of quotas, but in the highly charged postwar atmosphere that may not be so easy. **********With Saudi Arabia accounting for about 8.3 million of the nearly 23 million barrels a day that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped last month, other OPEC members are expected to put pressure on the Saudis to absorb the bulk of any cuts. But the Saudis say they will fend off such pressure. After incurring some $50 billion in expenses in fighting Baghdad, as well as huge investments to increase output to offset the embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, Saudi Arabia does not want to be the only country to cut production. **********Oil analysts say the Saudis do not want prices to rise quickly, since a price jump could be seen as a slap in the face to the United States and other Western nations that joined Riyadh in fighting Iraq. What is more, the Saudis recognize that a jump in prices could undermine a recovery of the slumping American economy.  Agreement on Price **********\"What they will quickly agree on is the price will go to $21,\" said John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, based in New York. \"The question is whether the price will go up right away.\" **********Some analysts suggest that Washington would not be disappointed if OPEC moved to re-establish a price of $21 a barrel, which is usually about $2 a barrel below the price of West Texas intermediate, the benchmark American grade of crude oil. In February, OPEC's average price was $17.55 a barrel. **********\"Twenty-one dollars is realistic for everyone, even the U.S.,\" said Pierre Terzian, editor of Petrostrategies, a Paris-based oil journal. He said that level would just reaffirm the July price target, to which Washington did not object. He added that because the dollar has plunged against the Japanese yen and most European currencies, oil, which is priced in dollars, is far cheaper for Japan and Western Europe than it was five years ago.  A Glut in the Offing **********Oil experts say that if OPEC continues to produce oil at the February rate of 23 million barrels a day, a glut could develop quickly. Prices would plunge as a result, because daily demand for OPEC oil is expected to be between 21 million and 21.5 million barrels in the second quarter. **********Demand for oil historically falls by more than two million barrels a day from the first quarter to the second as spring weather comes to the Northern Hemisphere. Also weighing on the market is some 120 million barrels of oil stored in tankers at sea, far more than the 45 million barrels usually stored that way. **********In Geneva on Sunday, the Oil Minister of Indonesa, Ginanjar Kartasasmita, said: \"OPEC will take all the necessary steps to stabilize the market. If a cut is necessary, then we will do it.\" **********Saudi Arabia's former oil minister, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, said that if nothing was done to control the glut, oil prices could drop to $12 a barrel. He said Friday that there was a 50 percent chance that OPEC would agree on new production ceilings at the Geneva meeting. **********Sheik Yamani said one possibility that could drive down prices was a resumption of Iraqi exports by June. Some experts said the country's northern oilfields were only partially damaged by allied bombing. But many analysts said it would take much longer for Iraqi oil to enter export markets, because of the continuing embargo against Iraq and the destruction of that country's electric power stations. **********OPEC's Market Monitoring Committee, which is not empowered to decide on production quotas, meets on Monday to review the supply and demand situation. Oil analysts say there is a good chance the ministers will turn the committee's talks into a full-scale emergency meeting to decide on quota levels. **********Last July, OPEC set a production ceiling of 22.5 million barrels a day, but those quotas were suspended in September, when the 4 million barrels a day produced by Iraq and Kuwait were embargoed after the invasion of Kuwait. **********Many oil analysts predict that OPEC will agree to set a production ceiling of 21 million or 21.5 million barrels a day. \"If they cut to 21 million barrels, it won't take long to establish the $21-a-barrel price,\" said Mr. Varzi of Kleinwort Benson. \"If they cut to 21.5 million barrels, it will take longer.\" **********In recent days, OPEC ministers have maneuvered to put pressure on Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, to cut production. In a comment that many construed as a suggestion that Saudi Arabia had become a vassal of Washington, Algeria's Oil Minister, Sadek Boussena, who is also the president of OPEC, said the gulf countries had to \"show their capability of pursuing an independent oil policy, despite the new balance of forces in the region.\" **********Some of OPEC's price hawks fear that Saudi Arabia wants to keep its and OPEC's production high to please Washington, since this would help hold down prices. But Saudi officials deny they are doing Washington's bidding, noting that they have long opposed high prices. **********Saudi production is some 3 million barrels a day higher than the 5.3 million barrels a day the country produced before Iraq invaded Kuwait. **********The key to the meeting, many analysts say, is whether the Saudis can persuade other members to cut production as well. **********Analysts expect the Saudis to balk at accepting a quota of less than seven million barrels a day. Indeed, OPEC officials say Kuwait is negotiating with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates so they could produce part of Kuwait's 1.5 million-barrel-a-day quota. This would help pay for Kuwait's reconstruction. Kuwait would, in theory, repay this production when its oilfields are up and running.                    --------------------       New Kuwait Oil Output **********KUWAIT CITY, March 10 (AP) -- Kuwait hopes to start producing 50,000 barrels of oil a day in the next two months to run its power stations, an executive with the Kuwait Oil Company said today. **********Officials have estimated that between 80 and 85 percent of Kuwait's oil production capacity was damaged by fires set by fleeing Iraqi troops, but the executive, Ahmad Murad, said some wells were unscathed. **********\"We have identified about 30 to 40 wells which are not on fire, but they could have been affected,\" he said at a news conference. \"There are a number of wells that are not even damaged. In fact, I saw 7 by my own eyesight.\" **********Mr. Murad said tentative plans call for American firefighters to start tackling the blazes on Friday after equipment is brought from the United States. He said that once Kuwait starts producing crude for the power stations, the next goal will be to start producing another 50,000 barrels a day to refine into gasoline for the local market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/27/business/ibm-model-to-be-sold-by-mitsubishi.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1991-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 408, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.B.M.

Earlier Stand by Bush **********They say Subic's functions could be duplicated elsewhere in the region, but at a cost of several billion dollars. \"And you can't replicate those functions in any one place,\" a diplomat said. **********Earlier this week, President Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney suggested that the United States would abandon Subic before agreeing to any modification of the treaty. \"We've made our best offer,\" the President said in Washington. **********Most of the 23 members of the Philippine Senate, which must ratify treaties, have already announced their opposition to the decade-long base agreement negotiated this summer. Under the pact, the United States would pay $203 million a year in rent for the base. **********Several senators oppose the treaty on the ground of national sovereignty, saying it is time to end nearly a century of American military presence on Philippine soil. Others oppose the specific terms of the agreement, especially what they regard as an insultingly low amount of money offered. **********The vote on the new base agreement is expected on or before Monday, when the treaty expires. As the Philippine Senate moves closer to a final decision, members are being confronted with a series of alternatives designed to make it possible for American troops to remain, at least for the time being. **********One set of proposals would put off the United States withdrawal for three years, a period in which American negotiators could seek a new, long-range treaty. **********Another proposal, sponsored by President Corazon C.

Companies declined to specify how many employees they have in the gulf, citing security concerns, but the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the Raytheon Company, the Lockheed Corporation and almost every other major contractor confirmed having at least some workers on the scene. **********The employees are the 1990's high-technology version of civilian personnel who have long flocked to jobs in war zones. If the need in Vietnam was for engineers and laborers to build airfields and ports, the need in Saudi Arabia is for technicians to maintain sophisticated radar, navigation, guidance and communications systems and the other hardware and software that make modern planes, missiles, bombs and sensors work as advertised. More Complex Systems **********Arms makers have dispatched technical representatives to wars where their weapons were deployed at least since the Vietnam War. But the complexity of the new weapons of the gulf war, like the Patriot and Tomahawk missiles, and the fact that many advanced weapons have never been used in combat, has increased the need for industry support. **********The primary role of the personnel is to assist military technicians in diagnosing and solving problems with weapons systems and in assessing and repairing battle damage. In some cases, companies are under contract to provide support services directly to Saudi Arabia's military as well as to American forces. **********Several companies said their employees had had extremely heavy workloads as the United States and allied forces continued their constant air attacks on Iraq. **********\"You can be sure they're pretty busy,\" said Michael Burch, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas. Mr. Burch said the company's personnel were generally present wherever there were McDonnell Douglas weapons systems, like the Air Force's F-15 fighters and the Navy's ship-based Tomahawk missiles.  New and Untested **********Industry executives said the military relies heavily on contractor personnel when a weapons system is relatively new and untested in combat, as is the case with many weapons systems in the gulf. In those cases, military technicians may have limited experience in dealing with any problems that may arise with increasingly complex electronics systems. Raytheon, for example, is known to have sent technical representatives to aid military personnel in installing and maintaining the Patriot anti-missile system both in Saudi Arabia and in Israel. **********Lockheed said it had a number of employees stationed in Saudi Arabia with the F-117A Stealth fighters made by the company. E-Systems Inc., a Dallas-based military contractor, is believed to have employees in the gulf supporting missions flown by the TR-1 and RC-135 reconnaissance planes, analysts say. The Hughes Aircraft Company, a unit of the General Motors Corporation, has \"a few dozen people over there,\" said Richard Dore, a spokesman. Hughes makes missiles, radar systems, night-vision and targeting equipment and other gear. **********\"In these types of situations, if something does develop, the Defense Department and the people in the field understandably want immediate assistance,\" Mr. Dore said. \"The Government has a lot of good people of its own there, but it helps to have someone from the team that built it.\" Request From the Navy **********Richard Vance, the director of field operations for the Grumman Corporation's aircraft division, said the Navy had for some years been trying to reduce its dependence on contractor employees on aircraft carriers by building technical and trouble-shooting expertise among its own seamen. But he said the Navy requested more help last year after Iraq invaded Kuwait and the American military buildup in the gulf began. **********\"There's a desire to have as much expertise there as possible,\" Mr. Vance said. Grumman makes the carrier-based F-14 fighter and A-6 bomber, among other weapons. **********While the employees are not armed and remain well behind the front lines, industry executives said they were at risk like anyone else attached to a military installation during a war. **********\"Are we concerned? You bet,\" Mr. Vance said. Advance Agreements **********Most contractors agree to provide support services as part of their contract to build a weapon. The companies recruit technical representatives from among their own employees and from among former military personnel, and most agree in advance to go to a war zone if needed. **********Industry executives declined to discuss the pay scale. Mr. Dore said that in a war, Hughes employees on the scene received their regular pay, plus an amount equivalent to whatever differential the military pays soldiers for combat duty. The differential ranges from 10 percent to 40 percent of base salary, depending on how close the employee is to the front lines. **********Contractor representatives are in regular communication with engineers and technicians at company plants in the United States. \"If the F-15E is experiencing problems that are not normal, the tech rep gets in touch with the factory, anytime day or night,\" said Mr. Burch of McDonnell Douglas. **********Industry executives said that the Pentagon had been pushing in recent years to reduce the amount and complexity of the maintenance needed for its weapons. As a result, contractors expect the role of their employees in future conflicts to decline. **********\"In ordering new airplanes, the Pentagon has given manufacturers high goals to meet in terms of reliability and maintainability,\" said James Ragsdale, a spokesman for Lockheed's aircraft division."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/13/world/hostage-drama-excerpts-demands-free-all-detainees-throughout-world.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-08-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 950, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Excerpts From the Demands: Free 'All Detainees Throughout the World'", "print_headline": "THE HOSTAGE DRAMA; Excerpts From the Demands: Free 'All Detainees Throughout the World'", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from a statement by Islamic Holy War, the pro-Iranian Lebanese group that released a British hostage, John McCarthy, last week.

However, the uprising of peoples seeking to achieve self-determination, recover their stolen freedom and independence, sever their links of dependence on the imperious states and insure that the principles of justice are put into practice is not terrrorism; it is a legitimate right. If the slogan of the need to combat international terrorism is an attempt to divert us from our course of holy war in the face of international arrogance, we will continue along the difficult path that we have chosen for ourselves without giving an inch. If its purpose is to maintain the state of open warfare between us and them, we are fully prepared to pursue this confrontation until we achieve one of the two divine rewards: victory or martyrdom. If struggle, holy war and resistance against the superpowers is terrorism, we and the oppressed peoples throughout the world are proud to be terrorists combating injustice and striking terror into the hearts of the enemies of God and mankind as long as they interfere in the internal affairs of oppressed nations and peoples anywhere in the world. We are part of the worldwide Islamic movement; the causes of the Muslims are our causes, and we share their sufferings and jubilations. By the grace of Almighty God, we shall always remain in the vanguard of the defenders of the causes of Islam and the Muslims and, in the cause of God, we do not fear the reproaches of anyone.

This reaction will continue as long as they remain incarcerated. Release All Detainees **********In view of our belief in the need for action to secure the release of our freedom-fighters from prisons in occupied Palestine and Europe and also to solve the question of the detainees whom we are holding and the problem of their families, we call upon you to make a personal endeavor, within the framework of a comprehensive solution, to secure the release of all detainees throughout the world.

Everyone is afraid to be honest, because they are aware that there are some real underlying differences over the question of the occupied territories.\" **********Interviews in recent days with many American and Israeli officials and others involved in the dispute suggest that Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir badly miscalculated when he brushed aside a Bush Administration request in early September to put off a request for $10 billion in loan guarantees or face a confrontation over Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Bush-Shamir Misunderstanding **********It is now evident that Israel's supporters in Congress have decided not to fight the Administration and will postpone dealing with the loan guarantee issue until after a Middle East peace conference begins. **********The lack of communication between Mr. Shamir and President Bush goes back to the very first meeting between the two men in the Oval Office in April 1989, when Mr. Bush expressed his displeasure over Israeli settlement-building practices and Mr. Shamir responded, \"It won't be a problem.\" **********Mr. Shamir meant that if the Israelis really have an Arab partner for peace talks, settlements will not be an obstacle to peace. What Mr. Bush thought he heard, though, was a commitment from Mr. Shamir to slow down or stop settlement-building, and when just the opposite happened as soon as Mr. Shamir returned to Israel, the seeds of Mr. Bush's personal wrath with Mr. Shamir were firmly planted.  Loan Guarantees Delayed **********Mr. Bush's focus on Israeli settlements grows out of a longstanding American belief that an accord between Israel and the Arabs will only come about in a trade of land for peace, and if Israel builds housing all over the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, no trade will be possible. **********The tension between Mr. Shamir and Mr. Bush dating back to that first meeting hung over their relationship. In early 1990, Israel appealed to the Bush Administration for $400 million in housing loan guarantees to help resettle Soviet immigrants who were flooding in. **********The guarantees sailed through Congress, but they did not become available for almost nine months while Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d negotiated with the Israeli Foreign Minister, David Levy, an unusual letter in which Israel for the first time promised not to use the money to settle Soviet Jews \"beyond the green line\" dividing Israel proper from the territories occupied in the 1967 War. The expectation in Washington was that as a result of that letter there would be no increase in Israeli settlement activity of any kind, whereas the view in Jerusalem was that Israel had agreed not to spend the $400 million in the territories, but that it could spend its own money. **********Mr. Levy also agreed to provide Mr. Baker with certain financial data to assure the Americans that their money was not going into the West Bank. Baker and Levy Letter **********The Levy letter was signed on Oct. 2, 1990, and the $400 million in guarantees was granted. After the new year, though, it became apparent to the Israelis that the number of Soviet Jews that could descend on them could reach a million, far more than anticipated, and therefore their housing and absorption requirements would be much greater. **********In between all of that the Persian Gulf War intruded and Israel sought a special aid infusion from the Bush Administration -- over and above the annual $3 billion it receives for economic and military assistance -- to compensate for losses it incurred from Iraqi Scud missile attacks and increased defense spending. **********The Bush Administration, beholden to Israel for not retaliating against Iraq, agreed after a period of bargaining to a one-time grant of $650 million in cash -- on the condition that Israel not ask for any more extra aid of any kind until after Labor Day, when the Administration hoped it would be too late to get the request through Congress this fiscal year. **********Between March and Labor Day, the President was privately seething over what he believed was Israeli non-compliance with the Levy letter of October and the fact that every time Mr. Baker came to Israel on his peace missions a new settlement was erected. Despite the Levy letter, Israeli settlements in the occupied territories were increasing instead of decreasing and the financial data Israel promised was not forthcoming. At a news conference on July 1, Mr. Bush said he did not think there \"ought to be a quid pro quo\" between a halt on settlements freeze and loan guarantees, but he implored the Israelis to live up to the Levy letter. Lobbying Campaign in U.S. **********But Mr. Baker was obsessed with putting a peace conference together, and while he regularly spoke to the Israelis about problems he had with settlements, he acceded to their demand that a halt on settlement not be made a precondition for the peace conference, and sold that to the Arabs. **********The Israeli Government began talking about the need for $10 billion in housing loan guarantees and the Israeli lobby, the American Israel-Public Affairs Committee, or Aipac, and every other major American Jewish group began organizing a lobbying campaign that would culminate after Labor Day to insure that the Israelis got the money through Congress. **********The Israeli Government was aware of how President Bush was feeling, because Israel's Ambassador to Washington, Zalman Shoval, was hearing it from his sources. But Mr. Shamir apparently did not take his warnings seriously. On June 22, Mr. Shoval, in an unsual move, went public. Asked in an interview with Israel Radio whether the $10 billion in loan guarantees was assured, he answered: \"Very probably there will be a difficulty. The Government of Israel with all the data in its hands may have to decide whether the issue of settlement is a priority or that the issue of aid is a priority. Sometimes there are moments and there are issues where governments have to take decisions.\" **********For his candor, Mr. Shoval was berated by his superiors. Mr. Shamir apparently thought the Administration was simply using the loan issue as leverage to get him to say yes to Mr. Baker's peace conference. **********But he had received other warnings. On July 25, Vice President Dan Quayle personally warned the Israeli Defense Minister, Moshe Arens, when he visited Washington that linkage was a possibility if Israel did not curb settlements. **********In early August, though, Mr. Shamir finally told Mr. Baker that Israel would come to his peace conference and Israeli officials said at the time that they assumed that the Shamir \"yes\" to the conference meant that the housing guarantees were assured. **********While Baker aides say they never told the Israelis that, Mr. Baker, still focused on his peace conference, also did not explicitly tell Mr. Shamir that the Administration intended to hold up the guarantees until it got even more restrictions on Israeli settlements. **********A few days later, after Mr. Baker returned from the Middle East, senior Administration Middle East experts began focusing on the gauarantees. It became clear to them then that President Bush had no intention of granting the guarantees without restrictions that would finally either freeze or severely curtail Israeli building. Mr. Bush is said to have literally laughed at the notion that the sort of understandings Mr. Levy agreed to for the $400 million guarantee would be satisfactory for the $10 billion. **********Meanwhile, Aipac and other Jewish organizations were putting the finishing touches on their lobbying campaigns for the guarantees. **********Over the Labor Day weekend, Secretary Baker telephoned Mr. Shamir twice and asked him to delay the loan request for four months. But Mr. Shamir said he could not do that. He had just concluded an exhausting domestic budget battle in which he agreed to increase the defense budget by cutting the housing budget and the only way he could limit the damage to his housing budget was by assuming that the loan guarantees would come this fiscal year. It was already written into the Israeli budget. **********The guarantees would enable Israel to borrow $10 billion from banks over the next five years at reduced interest rates, since the United States would be giving its assurance that it would meet any principal or interest payments that Israel could not make. Israeli officials, noting that Israel's credit rating is fairly good, say there would be no need for Washington to pay any money. **********When Mr. Baker got no satisfaction from Mr. Shamir, the Administration turned to Congress to delay the issue for 120 days, which it now appears ready to do. **********In four months, the Administration will again try to link Israeli housing guarantees with some sort of suspension of Israeli settlements. But the Administration apparently hopes that by then the Arab-Israeli peace conference will be well underway and they can use their leverage over Israel on that issue to help forge the first interim deal in that conference: Israel suspends settlements in return for the Arab countries' suspending their boycott of Israel and the Palestinians' suspending their uprising."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/21/world/mexico-city-journal-a-daring-magazine-and-its-awkward-questions.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Uhlig", "pub_date": "1991-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 914, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Daring Magazine and Its Awkward Questions", "print_headline": "MEXICO CITY JOURNAL; A Daring Magazine and Its Awkward Questions", "body_text": " **********If the editors of Mexico's newest monthly magazine had merely wanted to print their own views about Mexican politics and society, no one might have cared. What has stirred critics of the new magazine, Este Pais, is a much more delicate editorial goal: to publish what the Mexican people think about themselves. **********Started by a group of intellectuals and public servants that spans the spectrum of Mexican politics, the new publication has been designed to include extensive monthly opinion polls and analysis of national attitudes, exploring public feelings on everything from politics to corruption to religious behavior. **********But in a society where such surveys are carefully managed and seldom published, that proposition has surrounded the magazine with controversy, even before the publication of its first issue, which is scheduled to come out next month. **********Government officials portray the magazine as an opposition tool, opposition parties are wary of its electoral implications, and, in general, the idea of putting cherished political myths to a statistical test appears to have challenged the comfortable ambiguity that pervades much of Mexican scholarship and political life.  A Tradition Is Lacking **********\"If you think about political science in the United States, you think about polls, statistics, that kind of thing,\" said Federico Reyes Heroles, a 36-year-old political scientist and novelist who is to edit the new publication. \"But in Mexico, political science means philosophy. We don't have a tradition of fact in Mexico, even in economics.\" **********Although scientific soundings of national opinion are routinely commissioned by Mexican political parties and the Government itself, they have seldom formed an important part of public debate. Moreover, rarely if ever have they presented a full-scale portrait of values and social attitudes in a country where national stereotypes have long substituted for direct investigations of public thinking. **********Among other findings presented in its first few issues, editors say, the new magazine will scrutinize traditional conceptions about Mexican nationalism, citing recent polling data that show just 56 percent of Mexicans to be \"very proud\" of their nationality, down nearly 10 percent from survey results a decade ago, and fully 20 percent below the corresponding figure for the United States. **********Similarly, according to figures compiled by the magazine, the number of Mexicans who are ready to fight for their country in case of war has fallen from 90 percent in 1981 to less than 75 percent last year. **********Other issues will deal with delicate social and political questions, ranging from confidence in public institutions to family relations to moral issues. For example, Mexican respondents in recent polls expressed a lower level of trust in their family members than did American or Canadian respondents. And the number of Mexicans who described themselves as \"very religious\" was just over 40 percent -- less than the corresponding figure for American respondents.  Some Are Uneasy **********The striking unpredictability of those figures -- and the prospect of having such data published and analyzed systematically in the pages of Este Pais -- has prompted conspicuous unease from many politicians and business people with a stake in the traditional order of Mexican society. **********Citing the opposition ties of Mr. Reyes, who gave up his membership in the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party to form the magazine late last year, many party and Government officials have hurried to denounce the journal as an anti-Government project. **********\"It seems clear at this point that this is going to be strictly an opposition magazine,\" a Government official said. **********But ownership of the magazine has been structured around a diverse group of 200 principal shareholders, each of whom is permitted only one vote in decisions on magazine policy, regardless of financial investment. And Mr. Reyes and his colleagues have taken care to insure that the group spans the broadest range of Mexican politicians and intellectuals, ranging from opposition economists to sitting Governors from the ruling party. **********The magazine's founders' list also includes an eclectic, nonvoting group of foreign associates that includes many of the most distinguished American academic experts on Mexican government and society. **********\"This is something that could help reduce cynicism about Mexican politics,\" said Susan Kaufman Purcell, a foreign associate of the magazine who is vice president of the Americas Society, a prominent New York-based group dedicated to the study of Latin American affairs. **********\"The problem at this point is that the Mexican people don't trust declarations and statements and rhetoric. So to the extent that you can start basing things on more scientific kinds of studies, the people may have more confidence.\" **********As now envisioned, the magazine will conduct many of its own polls, overseen by Miguel Basanez, a well-known Mexican political scientist who is president of the magazine's board of directors. But its editors say they also plan to use polls conducted by academic institutions, foreign experts, multilateral institutions and other investigators, making full disclosure of the samples and methods used in each to provide the clearest possible portrait of Mexican thinking. **********Dr. Purcell and others caution that the test of Este Pais's success will lie in the magazine's ability to maintain a political balance in the kinds of questions it seeks to explore, as well as the scientific accuracy of the results. But that concern is viewed more as a challenge than a limitation by the editors of the magazine, who say they have planned from the start to let the political chips fall where they may. **********\"Everyone is very anxious about what we are going to find,\" Mr. Reyes said. \"But that is exactly the point -- nobody really knows.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/16/business/selloff-hits-compaq-on-profit-news.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1991-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 855, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Selloff Hits Compaq on Profit News", "print_headline": "Selloff Hits Compaq on Profit News", "body_text": " **********Shares of the Compaq Computer Corporation lost more than a quarter of their value today after the company said it expected earnings to plummet at least 79 percent this quarter, mainly because of a sharp downturn in orders from some big retailers. **********Joseph R.

Revenues were likely to drop more than 15 percent below the $862 million posted in the period a year ago.  Second Big Drop **********It was the second big dent in Compaq's market value in three weeks. On April 25 it reported lower-than-anticipated growth in sales and earnings for the first quarter and gave its first warning of the current quarter's woes. Its stock fell 15 percent then. **********This quarter's troubles represent \"the first real disappointment from Compaq,\" said Mark D. Stahlman, technology analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., in New York. Growth in worldwide sales of business personal computers has slowed to less than 10 percent a year, he said, and investors considered Compaq ill prepared to compete in other, faster-growing niches in the computer industry. **********Mr. Stahlman said he had reduced his forecast for Compaq profits this year to $2.10 a share from $4.90 after the announcement. **********Jim Poyner, who follows Compaq for William K. Woodruff & Company, a Dallas brokerage, said Compaq erred by not using specialty retailers or hiring its own sales force as alternatives to the retail dealers now in retreat.  Seeking New Markets **********\"The distribution strategy should have changed more than a year ago,\" he said. \"This is what happens when you put all of your eggs in that one basket.\" **********The Houston-based company is trying to challenge Sun Microsystems, Digital Equipment, I.B.M. and others in work stations and minicomputers as it moves beyond the personal-computer market, where lower-price rivals like Dell Computer and AST Research have gained ground this year in notebook models. **********Compaq disclosed the news on its second-quarter earnings on the eve of its annual shareholders meeting, scheduled on Thursday in Houston. Mr. Canion said in an interview today that Compaq learned some of its major dealers had trimmed orders in the last few days because recent mergers among them left them with too much inventory. Also, the strong dollar is reducing profits from European sales and unit sales remain flat to lower in the United States, he said. **********Three of the nation's 10 biggest computer dealers were acquired earlier this year by other major dealers amid a shakeout in computer retailing. Inacomp merged with Balcom, Compucom bought the Computer Factory and Computerland, the largest, acquired Nynex's retail stores. **********Mr. Canion said sales by major dealers of Compaq products appeared to be unaffected by the consolidations, and that the company's market share probably increased since it announced price cuts last month. But the slowdown in dealer orders from Compaq could last through most of the summer, he said.  Oversupply in Stores **********Computerland, for instance, found a 12-week supply of Compaq machines in Nynex stores, and plans to pare those inventories to no more than eight weeks before stepping up orders, he said. **********\"This will be with us a few months, but it is not a long-term factor,\" he said. \"You might say some channels were less efficient than others in managing their inventory. Once that inventory bubble is passed, it will have a positive impact on our overall distribution.\" **********But some analysts said Compaq, which earned $114.3 million, or $1.26 a share, in the first quarter, would struggle for profits in the months ahead. Price cuts from rivals are anticipated soon, and Compaq, burdened by high costs, could be unwilling to chop prices again after cutting them by as much as 34 percent on some models last month. **********Mr. Canion conceded that the April price cuts had squeezed profits, but insisted that the decline was temporary and \"will be offset over a period of time by increased volume.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/04/business/executives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "body_text": " *********** Cyprus Minerals Co., Denver, named Chester B.

McDonnell, made a shocking request of the Pentagon. **********McDonnell Douglas, Mr. McDonnell wrote in a letter to Undersecretary of Defense Donald J. Yockey, was suffering through a cash crunch caused by a mounting debt load, weapons-contract cancellations and problems in its commercial aircraft division. Shut off from further bank financing and worried about the company's ability to handle any unexpected problems, Mr. McDonnell asked the Pentagon to give McDonnell Douglas an advance on its weapons-contract payments. A billion dollars would be sufficient, he wrote. **********The notion of the nation's largest military contractor seeking a financial lifeline from the Government in the midst of a war jolted Pentagon officials, who kept the request a secret at the company's behest until it was uncovered by Congressional investigators in July. The request was never granted and was ultimately withdrawn by McDonnell Douglas last spring, when its cash crunch eased. But the episode added fuel to longstanding rumors questioning the viability of the company, the No. 2 builder of commercial jetliners, behind the Boeing Company, and the third-largest supplier to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  Back From the Bottom **********Yet from that nadir just eight months ago, McDonnell Douglas has rebounded sharply, with a cost-cutting program imposed last year by Mr. McDonnell helping it to post stronger earnings and pare its swollen debt load substantially. While its troubles are by no means completely behind it, McDonnell Douglas is recovering from a period of intense upheaval, confident not only of surviving the shriveling of the weapons business, but also of emerging as a more potent competitor in jetliners to Boeing and the European Airbus consortium. **********Increasing sales of commercial aircraft may well offset the military slide. The company forecasts that its commercial sales, which accounted for 34 percent of its 1990 revenue of $16.2 billion, will grow to 53 percent of sales by 1995. In a sign of its confidence, McDonnell Douglas is moving ahead with plans for a new jetliner, the MD-12X, to be built with a foreign partner in a direct challenge to Boeing's successful 747-400 long-range wide-body. **********\"I think they've really turned the corner,\" said Jerry Cantwell, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company. **********But not everyone is upbeat about the company's prospects. Short sellers, who bet on declines in the prices of particular stocks, own the equivalent of 13.3 percent of McDonnell Douglas's outstanding shares. They and others point to a long list of questions about McDonnell Douglas's future. **********The St. Louis-based company faces the end of some of its biggest weapons programs, including the Air Force's F-15 fighter and the Army's Apache helicopter, and it lost out this spring on competitions to build their replacements. It remains exposed to potentially crippling losses from contract disputes with the Pentagon over several troubled programs, including the Navy's A-12 bomber, a joint venture of McDonnell Douglas and the General Dynamics Corporation that was canceled in January by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Air Force and Pentagon auditors have calculated that McDonnell Douglas also faces losses ranging from a few hundred million dollars to more than $2 billion on the development of the new C-17 military transport plane. The company insists that it expects no significant loss and that it will ultimately earn billions of dollars if the Air Force goes ahead with plans to buy 120 of the planes. **********And now, with the company's future resting more than ever on the commercial aircraft business, the airline industry is cutting back on airplane orders as the weaker carriers grapple with financial woes and some of the stronger ones retrench. **********\"The worst is behind us,\" said Mr. McDonnell, the 53-year-old son of the company's founder, James S. McDonnell Jr., who died in 1980. \"But we have a long way to go before we're at a level I think we can be proud of.\" **********In some areas, McDonnell Douglas has already come a long way. It has slashed its costs, in large part by laying of nearly 20,000 employees, or 15 percent of its work force, over the last 15 months. It has kept profit margins high in its remaining Pentagon business in St. Louis, and has won some vital new business, including a contract to build an upgraded version of the Navy's F/A-18 fighter.  A Rehabilitated Douglas **********Perhaps most important, it has finally shored up its Douglas Aircraft division in Long Beach, Calif., the home of the company's commercial aircraft business, after decades of abysmal performance. Although its margins remain slim, the division turned profitable in the fourth quarter of last year when it began delivering its new MD-11 wide-body jetliner, ending years of heavy investments in its development. After a decade in production, the midrange narrow-body MD-80 aircraft has at last become consistently profitable. Douglas also got a lift when the one military program it manages, the C-17, flew for the first time earlier this month, albeit more than a year behind schedule. (The C-17 is part of Douglas rather than McDonnell because it is a transport, not a combat, aircraft. **********Overall, said Robert H. Hood Jr., the president of Douglas, the division should post higher operating profits this year than in any year since the McDonnell Aircraft Company of St. Louis merged with Douglas Aircraft of Long Beach, Calif., in 1967. Mr. Cantwell of Wertheim Schroder projected 1991 profits for Douglas at $120 million, compared with a $177 million loss last year. **********With Douglas finally profitable, the parent company has had enough money to begin paying off debt, much of it taken on to finance the MD-11 development program. The debt, which peaked at $3.3 billion in the first quarter, was reduced to $2.9 billion as of June 30, and analysts think it could shrink to as little as $2.5 billion by year-end, significantly easing the pressure on the balance sheet. **********The turnaround comes after nearly three years of tumult, some of it induced by the rapid shrinkage of the weapons business and some by Mr.  McDonnell's decision after taking over in 1988 that shock therapy was in order, especially at Douglas. **********Douglas Aircraft had been unable to keep up with Boeing as far back as the dawn of the jet age in the 1950's, and the merger with McDonnell did little to change things. Despite a generally healthy backlog of orders, Douglas did not turn an annual operating profit after 1974, primarily because its engineers and workers could not build aircraft quickly enough. **********Mr. McDonnell, a self-effacing engineer who joined the company in 1962, determined quickly that, given the coming decline in weapons orders, the company would no longer be able to count on the steady profitability of its combat-aircraft division in St. Louis to make up for the chronic weakness of Douglas in California.  A Radical Departure **********\"It was time to bite the bullet and systematically change the way business was done\" at Douglas, Mr. McDonnell said in an interview during a trip to California last week. **********His solution, announced early in 1989, was a radically new management approach, built around a philosophy called the Total Quality Management System, or TQMS. One of the approach's primary tenets is to push responsibility and authority down the organizational chart as far as possible. At Douglas, it was often pushed down to the production line, where, under TQMS, workers, supervisors and engineers were supposed to work together in teams to solve problems and increase efficiency. **********At first, the approach did little except alienate and confuse production workers and managers alike, with some joking that TQMS stood for \"Time to Quit and Move to Seattle,\" the home of Boeing. In fact, many of the improvements in Douglas's performance seem to stem primarily from more disciplined and aggressive management rather than from teamwork. For example, instead of allowing the three shifts of workers on the MD-80 production line to use three different techniques for applying the metal skin to the plane's nose cone, as it always had, the company studied which technique was most efficient and then directed all three shifts to use that technique. **********Still, the TQMS approach clearly helped, especially on the MD-80 line. It now takes the company 19 weeks to build an MD-80, down from 30 weeks at the beginning of 1990. Although it is difficult to measure because the programs are still in their early phases, company executives say they are convinced TQMS has helped on the MD-11 and C-17 programs as well. **********\"It played a key part in getting us where we are,\" Mr. Hood said. **********But TQMS may not have helped profitability as much as the huge number of layoffs Mr. McDonnell ordered last year to cut the entire corporation's costs by more than $700 million a year. At Douglas, thousands of middle managers, as well as some production workers, lost their jobs. **********The company will need its lower cost structure to weather the downturn in commercial aircraft demand. The airline industry has been growing weaker, with troubled carriers like Eastern disappearing and strong companies like American Airlines ordering fewer new planes and in some cases canceling orders. **********For Douglas, the effects have been most apparent in a falloff in orders for its twin-jet MD-80, used mostly on medium-length domestic routes. Through the first six months of the year, total orders for the MD-80 and a planned upgrade called the MD-90 had declined by 90, to 309 firm orders and 409 tentative \"option\" orders. For the same period, there were no net new orders for the longer-range, wide-body MD-11, whose backlog stood at 160 firm orders and 197 options as of June 30. **********Douglas now faces the possibility that it will not have enough orders to run the MD-80 and MD-11 production lines profitably after next year, analysts said. The weak market will also make it harder for the company to reach the 301 MD-11 deliveries it needs to recoup its $3 billion investment in that program. **********\"The cost-cutting moves McDonnell Douglas has made appear to be paying off, but the problem is that the market for their products has weakened over the same time period,\" said Steve Binder, an analyst at Bear Stearns & Company. **********McDonnell Douglas executives acknowledge that the MD80/90 production line will have to be slowed because of the weakened order book, but they say they are optimistic about the outlook for the larger MD-11. American Airlines, they said, has expressed some interest in modernizing its fleet of Douglas DC-10's instead of buying new planes, which probably would have come from Boeing and Airbus. American, meanwhile, has indicated that it may still go ahead with plans to buy more MD-11's for many of its new overseas routes. A Test of Demand **********\"It's a cyclical business,\" Mr. McDonnell said. \"As sure as it's going down, the business is going to come back again in a few years. And right now, we have a luxury we haven't had at this point in the cycle in the past, which is a big backlog.\" **********It is still unclear whether enough airlines will have sufficient confidence in the future -- and in McDonnell Douglas -- to start ordering the proposed MD-12X, a larger variant of the MD-11. The company's board, at its meeting next month, is expected to authorize the company to begin soliciting orders for the new plane, a key test of demand. **********But the program will hinge on more than orders. In a sharp break with its past, McDonnell Douglas is seeking to cut much of the multibillion-dollar risk of developing the new plane by signing a deal with one or more partners who would take ownership positions in the project. At least one of the partners is likely to be Asian -- the current speculation centers on Mitsui of Japan -- because of McDonnell Douglas's criteria that any partner provide access to a low-wage work force and to a fast-growing market like the Pacific Rim. **********Some analysts question whether the company will be able to afford the several billion dollars it will take to develop the MD-12X, especially if MD-80 and MD-11 orders do not rebound quickly. Mr. McDonnell said that with a strong partner and an efficient new assembly plant in the United States -- the company has ruled out building the plane in Long Beach and is evaluating a half-dozen other cities -- McDonnell Douglas will have the resources it needs. **********\"We're not going to launch it until we can do it in a way we are satisfied will not bet the company,\" Mr. McDonnell said. **********Boeing uses Japanese companies as major suppliers, but neither Boeing nor McDonnell Douglas has ever taken on equity partners for an airplane. Mr. McDonnell said any deal will also be complicated by the company's desire to structure it in a way that will minimize the chances its new partner might someday become an unwelcome low-cost competitor, a fear that has plagued relations between American aerospace companies and their counterparts in Japan and South Korea for the last several years. **********\"The U.S. is not going to stay a leader in aerospace by becoming Fortress America. We're going to stay a leader by sharing today's technology while developing tomorrow's,\" Mr. McDonnell said. **********For now, however, Mr. McDonnell said he is convinced the company can do what it must to continue growing and becoming more profitable. **********\"We've all been through the fire,\" he said. \"We've all been hardened in the forge these last couple of years.\" A PENTAGON BAILOUT? **********Has McDonnell Douglas been the beneficiary of an unacknowledged bail out effort by the Pentagon? The company and the Pentagon say no, but two Congressional committees are not sure. They are looking into decisions by the Government that they say greatly aided the company. **********In February, for example, just a few weeks after canceling the Navy's A-12 bomber, the Pentagon said it would not immediately force McDonnell Douglas and its partner on the program, General Dynamics, to repay more than $650 million each the Government claims it is owed from work paid for but never completed. The Pentagon, which could have demanded immediate payment, did not give up its claim on the money, but said it would settle the matter in court. The case is not expected to be resolved for years. **********Investigators for a subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee are studying whether the Pentagon funneled additional money to the company on the Air Force's C-17 program. Pentagon officials have denied making any unauthorized payments and McDonnell Douglas has denied receiving any. **********But critics remain unconvinced. The House Oversight and Investigations Committee has planned a hearing for Thursday. The Operations subcommittee will hold hearings later in October. BIDING TIME FOR BAD NEWS **********The earnings of McDonnell Douglas have improved, its debt is down and its stock price is up sharply.

If you are one of them, you should start thinking now about how you will comply. **********Precisely half of the estimated $5.2 billion needed to pay for the benefits will come from changing the rules for paying estimated taxes beginning in 1992. The changes will remain on the books through 1996. **********For those five years, many taxpayers with incomes over $75,000 will be forced to calculate their income on a quarterly basis and \"pay as they go\" rather than submit the same tax they paid the previous year, an option that is referred to as a \"safe harbor\" under current rules. The change will mean more paperwork -- and higher accountants' bills -- for many of those affected. And in some cases, it will result in an overpayment of taxes for which a refund may not be available for nearly a year. **********Estimated quarterly taxes are paid by those who do not have money withheld at their job or who do not have enough withheld because they have additional earnings from outside work or investment income. These people must make estimated tax payments on April 15, June 15, Sept. 15 and Jan. 15. **********For simplicity's sake, many pay the same amount they paid the year before, split into four chunks. At the end of the year, a full return is filed and any taxes owed are paid. This \"safe harbor\" approach is particularly advantageous to people with rapidly rising or erratic incomes, to active investors and to people who receive their income from partnerships, like lawyers and accountants, and often don't know until year end just what their compensation will be. **********Under the new rules, though, taxpayers who meet three conditions will not be eligible for the safe harbor treatment. To be affected, a taxpayer must have adjusted gross income of more than $75,000 and the amount must exceed the previous year's income by at least $40,000. The taxpayer must also have paid estimated taxes in at least one of the three prior years. Those affected will have to calculate their taxes quarterly and pay at least 90 percent of taxes due for that portion of the year. Otherwise, they will be subject to stiff penalties and interest. **********The problem is that overpayments may result for those who earn a great deal early in the year and little or nothing later on. If that happens, a refund cannot be claimed until a final return is filed. **********The income thresholds for the new rules are established for taxpayers who are married, filing jointly. It is not clear whether they are the same for individuals. Henry Holmes, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, said there were no separate income levels for individuals in the legislation. \"The I.R.S. will have to go back and look at committee reports to see if the same levels are applicable,\" he said. **********The I.R.S. says that about 12.5 million of the 114.5 million individual taxpayers file estimated taxes. Although the agency predicts that only 500,000 will be forced to accelerate payments, most of the other 12 million will have to become familiar with the new rules to make certain they don't apply. **********There are a couple of exceptions to the rules. Taxpayers will be allowed to use the old \"safe harbor\" for the first-quarter payment on April 15 each year. But then they must \"catch up\" with the next payment, making certain that they have paid 90 percent of taxes due at midyear. **********Taxpayers who did not file estimated taxes for three years, and were not required to, will escape the reach of the new rules. And there is an exception for proceeds from the sale of a principal residence. **********But the rules will leave plenty of taxpayers with far more complicated tax preparation tasks. \"There's no question that they've made it much harder for people,\" said Larry Elkin, manager in charge of personal financial planning for Arthur Andersen & Company in New York. **********Consider what might happen to an active investor who has a $100,000 capital gain in May. That investor will have to pay $28,000 in taxes on that amount on June 15 because the capital gains rate is 28 percent. **********But suppose the investor has a $100,000 capital loss in October. While that erases the earlier tax liability, the taxpayer cannot immediately ask for a refund. \"There is no provision for getting this money back until you file your tax return the following year,\" said Laurence I. Foster, a tax partner at KPMG Peat Marwick in New York. **********The new rules will also eliminate what accountants like to call a \"planning opportunity\" for taxpayers who plan to sell appreciated property. Under the old rules, accountants advised clients to sell appreciated property in January so they could bank the capital gain until taxes were due a year from April. \"You could have had a 15-month deferral on taxes due,\" said Vincent D. Vaccaro, partner at Coopers & Lybrand in New York. \"That deferral will be eliminated under the new rules.\" **********The same is true for bonuses and other incentive compensation customarily paid in January. Companies are required to withhold only 20 percent of such payments, Mr. Vaccaro said. But under the new rules, you may be liable for additional estimated taxes if your bonus or other incentive compensation sharply increases your income.AVOIDING THE HARSHER RULE **********Accountants are already beginning to look for \"planning opportunities\" in the new estimated tax rules. For example, Laurence I. Foster, partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, suggests that some people may profit by doing \"quarterly planning,\" or moving sales of appreciated property from one quarter to the next. **********Lorin D. Luchs, partner at BDO Seidman's national tax office, says he will advise clients who can do so to pay their tax through withholding rather than make estimated payments so they can preserve the opportunity to use the old rule on an important occasion, if need be. **********The old rule can still be used by those who did not file estimated taxes during the previous three years, among other exceptions. **********\"If you pay everything through withholding, then you're not tainted by the payment of estimated taxes,\" Mr. Luchs said. **********Thus, if a taxpayer wanted to sell a piece of appreciated property and delay paying tax on the gain, he or she could use the old \"safe harbor\" rule for one year, paying estimated taxes that equaled the total tax from the previous year. **********For the same reason, Vincent D. Vaccaro of Coopers & Lybrand says he will look at the withholding for clients who receive large lump sums like bonuses early in the year. There may be an advantage to withholding more than the required 20 percent from these lump sums so that the client will not be required to make an estimated payment later in the year, similarly \"tainting\" that year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/24/business/company-news-genentech-enters-research-venture.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-09-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 104, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Genentech Enters Research Venture", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Genentech Enters Research Venture", "body_text": " **********Genentech Inc. and Incyte Pharmaceuticals have signed an agreement to develop a drug to treat septic shock, an often fatal condition arising from bacterial infections.

Now comes the hard part. **********Later this month, Procter & Gamble will report how severely the recession has punished the 97 percent of its business that is not cosmetics. **********In recent months, securities analysts have been steadily whittling their forecasts for P.&G.'s third-quarter earnings, from about $1.29 a share to about $1.20 or less. That compares with $1.14 a share in the 1990 quarter. Modest or flat unit sales growth in the United States, where P.&G. does more than 60 percent of its business, is to blame for the weak expectations, analysts say. **********Despite the soft short-term outlook, many analysts think Procter & Gamble has strong growth possibilities, especially in its stock price. Yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, P.&G. gained $1.875 a share to close at $89.375, almost 18 times estimated 1991 earnings. Jay H. Freedman, a consumer-products analyst at Kidder, Peabody, thinks that the share price could reach $110 in the next year and a half. **********Getting there may be a bumpy road, however. Although many consumer-products companies are perceived by investors as safe harbors in a recession, they are nonetheless harmed when increasing numbers of consumers lose their jobs, or even when those still employed begin to cut back spending. Analysts say that an internal P.&G. survey found that 18 out of 24 markets that the company serves -- including detergents and toothpaste -- are showing soft or declining unit sales. **********Added to that is the fact that population growth in the United States has been only 1 percent or so a year. So, the supply of consumers with money in their pockets is growing slowly even without a recession. In addition, supermarkets and mass merchandisers have built too many stores, adding to the pressure to stock less. **********Procter & Gamble is especially vulnerable when people curtail spending because the typical American home offers a cavalcade of the Cincinnati giant's products. Wake up in the morning and you can wash with Ivory soap, shampoo with Pert Plus and brush your teeth with Crest. Don't forget the Secret deodorant. Still groggy? Have some Folgers coffee. Before you leave the house, be sure to load the dishwasher with Cascade detergent and the washing machine with Tide laundry detergent. **********But even such a roster of strong brands cannot entirely offset some apparent trends in the marketplace. Analysts say that retailers, despite already lean inventories, are continuing to cut back, a development affecting many packaged-goods companies. Bonita Austin, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, said the Colgate-Palmolive Company reported that some of its supermarket accounts were maintaining inventories of 1.5 weeks on some products, compared with 3 weeks, only a few months ago. \"Even three weeks isn't a whole lot,\" Ms. Austin said. **********Inventories may be thinning because money-conscious consumers are stocking up less, buying one bottle of shampoo instead of two, for instance. **********Moreover, there is scattered evidence that consumers, either newly jobless or simply cautious, are increasingly \"trading down\" to cheaper generic or store brands for detergents, toilet paper, toothpaste and other consumer goods. The strength of the trend isn't clear yet, however. Ms. Austin notes that Helene Curtis Industries is reporting booming sales of its budget Suave shampoo, but is also seeing strong sales of its higher-priced Salon Selective. **********The hazards of recession have focused Procter & Gamble's attention on acquiring health and beauty lines. In recent years, it bought such brand products as Nyquil cold remedy, Oil of Olay moisturizing cream and Cover Girl cosmetics, and last week, it made the Max Factor deal. **********Health and beauty products have above-average growth possibilities in unit sales, perhaps 3 percent to 5 percent annually, because the population is aging and older consumers are more likely to buy products like P.&G.'s Pepto-Bismol. A growth rate of 2 percent or so is expected for P.&G.'s more basic products, like laundry detergent. **********Profits, too, can be above average in health and beauty products, another attraction for P.&G. Alice Beebe Longley, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said a successful fragrance could have a profit margin as high as 40 percent, compared with 10 percent or 11 percent for detergents. **********Not all analysts, of course, are excited about Procter & Gamble's Max Factor deal, which at least doubled, to about $1.6 billion, the company's revenues from cosmetics and fragrance lines. Mary Ann Winter, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, noted that those revenues would still be only a small part of Procter & Gamble's total, which was $24 billion in the 1990 fiscal year. **********Ms. Winter, who has been neutral on P.&G. since the start of the recession and the onset of the Persian Gulf crisis, said: \"I'm not excited about the deal. I'm not against the deal. I'd like to see how the company as a whole performs in the next few months.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/04/business/markets-closed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 16, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Markets Closed", "print_headline": "Markets Closed", "body_text": " **********Because of the Fourth of July holiday, financial markets in the United States are closed today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/27/business/credit-markets-bonds-post-modest-rise-in-light-day.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1991-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 625, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bonds Post Modest Rise in Light Day", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Bonds Post Modest Rise in Light Day", "body_text": " **********Bond prices rose modestly yesterday on the strength of slight buying by mutual funds and other investors who had cash but were not willing to keep it invested in low-yielding short-term securities. **********By late in the day, the 8 percent Treasury bonds due in 2021 were offered at 105 7/8, up by an eighth of a point on the day, to yield 7.50 percent, compared with 7.51 percent late on Tuesday.

As the people here say, the tiger has come out of the mountains. **********The tiger is China's so-called Third Line of industry, built mostly in the 1960's. Fearing attack by the United States or the Soviet Union, Mao Zedong ordered 2,000 companies representing a large share of China's industrial and military capacity removed from vulnerable coastal areas to remote hillside towns in the country's interior. Mao thought that the Communists could rely on that Third Line of industry even if an enemy attacked the coast. **********It was an extraordinary scheme, the most daring and perhaps the most ill-considered industrial relocation plan that any country had ever attempted. From the mid-1960's to the mid-1970's, nearly half of China's budget went to Third Line construction, but the new factories tended to be inefficient because of poor infrastructure and supply lines. Moving Back to Cities **********In this post-Mao, post-cold-war era, the Third Line companies are now moving back to the cities, and in many cases retooling to make consumer goods instead of weapons. Across the nation, enterprises that once produced tanks and missiles and other military products are now making 650 kinds of civilian goods. Here in Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou province, two new industrial zones are filling up with Third Line factories making everything from transistors to automobile headlights. **********\"Intellectuals are very happy with the move, after being in the mountains for two decades,\" said Wang Quan, director of the Guiyang office of the Zhenhua Electronics Industry Corporation, one such enterprise. \"Life is better here, there is entertainment and culture, and there's better education for the kids.\" **********Of the 700,000 industrial workers in Guizhou Province who work in Third Line enterprises, about a third have already moved to the cities or are in the process of doing so, according to Hu Lun, chief economist of the Guizhou Province Planning Commission. Efficiency and Location **********\"We plan to move all our workers to Guiyang,\" said Mr. Wang, of Zhenhua, which has 30,000 employees at 21 factories scattered across Guizhou. \"But that will depend on economics and on how efficient the factories are here.\" **********One of the factories that already has moved and started operations in Guiyang is the Jianxin Machine Factory, a unit of Zhenhua that makes stone cutters, drill presses and other industrial equipment. In the past it exported some goods to Eastern Europe and now the managers are hoping that the improved location will improve exports to the West. **********\"It's much more convenient here,\" said Feng Yisong, a senior engineer of the factory. \"Transportation is much easier, and it's far simpler to make contacts and get a hold of people. So our efficiency is much better now.\" **********The factory shop -- emblazoned with huge red characters across the wall declaring: \"Socialism is Good. The Communist Party is Good\" -- is spacious and is taking advantage of a tax break to install some brand-new equipment in addition to assembly lines brought in from its old location near the town of Duyun. Creating a Society **********The director of the nearby New Cloud Equipment Factory, Long Hanmin, said that though there is a hefty cost to moving the plant and all of its employees to Guiyang, the move will soon pay for itself in improved efficiency and reduced transportation costs. **********\"We used to be a company town and had to create our own society,\" said Mr. Long. \"We had to provide schools, restaurants, a movie theater and a hospital. In Guiyang, we don't have to do any of that.\" **********Mr. Long's factory used to make electronic components for the army, but it shifted a half-dozen years ago to manufacturing similar civilian products, like transistors and capacitors. These days, the transition from military production to civilian production is well underway, not just in Guizhou but throughout China. **********For Guizhou Province, one of the poorest in China, that switch -- coupled with the emergence from the mountains of the Third Line \"tiger\" -- also offers an important opportunity to lure foreign investment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/21/business/now-when-you-re-out-you-re-in.html": {"writer_name": "Anne-marie Schiro", "pub_date": "1991-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1337, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Now, When You're Out You're In", "print_headline": "Now, When You're Out You're In", "body_text": " **********A few years ago, it was just about impossible for a fashion newcomer like Byron Lars to get a foot -- let alone a dress -- inside a major store. Lars? Who had ever heard of him? But last winter the 26-year-old designer packed up the eight samples that were his entire spring line, marched into Henri Bendel and walked away with an order for 80 pieces. **********Now his second collection, for fall, is in 10 stores around the country, including Bloomingdale's in New York, which put his witty clothes in its Lexington Avenue windows in July. **********Mr. Lars is one of the recent brood of fledgling designers to benefit from retailers' new receptiveness toward unproven talent. In the last year or so, major stores long dominated by names like Klein and Armani have been giving valuable floor space to designers like Gemma Kahng, Gordon Henderson, Todd Oldham and Zang Toi. **********Before the buyout wave and the recession hit the retailing industry, unknowns like them had trouble getting store buyers to take their calls. Now the stores are banking on such young designers to bring in the customers without driving up their costs . **********The stores are finding that the eager new designers can often save them the expense of accommodating the major names. Prominent designers can impose minimum orders of $100,000 or $200,000, and not only demand their own in-store boutiques but even dictate the size and decor. Giorgio Armani expects his departments to look like his stark, ultra-modern Milan boutique; Calvin Klein wants soothing beige and brown furniture. The store is expected to foot the bill, and how can a store say no to any of the world's top designers? **********Young designers set no minimums, said Joan Kaner, senior vice president and fashion director of Neiman Marcus. \"They're thrilled to sell you one piece, just so they can be in a big store,\" she said. \"You can pick just what will work for your store and expand later based on performance, delivery and quality.\" **********Ellin Saltzman, senior vice president and corporate fashion director of R. H. Macy & Company, said that to distinguish themselves, stores were looking for fresh young names. \"The stores got so much alike with all the same designers,\" she said. \"They now realize that the safe route of the tried and true is not necessarily the only way. So they're looking for a gimmick, some way to be different. It's a new attitude.\" Returning the Calls **********New designers appreciate the change. \"When we started two years ago,\" Gemma Kahng said, \"we couldn't get anybody to come see us. We called and called and called, and they didn't even return our calls. Then we got some press, and the stores started calling us.\" Her colorful clothes with oversize jeweled buttons are now in many major department and specialty stores, and she expects her wholesale volume to reach $2 million this year. **********Traditionally, newcomers have relied on specialty stores willing to take a chance with a small order of five or six styles, which got the designers started but allowed them little room for growth. Then, two years ago, Lynn Manulis of New York's venerable Martha Park Avenue boutique opened a shop totally devoted to a new generation of designers. Called Martha International, it offered clothes by Christian Francis Roth, Carmelo Pomodoro, Charlotte Neuville and Randolph Duke. Soon, department stores decided they were missing out on a good bet. **********A store can put a few styles from each of several young designers together in one department and see what sells. Macy's Northeast put a New Signatures department in the Herald Square store in New York last year as an experiment; it was successful enough to be expanded to Macy's San Francisco and the company's Bullocks stores. A Growing Trend **********Henri Bendel, which was once well known for discovering new talent, has made its new store on Fifth Avenue a showcase for young designers. **********Nordstrom, the Seattle-based retailer with more than 60 branches, has a department called Savvy where newcomers can get a tryout. Byron Lars is there this fall, along with Gemma Kahng, C. D. Greene, Anna Sui and Randolph Duke. \"I look for items, not names,\" said the Nordstrom buyer, Carrie Fahey, who was one of the first to give Randolph Duke a break. **********Mr. Duke, in business three years, said Nordstrom had saved his operation. \"When you first start, it's good to have the anchor of one department store,\" he said. \"Our anchor was Nordstrom. There was one season where we would have gone under if we didn't have paper from Nordstrom. \" **********At Bloomingdale's, Byron Lars received the most lavish promotion of any new designer since Isaac Mizrahi. Although Mr. Mizrahi beat the odds by attracting major retailers to his first show three years ago, he had the advantage of the contacts with store executives that he developed as an assistant designer for Perry Ellis and Calvin Klein. Mr. Lars, a native of San Francisco with limited experience as a freelance designer, was an unknown quantity. **********\"We don't normally do windows and ads for a new talent,\" said Kalman Ruttenstein, Bloomingdale's vice president for fashion direction. \"This is the first time since Isaac Mizrahi that we pulled out all the stops for a new designer. But we think our customers will respond to Byron. His clothes have a street humor, but they're also very sophisticated and cut beautifully.\" **********What sets the designs by Byron Lars apart is his way of adding an ironic twist to the classics. He uses striped cotton for a shirtdress, adding a man's necktie but also a seductively draped skirt, and he cuts rustic buffalo plaid into feminine full-skirted shapes for coats. The dresses retail for $325; the coats for $750. **********Gambling on new designers is not without its risks. Customers are often reluctant to spend $800 on a jacket by someone they have never heard of. Because it can cost more for a small manufacturer to produce a garment than for a big company that makes thousands of each style, a young designer's clothes can end up priced as high as a well-known designer's. **********A store has to be patient, said Mara Urshel, a senior vice president and general merchandise manager of Saks Fifth Avenue. \"You know up front that the merchandise will not walk out of the store the first day,\" she said. **********Mr. Ruttenstein of Bloomingdale's agrees. \"You can't just buy the clothes and let them sit there,\" he said. \"You have to promote them, and let the customer know about them. And you have to be prepared to give them a few years before you can make money with them.\" **********Another risk for stores is that untried talent is often undercapitalized. \"You may place an order, and it's never sent to you,\" said Ms. Kaner of Neiman Marcus.\" A Sudden Demise **********That has happened to stores that ordered fall merchandise from Michael Leva, who suddenly closed his four-year-old business in July. Faced with a doubling of orders, he could not raise enough capital to buy the fabrics and pay the contractors. **********Mr. Lars hopes to avoid that danger. He sought professional advice from Mary Ann Wheaton, who is in the business of helping to introduce new lines. She determined that he could afford to ship to just 10 stores for fall. \"The hard part for a designer to understand,\" Ms. Wheaton said, \"is that there's a big danger in being immediately successful and growing too quickly.\" **********But by and large, the new designers are thoroughly professional. Andrew Basile, the fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman, said today's young designers were more aware of the need for well-made, high-quality clothing as well as fresh ideas. \"They know they must present a clean, clear point of view that marries value and quality with creativity and ingenuity,\" he said. \"This has all happened in the last two years. It's all come together in one moment.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/25/world/grief-and-bitterness-smolder-in-the-embers-of-a-fatal-fire.html": {"writer_name": "Tim Golden", "pub_date": "1991-03-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2600, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Series", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Grief and Bitterness Smolder In the Embers of a Fatal Fire", "print_headline": "Grief and Bitterness Smolder In the Embers of a Fatal Fire", "body_text": " **********Ruben Valladarez is nearly over the worst of his nightmares, the dreams in which terrified faces of old friends stare through him into the flames consuming the Happy Land Social Club -- dreams from which he wakes crying. **********He has other reminders of the fire that killed 87 people: the light brown scars that wrap around his calves and the thick black ones that crawl over his ribs and thighs like scabs, the scars that paralyze his hands, the scars that run across his face and finally fall like a heavy tear at one end. **********All of that Mr. Valladarez can understand. **********What he cannot fathom is the court case against Julio Gonzalez, the man accused as the arsonist, which has dragged on for a year without so much as a date for trial; the welfare case workers who he says balked at helping his family while he recovered from his burns, and the terrible dispatch with which he saw people stop caring about the fire's victims. **********\"Everyone promised help: $40,000 here, $50,000 there,\" said Mr. Valladarez, a 28-year-old illegal immigrant who used to earn $150 and free beer for three long nights of work as the club's disk jockey. \"It was all a lie.\" **********For the relatives of those who died, the anniversary of the fire today will be a day of prayer in the Tremont section of the Bronx, where a Mass is to be celebrated two blocks from the club, in villages along the northern coast of Honduras, and at cemeteries scattered elsewhere in the Americas. And it will be a day of bitterness as well as pain. Guilt, Loneliness, Poverty **********At a year's distance, the suffering seems to have only begun with the deaths. Like Mr. Valladarez, six other people escaped the burning club only to find their lives a shambles. For them, as for hundreds of people who loved and depended on those who died, the months have been filled with anguish, guilt, loneliness and poverty. **********The fire would have stunned New York simply with its tally of innocent death. But for 16 months and without much difficulty, the Happy Land's proprietors ignored officials who had cited the place as a fire hazard and ordered it vacated. Around the city, scores of other illegal clubs -- many of them, like the Happy Land, sanctuaries from the hardships of immigrant life -- were found to have been doing the same. **********Among the fire's survivors and the relatives of its victims, the outrage has lasted months and perhaps grown. They complain of the inevitable bureaucratic failings: aid checks not received, funeral expenses not remunerated. But this hardly explains their sense of abandonment. That accounting also involves the sudden loss of promising lives, the battering of their dreams, the expectations of support that were inflated by an outpouring of concern and then quickly disappointed. **********What many had initially taken to be a net of help they now describe as a web of cold regulations and promises that cancel out. Their unwanted celebrity -- perversely lavish even by the standards of New York victims -- has quickly given way to anonymity. The same families that once marveled at their adoptive country's generosity and promises of justice now see prejudice and cruel tricks. **********\"Since all of the people in there were Hispanics, everyone washes their hands quickly,\" said Roberto Michell Suazo, a shy 36-year-old who found a way out the club but lost his job, many of his belongings and most of his hopes to the demons that followed him. **********Like Mr. Michell, 59 of the dead were from Honduras, a country where poverty kills every day without drawing much of the world's attention. But there was another common denominator: The Happy Land built its following among Latin soccer players, vigorous young immigrants who stood out from compatriots just by the determination it took them to find homes and jobs in places like the Bronx. Fights Over Painful Remnants **********As suddenly as it choked the dance floor of the club's two-story space at 1959 Southern Boulevard, near East Tremont Avenue, the fire seemed to bare lives that had not had a chance to sort themselves out. **********Social workers still confronting the fire's emotional toll no longer speak of 87 victims, but of hundreds. There are the scores of orphaned children, the 20-odd widows and widowers and the uncounted men and women linked to the victims by everything but marriage. Perhaps a dozen new babies bear the names of loved ones who died. **********In their grief, some families have drawn closer together. Yet there has also been another pattern, in which death has stolen the distance that separated estranged parents from one another and new families in the United States from old families abroad. With nothing else between them, the sides have fought over painful remnants: keepsakes, children, the uncertain promise of huge civil lawsuits. **********The dislocation has been replicated on a broader scale. Last spring, the disaster seemed to bring together the city's scattered and largely poor Honduran community. In the months since, groups that sought unity have seemed to lose momentum, and many victims' relatives have begun keeping to themselves. For the jumble of families from other parts of the hemisphere (only nine victims were listed as Americans), social workers say the sense of isolation has been even worse. Coming Together in Court **********Nowadays, the families' most regular communion takes place on the sixth floor of the Bronx County Courthouse, where they come with a sense of duty they often find hard to explain. **********Stepping patiently through metal detectors, they take seats in a vast paneled room and chat in Spanish until Mr. Gonzalez, the arson suspect, appears. **********Before a hearing earlier this month, the talk went like this: **********\"I had never thought death was so bad,\" said Maria Colon, a woman from Ecuador who was thinking of her Puerto Rican husband. **********\"I thought it was just one more step,\" Dilcia Pineda said, thinking of the Honduran man with whom she had lived. **********One row ahead, Lourdes Robledo was saying, \"I haven't missed one of these hearings -- except when my husband was buried.\" **********And Lydia Rodriguez, a sister of the man who ran the Happy Land and died there, wondered aloud: \"When? When is this going to be resolved? When?\" The Fire Injuries of Body And of Spirit **********As survivors recall it, March 24 had been another busy Saturday night at the Happy Land. At 3 A.M., people were still arriving. Nearly everyone was upstairs, crowding the dance floor and the fake-wood bar that sold beers for $2. **********Downstairs, Elena Colon was waiting for her husband, Elias, who ran the club. She remembers Julio Gonzalez having a couple of drinks and talking calmly to a boy who later died. **********It was not much later, the police say, that Mr. Gonzalez was ejected by a bouncer after arguing with Lydia Feliciano, the club's ticket-taker and the woman who had just broken up with him after eight years together. **********Mrs. Colon said she saw no argument. But in a videotaped statement that they have described as a confession, the police say Mr. Gonzalez told of grabbing a plastic jug outside the club and filling it with $1 worth of gasoline at a nearby Amoco station. Dousing the Happy Land's door, he lighted a match, they say. Then, Mr. Gonzalez told them, he went home to sleep. **********Ms. Feliciano, Mrs. Colon and three young men who had been downstairs all escaped through a poorly marked emergency door down from the flaming main entrance. **********Ruben Valladarez, warned by a friend who also found the emergency door, shut off the music and alerted the crowd through his microphone. Then he turned to friends gathered around him by a front staircase. \"Whoever wants to live should follow me,\" he recalls telling them before bounding down into the fire. **********None of them did. As smoke poured upstairs, they were quickly asphyxiated. Firefighters later told of men with their arms still around women, as if to protect them. The Aftermath Shining Promises Quickly Tarnish **********Many of the victims' relatives and friends seem to remember the fire's aftermath almost as a dream. City officials, social workers and reporters were everywhere. Telephones rang incessantly. Honduras declared three days of national mourning. **********Then came the lawyers. They called, knocked on doors and traveled thousands of miles in search of grieving relatives looking to sue. In Francia, Honduras, a farming hamlet eight bumpy hours from the nearest international airport, \"there were American lawyers, Puerto Rican lawyers -- all kinds,\" said Maria Arriola, who returned home there to bury her daughter, Alba, her brother, Querry Romero, and four other relatives. \"It was like a world event.\" **********Amid the onslaught came government and private agencies offering aid that many families never expected. **********Inside the school gymnasium where families went to identify snapshots of the dead, city social workers gave many of them hundreds of dollars for rent, food and other expenses. The State Crime Victims Board paid funeral expenses of up to $2,500. The American Red Cross gave money, too, and 48 coffins were flown to Honduras for burial. 'That's Where Things Failed' **********Rosa Guevara, a native of El Salvador who lost her brother, Victor Hugo Benavides, still talks of the limousine ride to his funeral. \"If things like this happen in one's own countries, you have to bury your own,\" she said. **********By summer's end, 87 relatives of the dead and Mr. Valladarez's wife had received $1,600 each from private donations. But for each loved one who cashed a check, social workers say, several others were left empty-handed. **********Some city agencies declined to provide aid they believed would be given by other city agencies. Some relatives, because they lacked legal residency, feared contacting the government, while others, accustomed to self-sufficiency, did not know how. **********\"The initial response was fabulous, but it was crisis-oriented and somewhat chaotic,\" said Antonio Fernandez, who worked with the South Bronx vicariate to help many families. \"There was no planning for what happened after the crisis, and that's where things failed.\" **********As the initial aid took many of the relatives by surprise, so have some of them seemed to grow obsessed by the promises they say went unfulfilled. **********Some recall the Permanent Honduran Committee, which vowed to raise $1 million for the victims' families, but faded away after a single event that barely covered its costs. Others remember the Honduran community center for which President Rafael Leonardo Callejas of Honduras and John Cardinal O'Connor donated $52,000, only to see the project set aside when they could not persuade the city to donate a site. **********And then there are the stories of women like Lourdes Robledo, who because of a bureaucratic foul-up is being made to pay back $900 she was given after her husband's death, and Rosa Perez, who cannot become a legal resident because her residency papers are in Honduras and she is in the Bronx, destitute after the death of her son's father. **********Though some of the relatives speak with resignation carried from countries where sudden death is too familiar, their bitterness also betrays quick assimilation. 'He Would Be Dead' **********\"When you live in a country like this -- where you work and you pay taxes and when you hurt your leg on a broken sidewalk you can sue someone -- it's different,\" said Rosiviltt Garbutt, who lost a son. \"Of course it's different.\" **********But ideals of American justice have eroded with delay after delay in the courts. The trial of Mr. Gonzalez, a 37-year-old Cuban refugee, is expected to begin sometime between May and July, after yet another round of psychological evaluations. Although the club's landlords were cleared of criminal liability last year for the deaths, they still face misdemeanor charges. And the civil suits may drag on for years. **********\"In our country, this man would no longer be in jail,\" said Francisco Gamoneda, a Honduran who lost two sons to the fire. \"He would be dead.\" **********From his cell in the Brooklyn House of Detention for Men, Mr. Gonzalez seems to prolong an agony of many forms. **********At the Gamonedas's small house in the Belmont section of the Bronx, for instance, 9 children, 12 grandchildren and various other relatives come and go. Still, Leticia Gamoneda says she cannot find a way out from the shadow of her two missing sons, Marco Tulio and Lenin Ernesto. **********\"You could have 20 children,\" she said, \"but if you lose one or two or three, you'll miss them always.\" **********Dilcia Pineda's apartment in the Fordham section is a quiet, almost serene place where the image of Marvin Doubleday lingers in a blown-up snapshot on the wall and in the face of an infant who carries his name. **********\"Each time I look at the baby,\" she said, \"I remember how much he wanted a son.\" Ms. Pineda discovered she was pregnant after feeling sick when she went to identify the body of Mr. Doubleday, with whom she had lived. Since that day, she has felt little comfort from others. \"This is a country that forgets pretty easily,\" she said. The Only Memorial **********Compared to some, Ruben Valladarez has been lucky in the help he received. What sympathy may not have been prompted by the burns over more than 40 percent of his body, his courage has seemed to elicit. And he is grateful for all of it, as he is for his hands, which he feared might be amputated, and the ability to walk. But he is bitter about America: about its system of justice, its bureaucracy and the promises it seemed to make to him in Honduras that he believes have not been kept. **********Though his wife was born in the United States, Mr. Valladarez said, welfare workers offered him only $40 a month to supplement her income as a word processor while he recovered. A spokesman for the Human Resources Administration, Earl Weber, said that the case was being investigated and that he could provide no details. **********Israel Bulnes arrived at similar thoughts as he drove around the Bronx listening to a tape of old Spanish songs that his son, Israel Antonio, made for him and talked about how much he misses the boy. **********\"Before people come, back in Honduras, they think poverty doesn't exist here,\" he said. \"When you go there and tell them that life is very hard here, that you live in cold buildings with rats and cockroaches, they don't believe you.\" **********Parking on Southern Boulevard, he added, \"Somebody should send them a picture of that.\" **********Across the street, behind two barren trees ringed by burnt candles and empty pints of cheap vodka, was the boarded-up storefront from which he had watched Israel Antonio's body emerge in a thick plastic bag. **********There were plans to build a monument, but so far only relatives like Mr. Bulnes have contributed, and their money pales at estimates of the cost. So until an all-weather sign was affixed to the building for a modest commemoration yesterday, the only memorial consisted of some weathered wreaths, some artificial flowers and a plastic sheet with 87 names and the legend \"Descansen en Paz,\" Rest in Peace."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/02/business/house-panel-in-compromise-on-bank-bill.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-05-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 238, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "House Panel in Compromise on Bank Bill", "print_headline": "House Panel in Compromise on Bank Bill", "body_text": " **********House Democrats reached a compromise today that increased the chances of banking legislation being passed in the next few months. **********Democrats on the House Banking Committee had threatened to join Republicans in opposing a narrowly tailored bill that fell short of the Bush Administration's recommendations to overhaul the banking system. **********The bill was proposed by the chairman of the committee, Representative Henry B.

The war now involves three loosely allied, ethnically based rebel armies pitted against the Government. **********The rebel gains are the latest in a three-month offensive in which the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, the largest guerrilla army, has driven to within 65 miles of Addis Ababa. **********Backed by mortars and artillery, the rebels moved on the provincial capital of Dese and the nearby highway towns of Kembolchza and Bati late Saturday, effectively taking control of the entire north-central province of Wollo and blocking the highway that leads to the rebel heartland in Eritrea and Tigre provinces. **********Residents in Dese described heavy street fighting between guerrillas and army troops. They also reported government aerial bombardments on the outlying lowland plains. **********\"I can see from my window that people are engaged in hand-to-hand fighting,\" Amina Abdella, a housewife, said in a telephone interview Saturday night. \"Bodies are falling one after another, though I cannot tell whether they are rebels, soldiers or civilians.\" **********There were no official reports on casualties.  Telephone Lines Are Cut **********After the rebels secured Dese this morning, telephone lines were cut. The Government prohibited travel to the combat zones. **********Simultaneously with the northern attacks, guerrillas attacked the town of Ambo, 65 miles west of the capital. The rebels had driven the army out of Ambo last month, only to withdraw shortly afterward under threat of a Government counterattack. The rebels claimed control of Ambo on their radio station, but fighting was still reported in the area today. **********The capture of Ambo and Dese appeared to signal the collapse of the Ethiopian Third Army, probably the best Government military unit stationed outside the capital. Should the rebels follow up their victories with an expected attack on the highway town of Mille, east of Dese, they will control all the routes north from Addis Ababa and will have severed overland links between the capital and Assab, the last Government-held port. **********Sesseha Tessema, a rebel envoy based in Washington, said in a telephone interview that the rebels launched their offensive in response to an air force bombing of the guerrilla-held village of Shiraro, about 45 miles southwest of Asmara, the Eritrean capital. Mr. Tessema said 20 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in the air raid, which he said took place on Thursday. He also said the attacks were staged because the army was mobilizing to break through rebel positions outside Addis Ababa and Dese. **********\"This is not an offensive,\" he said. \"It is a counteroffensive.\" He denied that the latest military activity betrayed a promise the rebels had made to American officials that they would not mount a major operation in the days preceding the conference. **********\"We are still going to the peace talks,\" he said, adding that the rebels had no intention of blocking food or other nonmilitary supplies from entering the capital. **********But Government officials responded to the new attacks with skepticism that the rebels would attend the London conference. They noted that the rebel faction based in Eritrea, on the Red Sea coast, had already postponed the talks, which were originally scheduled for Monday, until next week. **********The Eritrean rebels seek independence for their region, but the rebel group based in neighboring Tigre province merely wants a different government in Addis Ababa, and says it is willing to enter an interim coalition.

A G.M. spokesman said he was not aware of any such proposal under consideration by the company, and a Ford official did not provide an immediate response to a telephone call seeking comment. **********The Chrysler chairman's remarks seemed to be motivated by a growing sense of desperation that Japanese competition and a weak economy were mortally wounding the nation's largest manufacturing industry. **********But the 67-year-old Mr. Iacocca, who will retire at the end of next year, dismissed questions about Chrysler's viability over the coming 10 months, saying the company thought its new products, including a four-door Jeep that goes into production in early 1992, would increase cash-flow substantially. **********\"We're in good shape, and have plenty of backstops,\" he said. \"We still have a $1.75 billion revolving credit line that we've paid fees on for 10 years that we haven't touched.\" **********A limit of market share, like the 16 percent cap imposed last summer by the European Community through 1999, would cover all cars and trucks sold by Japanese manufacturers, including those assembled at American factories, or transplants, like the Honda Motor Company's plant in Marysville, Ohio. Japanese producers now sell about 31 percent of the cars sold in the United States. **********It was not immediately clear today how Mr. Iacocca's proposal would treat Japanese components, which are found in most domestic models, or vehicles built in joint-venture plants but sold by domestic manufacturers. General Motors's Geo Prizm car, for example, is built in Fremont, Calif., but has an engine made by the Toyota Motor Corporation. **********The European laws on market share do not cover Japanese vehicles built in North America, like the Honda station wagon now sold in several European countries. **********A ceiling on the number of vehicles that could be sold by Japanese auto makers is the most extreme proposal so far to help ailing American car makers, whose cumulative losses in the last year have totaled about $6 billion. Despite voluntary export restraints by the Japanese starting in 1981, the industry has steadily lost ground against Japanese auto makers. **********In recent years, the number of Japanese imports has fallen as the number of vehicles produced by their transplants has increased. Indeed, most Japanese producers are importing substantially fewer vehicles than are permitted under the voluntary restraint agreement. **********Democratic legislators have recently been exploring the possibility of following the European model to cap overall sales of Japanese cars. No one has offered a bill yet, but prospects for passage would be uncertain, given the Japanese industry's efforts to build an American infrastructure of plants, workers, research labs and lobbyists.  Most Damage to Chrysler **********Chrysler, as the smallest of the Big Three, has experienced the most serious financial damage. Its debt securities have been downgraded to junk-bond status, and it was recently forced to raise equity capital when its stock price was at a 10-year low. **********In recent weeks, the car maker's rhetoric against the country's trade imbalance with Japan has grown sharper. Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler president, criticized American trade policy, comparing United States consumption of Japanese-made products to the behavior of an alcoholic. **********Separately, Mr. Iacocca acknowledged that Chrysler was close to agreement with the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation for the sale to Mitsubishi of Chrysler's 50 percent stake in the companies' Diamond-Star assembly plant venture in Bloomington, Ill."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/31/business/us-will-trim-sale-of-reserve-oil-by-half.html": {"writer_name": "Matthew Wald", "pub_date": "1991-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 934, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Will Trim Sale of Reserve Oil by Half", "print_headline": "U.S. Will Trim Sale of Reserve Oil by Half", "body_text": " **********The Energy Department, facing a very weak market for the high-sulfur crude it had planned to sell from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, said yesterday that it would cut the total sale by nearly 50 percent. **********The department said it would sell only 3 million barrels of the high-sulfur, or \"sour,\" crude instead of the 22.5 million barrels originally planned, because the prices bid were too low. But it said it would increase the sale of \"sweet,\" or low-sulfur, crude to 14.35 million barrels, from 11.25 million barrels. As a result, the sale will comprise a total of 17.35 million barrels, rather than the 33.75 first planned. **********The intended sale from the 586-million-barrel reserve was first announced two weeks ago, when the air attack on Iraq began, as a way to avert panic in the oil market. But the price of oil unexpectedly plunged when traders concluded that the attack was a success and that Saudi exports were not threatened. Statement by Watkins **********In a statement yesterday, James D. Watkins, the Energy Secretary, said, \"We clearly must remain sensitive to the market by making available the crude oil the industry is saying it really needs, and not allowing bargain hunters to take advantage of the taxpayers.\" **********He added that the department would also fulfill the commitment it made to the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based organization of 21 oil-importing nations, whose members had collectively agreed to release 2.5 million barrels a day. Half of that was to come from American reserves, although the department had said it would be flexible. **********The largest contract, for 7.52 million barrels, was awarded to Phibro Energy Inc., a trading company and refiner based in Greenwich, Conn. Bids were submitted by 26 companies, 13 of which won contracts. **********The 17.35 million barrels were auctioned at prices ranging from $25.67 to $28.52 a barrel.  Oil Drops 88 Cents **********The news of the amended sale plan, which was first disclosed in The Wall Street Journal yesterday, did not upset the oil market yesterday, with oil for delivery in March closing on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $20.97 a barrel, down 88 cents. **********That oil, however, is sweet crude. The announcement did push up the price of sour crude relative to sweet, according to industry experts. Sour crude is traded among refiners, producers and trading houses, generally at bids expressed in relation to sweet crude rather than at an absolute price. And the announcement prompted the discount for sour crude to shrink, with the price difference per barrel dropping to $3.30 late yesterday from about $3.70 on Tuesday. The reason was that supplies of sour crude will now be smaller than the market had anticipated. **********Market participants said the price of sour crude actually started to close in on the price of sweet crude in trading late Tuesday afternoon. Several participants said they were angry with the Energy Department because it appeared to them that the information had leaked out and that some companies had been able to take advantage of it.  Department Denies Leak **********The department denied there had been a leak. And at least one trader, while saying he had suspicions of such an advantage, said it was possible that an astute trader could have made the same trades based on conclusions drawn from publicly available information. **********Philip K. Verleger Jr., a commodities economist and visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, who follows the oil market closely, said the price move started Tuesday afternoon when Phibro, the company that received the largest contract, \"started buying up a lot of sour crude.\" He said the trading suggested that Phibro had \"advance notice\" of the change in the oil auction, and that what he believed was an information leak \"tarnished what is otherwise the greatest success in energy management in 18 years.\" **********There is no law against insider trading in commodities, as there is in stocks. **********A Washington lawyer who specializes in energy matters, Peter H. Rodgers, said that trading companies he works with had complained to him yesterday morning, after the change in the auction was made public, that Phibro's purchases, beginning at about 4:30 P.M. on Tuesday, appeared to them to indicate the company had early knowledge.  A 2 P.M. Decision **********Robert F. Baker, a spokesman for Phibro's parent company, Salomon Brothers, would not confirm trading by Phibro, but said any suggestion Phibro had advance information was \"utter nonsense.\" **********At the Energy Department, M. J. Jameson, the chief spokeswoman, said that the decision was made at about 2 P.M. on Tuesday, in consultation with the White House, and that the first time the information was divulged outside the Government was to a Wall Street Journal reporter at 6:30 P.M. **********But a trader at one international oil trading company, who spoke on condition that neither he nor his company be identified, also said Phibro started buying at about 4:30, and he felt there may have been a Government leak. \"I trade off information all the time,\" he said. But, he added that his information usually came from private sources, \"and this is a Government body.\" **********One energy trader at a different international company also said there may have been a leak, although he added that a perceptive reading of publicly available information, including Energy Department data showing that sweet crude was in much higher demand than sour, might have led an astute trader to expect the Government to cut back on its sale of sour crude and to anticipate a rise in its price."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/27/business/canada-banks-cut-prime.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 48, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canada Banks Cut Prime", "print_headline": "Canada Banks Cut Prime", "body_text": " **********Canada's big commercial banks have cut their prime lending rates by half a percentage point as the economy remained stuck in recession with few signs of recovery.

It could be a rather ugly ending.\" **********The Vietnamese offer reported today had been sought by Britain, and would doubtless be welcomed by several Southeast Asian nations that are now sheltering boat people and have sought for years to send them back to Vietnam.

Ending U.S. Embargo **********But the offer has not been formally announced in Hanoi, and diplomats warned today that it might be quickly withdrawn if there were strong objections from the United States, which the Vietnamese Government is reluctant to offend. **********Vietnam has sought to restore diplomatic relations with the United States and to end a punishing American economic embargo on this impoverished nation. **********The United States expressed outrage when, in December 1989, the authorities in Hong Kong forced 51 Vietnamese refugees, many of them kicking and screaming, onto a plane in the middle of the night and flew them to Vietnam.

As in formerly Communist eastern Germany, the authorities here say, the Czechoslovak attackers are mainly disaffected youths in their late teens and early 20's trapped by the high unemployment and social dislocation gripping the country since the collapse of Communism nearly two years ago. **********Their victims are the growing numbers of gypsies migrating westward to escape faltering economies in Romania and the Slovak region of Czechoslovakia, or migrant Vietnamese laborers, the remnants of tens of thousands of such workers brought to Czechoslovakia by the country's former Communist bosses to offset chronic labor shortages. **********Responding to the mounting violence, about 150 gypsy leaders marched on Friday to the residence of President Vaclav Havel on Castle Hill here, chanting slogans like, \"They are beating our children,\" and \"Give us human rights.\" They met with Mr. Havel's chief of staff, Karl Schwarzenberg, who agreed to establish a five-member commission to examine the gypsies' grievances and pledged Government support to curb the violence.  Attack in Teplice **********The gypsy leaders were particularly rattled by an incident on Oct. 5 in the industrial city of Teplice, north of Prague, where gangs of several hundred skinheads, responding to bogus announcements of a concert, gathered, overturned a car carrying two gypsies and beat the driver so badly that he required hospitalization for a concussion, a broken shoulder blade and cuts and bruises. The skinheads chanted slogans like \"Sieg heil\" and \"Czech lands for the Czechs.\" Witnesses said some wore red armbands with swastikas. **********The neo-Nazi paraphernalia struck an paradoxical chord in a region that was occupied militarily by Nazi Germany in 1938, and saw many of its residents jailed or killed. **********But Government anxieties in Prague are rooted not least in general public passivity toward the beatings. Crime by gypsies, like picking pockets, is a regular feature of newspaper reports here, and according to newspapers, local people directed the skinheads to taverns in Teplice where gypsies regularly congregate. **********Nor are gypsies the only victims. Hardly a week goes by without reports of attacks by marauding skinheads on homes for Vietnamese migrant workers. In Prague, there have been attacks on Arab diplomats, and in Pilsen, the beer-brewing center east of Prague, a Turkish worker died recently as a result of a beating.  Flow From the East **********The western Czech region, where about two-thirds of Czechoslovakia's people live and where most incidents occur, is the destination of growing numbers of gypsies fleeing economic decline not only in Romania but also in Slovakia, the eastern republic of federated Czechoslovakia. The Prague Government has taken measures to stanch the flow of illegal immigrants, and Hungary last week angered Romania's authorities by closing its borders to Romanians with tourist visas, mostly gypsies who travel via Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland to affluent Germany. **********Gypsy leaders and Czechoslovak officials say they believe that the Czech youths are spurred by the example of Germany. In September, the Prague police fought pitched battles on the historic Charles Bridge with hordes of German skinheads who molested tourists. Many young people from eastern Germany regularly visit Prague, one of the few cities in the old Soviet bloc they were permitted to travel to under Communism. **********Prague officials are worried that the problem could worsen if Germany follows through on measures announced in Bonn this week to curb an influx of foreigners by establishing large refugee camps and quickly deporting immigrants believed to be seeking only to better their economic lot.                     --------------------       Surge of Attacks in Germany **********BONN, Oct. 13 (Reuters) -- Neo-Nazi youths burned down a hostel for asylum-seekers, seriously injuring two people, and several foreigners were hurt in an upsurge of racist attacks across Germany, the police said today. **********Skinheads kicked down the door of a first-floor apartment in a hostel in the Bavarian town of Immenstadt overnight and tossed in fireworks, which started a blaze. **********One hostel resident broke several bones when he jumped from a window to escape the flames. Another was overcome by smoke. The police arrested three skinheads between the ages of 17 and 23. **********In several eastern German states, gangs of masked youths stormed foreigners' hostels. A Moroccan man was beaten by a group of about 30 skinheads in the town of Greifswald. **********Neo-Nazi violence directed at refugees from Eastern Europe and the third world has spread across Germany in recent weeks.

Still, they found much to critique. They praised some ads, like the Nike and Subaru campaigns by Wieden & Kennedy Inc. And they faulted others, such as the salacious skin-filled supplement for Calvin Klein jeans.
