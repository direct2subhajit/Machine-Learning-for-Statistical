The project was completed recently by the United Methodist City Society, and next week the first of 56 low-income families will start moving in. **********A 10-story building at 123 West 104th Street replaces the Grace United Methodist Church, which occupied the 17,000-square-foot site between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues for more than a century before it was destroyed by fire in 1983. **********The City Society, a 154-year-old mission, saw that as an opportunity not only to replace the church but also to create affordable housing for the community and housing for some of its clergy. Along with the 56 low-income units, the building, whose architect is Prentice & Chan, Olhausen of Manhattan, has 12 apartments for clergy, a 299-seat sanctuary, a fellowship hall, classrooms and church offices. **********Money from the fire-insurance claim was used to pay for the clergy housing and church areas. To pay for the low-income housing portion of the project, two city programs -- one offering tax incentives, the other density bonuses -- were combined with a Federal tax-credit program for which the church project was approved in 1989. **********\"It took three programs to create one project,\" said Drew R. Greenwald, president of Grid Properties, a Manhattan-based development and management consultant that put the package together for the church group. **********Although there has been a slowdown in the production of low-income housing in Manhattan because it is linked to the recession-slowed construction of market-rate buildings, incentives created by the two city programs have already helped produce almost 1,100 low-income units since the programs' inception in 1987. Both programs are administered by the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. **********One program can be used by developers of market-rate buildings between 14th and 96th Streets in Manhattan, an area that is considered prime real estate and consequently is generally excluded from the so-called 421a tax abatements granted for putting up new housing. The program allows such developers to acquire the 10-year abatements by participating in the construction of low-income housing. The participation can be direct, by producing low-income units, or indirect by purchasing 421a certificates from developers who build such housing. Each low-income unit provides abatements for five market-rate apartments. **********The Brodsky Organization of Manhattan needed abatements for its new rental building, the Concerto, at 200 West 60th Street. It also wanted to purchase 421a certificates within the same community board to meet commitments made when it applied for a rezoning for the Concerto. So it paid the United Methodist City Society $2.8 million for the 421a certificates of 24 of the low-income apartments at the project. The certificates created abatements for 120 of the 248 apartments at the Concerto. Brodsky purchased certificates from others for the remaining apartments, providing tax abatements for the entire building and helping the developer keep its rents competitive. **********Under the second program, low-income housing can generate valuable density bonuses if such bonuses are applied at sites with appropriate zoning within the same neighborhood. **********The General Atlantic Realty Corporation, which along with the Brodsky Organization assisted the Methodist group in the development of the West 104th Street project, agreed to pay the group $1.5 million for bonuses generated by the 32 low-income apartments on which 421a certificates had not been sold. General Atlantic can use those bonuses in a future development. **********The church group also received $3.5 million from the sale of Federal tax credits. The Federal program, part of the the 1986 Tax Reform Act, gives investors in qualifying low-income rental projects a dollar-for-dollar credit on taxes for their investments. It has already assisted in the production of nearly 18,000 low-income housing units in New York State. The administrator for the state is the Division of Housing and Community Renewal. **********Credits were syndicated and sold to investors through the Shearson Lehman Brothers Liberty Fund. The investors became limited partners of West 104th Street Associates, the general partner that now owns the church building's 56 low-income apartments. The monthly rents, which cover maintenance but are not allowed to produce a profit, range from $310 for a studio to $498 for a two-bedroom apartment. The units will be managed by Phipps Houses Services. **********The 12 apartments for clergy, two of which have been rented to the two pastors of Grace Church, occupy the 2d and 10th floors. Rents range from $650 for a studio to $1,100 for a three-bedroom apartment. The sanctuary and other church rooms are on the ground floor. **********The property is structured as three condominiums, of which two are owned by the City Society, and the third -- consisting of floors three through nine -- is owned by West 104th Street Associates. Considering all the elements that had to be brought together to create the project, the Rev. John E. Carrington, executive director of the United Methodist City Society, said, \"It's a miracle on 104th Street.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/12/business/credit-markets-treasury-prices-slightly-higher.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1992-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 915, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Prices Slightly Higher", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Treasury Prices Slightly Higher", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in quiet trading yesterday, as credit market participants readied themselves for release later in the week of economic statistics that most expect will be favorable for fixed-income investors. **********\"People have money to put to work, and we should get good statistics over the next week,\" said one Government-bond trader. \"Right now is not an occasion to be aggressively bullish, but it is a time to be involved.\" **********Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, estimated that the Treasury would make interest payments of just under $25 billion on Friday. **********\"There is a boodle of cash to be put to work,\" he said. \"The question is whether investors perceive that this market has more to run. I tend to be a little more cautious than what seems to be the prevailing market sentiment.\"  Producer Price Numbers **********This week's stream of new data begins to flow today, with the release of April producer price numbers. **********Most economists are forecasting that the Producer Price Index rose by a relatively modest three-tenths of 1 percent last month, and by the same amount when volatile energy and food prices are excluded. **********Consumer price statistics, retail sales figures and industrial production data are among the other reports scheduled to be released over the next four days. **********Aside from expectations that the data will show that the economy is recovering slowly and that inflation pressures are mild, traders began buying back short-term bills and notes on the chance that the Federal Reserve Board might decide to ease monetary policy once more. **********Prices of short-term issues fell fairly sharply on Friday after the Labor Department reported that non-farm payroll employment rose by 126,000 in April, a bigger increase than most analysts had anticipated.  Making a Difference **********Victor Chang, president of VC Management, a New York-based money management firm, said, \"I don't think the Fed needs to ease policy any more, but another quarter-point cut in the Federal funds rate would not make a material difference.\" **********What is needed now, Mr. Chang said, is for the Fed to convey the message that it will maintain a stable monetary policy even as economic activity begins to pick up. **********\"The Fed can do that because inflation is not going to be a problem for the rest of this year and into 1993,\" Mr. Chang added. \"That sort of signal would allow long-term interest rates to come down a bit.\" **********Hopes that the Fed might ease helped fuel demand at the weekly auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills yesterday. **********At the auction, new three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 3.64 percent, down slightly from the 3.65 percent average rate at last week's sale. **********Six-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 3.74 percent, compared with 3.78 percent at the auction a week earlier. Long Bond Rises **********In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 10110/32 , up 3/32 , to yield 7.88 percent, compared with 7.89 percent late Friday. **********Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10027/32 , up 3/32 , to yield 7.37 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 10011/32 , up 5/32 , to yield 5.18 percent. **********Corporations, which were notably absent from the new-issue market last week because of the Treasury's refunding auctions, were more active yesterday. **********Roughly $1.25 billion worth of new securities were priced yesterday, including 30-year debentures by the Georgia Pacific Corporation and Dow Capital B.V. **********The $250 million worth of 9.50 percent Georgia Pacific securities were priced at $99.15 to yield 9.587 percent, 1.70 percentage points more than the prevailing yield on the 8 percent 29 1/2-year Treasury bonds at the time of pricing. **********Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. **********The securities, which are noncallable for 10 years, are rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BB+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. **********Dow Capital B.V. offered $150 million of 8.70 percent debentures through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company. **********The securities were priced at $98.781 to yield 8.816 percent, 92 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing. **********The issue, which is noncallable for 10 years, is rated A-1 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's. **********Participants in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities said that trading was slow and that prices of most outstanding securities were unchanged. **********Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills: (000 omitted in dollar figures)                    3-Mo.

They know it will happen. They even know when: Jan. 20, 1993, around noon. **********Ms. Haley is the deputy executive director for U.S. Savings Bonds at the Treasury Department. Mr. Haley is administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service at the Agriculture Department. Like most of the more than 3,000 Government employees who serve \"at the pleasure of the President,\" the Haleys lost the prospect of four more years when President Bush lost his bid for a second term on Nov. 3. **********\"First, it takes a while to get over the shock of watching the election returns,\" Ms. Haley said. \"Then you get your resume in order.\" Since the election, she has been devoting about two hours a day to her so-far-unsuccessful hunt for a corporate job. **********As the scramble intensifies for jobs in a Clinton Administration, the second- and third-tier appointees of the last two Republican Presidents are preparing to move out. There has not been such a partisan shuffle in Washington since the end of the Carter Administration in 1981. But unlike the Carter appointees, this year's crowd has almost nowhere to turn in Washington itself, with Democrats at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue and a flat market for lobbyists. **********\"For the past 30 or 40 years -- since the Roosevelt Administration, really -- the business of government has been growing, and this town could always sop up the extra people that came off the Hill or out of the Administration,\" said Eric Vautour, who worked in President Reagan's Office of Presidential Personnel from 1983 to 1987 before joining the Washington branch of Russell Reynolds Associates, an executive search firm. \"That's not true anymore.\" **********E. Pendleton James, former assistant to President Reagan and director of Presidential Personnel in Mr. Reagan's first term, takes a rather cynical view of the current exodus: \"The economy is suffering, and now they're going to reap the benefits of their administration.\" **********The executive search firm Mr. James now runs under his own name in New York is one of the first stops for out-of-work Bush appointees. After all, it was Mr. James who first appointed many of them. Now, he said, \"I'm trying to be a friend and adviser, but that's all I can do. When I talk to industry captains and corporate leaders, they don't know how to value the experience of serving in government. What we're talking about is hundreds of very talented, experienced professionals who are today's market of unemployables.\" **********A Bush assistant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, agrees: \"The assumption used to be a good job in government meant a better job when you left government. It's an assumption that's still bruited about Washington, but it's not true anymore.\" **********There is no question that the going will be rough for these government workers. For many, the election shock is only now wearing off. \"I was a loyal soldier,\" said Chip Yost, a 36-year-old Treasury Department appointee.  Only in the last few weeks has he begun to look at vice president-level jobs with pharmaceutical companies like the one he worked for before going to Washington in 1989. **********Some lower-level appointees are encumbered by their titles. Mr. Yost is special assistant to the Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy at Treasury. \"Nobody understands that title,\" he said. **********Nor are higher-level appointees immune. Said Marion C. Blakey, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at the Transportation Department: \"Right now I manage a work force of 660 people and a budget of $270 million, a fair-sized corporation. But the measure of my effectiveness is not in producing dividends and profits for shareholders; it's whether we've moved the needle on issues such as drunk driving.\" **********Alfred A. DelliBovi is one Administration official who has nailed down a job for 1993, but the Deputy Secretary of Housing and Urban Development had decided last December he would not stay on for a second Bush term. On Oct. 30, the board of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York elected him its new president and chief executive. \"I expected to be leaving after a triumphant victory,\" he said. \"There are certainly a lot of surprised people in this town these days. And to be honest, if I had wanted to stay on, I might be in the same boat.\"Last Leg of Bhutan Climb **********When last we heard from New York-based investment banker Frederick P. (Fritz) Selby and William E. Phillips, former chairman of the Ogilvy Group, they were leading an expedition of nine business men and women up a 20,000-foot, unnamed, unscaled Bhutanese mountain peak. \"It's not Everest,\" Mr. Selby said in the Sept. 13 column, \"but it's high enough to die on.\" **********After seven days of trekking, the executives, beset by headaches, diarrhea, constipation and altitude sickness, huddled in tents on a yak-herding plain 15,500 feet above sea level. Fog and snow had slowed their progress, and on Oct. 14, Jim Williams, a mountaineer from Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Pemba, the expedition's Nepalese sherpa guide, decided to wait out the weather. **********At 2 A.M. on Oct. 19, Mr. Williams awoke the climbers to say that up to two feet of snow had fallen, and the temperature had risen to 35 degrees -- too warm, wet and slippery. Five of the original nine, including Mr. Phillips and Mr. Selby, dared the final ascent. **********They struggled up a funnel-shaped couloir, arriving at daybreak at the saddle below the summit. Pemba led the way. With each step, he showered the climbers below with crumbling rock. Finally, 200 feet from the summit, Pemba made an executive decision: \"Life has value,\" he said. \"We are turning back.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/world/tories-say-party-s-strategy-is-hurting-campaign.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1992-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 861, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tories Say Party's Strategy Is Hurting Campaign", "print_headline": "Tories Say Party's Strategy Is Hurting Campaign", "body_text": " **********While it is too early to say who will win the British general election on April 9, Prime Minister John Major's Conservatives began today to sound like a party increasingly afraid that it could lose. **********Several leading Conservatives blamed Mr. Major's campaign team, headed by the party chairman, Chris Patten, for a defensive, negative approach that has let the opposition Labor Party and its leader, Neil Kinnock, set much of the agenda so far. **********\"We have got to change tack,\" said Sir Marcus Fox, a senior Conservative lawmaker who has run in every parliamentary election since 1966. \"We need a more forceful style.\" **********Of Prime Minister Major, who is facing a national election for the first time since he succeeded Margaret Thatcher 16 months ago, Sir Marcus said on BBC radio this afternoon: \"On the doorstep everybody likes him. They say he is a nice man. I am sure that he has it in him, he has got that strength.\" **********Mr. Major was doorstepping today, in the Hertfordshire town of Welwyn Garden City, and he denied he had the jitters. \"No. No. We are going to win and win with a clear majority,\" he told reporters. \"Ask me about the positive things. Ask me questions about the issues and I will deal with questions about the issues.\" **********But David Evans, the Conservative candidate Mr. Major had come to help, said: \"The campaign itself has not been robust enough. We have not told the people exactly what we have achieved and what we are going to achieve in the 1990's. The failure is the people running the campaign.\" **********Cecil Parkinson, a former party chairman who ran the campaign that won Mrs. Thatcher her second term as Prime Minister in 1983, said today, \"I believe we can win and win well, but we are going to have to improve our campaigning in the next 10 days.\" Mr. Parkinson, like Mrs. Thatcher, is not running in this election. **********\"I have no doubt at all we have the best leader,\" Mr. Parkinson told the BBC. \"It will be a failure on the part of the party if we don't put him over as the person he really is. He's on the move the whole time. It's the strategists who have to be doing the thinking.\" Hung Parliament Predicted **********If the Conservative campaign does not catch fire, Mr. Parkinson said, the result will be a Parliament in which neither party holds the majority of 326 seats needed to form a strong government. **********That is exactly what most of the public opinion polls have been predicting, including three being published in Sunday newspapers this weekend. The Sunday Times survey, conducted by the MORI organization, puts support for Labor at 40 percent and the Conservatives at 38, while the Sunday Express poll by I.C.M. gives Labor 38 percent and the Conservatives 36. Both polls give 20 percent to the opposition Liberal Democrats. **********A Harris poll in Sunday's Observer newspaper gives the Conservatives 40, Labor 38, and the Liberal Democrats 17. **********\"We mean to win,\" said Labor's campaign director, Dr. Jack Cunningham, as a confident and relaxed Mr. Kinnock celebrated his 50th birthday today on the campaign trail in Scotland. **********\"If you live a clean life and keep clear of politics, you will live to be 100,\" Mr. Kinnock said today. Demonstrators Jeer Major **********Mr. Major was jeered in Luton by a group of 50 or so demonstrators screaming \"Tory scum!\" **********\"You see the face of hatred there,\" the Prime Minister shouted back. \"No mob taking to the streets is ever going to stop us coming out and talking to the ordinary decent people.\" **********Another Conservative candidate, Edwina Currie, a former junior health minister, said today that she had poured a glass of orange juice over a Labor candidate, Peter Snape, in a Birmingham television studio after a debate Friday night. **********\"I just looked at my orange juice, and looked at this man from which this stream of abuse was emanating, and thought 'I know how to shut you up,' \" she said. **********On Friday, Mr. Major and his campaign appeared to shift gears, moving away from what has been a strategy of relentlessly attacking Labor rather than stressing Conservative policies. **********Until this weekend, Conservative billboards and candidates have mainly been criticizing Labor's plans to raise taxes on the highest incomes from 40 to 59 percent, responding to Labor's claims that the Government is trying to undo the popular National Health Service and warning that a Labor victory could return the country to the strike-ridden days of the 1970's. **********But on Friday night, in South Wales, Mr. Major appeared to recognize that many young voters had no memories of what life was like under the last Labor Government, which Mrs. Thatcher defeated in 1979. \"To them, it seems ancient history,\" he said. \"Understandably, what concerns most people aged between 18 and 30 is what is going to happen for the next five years. They want us to look forward.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/19/business/all-about-electronic-bulletin-boards-it-s-no-longer-just-techno-hobbyists-who.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Berck", "pub_date": "1992-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1388, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "All About/Electronic Bulletin Boards; It's No Longer Just Techno-Hobbyists Who Meet by Modem", "print_headline": "All About/Electronic Bulletin Boards; It's No Longer Just Techno-Hobbyists Who Meet by Modem", "body_text": " **********A communications explosion is under way across America, though about the only sound from it is the clacking of computer keyboards. People by the tens of thousands are plugging their telephone lines into their personal computers and using them to argue Presidential politics, discuss scuba diving in underwater caves with experts or view satellite pictures of Jupiter's moons. **********Much of this, of course, has been available for years to techno-hobbyists and to people willing to pay fairly high connection fees to link up with Compuserve and other on-line information services. But as the sheer number of people with computers has surged, so has the variety of electronic meeting places known as computer bulletin boards. **********\"The roof has blown off the industry,\" said Jack Rickard, editor of Boardwatch magazine, the largest trade publication covering the bulletin board and on-line service industry. He is organizing the industry's largest trade convention, called the One BBS-Con, to be held Aug. 14 to 16 in Denver. **********Mr. Rickard, who estimates the bulletin board industry at nearly $500 million, said there are nearly 60,000 public access bulletin boards in the United States, up from 3,500 five years ago. These boards, most devoted to exchanging information about hobbies and vocations, are open to anyone with a personal computer, a modem to transmit and receive data via a telephone line and a communications program to dial telephone numbers. **********But the growth of boards operated by private companies like Seiko and Eastman Kodak has far outstripped growth of public ones, and they now surpass 120,000. **********Why such growth? It certainly has helped that the prices of personal computers and high-speed modems have fallen drastically.  But the real force seems to be that people are inherently curious and sociable. **********10 Million Users  Lots of Information And Most Is Free **********Industry experts estimate that about 10 million people are regular callers to public-access bulletin-board services, called BBS for short. They find the numbers in magazines like BBS Caller's Digest and Computer Shopper. A user anywhere on the globe can dial a board's phone number at his or her convenience, pick a topic of interest, read messages left by others and reply. The replies provoke or inspire more replies, all readable in sequence by others. Users can also trade private electronic messages, or E-mail. Many boards belong to far-flung international networks, like Internet, which passes messages between bulletin boards in dozens of countries, negating overseas telephone charges. **********Besides reading and leaving messages, users call bulletin boards to pull games, word processing and graphics programs from their file libraries. These can be copied at little or no charge. Users can also transfer their own files to the library. **********The bulletin boards' abilities to catalogue messages, and to send, receive and store electronic files, make them large repositories of knowledge, with as many potential sources of information as there are callers. **********Just a Sideline  Often, Profit Isn't the Point **********Many system operators, known as \"sysops,\" (pronounced sigh-sops) start public bulletin boards as a creative hobby. A system with the computer hardware and software needed to work with a single telephone line costs about $3,000; most bulletin boards have one to eight lines. But in the last two years, to meet soaring demand, systems with 20, 40, even 60 or more lines have proliferated. **********Kevin Behrens began the Aquila Bulletin Board in Chicago in 1988 as a hobby on a spare I.B.M.-compatible computer with a single line. \"It just went nuts,\" Mr. Behrens said. \"We got more and more calls, put up more phone lines and built it up. Now we have 25 lines and get over 2,500 calls a month.\" **********The largest bulletin boards, like Exec-PC with 230 lines, offer so many services that they are becoming almost indistinguishable from the giant on-line information businesses like Compuserve and Prodigy. **********Unlike their larger cousins, though, more than 80 percent of bulletin boards are nonprofit; a third charge nothing at all. To cover costs for more sophisticated systems, some operators charge annual fees, typically $15 to $60. Some boards make a profit by offering a mix of free and pay services. Tess Heder and her husband, Brian Miller, run the Channel 1 board in Cambridge, Mass., with 85 lines. It has achieved wide repute for its breadth of topics and file collection. It receives about 2,500 calls a day, earning more than $20,000 a month in subscription and access fees. **********Not surprisingly, the four largest sellers of operating programs for both corporate and hobby bulletin boards have really taken off. The companies, all privately owned, are Gallacticomm Inc. in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Mustang Software Inc. in Bakersfield, Calif.; eSoft Inc. in Aurora, Colo., and the Clark Development Company in Murray, Utah. **********\"Doing nothing particularly differently, these companies have doubled in size in the past year,\" said Mr. Rickard. He estimated the market for their programs at more than $20 million annually. **********Philip Becker, president of eSoft Inc., said sales were \"growing so rapidly the numbers are obsolete almost as soon as you say them.\" **********The biggest financial winners, though, are telephone companies, which effortlessly rake in more than $700 million a year from extra line installations and modem calls. **********\"They make out like bandits and don't even know it,\" said Mr. Becker of eSoft. **********In fact, though, Ameritech Services, a phone company based in Illinois, includes a list of area bulletin boards in phone bills. **********Office Dialogue  Managers Can Reach Workers in Seconds **********Bulletin board software companies say that corporate sales now outnumber \"hobby\" sales three to one. Some are used by industry trade groups, like the National Dairy Board in Arlington, Va. Its board is used by regional organizations can for market research. **********Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois uses a bulletin board to collect and process Medicaid claims and transfer them to the government. Doctors and other providers can dial in to transmit claims. Many businesses use bulletin boards as 24-hour customer service lines, where clients can get information, leave messages or place orders. **********But the biggest growth has been by private corporations that want to give their managers and employees more access to company information, policy messages, or even minutes of meetings. Nikon Precision Inc., a semiconductor equipment company in Belmont, Calif., uses a bulletin board to transfer data and information between corporate headquarters, 12 satellite offices and employees at home. **********\"Purchases of group communications software is a huge trend,\" says Paul Johnson, vice president for Equity Research at the First Boston Corporation.  SOME ARE REALLY FOR THE BIRDS **********Computer bulletin boards are almost perversely diverse, with topics ranging from birds and bees to the birds and the bees. **********Trouble hand-feeding your cockatiel?

Engineers in the 1950's were stunned by the idea that nuclear power meant cheap, limitless energy and stunned again in the 70's that it did not. New inventions, regulations and political developments rush onward, sometimes offering vast changes, but often doing no more than offering. **********What is next on the horizon? **********Here are three glimpses of the future, each of which might prove a turning point -- or a mirage. They are the large-scale direct production of electricity from sunlight, the establishment of workable agreements that would foster the use of renewable energy sources and the peaceful use of surplus plutonium from nuclear bombs. Photovoltaic Cells **********Photovoltaic cells, which make electricity directly from sunlight without emissions, are waiting in the wings. While they are far too costly today to compete with conventionally made power, they are useful in devices that would be expensive to wire to the power grid, like irrigation pumps, roadside signs and emergency call boxes. And with breakthroughs in the laboratory and factory, the price of the cells is rapidly falling. **********When and where will they reach the magic price level and begin to displace power from coal, oil and natural gas? With a little extra help in the form of research money, maybe next year, in White Pine, Colo. Advocates of \"renewable\" energy say a cluster of 33 houses high in the Rockies could become the Kitty Hawk of solar power. **********White Pine, which is 110 miles southwest of Denver and 7 miles up a dirt road, is tied to the Public Service Company of Colorado's electric system by a line that crawls five miles over an 11,300-foot mountain pass. The 70-year-old line is still functional but perilously close to the tops of the winter snow drifts, and the utility fears that the wire will be a hazard to skiers. The utility wants something done by the end of the summer of 1993; replacing the line would cost $130,000. **********The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a Government research institution near Denver, and Public Service drew up an alternative: a 35-kilowatt solar cell array, coupled with batteries that would store the energy if it was not needed when the sun shone. The cells would provide two-thirds of White Pine's electric needs; the rest would come from a generator running on propane. **********The cells and the generator are off-the-shelf parts. But the utility would have to develop a control system to keep track of how much electricity the cells produced, how much was in the batteries and how much was being consumed. The system would run the propane generator when needed. **********\"There is nothing quite like this in America, where a complete community in America would be serviced like this,\" said John Thornton, a photovoltaic expert at the Energy Department who works at the renewable energy laboratory. **********According to Chuck Rhodes, senior planning engineer at Public Service of Colorado, the alternative system would cost $500,000. Photovoltaic cells are now most commonly found on pocket calculators, but White Pine, said Mr. Rhodes, would teach energy engineers more about utility-scale applications. The cells that would be used in the White Pine project would produce energy at a cost more than triple that of electricity from old-fashioned coal-fired plant. **********The company does not think its other electricity customers should pay for the White Pine experiment and is looking for financing from the energy laboratory and others to make up the difference. **********If the solar project is built, said Mr. Thornton, \"it will give confidence to other utilities, so other people say, 'Yeah, that's possible.' \" If the price of solar cells falls by half again -- as it has done several times -- it would be economical in some locations, he added. **********Mr. Rhodes agreed. \"It's inevitable that the price will come down,\" he said. \"It's a question of how long, 5years or 20 years.\"  Renewable Energy **********Regulators have debated for years how to set prices for electricity in a way that gives appropriate advantage to power from renewable energy, like wind, sun or trees, which do not pollute or deplete natural resources. Now, the Bonneville Power Administration, which serves the Pacific Northwest, has taken a concrete step in that direction. **********The administration, a Federal agency, announced in December that it wanted to sign purchase contracts with independent electricity producers, a common way for utilities to get new power supplies. But Bonneville said its contracts would specify that if over the agreements' 20-year lives Congress imposes a tax on pollutants, including one on carbon dioxide, which is believed to cause global warming, the tax would be paid by the electricity seller, and not by Bonneville. The possibility of such a tax might discourage a builder of conventional generators. **********According to Gary L. Fuqua, deputy assistant administrator of Bonneville, if the generator bears the risk, \"renewables\" have an advantage in the bidding, because they do not emit carbon dioxide. **********Energy experts say that most existing contracts are silent on the question of new taxes, and this clause represents a new direction, though Bonneville is not certain whether it will affect the bids it will receive. **********But an independent producer who planned to use a conventional source like natural gas might go to Lloyd's of London for a policy guarding against a pollution tax, Mr. Fuqua said, and the price of that policy could give the edge to another technology. Or, as a precaution, a company that planned to use fossil fuels might add a few tenths of a cent to its price, giving an advantage to renewables. Or a company that specializes in plants that run on fossil fuels might decide not to bid, leaving the field open for renewables. Surplus Plutonium **********A political shift, the end of the cold war, has produced a problem and an opportunity in nuclear power. The United States and the Soviet Union are disassembling thousands of nuclear weapons with tons of plutonium, which can power reactors as well as bombs. **********Disassembly is a very small step because the bulk of the work involved in making nuclear weapons is in preparing the plutonium. In this case, the plowshare can be quickly converted back into a sword. **********But the plutonium can be safely disposed of in a nuclear reactor. And while the precise amounts involved are classified information, it is clear that only civilian power reactors can do the job. **********\"We should do it damn fast,\" said Ersel A. Evans, a consultant and former vice president of the Westinghouse Hanford Company, which for years ran a big weapons installation for the Government. \"There are hundreds of tons of plutonium out there,\" he said, raising the possibility that the owners could rebuild bombs, or some could be diverted by a third party. \"If we're horrified by it, why don't we do something?\" **********On its face, this would also seem to be an opportunity, since making uranium fuel for utility reactors requires extensive, painstaking preparation.  Like surplus k-rations, the bomb plutonium would seem to be available for peacetime use. **********But no one is jumping. **********\"I don't think the utilities would be wanting to volunteer for that sort of thing,\" said John J. Taylor, vice president for nuclear power at the Electric Power Research Institute, a not-for-profit consortium in Palo Alto, Calif. **********Loading plutonium fuel would require a license amendment, and that requires public hearings, something no utility relishes. And, experts say, many utilities are loath to make any connection between their plants and nuclear weapons. Several experts with long Government experience in plutonium-fueled reactors who now work in the civilian sector refused to be quoted on the subject. **********And plutonium, unlike uranium, is highly toxic, so it must be converted into fuel rods in highly controlled circumstances. Fuel manufacturers would have to convert the plutonium from its current metal form to the ceramic form used in reactors, but plants to do this do not exist in the United States. If built, the plants and fuel would have to be guarded against anyone shopping for bomb fuel. **********But no significant technical breakthroughs are needed. In fact, all American power reactors already run partly on plutonium. They convert uranium into plutonium every moment they run; plutonium is formed when a neutron freed by splitting a uranium atom crashes into another uranium atom and is absorbed by it, transforming it into a new element. When the new plutonium atom is hit again by a neutron, it splits and gives off energy. **********With all the complications, Dr. Taylor said, \"I wouldn't want to state that there's some economic advantage there.\" But if the Government put it forward as an important national problem that only the utilities could solve, he said, \"I'm sure people would cooperate.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/23/world/what-is-a-team-un-delays-bosnia-s-olympians.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1992-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 929, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "What Is a Team?

On days when the bombardments have been especially intense, she has shifted her running to the basement passageways of the Holiday Inn.  Two Views of the War **********Although the dispute seems likely to be resolved before the Games begin this weekend, it reflects the underlying animosities between the United Nations command and the Government. Maj. Gen. Lewis W. MacKenzie of Canada, the military commander, told reporters today that he was \"sick and tired\" of driving through the streets of Sarajevo and seeing people along the roadways sticking their fingers in the air in a gesture of hostility. **********The estrangement has involved widely differing views of the political and military situation. The central issue is whether the Government, defending Sarajevo against Serbian nationalist forces who have held the city under siege for 109 days, has been a hapless victim of Serbian ruthlessness, as the Government contends, or whether it is partly responsible for Serbian attacks that have killed and wounded thousands of civilians, as United Nations officials have alleged. Question of Who Shot First **********General MacKenzie, 52, has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of the Government as he prepares to yield his command at the end of the month. The General has said that the decision to replace him is linked to the replacement of an 850-man Canadian mechanized battalion by French, Egyptian and Ukrainian troops. But Government officials have suggested that their dislike for the General, made known to senior United Nations officials, may have influenced the moves. **********The strains came to a head on Tuesday when General MacKenzie told a news conference in the Government press center that Government forces defending Sarajevo had provoked many of the Serbian bombardments in the last two weeks by opening fire after both sides had accepted a cease-fire. **********\"You sort of tickle them here and there with little attacks, and they respond with heavy weapons, then the international community condemns them for bombarding Sarajevo,\" the General said. **********Bosnian officials do not deny that their forces have started some of the firing. But they object strongly to the General's suggestion that firing by their troops and retaliation by the Serbian forces can be equated. Their fire, the Bosnian officials say, is directed at Serbian military positions, while the Serbian attacks are mainly aimed at civilians. About 150 civilians have been killed and at least 400 wounded in the past two weeks. **********Although neither side was saying so today, it seems likely that a compromise could be reached that would allow the Olympic team, or at least some members, to fly as originally planned on one of the military aircraft that shuttles relief supplies to Sarajevo from Zagreb, the Croatian capital. **********From Zagreb, the two athletes and those accompanying them could take a commercial flight to Barcelona, where the Bosnian team, representing a country that declared its independence from Yugoslavia less than five months ago, would be making its first appearance. **********But the situation tonight, with both sides saying that they would not compromise, had Ms. Buric, the 3,000-meter runner, close to tears. She said over dinner that she felt that years of training to qualify for the Olympic team had been wasted, and that she would still be in Sarajevo, watching the Games on television, when her qualifying heat is run on July 31. **********The dispute blew up on Monday, when United Nations officials noted that only 2 of the 27 names submitted for flight clearance -- Ms. Buric and Vlado Paradzik, 24, a judo competitor -- were athletes. Mik Magnusson, the British-born United Nations official who is the chief civil affairs officer here, told the Bosnians that the delegation would have to be reduced to 10 people, including the two athletes, a team doctor, an Olympic judge, two members of the Olympic Committee, an interpreter and three reporters.  Rationing the Few Seats **********Mr. Magnusson, backed by General MacKenzie, said the United Nations had to be careful not to approve the use of relief aircraft by anybody not essential to the team because of arrangements under which the Sarajevo airport was opened to relief flights three weeks ago. **********Before today's ruling on the size of the Olympic delegation, Serbian leaders had agreed to allow 27 members to be flown out. **********After an angry meeting between General MacKenzie and senior Bosnian Government officials, Stjepan Klujic, a vice president of the Government who is chairman of the Bosnian Olympic Committee, said the issue of who would go to Barcelona involved \"the dignity of the state itself.\" **********\"The Olympic Committee would prefer that the Bosnian team not compete in Barcelona rather than agreeing to strike from its delegation the 17 people excluded by the United Nations,\" he said. These 17 included two other reporters, three people listed as \"technical escorts,\" meaning bodyguards, a \"hostess\" and two people listed as \"marketing executives.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/15/business/securities-firms-merge.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Securities Firms Merge", "print_headline": "Securities Firms Merge", "body_text": " **********Douglas James Securities and Asch-Dwyer Municipals have merged to form Douglas James Asch-Dwyer Inc.

Its sales totaled about $600 million for the year. The chain is expected to sell for less than half of its annual sales. **********\"In today's market, I can't imagine they would get $200 million for it,\" said John Horan, the publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, an industry newsletter in Glen Mills, Pa. **********Herman's expanded nationally under the ownership of W.

Dee later changed its name to Gateway. **********Herman's and other retailers with medium-sized stores are having difficulty competing with larger operations like the K Mart Corporation's Sports Authority unit. The average Sports Authority store is 42,000 square feet, four times as large as a typical Herman's store at 10,000 square feet. **********Other large stores include Sports Town Inc., which said last week that it planned to go public. **********Herman's is also under assault from smaller retailers inside shopping malls, like Champs, a sports-clothing chain owned by the Woolworth Corporation. **********Other troubled sporting-goods retailers similar to Herman's include Oshman's Sporting Goods in Houston, which has lost money in its last two fiscal years. Also, Pacific Enterprises, the Southern California utility, recently said it planned to sell its three sporting-goods chains.

United Nations officials implied that the overflights, which they said occurred mostly near the border with Honduras, came from the neighboring country. But Honduran officials denied that the flights originated in their country. **********Under the peace accords signed on Jan 16., by Tuesday the rebels are to concentrate in 15 secure areas under United Nations supervision and put their weapons in storage areas to which they and the United Nations military observers will share keys. In the next eight months, the rebels are to gradually leave the secure areas to join civilian life, and concurrently their weapons will be destroyed. **********But United Nations officials said it was unlikely that the Tuesday deadline would be met because plans were still being drawn up to create the infrastructure to feed and house the former combatants, whose number rebel leaders have put at 6,800 men and women. The officials said they were trying to find at least $2 million for that work, money that was not budgeted in the planning for the cease-fire. Land-Rights Dispute **********Despite the angry language from both sides about the overflights, no one expected the issue to disrupt the peace. In fact, the most serious dispute, and the most difficult to resolve, is that over land rights. **********The Government, in response to demands from rebel leaders, committed itself to find ways to permit rebel families and sympathizers to become the owners of lands they occupied early in the war when the owners fled to other parts of the country to escape guerrilla control. **********How that was to be done was not spelled out clearly in the peace accords, but the Government talked of creating a \"land bank\" to serve as a kind of clearing house, offering the owners payment or land somewhere else in the country in exchange for the land they abandoned. **********But constitutional experts say that if the original owners still want their land in the rebel or conflict zones they have a constitutional right to claim it, creating a potential conflict with those now occupying it. **********Further, in what may be a more serious point of conflict, during the last month peasant and labor groups affiliated with the rebel front have occupied many farms in parts of the country that were never under guerrilla domination or that are in borderline areas where the army and guerrillas claimed influence during the war. Mediation Is Urged **********Joaquin Villalobos, who was the top military commander in the rebel front during the war and is now pursuing a political career, seemed to agree at a recent news conference that some of the occupations were unjustified. **********But he urged the Government to hold off from forcibly dislodging those who have taken over the lands and, instead, let the rebel front serve as mediator. He denied that the rebel leadership was fomenting such takeovers. **********\"In this country, businessmen and landowners have the notion that if people protest about something it is always because we have ordered them to do so,\" he said. \"They have to learn that these things happen for social reasons.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/07/world/mission-to-somalia-a-few-in-congress-advising-caution-or-vote-on-somalia.html": {"writer_name": "Clifford Krauss", "pub_date": "1992-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 835, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Few in Congress Advising Caution, or Vote, on Somalia", "print_headline": "MISSION TO SOMALIA; A Few in Congress Advising Caution, or Vote, on Somalia", "body_text": " **********In the chorus of Congressional support for military intervention in Somalia, a few dissident voices are urging caution and, in some cases, suggesting that the mission be formally put to a vote under the War Powers Act. **********Many Democrats and some Republicans in Congress had been urging the Bush Administration for months to step up its efforts to get food to starving people in Somalia. But now that President Bush has acted, some lawmakers are troubled that Congress, which is not in session now, is exerting so little influence as the Administration begins a military operation. **********Adding to their concern is an awareness that the deployment of combat troops to Somalia is a new kind of intervention, in which American security interests are not directly involved, and that it could set a precedent for military relief operations in more dangerous places like Yugoslavia, Cambodia or Liberia. **********The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, and other senior lawmakers expressed firm support for the Administration's decision in a meeting on Friday with Mr. Bush and with other Congressional leaders at the White House. Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, even expressed hope that the Somalia operation could set a precedent for sending a United Nations peacekeeping force to Haiti to help establish a constitutional government.

Murtha of Pennsylvania, the Democratic chairman of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee, pressed for a commitment to bring the troops back home quickly. \"The danger is we won't be able to get them out,\" he said after the meeting. **********So far, lawmakers' expressions of caution have varied in their emphasis and have been largely uncoordinated. **********Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, a senior Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, warned that Congress should not assume that American troops will face no meaningful opposition from violent Somali gang members, but he has stopped short of opposing the operation. **********Senator Hank Brown of Colorado, a Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee who also attended the meeting at the White House on Friday, said he could not support the troop deployment \"without a clearly defined military mission.\" **********Mr. Brown also argued that troops performing what he views as \"police functions\" in Somalia should have a deeper understanding of the Somalis' language or religion or culture.  'Mistakes' Seen **********\"I think it's a mistake not to have Muslim troops take the lead in this,\" the Senator, who served in Vietnam as a Navy officer, said after the White House briefing. **********Since the Vietnam War, Congress has been wary of allowing the President to act unimpeded in setting foreign policy. Some members say that even if the operation to feed Somalis is overwhelmingly popular, Congressional prerogatives established by the War Powers Act must be exercised through a vote authorizing the deployment of troops. **********The War Powers Act was approved by Congress in 1973, overriding a veto by President Nixon, in the wake of the Vietnam War. It requires the President to report to Congress when he deploys troops in areas where they might face combat. Once he declares that troops face \"imminent\" risk, the resolution is invoked and the President is granted a 60-day limit to commit forces without Congressional authorization. **********\"The widespread violence against non-government relief personnel, U.N. staff, and occasionally even U.S. military personnel in the region suggests that the dangers of such a deployment are real,\" Senator Paul D. Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, wrote in a letter last week to Senator George J.

Nature of Mission Cited **********Mr. Mitchell maintains that there is no need to reconvene Congress under the terms of the War Powers Act because the mission in Somalia is aimed at feeding the starving rather than putting down a revolt or dislodging a government. In any case, he has said, Congress can discuss the issue when it goes into session in January, well within the 60-day limit set by the act for authorizing deployment of American troops in a hostile situation. **********In a letter to Congressional leaders on Friday, the American Civil Liberties Union called on Congress to reconvene quickly to affirm its war powers by authorizing the troop deployment. **********\"Even if the objective is to deliver food and medical supplies,\" said Kate Martin, director of the organization's Center for National Security Studies, \"the Constitution simply forbids the President from deciding on his own to authorize tens of thousands of U.S. troops to engage in force and military combat.\" **********In his meeting with the Congressional leaders on Friday, Mr. Bush repeated his contention that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/23/business/market-place-new-lines-hold-hope-for-chrysler.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1992-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 738, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; New Lines Hold Hope For Chrysler", "print_headline": "Market Place; New Lines Hold Hope For Chrysler", "body_text": " **********FEW new products from Detroit in recent years have provoked as much curiosity on Wall Street as the Chrysler Corporation's midsized models, code-named L/H and set to be sold as the Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision and Chrysler Concorde. **********Accordingly, several financial analysts took the unusual step this week of attending the L/H debut in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., held principally for automotive journalists. **********The debut, held in three sessions to accommodate everyone, consisted of technical briefings by Chrysler executives and test drives of Intrepids, Visions and Concordes over several hundred miles through horse country and the 112-degree heat of Borrego Springs, Calif. **********Cars made by competitors were available, too. So analysts and reviewers could drive a $19,000 Intrepid for a while, and then switch to a $30,000 Acura Legend to see how they compared. **********Too often in the past, Chrysler cars compared poorly. **********Hobbled by rock-bottom credit ratings and unfinanced pension liabilities of some $4 billion, Chrysler now needs a \"home run\" car to restore financial stability and confidence. The Ford Motor Company -- and its common stock -- received just such a lift in the mid-80's when its Taurus and Sable midsized models became smash hits. **********Analysts were optimistic when they saw hand-built L/H prototypes last year. But they were eager to assess how L/H's built on production tooling compared with cars like the Taurus, Toyota Camry and the Legend, which are competitive on either size or price. They were also keen to hear professional judgments of automotive reviewers, because their recommendations often shape consumers' early buying patterns. **********\"Certainly some cars the reviewers love don't sell well,\" said Jerry G. Paul, automotive analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, which owns about 20 million Chrysler shares. \"But it's a lot easier for a car to sell well if they love it than if they don't.\" **********The reaction of Kathy Hamilton, senior editor of Automobile magazine, seemed to exemplify what most automotive writers were saying: \"The consensus was that this is an exceptional automobile. It definitely was major league, in my opinion, and the first American car I've seen in a long time that you could call state of the art.\" **********Reviews of the L/H cars will begin appearing next week; the cars will trickle into dealerships during August and September and become more readily available later in the fall. **********Chrysler executives say the L/H proves they have been able to restructure their development process from a hierarchical system to a team system, in the manner of the best of their Japanese competitors. **********Most of the 22 automotive analysts tracked by Zaks Investment Research in Chicago are already recommending either a full-fledged buy or a buy-hold on Chrysler stock. The main reason for the buy signal is that the economy is in an early phase of recovery, which usually spells price appreciation for the cyclical automotive stocks. But if the L/H succeeds \"it could give the stock an especially strong tailwind,\" Mr. Paul said. **********Analysts warn that Chrysler must still prove it can maintain the quality of the L/Hs's when the assembly line cranks up to speed. And the economy must grow robustly enough to provide buyers. Given those caveats, the L/H could once more turn Chrysler stock into a great turnaround story. **********Harvey Heinbach, Merrill Lynch's automotive analyst, said that driving the L/H and listening to reviewers extol its virtues reinforced his confidence in the No. 3 auto maker. If Chrysler sells 225,000 L/H's annually, pretax profit could top $1.1 billion, he estimated, representing a gross profit of $5,000 a car -- about what Chrysler earned during its best years from its highly profitable mini-van. **********The depressed price of Chrysler stock during the last two years reflects the auto maker's recent earnings performance: break-even in 1990 followed by a $795 million loss last year. But unlike Ford and the General Motors Corporation, Chrysler's balance sheet remains scarred by its near-bankruptcy in the early 1980's. The auto maker can no longer borrow money in public credit markets. **********In December, when Chrysler was forced to raise $350 million of new equity, its common stock was selling for roughly $10 a share. That compared with a peak of $48 a share just before the market crash of 1987.

Septic shock strikes about 200,000 Americans a year, killing about half of them. **********The drugs are monoclonal antibodies, which are bioengineered versions of the proteins that the body uses to fight infections. The antibodies attach themselves to toxins released into the blood by the bacteria and neutralize them. **********Both companies have been handicapped by a lack of data showing generally reduced deaths of patients taking their drugs. Only among a subgroup of patients whose septic shock was caused by gram negative bacteria was there a significant reduction in the number of deaths. **********Because doctors have no way to determine the type of bacteria causing an infection before administering drugs, and because the drugs are so expensive -- about $3,750 a dose for Centoxin -- hospitals may be reluctant to use them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/08/business/slow-start-at-europe-s-disneyland.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1992-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 598, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Slow Start At Europe's Disneyland", "print_headline": "Slow Start At Europe's Disneyland", "body_text": " **********Euro Disneyland, which opened with immense fanfare almost two months ago, has encountered teething problems, and its normally ebullient executives are backing away from their unbridled optimism. **********Euro Disney stock plunged 5 percent Friday, to 109.5 French francs on the Paris bourse, more than 20 percent below its price when the park opened and more than 30 percent below its high. **********The fall followed a report issued Thursday in which Euro Disney said it was having difficulty attracting people from the Paris region and suggested that it might not be profitable in the fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30.

In Thursday's report, Euro Disney said, \"In light of the operating uncertainties, there can be no assurance as to whether the group will achieve profitability during the fiscal year.\" Income From Interest **********For the first half, the company announced net income of 74.57 million francs ($14 million), essentially from interest on the cash it is holding. **********The report said attendance at the park and guests at Euro Disney's six hotels there had fluctuated considerably during the period. \"Activity on weekends and holidays has significantly exceeded that of midweek periods,\" it said. It promised new advertising and tight management of costs in response to the situation. **********Euro Disneyland's opening was accompanied by a barrage of withering critiques from French intellectuals.

The Administration has begun scrambling for money, including the possible diversion of general foreign-aid appropriations. **********The money would guarantee not only huge American investments in factories, oilfields and the like, but also payments to American companies for products exported to the Commonwealth. So far, American companies have invested only $400 million in Russia and the other republics. Last year, they exported about $10 billion in goods to the Soviet Union. **********While numerous American companies are starting to operate in the Commonwealth, no American or European corporation has yet spent $200 million on a factory, an oilfield operation or other single project -- the scale of investment that would give a company's home nation an important presence in the economy. The largest single investment so far is less than $80 million and most are under $10 million. **********To encourage bigger outlays by businesses, the Administration included special provisions in a bill to authorize some contribution by the United States to a $24 billion international-aid package. One provision would channel more than $1.2 billion now earmarked for general foreign aid -- road building in Africa, for example -- into money to guarantee American ventures in the Commonwealth. **********\"We regard it as important to take whatever steps are necessary to help promote the role of United States trade and investment in developing the private sector in the former Soviet Union,\" said a State Department official who insisted on anonymity. **********The bill's prospects in Congress are uncertain. Some Democratic leaders have urged opposition until the President has a more effective domestic policy. And in an age of huge budget deficits, neither the Administration nor anyone in Congress has called for new money to support private-sector operations in the Commonwealth. **********Mr. Baker of the manufacturers group and a dozen other chief executives, along with representatives of the United States Chamber of Commerce, pressed their case with Mr. Bush at a White House meeting in late April. A Commerce Department survey of American companies, released in late April, uncovered the same desire for help. 'We Are Used to Taking Risks' **********\"We are used to taking risks, but risks that we can see and quantify,\" said Willard A. Workman, vice president for the chamber's international division. \"But in the Commonwealth countries you cannot learn enough or find out enough in the available time. You have to make assumptions and you have to be responsible to shareholders. So you look to Government for help.\" **********The Administration's initially favorable response to the unusually explicit corporate request for Government help constitutes what many economists describe as de facto industrial policy -- with the backing of giants like I.B.M., Coca-Cola, Texaco, Cummins Engine, Archer-Daniels-Midland and Dresser Industries. The term refers to a collaboration between the Government and the private sector that the Reagan and Bush Administrations, with their free-market orientation, have publicly opposed but privately permitted. Effect of Military Spending **********Military spending and the technologies it has generated represent the granddaddy of industrial policy, of course. But as military spending has declined, other programs have appeared, one recent example being Commerce Department grants to companies engaged in developing high-technology products, like special ceramics used in electronic products. **********Now, by publicly supporting Federal guarantees for private-sector investments, the Administration could fuel the debate over the need for a more comprehensive industrial policy, one that would explore other areas that could benefit from Government help and presumably rank them by importance. **********\"Do we want to go piecemeal from one case to the next, or do we want to step back and look at the broader objectives of industrial policy?\" asked Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. \"Is investment in Russia more important than a business-government partnership to clean up the environment in the United States, or infrastructure spending here, or who knows what else?\" Corporate Change of Heart **********Others note that many corporations are altering or reversing their policies. Now, they are underscoring their American identities. During the 1980's, a period of rapid expansion abroad, they argued that their global interests were not always those of the United States. **********Among other things, the Administration and Corporate America agree that European governments, particularly Germany's, are giving more support than the United States is to exports and to the investments of their corporate sectors in the Commonwealth republics. **********Such ties between business and government, in turn, are now considered an essential tool in the competition among the biggest industrial nations -- chiefly the United States and Germany -- for influence over the Commonwealth nations as they develop their rich natural resources and open their markets to the West. **********Apart from the Government's foreign-policy goals, American corporations subscribe to the proposition that the payoff for early investors could be large by the 21st century. But they also argue that doing business in a land that banished capitalism for so long presents risks that are almost impossible to assess. **********The problem, then, is to get through the early, risky years without too much loss, and the solution, American companies say, is Federal guarantees that go far beyond those now offered by the Export-Import Bank, which lends money to foreigners to buy American exports, and by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a Federal agency that guarantees foreign investments. Separately, the Federal Commodity Credit Corporation finances food exports. **********\"There is a recognition developing on both sides that the private sector and Government need to pull together to assure that we have a fair chance to be successful in the emerging Commonwealth market,\" said Thomas J. Duesterberg, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for international economic policy. Requests Outweigh Resources **********The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, more commonly known as OPIC, has sufficient money today to insure nearly $8 billion in private-sector investment throughout the world, mostly against losses resulting from political upheaval. American companies, however, have applied for $12 billion in investment guarantees for the Commonwealth states alone, OPIC reports, including requests that exceed OPIC's $50 million limit for a single investment. **********\"No one right now is pushing for a higher ceiling,\" said Howard L. Hills, OPIC's vice president and general counsel. \"But that is a political question that is very pregnant.\" **********While OPIC has not yet guaranteed Commonwealth investments, the Export-Import Bank has issued $172 million in financing for exports to these republics. The bank pays the American exporter directly and then collects the loan over a period of years from the buyer in Russia or another Commonwealth republic. **********The bank has requests for more than $2 billion in export financing, and it has money to provide $11 billion in export financing worldwide in the current fiscal year. But the bank says it will proceed cautiously in the Commonwealth states, unwilling to take greater risks than Corporate America would take on its own. The caution reflects the bank's mandate from Congress. **********\"We are not suspending good business judgment; that is not our game,\" said Thomas Moran, the bank's vice president for Europe and Canada. \"We operate under a Congressional charter that specifies that we must find reasonable assurance of repayment.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/world/baker-raised-alert-on-iraqi-buildup-papers-show.html": {"writer_name": "Elaine Sciolino", "pub_date": "1992-09-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 519, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Baker Raised Alert on Iraqi Buildup, Papers Show", "print_headline": "Baker Raised Alert on Iraqi Buildup, Papers Show", "body_text": " **********As the Bush Administration was trying to preserve its friendship with President Saddam Hussein just before he invaded Kuwait, Secretary of State James A.

Mosbacher, who was then Secretary of Commerce, urging the imposition of new controls on the sale of equipment and technology that could contribute to Iraq's arms programs. The letter was based on a memo he received six days earlier drafted by the heads of four State Department offices explaining the need for new export controls. **********\"Iraq's extraordinarily aggressive weapons proliferation efforts make this situation urgent,\" Mr. Baker wrote, adding that the controls should begin \"as quickly as possible.\" **********Coincidentally, on the same day Mr. Baker sent the letter, April C.

Their goal was to create an organization that would represent underdeveloped nations seeking to preserve their independence in the midst of a cold-war rivalry that threatened to swallow them up. But 31 years after their first summit meeting in Belgrade, the members of the Non-Aligned Movement are not so likeminded, nor are they all underdeveloped. **********In conversations away from the meeting hall in Jakarta, delegates say it is increasingly difficult to see what the leaders of a fiercely Communist nation like North Korea have in common with the oil-rich sheiks who lead Kuwait or the free-marketeers of Singapore. All three nations are members of the movement. **********The differences among the movement's members have already been demonstrated in Jakarta. **********A meeting of foreign ministers last weekend to plan for the summit meeting dissolved into a shouting match over what was to be done with the membership of Yugoslavia, now represented by Serbia and Montenegro. **********A group of Muslim nations asked that Yugoslavia be expelled from the organization in a show of solidarity with Muslims under seige by Serbian forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The debate was ended with a decision not to decide the question of Yugoslavia's seat until later this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/15/world/reporter-s-notebook-unpaid-for-3-years-a-somali-still-directs-traffic.html": {"writer_name": "Donatella Lorch", "pub_date": "1992-12-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1024, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reporter's Notebook; Unpaid for 3 Years, a Somali Still Directs Traffic", "print_headline": "Reporter's Notebook; Unpaid for 3 Years, a Somali Still Directs Traffic", "body_text": " **********Idriss Hassan received his last paycheck three years ago. Still, every day from 7 A.M. until 3 P.M., he works as a traffic policeman, guiding cars, camels, trucks and people through one of Mogadishu's trickiest intersections. **********It is not only a difficult task but, in a city without any form of government, tap water, electricity or phones, it is an unusual touch of normalcy. **********The traffic light has been dead for over a year, and the intersection, on a main avenue about a mile from the United States Embassy compound, is more like a bumper-car arena. Dented mini-vans, their headlights, windshields, windows and doors missing, aggressively inch their way in between pickup trucks so loaded with passengers that some ride sitting on the hood and the roof. Adding to the mix are the newly arrived Humvees and other American military vehicles commuting between the airport and the United States Embassy compound. **********More often than not, the din of car horns drowns Mr. Hassan's shrill whistle. But it is a job that he does with pride. **********\"I do it for my country and because I love being a policeman,\" he said. **********There were once more than 200 traffic police officers in Mogadishu. Now there are only a handful, said Mr. Hassan, a slim 55-year-old who has spent 30 years in the traffic police and works at the intersection with four of his friends. **********Other former policemen want to come back to work, but they do not have uniforms. All that is left of Mr. Hassan's original uniform is the blue beret, the epaulettes and his whistle. He had to make himself new khaki trousers, and he sewed his own white shirt. **********Tears welled in Mr. Hassan's eyes when he recounted what he once had. **********\"I had beautiful white gloves which I used to direct the traffic,\" he said in fluent Italian learned during colonial rule of this part of Somalia. \"I had a shoulder holster and a gun and shiny black boots, and everyone respected me.\" Cheaper Weapons **********Weapons may have mostly disappeared along the main avenues of Mogadishu, but they are highly visible at the Bakara market. **********Patched together under rusty corrugated tin roofs and burlap-topped huts, the market stretches out along narrow, muddy lanes in the western part of the capital. **********It is one of busiest places in the city, and one of the roughest. Hundreds of Somalis meander through the chaotic, pickpocket-infested jostle accompanied by bodyguards toting M-16's and AK-47's. Armed men guarding the stalls and stores threatened to shoot loiterers, including Western ones. There is much distrust of foreigners here, and the Somalis who were the most talkative with a Western visitor were the few people who hissed: \"Be careful! Watch out!\" **********At a wheat store, the counter is used to prop up the owner's recoilless rifles and shiny coils of ammunition. Much of the wheat, rice and flour in the stores has made its way to the market after being looted from the warehouses and convoys of foreign relief agencies trying to alleviate the suffering in the famine-stricken interior of the country. **********The looting may have kept the Somali economy afloat, allowing the citizens of Mogadishu access to affordable food. But in the last couple of weeks, prices for basics have skyrocketed because supplies have dwindled. **********Dates imported from Saudi Arabia cost the equivalent of $1.80 a pound, sugar from China has tripled in price in the last week to $3.60 a pound, and rice has doubled to 70 cents a pound. **********Conversely, the price of weapons has plummeted since the Americans arrived and began fitful efforts to collect arms from Somalis. An AK-47, the most popular assault rifle here, now fetches $50, down from $150 a week ago. **********One of the biggest businesses is in Somali passports. For $50, anyone can choose from stacks of green passports, complete with stamps and an empty plasticized square for a photograph. **********Money-changers worked the alleyways, calculators in one hand, thick wads of $100 bills in the other, calling out \"Dollars! Dollars!\" But aside from the armed men who guarded them, neither the money-changers nor the other merchants who aggressively hawked their wares would have attracted unusual attention had they been placed in a bazaar anywhere else in the Islamic world. **********The market also reflects another return to normalcy -- the first successful Somali harvest in two years. Vendors serve fresh lemonade, grapefruit and watermelon juice. Rickety wooden carts stacked with green mangoes slide through the thick mud of the alleys. A Woman Dragged Away **********Since American troops arrived in Mogadishu last week, thousands of Somalis have gathered on the streets or perched in trees to stare at the passing soldiers. For the most part, they have been friendly and curious. But in this unpredictable city, this too can change in an instant. **********When a Somali woman got out of a jeep full of French soldiers today outside a hotel where more than 100 foreign journalists are staying, the crowd of mostly men, angry at her for being with foreigners, reacted like wildfire. Shouting, they quickly surrounded her and threw her to the ground. Some men stomped and kicked her, while others tore off her clothes and hit her in the head with sticks. **********She pulled out a knife and managed to stab one of her attackers before the weapon was wrestled away from her. Then the men dragged her by her hair into a nearby compound as they threw stones at passing photographers. **********The attack was witnessed by journalists on the roof of the hotel, and French Foreign Legionnaires watched from the roof of another building. But neither the French troops nor passing American marines intervened. **********People in the crowd later said the woman was attacked because she was accused of being a prostitute. No one knew what had happened to her after she was dragged out of sight. **********It was all over in 10 minutes, and then the crowd returned to soldier-watching."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/03/business/consumer-rates-tax-exempt-yields-gain-but-taxables-slip.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1992-09-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 488, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tax-Exempt Yields Gain but Taxables Slip", "print_headline": "CONSUMER RATES; Tax-Exempt Yields Gain but Taxables Slip", "body_text": " **********The yields offered by money market funds were mixed in the latest week, as the supply of municipal debt remained heavy and money markets regained composure after last week's decline in the dollar, according to The IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, which surveyed 857 funds. **********The assets of tax-exempt money funds were down $1.3 billion for the week, to $95 billion, as the average number of days left to maturity of securities held in fund portfolios increased a day, to 65. **********Walter S.

Kasten, Republican of Wisconsin, told Richard L. Armitage, who is directing American assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States, when he appeared before a joint hearing of two Senate committees. **********Mr. Kasten described the proposed Freedom Support Act as \"mirrors, paper clips and smoke,\" full of vague definitions that defied Congressional attempts to assess the costs. **********Other members of Congress say that the bill, scheduled to be debated in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee beginning on May 13, will have to be significantly revised if it is to pass. In all, six Congressional committees have assumed some jurisdiction over the fate of the legislation. Fate of Ukraine's Missiles **********The Congressional warning came on the day that President Bush welcomed Leonid M. Kravchuk, President of Ukraine, to the White house to sign agreements on trade and technical assistance. Mr. Kravchuk also signed a pact that will send 60 Peace Corps volunteers to Ukraine. **********Mr. Kravchuk used the occasion to assure President Bush that Ukraine would abide by promises to remove tactical nuclear arms from his country, beginning with short-range weapons, which he said would be transferred to Russia by July 1. **********In Moscow today, officials of the Commonwealth of Independent States said that the last of the former Soviet Union's short-range weapons based in Ukraine had already left the territory. Asked about the discrepancy, Mr. Kravchuk insisted that the moving of weapons was still going on. **********The Administration agreements with Ukraine signed today are apparently not dependent on passage of the legislation on Soviet aid, which Mr. Bush proposed on April 1. The bill covers Washington's part in a variety of financial reform and credit programs planned for Russia and other former republics in cooperation with other leading industrial nations and the International Monetary Fund. **********President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d have appealed to Congress to enact the legislation quickly. Administration officials would like to have the aid package in place before Mr. Bush meets President Boris N. Yeltsin in mid-June. **********Mr. Armitage, pressed on the costs the legislation could incur at a time when there was pressure to improve the domestic economy, repeatedly told the Senators from the Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry that he was not asking for new funds. Senators drew attention to unspecified costs alluded to in the bill like \"sums as may be necessary\" for administrative costs, as the documents puts it at one point. **********Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, told Mr. Armitage that while there was general agreement on the basic goals of the legislation, there was \"considerable confusion about the money.\" **********Mr. Leahy said the bill did not give Congress much of a role in apportioning or shifting funds and did not allow the issues of human rights, nuclear nonproliferation, terrorism or narcotics trafficking to be introduced by legislators in considering aid programs for one or more of the former republics. Japan's Aid Role **********As the bill stood now, he said, \"Congress has been written out of the act\" -- a complaint also voiced by other Senators who say that legislators were not consulted in the drafting of what they considered to be a momentous piece of legislation. **********Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, suggested that the legislation had been drafted in haste by an Administration undecided until the last moment whether to proceed with the aid package as announced on April 1. Now the White House wants the endorsement of Congress at a time when there is likely to be difficulty getting bipartisan support, Mr. Lugar said. **********Mr. Armitage was also challenged over whether other nations were playing a large enough role in aiding the Commonwealth of Independent States, in particular Japan, which several Senators accused of being reluctant to invest in democracy in the region. He replied that Tokyo appeared to be using the promise of more assistance as part of a carrot-and-stick approach to drawing the Russians into a settlement of the dispute over islands claimed by both nations. **********Mr. Armitage acknowledged that the problem faced by the United States was how to unite in an election year \"to bury forever the cold war.\" He said that in any endeavor like that, some \"creative tension\" might be useful. **********\"But when creative tension crosses a certain line, it becomes dysfunctional,\" he said. 'Very Dangerous' Statements **********After meeting President Bush today, Mr. Kravchuk, a former Communist who took on a nationalist mantle when the Soviet Union collapsed, told reporters that he was concerned that forces in Russia have territorial claims on his country. He said he wanted international security guarantees \"in case there is a possible threat.\" **********He accused \"outside forces\" of fomenting and financing separatism in Crimea. **********\"Let us take the example of the Vice President of Russia, Mr. Rutskoy, who stepped on Crimean soil and made a first statement that Crimea is Russian,\" Mr. Kravchuk said through an interpreter. \"He hugged the barrel of a huge gun and said, 'Can we lose Crimea with that type of weapon?' He's not a man on the street, but a Vice President of Russia. Such statements are very dangerous.\" **********President Bush, hailing Mr. Kravchuk's working trip to Washington as \"the first official visit by a freely elected President of independent Ukraine,\" said he was pleased to receive the assurances that Ukraine would remove all nuclear weapons from its territory and would sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Mr. Bush said the United States would follow through on its pledge to help Ukraine account for and control nuclear materials on its territory. **********Although Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus, which with Russia housed the former Soviet nuclear arms stock, have pledged that they will reach agreements with the United States on the disposal of their weapons, the Administration has been concerned about signs of balking, most recently in Kazakhstan.                    --------------------       Breakaway Crimea Reverses **********SIMFEROPOL, Ukraine, May 6 (Reuters) -- The Crimean Parliament appeared today to reverse its conditional declaration of independence by changing the republic's constitution to say the peninsula formed part of Ukraine.

W. de Klerk, the African National Congress today published a new strategy for ending white rule that offered the white minority the prospect of an indefinite share of power in the new order. **********The black organization, led by Nelson Mandela, emphasized accelerated negotiations, \"constructive interaction\" with Mr. de Klerk's governing party, and the need for reassurances to prevent anxious white civil servants from undermining a future democracy. **********Especially striking in a week of new disclosures that the military may have sponsored dirty tricks against the African National Congress, the congress today offered the military and the police an olive branch of job security and a general amnesty. Eye on the Prize: Power **********Demonstrating a new determination not to be distracted from the pursuit of democracy, Mr. Mandela also pointedly refused to join a chorus of indignation over a tempest of scandals gathering around Mr. de Klerk's Government. **********The conciliatory gestures from the leading black organization represented an important shift in strategy. **********In June, after witnesses alleged police complicity in the massacre of blacks at Boipatong township, Mr. Mandela broke off talks with the Government, losing four months of momentum. **********Now Mr. Mandela's eye is on the prize -- power. His congress has clearly concluded that only Mr. de Klerk can deliver it, and he will only do so if he does not fear chaos beyond. **********That has brought Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk to an unlikely patch of common ground: the need to avoid a wholesale assault on the state security forces, even though the congress believes the army and the police to be rife with enemies of change. **********\"If the transition to democracy affects the interests of individuals in these institutions wholly and purely negatively, then they would serve as fertile ground from which the destabilizers would recruit,\" the new strategy document declared. **********The black organization's decision to treat the latest assertions of state malfeasance as an ugly sideshow has enabled Mr. de Klerk to weather two weeks of stormy headlines with only a vague declaration of concern. Plot Against Blacks **********Last week it was a series of audits revealing runaway graft, waste and abuse of power in some of the nominally autonomous black homelands that subsist on state subsidies. **********This week, much of South Africa was absorbed by a drama that began when Judge Richard J. Goldstone, who heads an independent commission investigating the causes of violence, raided a military intelligence operations center and unearthed files on covert activities. **********The files showed that last year, while Mr. de Klerk was negotiating a new political order, top officials of South African military intelligence hired a convicted killer, Ferdi Barnard, as a covert operative, a figure of such notoriety that he is simply \"Ferdi\" in some headlines. **********In the pre-de Klerk years, Mr. Barnard had been employed by a shadowy military branch called the Civil Cooperation Bureau, which harassed anti-apartheid campaigners. Witnesses at a judicial inquiry currently underway have asserted that operatives of that group, including Mr. Barnard, assassinated critics of the state. **********The documents made public this week showed that Mr. Barnard drafted a plan to compromise members of the African National Congress's dormant guerrilla army, using prostitutes and drug dealers to lure them into crime. **********The files included no evidence that Mr. Barnard's plan was approved or enacted -- he says it was vetoed -- and nothing indicating Mr. de Klerk was aware of this operation. Defense Purge Brushed Aside **********But the documents indicate Mr. Barnard was one of 48 operatives working out of that center at a time when Mr. de Klerk maintained he had put the past behind him. Judge Goldstone said hundreds of files remain to be examined. **********For South African muckrakers, the files were a fresh whiff of what many say they believe is a conspiratorial network -- dubbed the \"third force\" -- of hard-liners within the state security forces waging a covert war on black leaders to prevent the surrender of white power. **********The African National Congress maintains that the \"third force\" has fomented much of the violence among rival black groups to undermine their popular support. **********Brushing aside calls for a purge of the defense establishment, Mr. de Klerk put the military chief of staff, Lieut. Gen. Pierre D. Steyn, in overall charge of military intelligence today and assigned him to investigate covert activities along with Judge Goldstone. 'Furious and Outraged' **********Critics, including the African National Congress, said that amounted to the military investigating itself, and demanded that Judge Goldstone be given more manpower to widen his independent investigation. **********None of the scandals has been traced directly to Mr. de Klerk, and none is enough by itself to endanger his position. But cumulatively they are eating away at his authority, and everyone assumes worse is on the way. **********Even Mr. de Klerk's Ambassador to Washington, Harry Schwartz, broke diplomatic protocol to declare he was \"furious and outraged,\" saying the disclosures had undermined his efforts to repair South Africa's image in America. **********Against that backdrop, the behavior of the African National Congress has been remarkable. **********While issuing pro forma statements of dismay, the congress pointedly declined to pose any ultimatums or threaten to break off talks. **********While editorial writers and anti-apartheid leaders have been livid with indignation, Mr. Mandela today called Mr. de Klerk's reshuffle of military intelligence \"a good, encouraging step\" and said he was \"not disappointed.\" **********The congress quietly let Mr. de Klerk miss a Nov. 15 deadline for completing a promised release of imprisoned anti-apartheid guerrillas and for fencing migrant worker hostels regarded as violent flashpoints in black townships. **********The congress's new strategy document, approved Wednesday by its governing committee, embraced a notion of power-sharing recently proposed by Joe Slovo, chairman of the South African Communist Party, and strenuously debated within the organization. **********The congress has long endorsed a multiparty partnership to run the country during a transition period, until a new constitution is written and elections are held. **********The new statement went further, saying that \"even after the adoption of a new constitution, the balance of forces and the interests of the country as a whole may still require us to consider the establishment of a government of national unity -- provided that the parties that have lost the elections will not be able to paralyze the functions of government.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/15/business/profits-off-82-at-genentech.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 238, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Profits Off 82% at Genentech", "print_headline": "Profits Off 82% at Genentech", "body_text": " **********Genentech Inc., the biotechnology concern, today reported a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings primarily because of increased research and development spending. **********But the decline also reflected a drop in sales of the company's blood-clot-dissolving drug, Activase, which was shown in recent trials to be no more effective than a competing drug, Streptokinase, which sells for about one-tenth as much. **********Genentech's first-quarter earnings were $3.5 million, or 3 cents a share, down 82 percent from $19.4 million, or 17 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier.

They will foster a more effective and moderate governance process. **********The S.E.C.'s reforms come in the midst of a revolution in corporate governance. A new kind of oversight is emerging in which informed investors seek to improve corporate performance not through acquisitions, but through debate, negotiation and limited voting challenges. **********Consider first the effects of the S.E.C.'s reform of the rules governing communication. Before Oct. 15, S.E.C. rules mandated that any shareholder wishing to communicate with more than 10 other shareholders about matters of corporate policy register as a \"soliciting party,\" and subject all communications to government review. The new rules allow shareholders who are not soliciting votes to freely communicate with one another and management about policy. They also reduce the requirement for S.E.C. review for shareholders and corporations when soliciting votes. **********Under the old rules it was costly and risky for corporations to engage in serious conversations about corporate policy or the effectiveness of the board of directors. Obvious First Amendment questions aside, the rules thus promoted instability in corporate governance. They encouraged an all-or-nothing approach -- silence unless things got so bad that an insurrection was necessary. The new rules encourage shareholders to make their views known to each other and encourage corporations to seek out those views. **********The timing of the S.E.C.'s ruling could not be better. In the past two years, institutions and corporations have moved toward informal communications to air and resolve concerns. These communications can now move forward and mature without the lurking threat that they violate proxy rules. A shareholder believing that the corporation needs a new director on the board, for example, can submit a name to the nominating committee and then call other shareholders and urge them to write, seconding his nominee. A corporation can solicit suggestions and comments on potential nominees for director from major investors. The corporation can also seek feedback on corporate policy without violating proxy rules. **********Under the old rules it was difficult for shareholders to gain representation on a corporate board.  The old rules stated that an outside \"dissident\" shareholder could seek votes only for his own nominees. Suppose, for example, that a dissatisfied shareholder wished to elect one new director to a 12-person board. Under the old rules, the shareholder had to circulate a proxy card with only one name on it and could cast votes only for that director at a shareholders' meeting. **********THIS created a dilemma for shareholders. If they voted for that nominee, they threw away their votes for the other 11 board seats. Their only recourse was to also return a proxy card separately to management voting for some of management's nominees. Not only was this complex and confusing, but, because of a kind of electoral double-counting that can occur when shareholders return both proxy cards, the dissident could receive 90 percent of the votes for his single director candidate and still lose the election. **********The new rules involve a simple change. Shareholders may now cast their proxy votes not only for their own nominees, but for management nominees as well. This seemingly trivial alteration allows a shareholder to offer a full slate of directors -- his own, plus all of management's nominees except those he believes least qualified. Shareholders can simply vote one proxy card. This rationalizes voting and also solves the double-counting problem: a shareholder receiving 90 percent of votes for his candidate wins, period. **********The S.E.C.'s new proposals thus facilitate two moderate alternatives to the two extremes that used to dominate in corporate governance -- doing nothing or taking over the company. They will encourage investors and corporations to develop a serious, substantive, less confrontational approach to oversight."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/25/business/sun-microsystems-suit-role.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 282, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sun Microsystems' Suit Role", "print_headline": "Sun Microsystems' Suit Role", "body_text": " **********Sun Microsystems Inc., the leader in the $15.3 billion market for computer work stations, acknowledged today that it had provided loan guarantees to a software company that brought an antitrust suit against the Open Software Foundation, a computer industry research organization. **********Sun said it had provided financing to the Addamax Corporation, one of its vendors, to sue the software foundation. **********Last night, Open Software, based in Cambridge, Mass., accused Sun of trying to sabotage its operations.

Economists say lower rates in Germany are essential to improving Europe's economic prospects. **********But analysts said investors also seemed unnerved by the lack of any coordinated economic policy in Europe after the currency crisis of last month. And they said the markets were likely to remain volatile at least until Friday, when the heads of the 12 European Community nations meet in Birmingham, England, to plot their strategy for putting the unification process back on track. Grimness and Uncertainty **********\"All in all the markets are looking at grim prospects and very high levels of uncertainty,\" said Giorgio Radaelli, an international economist at Lehman Brothers International in London. **********In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares fell 103.4 points, or 4.1 percent, to 2,446.3. In Paris, the CAC-40 index fell 72.3 points, or 4.3 percent, to 1,611.04. In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index closed at 1,424.4, down 53.64 points, or 3.6 percent. **********In the currency markets, the pound fell sharply against the German mark, which continues to grow stronger because of the Bundesbank's decision to keep interest rates high. After trading as low as 2.369 marks, an all-time low, the pound rebounded somewhat later in the day, and closed in Europe at 2.391 marks. The pound has lost nearly 20 percent of its value since Britain pulled out of the European system of fixed exchange rates last month. Some Action by Spain **********Spain, which was forced to devalue the peseta during last month's turmoil, said today that it was removing some of the capital controls it had imposed in an effort to stop speculative selling of the currency. But the Spanish Government pointedly did not raise interest rates to defend the currency as it edged down in value today, and analysts said it was increasingly possible that Spain would be forced to accept another devaluation of the peseta within the Exchange Rate Mechanism. **********The Italian lira also slid in value, but the French franc, which weathered intense selling pressure over the last several weeks with help from the Bundesbank, held fairly steady. **********\"To take the volatility out of the markets, you're going to have to have confirmation from the Bundesbank that they're cutting interest rates,\" said Richard M. Young, the director of European investment strategy for Merrill Lynch in London. Mr. Young said he did not expect that to happen before the end of the year. **********In Germany, the stock market has been depressed by a weakening domestic economy, by the negative effect of a strong mark on German exporters and by the Bundesbank's continued desire to choke off inflation even at the expense of economic growth. **********With German rates remaining high, France has been forced to keep its interest rates up, creating considerable unease about the economy and a weeks-long selloff in stocks. **********In Britain, investors are feeling the full effects of the nation's decision to withdraw from the European monetary system. Freed from the need to keep the pound stable against the mark, Britain cut its benchmark lending rate by one point last month, to 9 percent. But the lower rates have caused investors to sell pounds and buy higher-yielding currencies like the mark, precipitating the almost-unchecked plunge in sterling's value. **********Now the pound has sunk so low that the cost of imports will rise significantly, creating the danger of higher inflation. So politicians are talking openly about the possibility that Prime Minister John Major and Norman Lamont, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, might have to raise rates this week to stop the erosion of the pound, dealing a blow to growth prospects for the feeble British economy and to the political prospects for their governing Conservative Party. **********Mr. Lamont is scheduled to lay out the Government's new economic policy in a speech to the annual Conservative Party conference later in the week."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/14/business/patents-faster-operation-for-imaging-gear.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1992-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 246, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; Faster Operation For Imaging Gear", "print_headline": "Patents; Faster Operation For Imaging Gear", "body_text": " **********A researcher at the Essex Corporation, a small company in Columbia, Md., that provides systems engineering services to the Federal Government, has invented what company officials say is a light-based computing technology that allows medical imaging equipment and advanced radar to construct images far more rapidly and cheaply than is now possible. **********At the moment, for example, computer-aided tomography systems create detailed images of the inside of a person's body by beaming millions of X-rays through the patient and then measuring the intensity of X-rays as they reach detectors on the other side of the body.

Singer, has been accused by a junk-bond mutual fund analyst of joining in a scheme to profit from tips about the fund's trading plans. The other co-chairman, Bruce D. Sturman, has sued Mr. Singer and his fellow directors, who include three Singer family members, claiming they failed to cooperate with authorities investigating those charges. A former director is waging a proxy battle to oust the entire board. But at a stormy meeting last Thursday, the company's board did little more than grant Mr. Singer a leave, suspend Mr. Sturman as co-chairman and hire a law firm to investigate both of them. **********Somewhere inside this publicly traded potboiler is a business: the sale of contact lenses, eye-care products, and surgical devices. But it is nearly eclipsed in Cooper's annual reports by details about pending lawsuits and past settlements. Meanwhile, the company's stock, which traded around $30 a share in 1986, has tumbled to barely $3 a share -- with months of scandal still ahead. **********Besides putting a spotlight on Cooper, this case exposes the flaws in two cherished Wall Street myths. The first is that the only crooks in the junk bond market were those linked to Michael Milken, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert executive now jailed for securities law violations. The myth is that there are no crooks in the mutual fund industry. **********Mr. Singer, who has denied any wrongdoing, is taking a leave of absence from the chairmanship, although he and Mr. Sturman remain on the board as directors. The leave, a company statement noted, will allow Mr. Singer \"to respond to the allegations concerning transactions in the company's high-yield bond portfolio.\" **********Those allegations were raised in a Federal information, similar to an indictment, which accused two men, G. Albert Griggs and John D. Collins 2d, of joining wth an unidentified Cooper executive in an illegal kickback scheme. In Manhattan's Federal District Court on May 21, the two men pleaded guilty to securities law violations. Mr. Griggs, a former analyst and assistant fund manager for the Keystone Group in Boston, identified Mr. Singer as the executive involved. **********The scheme outlined by Mr. Griggs was simple: He said he told the Cooper executive in advance which bonds he was recommending, and the executive bought them and then sold them to the Keystone funds at inflated prices. About $700,000 of the resulting profits, estimated at $3 million, were funneled back to Mr. Griggs and Mr. Collins as \"consulting fees\" paid to a sham investment firm set up by Mr. Collins. **********A related complaint filed against the two men by the Securities and Exchange Commission charges that those who profited from the scheme included Cooper itself and unidentified relatives of the Cooper officer. **********The Keystone group had no knowledge of Mr. Griggs's activities, executives there said, and the group will seek to recover any money owed to shareholders. And the Federal investigation is continuing, under the direction of Scott A. Edelman and Denis J. McInerney in the United States Attorney's Office in New York. But the documents already available should be required reading in the junk market and the mutual fund industry. **********Mr. Griggs met the Cooper executive in the fall of 1990 in the normal course of business, since Cooper itself has issued junk bonds. By March 1991, according to the S.E.C. complaint, they had hatched the kickback scheme. As the profits grew, Mr. Collins was brought in to set up the phony firm as an intermediary. Fear of detection did not seem to loom large in the men's minds. They actually negotiated a plan under which Mr. Collins would gradually increase his stake in the profits over the years. **********Mr. Griggs also confessed to another transgression unrelated to the Cooper scheme. Between April 1990 and January 1991, he provided \"trading opportunities\" to an unidentified brokerage salesman, in exchange for a $35,000 slice of the salesman's commissions. In April 1991, the S.E.C. charged, Mr. Griggs steered fund purchases through another unidentified broker, then asked the broker to buy him about $10,000 worth of computer equipment. **********This largess, mind you, was available to a mere assistant at one mid-sized fund group. And it continued for a long time, undetected by the anti-fraud tripwires in which the mutual fund industry places such trust. **********As for Cooper, feuds and litigation have been commonplace at least since the 1988 coup in which Mr. Singer and Mr. Sturman joined forces to take control. The Griggs case threatens to turn that squabble into full-scale warfare. Even before the Griggs case surfaced, the current board was facing a proxy battle led by a former director, Frederick R. Adler. The fight will culminate at a shareholder meeting that, after two delays, has been scheduled for July 28. **********Meanwhile, the company disclosed on Friday that it would continue to provide \"documents and employee testimony\" to regulators and prosecutors and has hired a law firm to conduct \"a wide-ranging, full-scale investigation\" of the mess. To be sure, the law firm will report to a board that includes three Singer relatives and two of the Cooper executives on whose watch the questionable trading allegedly occurred. But \"anyone connected with the investigation will abstain,\" a company spokesman said. **********The lessons emerging from this case are clear. Those who think there is nothing to fear in the junk bond market now that Mr. Milken is locked up should think again. And mutual fund executives who habitually boast about the industry's \"squeaky clean\" image should consider the abundant opportunities exploited by Mr. Griggs. Indeed, as this case shows, the only thing that has grown as fast as the industry's assets is its temptations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/25/business/old-weapons-are-plants-new-work.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1992-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1682, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Old Weapons Are Plants' New Work", "print_headline": "Old Weapons Are Plants' New Work", "body_text": " **********The steel hulls of 12 big Chinook cargo helicopters on the assembly line of the Boeing Company's helicopter factory here have been sanded and burnished so that the silvery metal looks new. But small numbers stenciled in black on the hulls tell a different story. \"O22,\" one says, documenting that this was the 22d Chinook ever built, in 1961. None of the hulls is less than 15 years old. **********Like so many military contractors, Boeing Helicopter is increasingly en gaged in the rebuilding and upgrading of old weapons instead of building more expensive new ones. The conversion of old weapons into more modern versions -- rather than simply overhauling them periodically as the Air Force does with the B-52 bomber -- now appears to account for more than half the military hardware manufactured in America, and the percentage keeps growing. **********But as the numbers grow, so do the questions about whether the economics of such an approach make sense. With military budgets shrinking, rebuilding a Chinook so that it can carry more cargo, or an M-1 Abrams tank so that it is a more deadly weapon, is good business for weapons contractors, especially if it is a question of selling 20 improved weapons rather than only 6 new ones. Improvements Are Costly **********The improved weapons, however, sometimes end up costing the Pentagon almost as much as a new weapons system. And while the practice saves money in the short run, weapons experts say it could bring on a crisis in a decade or so when Chinook and Abrams tank hulls -- and the hulls of many other rebuilt weapons -- are too old for yet another upgrade. **********\"You get in the bind where the oldest model costs so much to run and maintain that you have no money to buy a new system,\" said Maj. Peter Keating, an Army spokesman. **********Congress would then have to choose between raising military spending to purchase new weapons or letting the weapons inventory shrink as worn-out weaponry is scrapped. Neither the Bush Administration nor President-elect Bill Clinton has addressed these issues. **********\"But right now, we have a lot of existing platforms with years of life in them, so we are looking for upgrades, and that trend will continue,\" said Robert Hall, a Defense Department spokesman. **********The pressure to rebuild weapons has intensified because the cost of new weapons has kept rising. The Pentagon, in effect, covers a weapons maker's costs, negotiating ever-higher amounts to be covered, and then adds a profit on top -- as it has for more than two decades. As a result, the Pentagon has increasingly chosen to rebuild, say, 30 existing weapons rather than purchase 15 more expensive new ones. **********The practice has gathered steam since 1987, when spending on weapons procurement began to shrink, after reaching a record $100 billion. Adjusted for inflation, the annual outlay today is about $80 billion. **********For Boeing Helicopter, as for many other weapons makers, upgrading weapons has kept factories open. At Boeing's complex along the Delaware River, with its huge gray and blue buildings, upgrading the twin-rotor Chinooks keeps more than 4,000 workers employed. A brand new Model D comes off the assembly line only rarely, and usually for a foreign customer. Most of the four Model D's completed here each month are overhauled Chinooks, which first carried soldiers and supplies into battle in Vietnam. **********Since the late 1980's, Boeing has been working on a contract that is costing the Pentagon more than $5 billion to rebuild 538 older Chinooks into the Model D. The Chinooks are flown here intact. Their rotors and engines are removed. The wiring, cockpit paneling and electronics gear are gutted. The paint is sanded off the hulls. The Model D's can carry more weight a longer distance. Looking to Foreign Sales **********The last copter in this process is to be returned to the Army by mid-1995, and after that the hope is to sustain the production line with foreign sales. \"We have people girdling the globe, trying to sell new Chinooks,\" said Stuart D. Dodge, director of Boeing's tandem rotor helicopter programs. **********Anticipating that foreign sales will not be enough to keep the factory open, Boeing is now arguing that the Persian Gulf war demonstrated the need for another upgrade: Model D's should be rebuilt into the more powerful Model F, still in the design stage. **********In a carpeted conference room at the headquarters building here -- a room with huge backlighted photo transparencies on every wall that show Boeing helicopters in action -- Mr. Dodge offers to a reporter the Model F sales pitch that he gives regularly now to people at the Pentagon and members of Congress. **********The Model D, Mr. Dodge explained, was everywhere in Saudi Arabia and Iraq during the Persian Gulf crisis, carrying troops, drums of fuel, artillery and the injured. But fully loaded, the Model D's two engines and fuel capacity could travel only 100 miles without refueling -- half the range of the proposed Model F. **********\"On the first day of the ground fighting, that 100 miles took troops and supplies only halfway to Baghdad on the Euphrates from the Saudi border,\" Mr. Dodge said. \"The Model F could have gone all the way to the Euphrates nonstop.\" And Mr. Dodge suggested that the Model F might have gotten American troops to Baghdad quickly enough to surprise Saddam Hussein and capture him.  The Persian Gulf experience is frequently invoked to justify the expense of upgrading old weaponry in the post-cold-war period. The deployment of American troops in Somalia is the latest such experience. **********But rebuilding older weapons rather than buying new ones raises issues that have not been adequately debated in Congress or by the public, according to Representative Andy Ireland of Florida, the ranking Republican on the House subcommittees for military procurement and for investigations of weapons contracts. **********\"If the threat is no worse than Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard, do you really need to spend so much on upgrading weaponry?\" Mr. Ireland asked. \"I know in my gut that upgrading weapons is a growing trend, although still not fully measured. Accountability is necessary to head off overcharging, which is just as likely with an upgrade as with a new B-1 bomber. Most important, is this an overlooked area for cutbacks in defense spending?\" **********One issue is whether companies like Boeing are rebuilding too much -- replacing too many parts -- and overcharging in the process. The rebuilding of Chinooks into Model D's, for instance, costs the Pentagon $11 million a copter, compared with $15 million to $17 million for a new Model D. In the early 1980's, when the Pentagon first began to convert earlier versions into the Model D, the cost per copter was $7 million. **********In addition, the profit that Boeing earns from building a new Chinook or rebuilding an old one is roughly the same, says B. Dan Pinick, president of Boeing's Defense and Space Group. \"The skills and capabilities that go into rebuilding a helicopter from the bare shell involve the same skills and capabilities that are necessary to build a new plane,\" Mr. Pinick said. **********The source of much of the increase in costs since 1980 appears to be the new electronics systems and computers wired into the stripped-down Chinooks on the line here, or into the F-14 fighter planes that the Grumman Corporation is upgrading at its Calverton plant on Long Island, or into the older Abrams tanks that General Dynamics wants to rebuild at its Lima, Ohio, plant into the M1-A2 model. Among other upgrades, the M1-A2's have a new digital electronics system capable of detailed communication with other battle units. **********In any modern weapon, the electronics gear is the costliest element and the source of the highest profit, said Peter Oram, president of Grumman Aircraft Systems. \"You don't replace landing gears or wings or fuselage, and this air frame is maybe $500 a pound for aluminum and steel,\" Mr. Oram said. \"But electronics go for $2,500 a pound installed, and if you are replacing 3,000 pounds of electronics, that is expensive.\" **********The 18 stripped-down F-14's that Grumman has been upgrading at Calverton with new radar, new engines, new electronics and new missile-firing ability are costing the Pentagon $37 million a plane, compared with a $50.8 million price tag for an F-14, newly built. **********\"They don't have to do so much; they are making work,\" said Seymour Melman, a retired Columbia University engineering professor and a weapons industry expert. Overhauls Without Upgrading **********Alternatively, these 10-year-old aircraft could remain in operation without becoming more powerful weapons, their lives extended through periodic overhauls at Air Force depots every year or two, at a cost of only $1 million to $2 million for each overhaul, Grumman officials say. **********The Army faces a similar alternative for Abrams tanks. The new M1-A2 outperformed earlier models in the Persian Gulf crisis, with its more powerful cannon, its new electronics and a turret that offered the crew protection against chemical warfare. Until the Berlin wall came down in 1989, ending the rivalry with the former Soviet Union, General Dynamics had sought a contract to build 3,000 new M1-A2's. **********But the company has switched strategies, bidding instead to upgrade 1,000 older tanks for $3.1 billion, compared with $4.6 million for a new M1-A2. A contract has not been signed, but the Army has endorsed the General Dynamics bid. It is seeking Defense Department approval to upgrade the first 260 tanks over the next five years, guaranteeing in the process the survival, until at least 1997, of the Lima plant, the nation's only tank assembly factory. **********\"You want to send soldiers into the field with the best equipment, even if it is an overmatch for the enemy,\" said Major Keating, the Army spokesman. \"You want to have the best tanks up front.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/21/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-campaigns-for-poultry.html": {"writer_name": "Adam Bryant", "pub_date": "1992-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Campaigns For Poultry", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Campaigns For Poultry", "body_text": " **********Two poultry companies are introducing campaigns focusing on nutrition and ease of preparation. **********Tyson Foods is introducing a print campaign for its frozen breaded boneless Holly Farms chicken products.

It is unclear how the allies would respond to such moves. **********Word of the Iraqi movements came on the eve of the Bush Administration's expected announcement of the establishment of the air exclusion zone. Under the operation, Iraq would be notified 24 hours before the zone is established. After then, any Iraqi planes that fly south of the 32d parallel would be fair game for allied fighters. The zone is to be policed by American, British and French planes. Saudis Won't Take Part **********Saudi fighters will not fly over Iraq, a senior Administration official said. **********The formal demand that Iraq stop flying in the area is expected to be delivered to the Iraqi Mission at the United Nations, and to be reiterated by British, French and Russian officials **********Describing the positioning of Iraqi aircraft, a Pentagon spokesman, Bob Hall, said: **********\"There has been considerable Iraqi military activity in the south, in the sense that all of their fixed-wing aircraft appear to have left the area below the 32d parallel, 32d degree, north latitude. And a number of their helicopters have also been withdrawn from southern Iraq and flown north of the 32d parallel. They still have some helicopters in the south and continue to fly missions.\" **********An American official, who asked not to be further identified, provided additional details. He said that about a dozen jets and a dozen propeller-driven planes in the south had been moved north.  Other Iraqi Precautions **********State Department officials also confirmed that Iraq has repositioned its aircraft. A department spokesman, Joseph Snyder, said that \"essentially all Iraqi fixed-wing aircraft\" had been moved north of the zone, but that there was \"some helicopter activity\" over it. **********In addition to moving aircraft, Iraq has taken other military precautions. It has dispersed some tanks and equipment to make them less vulnerable to air attack, a step carried out before the confrontation last month over access for United Nations inspectors to the Agriculture Ministry in Baghdad. **********The Bush Administration, in deciding to set up an air shield over southern Iraq, is reversing its decision just after the gulf war not to come to the aid of the Shiite Muslims. At that time, Shiite leaders appealed for American help in shooting down helicopters, but the Administration viewed such intervention as capable of drawing American troops into a quagmire and did not try to stop Saddam Hussein's forces from suppressing the rebellion. Bush Before the Legion **********Mr. Bush, speaking to the American Legion in Chicago today, made no mention of that earlier decision to deny protection to the Shiites. And he defended his decision to end the ground offensive in Iraq after 100 hours, which enabled some elite troops, from the Iraqi Republican Guard, to escape. **********The President asserted today that the action had been taken on the recommendations of Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of allied forces in the gulf war; Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. **********Some of the Iraqi forces that escaped during the ground war played an important role in suppressing the Shiite rebellion in the south, according to American intelligence reports."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/business/credit-markets-wells-fargo-notes-will-yield-8.81.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 78, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wells Fargo Notes Will Yield 8.81%", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Wells Fargo Notes Will Yield 8.81%", "body_text": " **********Wells Fargo & Company, a bank holding company, is offering to the public $200 million in 10-year notes through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********The notes have an 8 3/4 percent coupon and are priced at 99.603 to yield 8.81 percent, or about 125 basis points more than the Treasury 10-year note, according to the underwriter. **********Noncallable by the company, the notes are rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/29/world/after-8-months-first-relief-reaches-one-bosnian-town.html": {"writer_name": "Chuck Sudetic", "pub_date": "1992-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 423, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "After 8 Months, First Relief Reaches One Bosnian Town", "print_headline": "After 8 Months, First Relief Reaches One Bosnian Town", "body_text": " **********Thousands of Muslims lined the roads into the Bosnian town of Srebrenica today to greet the first United Nations aid convoy to reach them since the beginning of the eight-month war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********For three days Serbs from villages around the nearby town of Bratunac had held up the 17-truck convoy carrying 40 tons of food, blankets and other supplies to Srebrenica just as they had blocked every other aid convoy to the area since the war began in April. **********The Serbs allowed the convoy to pass today after long negotiations in Sarajevo and after United Nations officials threatened to halt aid deliveries to hard-pressed Serbian areas of the country unless the way to Srebrenica was opened. **********The convoy was escorted by Belgian troops attached to the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Yucca was picked by Congress as the leading candidate, but Nevada has blocked most testing. **********The Florida Public Service Commission is demanding that by the end of this year the Energy Department agree unconditionally to begin accepting the waste in 1998 or pay the utilities' extra costs for continuing to store it. **********The demand by the Florida commission, in a letter dated Oct. 15, represents a salvo in an unusual battle between state regulators and the Energy Department. Thirty years after the beginning of the civilian nuclear-power industry, there continues to be little progress in finding a national dump site, and the growing inventory of nuclear waste in temporary storage is creating an industry crisis. **********Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, all civilian reactor operators signed contracts with the Energy Department under which the Government is supposed to begin accepting the wastes in 1998. The schedule for opening a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain, however, has slipped until 2010, and may be delayed further. **********To the fury of the regulators, the Energy Department maintains that if it has not found a permanent or temporary location for the waste by 1998, it is not obligated to accept shipments until a site has been found. **********The Florida letter to the Energy Secretary, James D. Watkins, threatens unspecified steps to protect the interests of ratepayers. A commission staff member said the measures might include suing the Energy Department or ordering that utilities in Florida make their payments to an escrow fund instead of to Washington.

While some state regulators fear that the money will be frittered away by an ineffective bureaucracy in Washington, others say there may be a reluctance by Washington to spend the money, since the surplus makes the Federal budget deficit look smaller. **********The delays are beginning to take their toll. Earlier this month the owners of a recently retired reactor in Rowe, Mass., said that the slow rate at which the Energy Department was proposing to accept its spent fuel could add millions of dollars to the costs of decommissioning the plant, a problem that is likely to be repeated around the country. **********In Minnesota, regulators have taken the unusual step of telling the Northern States Power Company to report back regularly on what steps the utility has taken to insure that the Energy Department will meet its commitments. Minnesota regulators are also considering what action they could take to prod the Energy Department into accepting wastes. **********James T.

The order, intended to cover students and others who might be at risk if they returned, allows Chinese in the United States on that date to remain through 1993. **********\"Up to 80,000 illegal immigrants could benefit from this,\" Mr. Nicholl said. \"One of the first things many of them do when they arrive is pick up phony documents, saying they were here before June 5, 1989, the date of the Presidential order.\" Pickup Off Chinese Coast **********American officials said they began tracking the ship that dropped 151 Chinese men off in Haiti soon after it entered the Taiwan Straits off the coast of China's Fujian Province, where the men were apparently picked up. **********\"It was a Taiwanese trawler, 100 to 150 feet long,\" Mr. Nicholl said. \"It was a oceangoing ship, but not for these human conditions.\" Haitians fleeing their island homeland for the United States sometimes cram the same number of people onto a boat half that size, but the voyage they face is often very brief because Coast Guard cutters patrol the area off Haiti, 600 miles from Florida. **********The Taiwanese trawler sailed into the Indian Ocean instead of across the Pacific, and headed for Mauritius, where the crew tried unsuccessfully to buy food and water for their human cargo, Mr. Nicholl said. He said the Mauritius Government planned to take the Chinese into custody and send them home, but the ship sailed away. **********The trawler stopped next in Cape Town, and again tried to take on supplies. It then crossed the South Atlantic to Brazil, where, Mr. Nicholl said, it was provisioned just north of Rio de Janeiro. At that point, he added, it was also refueled at sea by a tanker apparently leased by the smuggling gang -- an indication that the group had a significant amount of money to spend. **********From Rio, the trawler apparently made its way to the Haitian coast. By then the 151 Chinese had been at sea in cramped conditions for between 35 and 40 days, Mr. Nicholl said.

Macomber, is president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The Federal agency, known as the Ex-Im Bank, provides loans, loan guarantees and insurance for exporters. Mr. Macomber was the chairman and chief executive of the Celanese Corporation until Hoechst A.G. bought it in 1987. **********On Wednesday, bank officials told the FCIA Management Company in New York, which administers the bank's export insurance program, that its contract was being canceled effective Sept. 14. **********The Ex-Im Bank will administer the program itself in Washington. Almost all of the 125 program employees except foreign citizens are being offered jobs here, although it is not clear how many are willing to move to Washington from New York and to accept the generally lower salaries paid by the Federal Government. **********Mr. Macomber said he acted after becoming aware of several potential conflicts of interest in the FCIA contract. The most serious was that FCIA had the opportunity to use its access to confidential Government information to aid it in selling the private export insurance offered by its parent, the Cincinnati-based Great American Insurance Company. **********Peter L. Aitken, FCIA's vice president for marketing, said that no information had been misused. **********Since Mr. Macomber took office in 1989, the bank has expanded rapidly, financing $12.06 billion worth of exports during the 1991 fiscal year, compared with $6.36 billion in fiscal 1989. In an effort to bring Government financial practices up to private-sector standards, Mr. Macomber has also set up the bank's first audit committee and loan-loss reserves. **********After a spate of losses in the mid-80's, Mr. Macomber tightened the bank's lending and insurance practices. Not one of the loans or insurance policies issued by the Ex-Im Bank during Mr. Macomber's tenure has gone bad. **********Mr. Macomber, who is 64 years old, is a longtime friend of President Bush and comes from a similar background.

And the hottest artist in town, a mysterious woman from the provinces known simply as Renata, wearing 1950's pink sunglasses and a blue pants suit trimmed with safety pins, showed off her ceramics to adoring clients. **********The event at the Brazilian Center was just one of several art happenings in this art-crazed city. Days earlier, a sculptor and critic, Eugenio Lemas, unveiled his 12-foot Calder-like outdoor iron sculpture whose spherical pieces, three years in the making, appeared to float on the grass. **********For a change of tempo, there was an exhibition of photographs of Makonde sculpture, the tribal art whose spirit animates much of Mozambique's modern art. 'In the Avant-Garde' **********\"I am not being chauvinistic, but Mozambique is in the avant-garde -- certainly in the southern African zone and probably elsewhere in Africa,\" said Malangatana Valente Ngwenya, a 56-year-old painter who is regarded as the father and nurturer of the vibrant contemporary art scene here. **********\"I know when I go to Tanzania, you don't find the boiling point that you do among the young artists of Mozambique,\" he said. \"I passed by a cultural center yesterday where there will be a show of young artists. These young artists can pull you, can make you think twice about how to start a new painting.\" **********Theories abound about why in a country where a 16-year-old war has ruined the economy and killed a million people there is so much new art and such a fraternity of artists who meet and talk and exchange ideas. **********\"Every day, I have hundreds of people asking if they can use the center to show their art,\" Luiza Helena Bennett, the director of the Brazilian Center, said. \"It's incredible, very impressive.\" **********The show that opened the other night juxtaposes fresh works of Mr. Ngwenya with those of younger painters as well as pieces from overseas. **********Mr. Ngwenya -- known as Malangatana in art circles here and in Portugal, where his works are prized -- said there were probably two explanations, internal and external, for the abundance of art. He remembers growing up in a village in southern Mozambique where there was plenty of creativity. **********\"Aside from making useful things like gourds, people carved things for witch doctors, and there were very strong, impulsive dances,\" he said. \"And there was poetry.\" **********Just as important as this innate imagination, Mr. Ngwenya argues, was the exterior influence of Portuguese colonialism and what he calls its double-edged character. **********\"The colonial situation helped stimulate art,\" he said as he showed a visitor around his rambling house, where he is in the midst of building a cultural archive for Mozambican painting, sculpture and anthropological treasures. \"Until 1975 when the Portuguese left, you didn't find any black doctors, or architects, or any blacks with academic credentials. This racism helped a lot to make people express themselves.\" **********The repression was so pervasive, Mr. Ngwenya said, that after 9 P.M. Mozambicans were not allowed to walk on the street in Maputo. If they did, they faced a long prison sentence or being sent to the Portuguese island colony of Sao Tome. Both 'Sweet and Sour' **********\"But also there was a kind of non-racism, because there were some restaurants where blacks and whites could go,\" he said. \"You could be drinking with a Portuguese but at the same time you could be swept off the streets. The relationship was sweet and sour.\" **********Taken under the wing of a Portuguese modernist architect, Mr. Ngwenya had access to paints and canvas. With these he created works in the 1960's and 70's, often in brilliant oranges and reds, suggesting the torment the Mozambicans suffered under the Portuguese. **********After independence, he supported the new Government but tried, he said, to send signals through his art that as the country slid into economic chaos and war, all was not well. \"I'm a social painter, but not in a pamphleteering way,\" he said. **********The new wave of young Mozambican artists show little concern with post-independence traumas, or even the civil war, but rather concentrate on modern renditions of traditional spiritual life. The works of 24-year-old Idasse, whose pieces in charcoal on paper were shown alongside Mr. Ngwenya's in Europe last year, evoke African mythologies of birds, animals, women. Traditional Stories Used **********At the School of Visual Arts, one of the teachers, Ulisses Gomez Oviedo, said his students' works often hark back to traditional stories passed down from generation to generation. **********\"Ask them to describe their art, and they will tell stories of witch doctors, of old customs,\" Mr. Oviedo said. \"They listen from the family, the grandfather. The art is very strong.\" **********Alongside the flourishing production of art, a support system insures that word of what is new gets around. **********A critic's circle writes in the Sunday newspaper, and the one television station often shows documentaries on artists. A video to appear on television of the opening at the Brazilian Center shows Renata stretched out on the floor dancing rhythmic movements to the thump of music and the excitement of the first-night crowd, emphasizing perhaps the multi-media dimensions of new Mozambican art."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/10/business/company-news-pirelli-replaces-division-head.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 137, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pirelli Replaces Division Head", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Pirelli Replaces Division Head", "body_text": " **********Pirelli S.p.A., the Italian tire and cable manufacturer, announced a series of management changes in its Dutch tire division, Pirelli Tire Holding N.V. **********Luciano Mattioli will be replaced as chairman by Giuseppe Bencini, now the chairman of Montefibre, a synthetic fiber maker that is part of the state-owned energy and chemical holding company Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi. **********Mr. Mattioli will become deputy chairman for industrial activities.

Because of Everbright's prominence and influence, Mr. Wang fears that he does not stand a chance to win the case. **********If Mr. Wang turns over the money, a judge told him, he will get his passport back and be able to return home to California, where his family lives. There is no explicit Chinese law that allows judges to confiscate foreign passports, according to a foreign lawyer here, but the practice still occurs. **********A loan document indicates that Mr. Wang does indeed owe Everbright the money, but Mr. Wang said the loan was part of a complex and fraudulent scheme by an Everbright executive to get out of a contract. In reality, he said, he does not owe a penny. **********So far, there has been no trial, and a result is that Mr. Wang has been obliged to remain in Beijing. **********Everbright and Chinese officials declined to be interviewed. The United States Embassy here does not take a position on the underlying dispute, but it has protested to Chinese officials the confiscation of Mr. Wang's passport. The embassy says all parties should simply try to work out an agreement. **********Other foreigners have periodically had their passports confiscated when they became enmeshed in commercial disputes, but apparently in most cases the companies were willing to pay to get their employees out.

But he has moved from hotel to hotel -- one even kicked him out because he had no passport -- and finally took a small room, where he shares a bath and a kitchen. He goes to the telephone company once every two weeks to make an international call to his wife. **********In the case of Mr. Collins, the court ruled against him and he is appealing the decision.

In an attempt to squelch inflation, the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, raised its key lending rates in December to their highest levels since 1948. **********Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, has said repeatedly that inflationary pressures are so strong the central bank must keep a tight rein on monetary policy to keep the mark strong and promote long-term economic growth. 4.3% Annual Rate **********The preliminary inflation figures released today by the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden appear to reinforce that view.

Consumer prices rose six-tenths of a percent in February from January, when they were up four-tenths of a percent from the previous month. **********In February 1991, the cost of living was up three-tenths of a percent from January levels and up 2.7 percent on a year-to-year basis.

Never before have so many women been sent to Leinster House, where the Parliament is to convene on Dec. 14. The major political parties are to form a new coalition Government, and women now seem likely to be named to important ministerial posts. **********The Labor Party, having doubled its strength, is apparently in a position to dictate which of the two larger parties, Fianna Fail, or Fine Gael, will head the Government, with Labor as a powerful junior partner. **********The Labor Party, which had no women in the Parliament that was dissolved two weeks ago, elected five. One of them, Eithne FitzGerald, said: \"It is absolutely fantastic. Absolutely wonderful. It is the biggest breakthrough since 1918. With the other women, all strong women, we will revolutionize the parliamentary party.\" (The Irish elected to the British Parliament in 1918 eventually became the first independent Irish Parliament.)

In the referendum on Wednesday, voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have legalized limited abortion in the country, while approving constitutional rights to obtaining abortion information and traveling abroad for abortions. **********But for Frances Fitzgerald and the other women, abortion is only one of many issues they are expected to concentrate on to improve the lot of women, as Ms. Fitzgerald said, \"as a way of helping the whole country, including men.\" **********\"The jump to the Big 20 represents a huge psychological leap for women in one of the most male-dominated professions,\" wrote Mary Cummins, the women's affairs specialist for The Irish Times. **********Irishwomen have the highest birth rate in the European Community -- 2.5 children per woman -- although that rate is declining. And the 30 percent of married Irishwomen working outside the home is the lowest in the community. A Struggle Over Divorce **********In recent years, many women in this country of 3.5 million have been quietly disregarding some of the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, the religion of 95 percent of the population, especially where birth control and abortion are concerned, and are in the forefront of the growing movement to permit divorce, which does not exist here. **********Women in all parties point to the election of Mary Robinson as President in 1990 as the catalyst for the surge of women in politics. **********Mrs. Robinson, whose important symbolic but largely ceremonial position now precludes her talking out on political issues, was known as a liberal who fought against the 1983 constitutional ban on abortion, and has fought for equal pay for Irishwomen, who are still often paid far less than men for the same work. **********She was the Labor Party candidate, although she had quit the party several years before, and she drew to the party people who had shunned it as too far to the left. **********Analyzing Labor's election gains, Gerald Barry, the chief political reporter for The Sunday Tribune, wrote that the increase in women \"was one of the lessons learned during the Mary Robinson presidential campaign.\" **********\"It was not just that very many people liked the idea of a woman President, but that they wanted more women in public life,\" in a Parliament \"that would better represent the real make-up of society. Women and the poor are still hugely underrepresented, but a start is being made.\" **********Liz O'Donnell, a Dublin City Councilor and mother of two, won a seat for the Progressive Democrats.

The women answered politely, but several said later that they were dismayed at the sexism of the questions. **********On one national television interview program, Frances Fitzgerald lost her smile when asked such a question. She pointed out that she is a professional social worker, and that as head of the Council for the Status of Women, an umbrella group, she had dealt with many issues, including the economy and Northern Ireland. **********If her party, Fine Gael, takes the leadership of the new coalition Government, she will be a likely candidate for a minister's portfolio. **********In a recent interview, she discussed her priorities as a politician, relating women's problems to the economy, which is stagnant with an unemployment rate of 20 percent, double the European Community average. **********\"Child care is a metaphor for the range of changes I feel are needed,\" she said. \"The poverty that many women are living in makes them powerless against unemployment. Nothing disempowers like poverty, a still somewhat hidden poverty in Ireland. Many women today are deciding what food they can afford for their children's meals.

A ferrofluid, as the combination is known, can be held in place permanently with a magnetic field. This means these fluids can be used to help cool a loudspeaker, to seal in emissions from the rotating shaft of a pump or to replace ball bearings in a high-speed computer disk drive. **********In addition, ferrofluids can be moved by manipulating magnetic fields. This may permit physicians to direct medicines to certain parts of the body to treat localized problems like cancerous tumors. **********According to executives of Ferrofluidics Inc., a company based in Nashua, N.H., that has developed commercial applications for the technology, magnetic fluids are a spinoff of the nation's space program. **********For space scientists, the basic problem was that fluids in general are hard to control. The usual solution is to pump them up high and let gravity pull them into systems of pipes and valves. But scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration feared liquid-fueled rockets might be balky to operate in the weightlessness of space. **********The proposed solution was to create an artificial gravity by making the fuels magnetic and pulling them into rocket motors using magnetic fields. As it turned out, rockets using solid fuel eventually provided the answer to the problem, but by then the technology had been developed. **********A ferrofluid consists of three components, according to Alvan F. Chorney, a senior vice president of Ferrofluidics. **********The first is magnetic iron oxide ground into a powder so fine that each piece is one-thousandth the diameter of a human hair. The powder is coated with a surface conditioner that prevents the particles from clinging together. Then the particles are added to fluid, which Mr. Chorney said might be water or one of a variety of hydrocarbons, depending on the application. **********Because of the surface treatment and their minute size, the particles remain in a suspension and the entire liquid responds to magnetic force. Ordinarily, a sample of the material lies in a flat puddle on the side of a test tube, but when it is placed near a magnet, the material rises up into a spiky, lines-of-force alignment. **********One early application of ferrofluids was in helping to cool loudspeakers. Electric energy sent to a speaker is converted into sound and heat. If more power is fed into a speaker than it was designed for, the speaker becomes overly hot, distorting the sound. **********Since ferrofluids can have a heat conductivity four times a great as air, they can be used to cool the electric coil that produces the sound. And since the coil operates within a field produced by a permanent magnet, the fluid stays in place, regardless of the movements of the speaker. **********Another area in which ferrofluids have found a use is the semiconductor fabrication industry. Chips are manufactured in vacuum chambers at high temperatures. Rotating shafts entering the chambers need to be tightly sealed to preserve the vacuum and to prevent the entry of contaminants. **********Mechanical seals are available, but since they must be squeezed tightly against the shaft to be effective, they produce friction and drag. **********By putting magnetic fluid into grooves on a shaft and holding it in place with a magnetic field, however, Ferrofluidics has developed what it terms \"liquid O rings\" that provide a tight seal while eliminating most of the friction. **********Because the sealing agent is a liquid, rather than a solid, it can comply more closely to imperfections in the shaft. And it does not wear in a conventional sense. Mr. Chorney says some seals have been operating in the semiconductor industry for as long as 10 years without replacement. **********\"You create a magnetic circuit with a permanent magnet and then bathe the shaft with the liquid for a perfect seal,\" he said. \"There are no mechanical parts to wear out.\" **********Since heat can cause the carrier fluid to evaporate or break down, ruining the seal, Ferrofluidics has developed cooling systems for high-temperature applications. Typically, a mechanical bearing is used for physical strength, with the fluid seal placed nearby to block contaminants. **********Ferrofluids are produced in small quantities at widely varying prices, company officials said. Prices range from $1 per cubic centimeter for loudspeaker applications to as much as $300 per cubic centimeter for highly specialized uses. A cubic centimeter is one-hundredth of a liter, which is about one-quarter of a gallon. **********The magnetic fluid technology differs from the magnetic bearings that have been developed elsewhere to reduce friction. Magnetic bearings balance multiple magnetic forces on a shaft so that it spins in the air, untouched by mechanical objects. But balancing the forces to keep the bearing flying requires constant adjustment, which in practice means computer controls. No such controls are needed by the permanent magnets that control the fluid seals. **********Ferrofluidics has also developed a liquid version of the air bearing. The shaft, which is shaped like an impeller in the bearing area, pumps up the pressure of the magnetic fluid, which is held in place by fluid seals at both ends. The shaft spins within a cylinder of pressurized fluid, without mechanical contact. One application has been in high-speed computer disk drives, where contamination from ball bearings can cause the data-reading heads to crash into disks. **********The revised Clean Air Act, which is expected to force manufacturers to clamp down on emissions from operating equipment in addition to those from smokestacks, is seen by Ferrofluidics executives as an important market opportunity. They have developed a liquid seal designed to be mounted outside existing conventional seals on pumps at chemical plants and petroleum refineries to contain emissions of volatile hydrocarbons, which contribute to smog. **********Pumps at chemical plants and refineries run 24 hours a day, moving products and byproducts through the processing system. They are suspected as the source of many of the so-called \"fugitive emissions\" the new law is intended to control. The new seal is designed to be added to existing equipment without extensive alterations. **********Mr. Chorney said early field testing showed the seal was capable of reducing hydrocarbon emissions to as low as one part per million, well below the 100 to 1,000 parts per million released by conventional seals. He said the refinery pump seal was derived from the work on vacuum chambers. \"One part per million is not hard after you have been trying to keep molecules out of a vacuum,\" he said. **********Biomedical applications are an opportunity for the future, he said. The ability to attach medicines to magnetic particles means they could be directed to the desired parts of the body and concentrated there through the use of magnetic fields. Researchers are looking closely, Mr. Chorney said, at potential use with cancer-fighting drugs, which often have unpleasant side effects. If they could be concentrated where needed, perhaps some of the side effects could be minimized."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/15/world/sibiu-journal-romania-s-monuments-make-strange-bedfellows.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1992-12-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 862, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sibiu Journal; Romania's Monuments Make Strange Bedfellows", "print_headline": "Sibiu Journal; Romania's Monuments Make Strange Bedfellows", "body_text": " **********Like mushrooms in the surrounding forests, monuments to those who were killed in the anti-Communist revolution of December 1989 have sprung up all over this Transylvanian city. **********On the Great Market Square, two plaques, incongruously attached to a statue of a 19th-century Romanian educator, recall the names of 64 men and women who were shot by the military and the police in the rising that ousted President Nicolae Ceausescu. **********Not far away, a massive construction of black and white marble and a large cross pay tribute to 25 police officers who died in a battle between the two uniformed forces of the old Communist Government. The army, too, has put up a monument to honor six of its men who fell in this city, which Germans founded in the 12th century and still call Hermannstadt. **********Each memorial describes the dead -- those who rose against the Ceausescu Government and those who died in its defense -- as \"heroes\" of the revolution in Sibiu, which was a center of the rebellion perhaps because Nicu Ceausescu, the dictator's son, headed the regional Communist Party.  Uprising's Origins Questioned **********Here and elsewhere in Romania, opponents of President Ion Iliescu say this attitude of indiscriminate elevation to heroic status of all who died here is indicative of the Government's unwillingness to give a clear account of Mr. Ceausescu's overthrow and its origins. **********Since Mr. Iliescu was a top Communist official until he fell afoul of Mr. Ceausescu, many opponents regard the dictator's overthrow as an internal Communist struggle. **********\"Nobody told us yet who were the ones who did it,\" said Marius Gheorghiu, who writes for 21 Radical, an opposition daily. \"As long as justice doesn't want to find out, I believe it was a coup d'etat.\" **********Thomas Nagler, a history professor at Sibiu University, said the situation recalled the attitude of Nazis in Germany after World War II. \"Hitler alone was guilty,\" he said. \"All the others were good.\"  Iliescu Urges Reconciliation **********In an interview in Bucharest, the capital, Mr. Iliescu said it was hard to shed light on \"so many bloody and violent events at a time when danger of total chaos and total anarchy\" prevailed. \"Look how hard the United States finds it even today to say who killed Kennedy,\" he said. **********\"For the life of the country it is wisest to proclaim a general reconciliation and to consider all as victims,\" Mr. Iliescu said. **********The overthrow of Mr. Ceausescu has brought free speech for citizens and free markets for peddlers in this city of 170,000, but it has not eradicated the blight of widespread poverty. **********Eight thousand are unemployed, Mayor Sorin Serbu said, and the 15,000 who live on pensions receive an average of 6,000 to 7,000 lei a month, about $14 to $16 at the official rate. The Mayor said about 10,000 lei, or $23, was needed for basic necessities. **********Perhaps because of the economy, in the presidential runoff elections last October, Sibiu reversed the national trend by giving about 60 percent of its votes to Mr. Iliescu's opponent, Emil Constantinescu. **********The Dumbrava department store, the city's main shopping center, is a dispiriting place of closed-off sections, half-empty clothes racks and barren shelves and display cases. **********There are few goods, said Ramona Mesesan, a 24-year-old sales clerk, because suppliers insist on immediate cash payment, and Dumbrava has no cash. \"I have not had my full pay for three months,\" she said. \"Instead of 14,000 lei, I got 6,000.\"  Ethnic Germans Emigrate **********Miss Mesesan lives with her parents, both of whom still work. But as factory after factory reduces production, and agriculture, back in private hands, limps along at a fraction of its former output, fear of unemployment grips Sibiu and most Romanian cities. **********The small staff at 21 Radical, named after the day in December on which the revolution broke out, has reduced its wages to 12,000 lei a month to keep the paper alive, Mr. Gheorghiu said. \"The spirit keeps us alive,\" he said, \"but sometimes you have to eat, too.\" **********Asked whether any one actually went hungry in Sibiu, the journalist lowered his head, hesitated and then said softly, \"I do.\" **********Paradoxically, one of the most favored groups, because of substantial aid from Germany, is the most melancholy. They are the ethnic Germans. In 1938, 40,000 of Sibiu's population of 48,000 was German. In 1968, before West Germany negotiated their right to emigrate, in return for payments to the Ceausescu Government, 20,000 lived here. At the time of the revolution, 15,000 remained. **********Today, there are only 2,000, said Professor Nagler, who is director of the Institute for Social Sciences of the Romanian Academy here. \"There is no more confidence in Romania,\" Professor Nagler said. \"When is the next dictatorship coming?\" **********Here and in many of the surrounding villages, the houses the Germans left behind are occupied by ethnic Romanians and Gypsies. \"The new settlers no longer identify with the town,\" the professor said, offering homemade plum brandy in the comfortable living room of a house in the nearby village of Cisnadioara, which he keeps for a friend who has emigrated. \"It is falling apart.\" **********\"I feel very alien in my hometown,\" the historian said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/02/business/media-business-advertising-philip-morris-defies-critics-marlboro-medium-brand.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 820, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Philip Morris Defies Critics Of Marlboro Medium Brand", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Philip Morris Defies Critics Of Marlboro Medium Brand", "body_text": " **********PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. is high on Medium, despite critics who hold it in lower regard. **********A year ago, the nation's leading tobacco marketer took a giant risk in introducing a variation of Marlboro, the world's best-selling cigarette, with tar levels between those of regular and light brands. Some industry analysts derided Marlboro Medium as an unneeded, oddball hybrid that would confuse consumers and prove a problem in stemming a recent decline in Marlboro's popularity. **********Now, as Philip Morris and its agency, Leo Burnett, begin an extensive advertising campaign heralding a second, longer Marlboro Medium, they are declaring their strategy a success. **********\"Thanks to the Medium introduction, Marlboro remains as strong a trademark and as strong an offering in the cigarette industry as ever before,\" David E. R. Dangoor, senior vice president of marketing at Philip Morris U.S.A., said in an interview yesterday. **********\"We expect the brand will show some growth again\" by year's end, he added. **********Some 70 percent to 80 percent of America's 50 million or so smokers have tried Marlboro Medium since it came out in June 1991, he continued, and its share has settled in a range of 1.3 to 1.4 percent. In the intensely competitive cigarette market, 1 percent is considered a smash hit. **********Lawrence Adelman, a senior vice president and tobacco-industry analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, said, \"They're better off with it than without it\" because Marlboro Medium \"has filled a void in their product line.\" **********Marlboro Medium, in its original 85-millimeter length, has 12 milligrams of tar, compared with 16 for regular Marlboros and 11 for Marlboro Lights. Marlboro Medium 100's, the focus of a campaign Burnett started running in July issues of scores of magazines, has 13. **********Philip Morris is unaccustomed to scrambling for market share, particularly for mighty Marlboro, one of the most successful consumer products ever. That success came largely because of one of the most effective advertising campaigns ever, featuring Burnett's cowboy in \"Marlboro Country.\" About one of every four cigarettes sold in the United States is a Marlboro, equaling all the brands sold by the No. 2 tobacco company, R.J. Reynolds. **********Yet an onslaught of low-priced products entering the $45 billion American cigarette market has dented Marlboro's once-impregnable franchise. For two years, Marlboro's share of cigarette shipments has fallen, to 25.8 percent last year from a record 26.3 percent in 1989. **********Marlboro Medium sought to reverse that by offering a lower-tar alternative in Marlboro's familiar \"red roof\" pack to younger male smokers, who disdained Marlboro Lights, with a white-and-gold package, in favor of rival brands like Camel Lights and Winston Lights. **********\"It has achieved exactly what we set out to achieve,\" Mr. Dangoor said, adding that Medium now accounts for 5 percent to 6 percent of Marlboro's volume. Though it has cannibalized regular Marlboro's sales, he added, many of those smokers would have switched to other brands. **********Mr. Adelman agreed. \"Better to lose volume to yourself than to your competition,\" he said. **********A crucial distinction between the Medium campaign and Burnett's traditional Marlboro work is the cowboy's absence. In his place are his accoutrements -- boots, saddles, spurs -- in oversized photographs carrying the theme \"A special place in Marlboro Country.\" **********Research among smokers, Mr. Dangoor said, indicated the ads' fresher look has improved \"the advertising likeability rate for Marlboro as a whole.\" That is important when critics like the marketing consultant Al Ries of Trout & Ries Inc. label the cowboy imagery \"old fashioned\" and less appealing to younger smokers. **********In a separate interview, Ted Bell, president and chief creative officer at Leo Burnett U.S.A. in Chicago, said: \"We don't want to fool around with the cowboy. But how do you show a hip side of Marlboro? **********\"You take the items from his life and present them in a contemporarily graphic way.\" **********Marlboro Medium's ad budget, estimated at $40 million to $45 million, underscores the company's elaborate efforts to re-emphasize its more profitable full-price brands. **********As pleased as Mr. Dangoor is with Marlboro Medium, he is overjoyed, in a characteristically low-key fashion, about new Merit Ultima, a version of his Merit brand with 1 milligram of tar and also handled by Burnett. **********Smoking a Merit Ultima that he lit with a Marlboro lighter, he said Merit Ultima has already achieved an eight-tenths of 1 percent share despite appealing to a narrower segment of smokers than Marlboro Medium. (Mr. Adelman called the Ultima concept \"expandable to other products,\" even Marlboro.) **********As for the critics' early carping about Medium, Mr. Dangoor said: \"All great ideas started off by people saying it was a crazy thought.

Terrence M. McDermott, president of Cahners, expects their circulation in Europe and Asia to exceed 550,000 within five years, up from about 200,000 now. By comparison, the Cahners trade journals now have an American circulation of about four million. **********The journals are aimed at managers and professionals in industries that are becoming global in ownership or in the technology they use or sell, said Martin Fleming, a Cahners vice president. They include such journals as Variety, Control Engineering, Pollution Engineering, Datamation, EDN, Electronic Business and Design News. **********In a telephone interview from Cahners headquarters in Newton, Mass, Mr. Fleming said the company expects to spend \"tens of millions of dollars over the next five years\" on this international expansion. **********Mr. McDermott said the journals generally covered areas in which the United States was the leader and in which there were no similar journals from foreign publishers. Cahners plans to use its relationships with large American companies with interests in Asia and Europe to gain a foothold in these markets. Some journals are being offered in different languages. But with the exception of inserts for individual markets, all will have the same editorial content. **********Another publisher, the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company, is creating indigenous magazines in large foreign markets for users and buyers of personal computers. These magazines are modeled after some of its seven successful American magazines. **********For example, PC Professionell, which Ziff-Davis began publishing in Germany in April, is modeled after PC Magazine in the United States. Because the computer products available vary from market to market, each magazine has its own laboratory to conduct its own product-performance comparisons.

The company's journals have a circulation of about three million in the United States. **********Mr. Kelcz said the company's 1991-92 budget was about $60 million for creating these and other magazines in Germany, France and Britain. \"But don't expect us to come out with an Albanian magazine,\" he said. **********On the other hand, International Data Group Inc., a pioneer in foreign markets, just might. **********Of International Data's 170 information-technology journals, 145 are in 55 countries outside the United States, including Bulgaria, the former Soviet Union, Romania and China. \"We probably started 25 publications overseas in the last 18 months and only a couple in the U.S.,\" said Kelly P. Conlin, president of the company's marketing services division, in a telephone interview from Boston. The company's journals have a circulation of 2.56 million in the United States and three million abroad. **********About 40 percent of International Data's $620 million in revenues last year came from abroad. With markets like Eastern Europe and Latin America relatively undeveloped, Mr.  Conlin expects the international portion of revenues to rise to 60 percent within five years. The company first went abroad in the early 1970's. **********Mr. Conlin described four of International Data's journals -- Network World, PC World, Macworld and Computer World -- as \"global product lines.\" Versions of them account for about 90 of the 145 foreign journals. But all 90 are very separate publications. While all of International Data's foreign journals have access to each other's information, local editors at each magazine decide which articles best suit its market. **********Many American trade publishers think it will be some time before the community, with its different languages and product tastes, will be ready for a pan-European trade magazine. **********Mr. McDermott of Cahners contends that another American publisher -- CMP Publications Inc. of Manhasset, L.I. -- is discovering this with Electronic World News, an English-language magazine aimed at managers and engineers in the electronics industry.

At a meeting of banking analysts on March 26, he said it would be several years before there was an appreciable decline in vacancy rates, even if the economy strengthened and grew at a 2.5 or 3 percent rate after inflation. **********Because of the danger that real estate values could continue to fall, or that developers who are now paying their loans could default, Salomon Brothers is limiting its recommended bank stocks to companies that offer prospects for earnings growth even without a drop in loan losses. **********Recommended companies are typically those that avoided making bad loans in the first place, like Norwest of Minneapolis, which ended last week at $35.50 a share, near its yearly high of $38.125 and off its low of $24.875; NBD Bancorp, owner of the National Bank of Detroit, $27.875 compared with $31.625 and $22.75; Comerica, also in Detroit, $55 compared with $60.50 and $35.125; BankAmerica, San Francisco, $41 compared with $46.25 and $30.625; Republic New York, $40.625 compared with $49.25 and $37.125, and Bankers Trust, $52.625 compared with $68 and $41.50. **********Although losses on commercial real estate loans have already been severe, Mr. Shulman said more losses are ahead. Charles L. Coltman, chief credit officer at Corestates Financial, owner of the Philadelphia National Bank, estimated that in many cases, commercial real estate loans were worth as little as 50 cents on the dollar if a bank wanted to sell loans or buildings quickly. **********Many analysts agree that banks still have a way to go in recognizing their losses. \"In almost every situation I have worked, the bank has underestimated the reserve that is required for a bad loan or the amount by which the price of the property must be reduced if it is to be sold,\" said Robert C. MacPhee, president of Real Estate Asset Specialists, a San Francisco bank advisory concern. **********While the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government agency in charge of selling assets of failed savings and loans, still holds hundreds of billions of dollars in assets, and tenants will be demanding lower rents when their leases expire, Mr. MacPhee said, \"The commercial real estate market remains very muddled, and it is hard for banks to have any real understanding of their losses.\" **********The problem of additional loans turning sour as banks solve their problems is another difficulty. **********At MNC Financial in Baltimore, owner of the Maryland National Bank, a 150-person department was created to handle bad real estate loans and was able to sell or reorganize an average of $200 million of loans or buildings a quarter during 1991. But almost as fast as it solved problems, others emerged, so that by the end of 1991, the company had reduced its holdings of badly delinquent loans or real estate acquired by foreclosure by only $110 million from a year earlier, to $1.77 billion. **********The new problems \"are cropping up at a slower rate,\" said Daniel G. Finney, senior vice president at MNC, which ended last week at $7 a share, compared with a yearly high of $9.125 and a low of $3. \"But we are not confident enough about the market to say the slowdown will continue.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/30/business/company-news-dow-corning-will-sell-its-artificial-joint-business.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DOW CORNING WILL SELL ITS ARTIFICIAL-JOINT BUSINESS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; DOW CORNING WILL SELL ITS ARTIFICIAL-JOINT BUSINESS", "body_text": " **********Dow Corning Inc. said it would sell its global medical-devices business, which makes artificial joints for hands, hips, knees and feet.

Billington, the Librarian of Congress and one of the leading American authorities on the Soviet Union, painted a picture of files both centralized in Moscow and St. Petersburg and scattered about republics and provinces. 'Never Opened Before' **********\"There are the archives of the Central Committee, about 75 million pieces,\" said Mr. Billington, who is chairman of an internatioal commission that is trying to establish priorities on what to microfilm and catalogue first. \"They have never been opened before. It includes a tremendous amount of material -- surveys on what people were thinking, the state of public opinion. The leaders had to be informed, even in their most repressive moods.\" **********While many Soviet leaders destroyed or altered records that would have cast them in a poor light, copies of just about everything were distributed to provincial archives of the Communist Party, Mr. Billington said. **********\"This was a very paper-accumulative system,\" he added. \"There is too much of it to be faked.\" **********Some of the other material awaiting examination is in the Central Communist Party Archives at the Marx-Lenin Institute, small parts of which have been examined, whetting scholarly interest. **********Included in that archive, Mr. Billington said, are \"4,000 Lenin letters that have never been published before, highly secret dossiers gathered for Stalin and stenographic reports of the meetings of the Comintern -- some third or fourth carbons on disintegrating paper that are hard to read and in need of conservation.\" The Comintern was the Soviet-led international organization of Communist Parties that existed from 1919 to 1943. U.S. to Raise Money **********The American effort, Mr. Billington said, will include help and advice on cataloguing and preserving, publishing and microfilming of the papers so they can be made available to scholars in Russia and the United States, and raising money to pay for the activities. **********The cost to the United States Government so far, he said, has been nominal, perhaps a few thousand dollars for travel and copying expenses, with private foundations and companies paying most of the expenses. The MacArthur Foundation, for instance, has agreed to provide $1 million over three years for a cold war project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars here, said William Taubman, a political science professor at Amherst College. **********Professor Taubman has been working to set up a conference with officials of the Center for Storage of Contemporary Documentation, formerly the Archives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. **********\"If this works out, they would be our partners in a conference that would be the first step in opening up the archives,\" he said. Papers would be done on the 15 to 20 subjects with the greatest interest: the Berlin crisis of 1958-61, the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, the Soviet interventions in Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the Korean War. Two Announcements Made **********Both the Hoover Institution and the Library of Congress made announcements regarding the Russian archives today. **********The Hoover Institution said that it and the Committee on Archival Affairs of Russia would begin a $3 million preservation project for the records of the Communist Party in April and would make microfilm copies of them available worldwide. **********The Committee on Archival Affairs also joined in the Library of Congress announcement. In that one, Mr. Billington said that the library would mount an exhibition in June of 300 documents, photographs and film clips provided by the committee concerning the control exerted by the Communist Party over everyday Soviet life. The Hiss Question **********Regarding a question that has long vexed Americans, Professor Taubman said, \"We are not ourselves going after the Hiss question, although it will come up.\" **********Alger Hiss was a State Department official who was accused by a former Soviet agent, Whittaker Chambers, of spying. Mr. Hiss has always denied having been a spy, but he was convicted of perjury and served a prison sentence. **********Another scholar of Soviet affairs, Robert Conquest, senior research fellow and curator of the Eastern European and Soviet collection at the Hoover Institute at Stanford University, cautioned against expecting \"quickie\" results. \"Most of the work will be done by Russians. The likelihood that many of them are well trained is poor.\" Eventually the Truth **********But so much paper is filed away that in time, the truth will become known about such things as how many people were killed by Stalin in the 1930's or who told the truth in the Hiss-Chambers affair, Mr. Conquest said. **********Paul Josephson, a professor of the history of Soviet science at Sarah Lawrence College, said, \"This is a very exciting time,\" but he added that there were problems for scholars looking at the old Soviet files. Most Material Uncatalogued **********First, since most the material is not catalogued, the most successful people will be those who can \"land on their feet\" and take advantage of what they come across. **********Mr. Billington, asked to assess the usefulness of the effort to the United States, said, \"Undoubtedly there are a number of things we were wrong about, including the fragility of the Soviet system.\" **********Perhaps, most important, he said, will come the answers to these questions: \"How did it stay together so long?

It will oversee the operations of a force of 6,000 European troops, who are to provide armed escort for supply convoys. **********\"This town has never had it so good,\" said a United Nations officer who toured the shops this week. \"If the war lasted 10 years, it wouldn't be too long for many of these people.\" **********To make the journey from Sarajevo to Kiseljak is to cross the three Bosnias that have emerged from the war -- from Sarajevo, bastion of the Muslim-led Bosnian Government, to Ilidza and a stretch about 15 miles north under Serbian control, and finally down a steep mountain road into Kiseljak, where Bosnia's Croats hold sway. Each region has its own administration, army, currency and travel documents. **********Those moving along the road learn to expect lectures in Bosnia's politics. With fuel scarce, hitchhikers are common. A traveler spent part of a recent trip with a Serbian militiaman who asked where the vehicle's driver had come from. \"Sarajevo,\" the driver replied. \"Ah, Muslims,\" said the militiaman. Then, drawing a finger across his neck like a knife, he said, \"Pretty soon, they'll all be gone.\" **********The only other road from Sarajevo to Croatian- or Muslim-held territory crosses the airport, which is controlled by the international peace force with orders to allow passage only to people with United Nations travel documents. **********Such papers are given to officials of the world organization, foreign reporters and television crews, and to Bosnians whose departure from Sarajevo has been approved by the Serbian nationalists and the Bosnian Government. All in all, they have numbered perhaps a few hundred in the five months the United Nations has controlled the airfield. **********Reaching Kiseljak is not easy for most. There are Bosnian Government roadblocks on every exit road from the capital, intended to enforce a mobilization order forbidding the departure of men between 18 and 60 fit for military service. **********Then there are three miles along the airport road to the Serbian-held suburb of Ilidza, which passes through a heavily contested strip with snipers' nests in shattered and burned-out buildings. The snipers frequently open fire. **********It was this route that Danilo and Danka took, after bribing officials with the power to see that militiamen at the Bosnian Govenment roadblocks would let them pass. **********Even with false documents, and along a circuitous route that avoided the main barricades, their trip was dangerous. Among other things, there was a risk that militiamen who were supposed to have been bought would betray them, or that those in on the transaction might have gone off duty. **********The final risk for Danilo, who has a Muslim father and a Serbian mother, was that he would be identified as a Muslim by Serbian police officials in Ilidza. For Danka, who is a Serb, there was no problem. **********It all went well. The Serbian officials who have frequently arrested Muslims arriving in Ilidza posed no problems. The couple were spotted at dusk, sitting happily at a roadblock outside Kiseljak, chatting with Croatian militiamen and eating bananas. **********\"Isn't life just wonderful?\" Danka remarked."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/27/business/executive-changes-671992.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********AVON PRODUCTS, New York, named Siri Marshall senior vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary.

The Muslim Tatars, who make up about 48 percent of Tatarstan's nearly 4 million people, and Russians, who make up 43 percent, had gotten along very well for centuries, with intermarriage common, she said. \"I hope we will continue to live together and remain friends,\" she said. \"But who knows? Results Without Winners **********Spinning her rings, she voiced the anxieties of Russians here, who fear that this confusingly worded referendum will let Tatar nationalism get out of hand.

Maybe those in power.\" **********The old Communist Government still rules in Tatarstan, which is known officially as the Tatar Autonomous Republic. But the Government here has taken on a nationalist cast and speaks of the rights of Tatarstan. **********While the Government here denies that it wants to secede from Russia, it is asking people to vote on a single question that implies independence and secession: \"Do you agree that Tatarstan is a sovereign state and a subject of international law whose relations with the Russian Federation and other republics and states are based on equal treaties?\" **********The woman at the polling station, who did not want to give her name, said that she herself did not really understand the question. To be sovereign and equal while still inside Russia made no sense to her, she said. Many others here agree, saying the Government and nationalists will be able to interpret the results, widely expected to be favorable, in any way they please. Turnout Is Heavy **********Turnout today was good, especially from the more strictly organized collective farms in the countryside. Final results are not expected before Monday. **********Having failed to get Tatarstan to cancel the referendum, which the Russian Constitutional Court had called unconstitutional, the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, made a last-minute effort to sway the vote. He appealed on radio and television for a \"no\" vote, saying that he was in no confusion about the meaning of the question. The aim, he said, \"is not to raise the status and strengthen the sovereignty of the republic, but to get approval from the people for secession of Tatarstan from Russia.\" **********Ignoring assertions from Tatarstan's President, Mintimer S. Shaimiyev, that he has no intention of seceding, Mr. Yeltsin said: \"There is a line that cannot be crossed in any conditions -- that is the unity of Russia, its territorial, state and legal integrity.\" **********Irek G. Suleimanov, a 27-year-old Tatar and trade unionist, is married to a Russian, and they have a son. \"I'm afraid of what will happen next, however this vote goes,\" he said. **********Mr. Suleimanov said that Mr. Yeltsin's tone brought to mind the manner of the former Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in the last days of the Soviet Union. \"He makes appeals and threats, but it only makes things worse.\" **********The old party elite in the Government are using the nationalists for now, he said, to try to keep power and property. \"But can they always control the nationalists? I don't think so.\" **********There are moderate nationalists with whom he has some sympathy, Mr. Suleimanov said. It was ridiculous, he agreed, for Moscow to have decided what songs can be sung in kindergarten, and to have prevented Tatar names from being used for villages, and to have ordered that a memorial to a Tatar composer, Salikh Z. Saidashev, should be a bust only, and not a statue with legs, like that of Fyodor I. Chaliapin, the Russian bass who was born near here. **********Turgenev once wrote that if you scratch a Russian, you will find a Tatar, and it seems true here, where many people, like Lenin himself, combine Tatar and Russian features. But here, too, as in all the former Soviet Union, there is terrible confusion about old and new identities and loyalties. **********In the street, outside what was once called the Lenin Library and is now the Tatar House of Culture, five off-duty soldiers walked along, chatting. They wore the greatcoats of the former Soviet Army, to which they suppose they still belong; they are attached to a tank unit stationed locally, and say they are treated well here. **********Three of them were Russian, tall and Slavic. Two, smaller and darker, said they were Kazakhs, from what is now the independent republic of Kazakhstan. Asked if they felt they were from a different country, one replied, \"Not at all.\" Then one of the Russians said, \"We are friends, we work together, we sleep side by side -- it's ridiculous.\" **********It's very confusing for everyone, isn't it?

But their lives are about to become substantially more complicated, because of new laws that force changes in the composition of oil products. **********The first of new rules under the Clean Air Act of 1990 takes effect next month on gasoline supplied in winter to nine of the metropolitan areas with the most polluted air. More rules, still being drafted, are to follow. The issue for most refineries now is what recipe the law will impose and whether the capital investment needed to make this gasoline is likely to be recouped through higher prices. **********For some refineries, the answer is already a clear no. According to Kenneth T. Derr, the chairman and chief executive of the nation's largest refiner, the Chevron Corporation, the depression that hit the oil exploration and production business in the 1980's, when 250,000 jobs were lost, is about to hit the refining end. 'Ultimately Banish It' **********\"No question about it, the oil refinery is becoming an endangered species,\" he said in a speech Thursday to business leaders in Philadelphia. New regulations, he said, will not only rearrange his industry but will also \"stop it, shrink it, and ultimately banish it from American soil.\" His company cut production at its refinery in Port Arthur, Tex., by one-third last year. **********On the other hand, for survivors life could be sweet, according to Robert Hermes, president of Purvin Gertz, a Houston-based consulting firm. \"It depends on who you are,\" he said. **********All companies are going to be hit with huge capital costs; some estimates run to $50 billion for the industry in this decade. That would come, on average, to more than $3,000 per barrel of daily refining capacity. For older refineries the cost will be still higher. \"If you're a weak company and cannot afford the capital required, it's a bad time,\" Mr. Hermes said. \"If you're a strong company, it's a good time to be in it.\" The reason, he said, is that as refining capacity disappears, prices for refined products will rise. **********But the initial effect of the new rules is the opposite; the supply of gasoline is growing. The reason is that the rules that take effect in November will require that fuel sold in the nine metropolitan areas -- Hartford, New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Houston, Chicago, Milwaukee, Los Angeles and San Diego -- have an oxygen content of 2.7 percent. More oxygen in the fuel means car engines will produce less carbon monoxide. Adding a Molecule **********The most common way to meet the oxygen requirement is to add a fuel molecule called methyl tertiary butyl ether, commonly called MTBE. Others will add ethanol, or a related compound, ethyl tertiary butyl ether, or ETBE. **********To reach 2.7 percent, the gasoline must be 15 percent MTBE by volume. The effect is as if a butcher were ordered to put sawdust in the sausage; the same amount of meat now yields 15 percent more product. So the refineries are faced with the prospect of oversupply or excess capacity. **********John H. Lichtblau of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation said that the nine cities specified in the Clean Air Act constituted nearly 25 percent of gasoline consumption. That implies a nationwide growth in wintertime production capacity of 3.75 percent, at a time when demand is depressed by economic conditions. The actual effect is somewhat smaller, because the oxygenate is only required in the winter and can be produced in the summer and stockpiled. **********Still, supply is growing. At Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a stock brokerage firm, James F. Hickman, a research associate, said capacity was growing faster than demand and refining profit margins would be pushed down, even for the most advanced refineries. Adding oxygenates and making other changes now under discussion could add 25 cents to the cost of a gallon of gasoline, refiners say, although experience is that price increases, at least in the short term, do not relate to costs but to what the market will bear. **********The oversupply could get worse, because the Clean Air Act gives the states the authority to \"opt in,\" or voluntarily put themselves under the oxygenate rules. Mr. Lichtblau estimated that by the end of the decade, half to two-thirds of the supply would have to be oxygenated, implying still more growth. Opting in, Mr. Lichtblau said, is \"politically correct, environmentally correct, saying that the strictest standards are the best ones for the population in my area.\" Cost-Effectiveness Cited **********State pollution officials put it differently, saying that reformulation of gasoline is one of the most cost-effective ways to come into compliance, or stay in compliance, with air pollution standards. **********When refineries start losing money, some will close. Others will be reluctant, however, because doing so incurs severance liabilities to personnel. Owners that close refineries may also incur environmental liabilities, because soil polluted over decades may then have to be cleaned up. **********And there is no indication where the trend to tighter regulation will end. \"You will see no new capacity put in the United States,\" said J. Robinson West, president of the Petroleum Finance Company, , a consulting firm in Washington, \"and certainly the marginal operations will be shaken out. The question is whether those facilities that are upgraded and survive will then operate at high margins or whether there will be increased regulations and they will never be profitable. There's absolutely nothing to say that this is the last round.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/15/world/service-for-slain-producer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 47, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Service for Slain Producer", "print_headline": "Service for Slain Producer", "body_text": " **********A memorial service for David Kaplan, the ABC News producer who was killed by a sniper's bullet in Sarajevo on Thursday, is to be held at 2 P.M. tomorrow in the Terrace Theater of the Kennedy Center in Washington.

They said Baxter and Caremark would have had combined after-tax earnings of about $709 million on $10 billion in sales this year, up from $591 million profit on $8.9 billion in 1991 revenues. **********Vernon R. Loucks Jr., Baxter's chairman, said the spinoff \"re-emphasizes Baxter's commitment\" to hospitals, the company's main customers. Caremark, the largest provider of at-home intravenous drug and nutrition treatment for people with cancer, AIDS and other chronic illnesses, competes vigorously with hospitals for patients. **********Kenneth S. Abramowitz at Sanford C. Bernstein said Caremark had had 20 percent annual sales growth for the last four years. The hope is that its stock will have price-earnings ratios comparable to those of other rapidly growing home-care companies. Baxter has been selling for about 17 times earnings, slightly above the average for all stocks. **********Mr. Abramowitz said that Caremark's new chairman, C. A. (Lance) Piccolo, 52 years old, who has been a Baxter executive vice president, would be able to motivate the new company's executives by offering rewards in stock tied to performance. **********Baxter shares closed unchanged yesterday at $35.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********\"The spinoff makes sense,\" said Lorraine Schwarz at Wertheim Schroder. \"Both companies will be more focused.\" **********She said the value of the two new companies would depend on the allocation of Baxter's $2.2 billion in long-term debt, additional administrative expenses at Caremark and \"arm's-length pricing\" of services they had been selling to each other. **********Baxter acquired Caremark, which had been a publicly traded company, for about $528 million in stock in 1987 and merged it with Baxter's own home-care unit, which was about the same size. Mr. Abramowitz estimated the price of the new Caremark shares would be $6 to $9, valuing the new company at about $2 billion. **********Baxter said the new Caremark, which will probably be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, would include Baxter's chain of physical therapy and sports medicine clinics and mail-order pharmacy business, which is second in size in the country only to Medco Containment Services.

But analysts attribute the projected increase almost entirely to a single event: the announcement by Magic Johnson that he has the virus that causes AIDS. The intense publicity about the basketball star scared more Americans into adopting safe-sex techniques. Signs are that the double-digit gains of condom sales in the 1980's are unlikely to resume soon. **********Industry efforts to bolster sales are hampered by restrictions on colling condoms birth-control devices and a virtual ban on television advertising. Tonight, Fox Broadcasting has scheduled two condom commercials during a show featuring the rock-and-roll band U2. But those would be the first since Fox broke ranks with the other networks to run the first national condom commercial a year ago.Outlook SteadyThe Question Is What Might Help **********The American market is dominated by three companies led by Carter-Wallace Inc., with 61 percent of total retail sales. Next are Schmid Laboratories (a division of the London International Group) with 21.5 percent and Ancell (a division of Pacific Dunlop) with 11 percent. All market a latex product that has changed little in 50 years. **********Japanese brands, thriving on a reputation of being thinner, stronger and silkier than American-made ones, have built their market share to 5 percent from zero just a few years ago. And small niche manufacturers have taken widening slivers of the market. But competition is by no means the industry's only worry. An extensive new survey on American sexual behavior released earlier this month reported that about 66 percent of heterosexuals with multiple partners do not regularly use condoms. It also found that 70 percent of heterosexuals with partners in groups that are at a high risk of contracting AIDS never use condoms. **********Diana Temple, an analyst for Salomon Brothers, attributed the weakening sales trend to a kind of consumer backlash. AIDS, she said, \"is an issue people just don't want to deal with.\" But she predicted that sales would increase when public fear about AIDS is rekindled by the inevitable announcements by more celebrities. \"I think we can continue to expect modest growth,\" she said. **********Ancell dismisses the idea that the industry is in any long-term trouble. \"It's not that we've reached the saturation point,\" said Kerry Hoffmann, Ancell's vice president for national accounts. (Ancell's international sales make it the world's leading marketer of condoms, though it ranks a distant third in the United States.) \"I don't see the industry backsliding,\" Mr. Hoffmann said, \"mainly because AIDS looks like it's here to stay.\" **********In the next few years, he contends, the market will be revitalized by increased AIDS awareness, condom giveaway programs and broader sales distribution. He also said sales would be helped by more imaginative packaging and new products. Those might include plastic condoms, which are thinner and stronger than standard latex rubber ones, and condoms made for women to wear. **********Mr. Hoffmann added that more could be done to market condoms for birth control as well. \"If we could build a better mousetrap, we could sway consumers away from using the pill,\" he said. **********Other industry executives seemed unsure whether there was much more their companies could -- or would dare -- do to increase sales. These executives said they hoped the Federal Government, public health officials and the media would become more vigorous advocates of safe sex and condom use. **********\"We need the kind of massive publicity effort we had when AIDS broke out, from people like the Surgeon General and the media,\" said George Gori, vice president for product planning at Schmid. \"I don't think the individual companies can spread the word about condoms on their own.\"Just Like AutosAn Industry Lacking Real Imagination **********Building up sales was hardly a challenge in the late 1980's, after Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's announcement in 1986 that condoms were the only effective barrier against H.I.V., which causes AIDS. Since then, sales have risen 60 percent overall. Carter-Wallace, maker of Trojans, the brand being advertised tonight, saw a 170 percent increase in its stock price between 1986 and 1988, largely because of the condoms that now account for about a third of the company's business. **********Another reason for the rapid growth in sales, industry experts say, is that buying condoms is no longer a stealthy transaction. Once banished beneath dusty pharmacy counters, condoms now enjoy prominent display in stores. **********Some industry insiders contend that the big companies lack the resourcefulness to further exploit changing consumer needs and attitudes. \"To me it's the auto industry all over,\" said Adam Glickman, owner of Condomania, a chain of eight condom shops, where Japanese imports outsell American brands five to one. \"Carter-Wallace today is like General Motors was in the 1970's.\" **********But Mr. Gori at Schmid said some people will never like condoms, no matter what they are called or how cleverly they are dressed up. \"There's just so much you can do,\" he added. **********For more than modest growth, some marketers say that condoms should be presented in nontraditional, even playful, ways. **********Sexcessories, for example, a Los Angeles novelty outlet, distributes condom bowties and earrings and ones that glow in the dark. **********\"People look at our products and say, 'God, I'm glad I can still laugh and have fun with something like this,' \" said Allen Glasgow, vice president for marketing.Publicity Problems **********What to Say In Which Medium **********The entire industry spends only about $1.8 million a year on promotion, according to Packaged Facts, a New York-based research firm. **********Condom ads have appeared in magazines like People, GQ, Cosmopolitan and Playboy. But many print and broadcast companies don't accept them, and even those that do, including Fox and The New York Times, forbid them to mention condoms' use in birth control. **********At ABC, one company that doesn't run any condom ads, \"We don't think it's appropriate to be accepting revenue for advertising from companies that are involved in controversial issues,\" said Janice Gretemeyer, a spokeswoman. \"We think issues like that are better to be discussed on our news programs.\" **********Indeed, condoms seem to be discussed everywhere on television -- except in commercials. Many network drama and comedy programs have had episodes that mentioned condoms. **********The networks also say they leave the decision on the ads to their local affiliates. **********Some familiar with the industry say that the condom companies are still too passive, even with restrictions on advertising. **********\"The major marketers are waiting for someone else to come along,\" said David Meyer of Meyer Laboratories, a condom importer in Oakland, Calif. \"Maybe they're waiting for another Magic.\" **********NO TV ADS? TRY GIVEAWAYS **********CONDOM makers have found at least one way to advertise extensively without TV: product giveaways. **********The top companies all donate and sell at very low prices millions of condoms annually to health departments, high schools, fraternities and agencies like Planned Parenthood. New York City's health department alone distributed 2,446,560 condoms at no charge last year. **********That is a far cry from the days when condom distribution was restricted in the United States by the Comstock Laws of 1873, which restricted distribution across state lines of products considered obscene. Retailers were forced to sell their wares secretly in saloons and barber shops. **********To counter the aura of lewdness, in the 1920's the Youngs Rubber Company (bought by Carter-Wallace in 1985) began selling its Trojan brand to pharmacies only. **********Individuals and small-business owners have also taken up the condom cause. At DiAna's Hair Ego, a salon in Columbia, S.C., men, women and children can take condom samples when they go in for a haircut. There are also some novelty condoms for sale, including some packaged like lollipops. **********\"If we can get people to feel condoms, to play with them, to giggle about them,\" said DiAna DiAna, the salon's owner, \"maybe we can get more people to use them.\" **********She also leads condom parties, in the Tupperware tradition, for colleges, churches and community groups around the country. **********\"I pass out free condoms and say, 'lighten up, it's latex,' \" she said. **********While giveaways and other tactics may have helped increase condom sales in recent years, most of the gains reflected purchases by adolescents and homosexual men. Neither health officials' admonitions nor condom companies' marketing has had as much impact on the harder-to-reach markets of women and heterosexual men. **********James Murphy, a former vice president at Schmid and author of \"The Condom Industry in the United States,\" wonders if the giveaways end up discouraging retailers, for whom condom sales are only a very small portion of business to begin with. **********\"If sales are light, they're not going to want to keep them in stock,\" said Mr. Murphy, who is now a florist in North Carolina. \"Who wants to buy something if they can get it for free?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/world/us-further-eases-its-restrictions-on-trade-with-vietnam.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 356, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Further Eases Its Restrictions on Trade With Vietnam", "print_headline": "U.S. Further Eases Its Restrictions on Trade With Vietnam", "body_text": " **********The United States further relaxed its 28-year-old economic embargo against Vietnam today, saying it would allow commercial sales of items like food, medicine and farm machinery that meet basic human needs. **********The State Department said that Washington would also lift restrictions on projects sponsored by American non-governmental and nonprofit groups. **********The spokeswoman for the department, Margaret D.

That contrasts sharply with a spate of purchases in the United States by German concerns. Topping the list was the Hoechst A.G. chemical group's takeover of the Celanese Corporation in 1987 for $2.8 billion. **********By bucking that trend, industry analysts say, Witco, a New York-based producer of chemicals, petroleum products and engineered materials, is taking a big and expensive step toward becoming a global company. The deal was closed on Nov. 2 and is one of the largest foreign acquisitions ever by an American chemical concern. **********William R. Toller, Witco's chairman and chief executive, said the move, which doubles the company's international revenues, was meant to provide a strong foundation in Europe that could be a basis for further expansion. The logical next step would be into the Pacific Rim, he added. **********\"We felt our first major focus should be in Europe, since we were already active there and familiar with the market,\" Mr. Toller said in a telephone interview. Witco, which had sales of $1.6 billion in 1991, has small operations in Britain, France and the Netherlands. \"Two years ago, we decided to search out an acquisition that would put us into Germany. It will continue to be the biggest market in Europe. And that status is enhanced when you look at the potential for supplying the former East bloc countries from your German operations.\" **********That decision coincided roughly with a shift in strategy at Schering, Germany's fifth-largest chemical company, which had group sales of about $4 billion last year at current exchange rates. The top management at Schering decided it wanted to concentrate on its highly profitable pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical businesses. **********In late 1991, Schering put its industrial chemical and organic chemical divisions up for auction. The two units, which have small subsidiaries in the United States, Britain and Spain, are expected to have sales of $645.2 million in 1992. The company also sold its electroplating business, which had sales of 329 million marks in 1991, for an undisclosed price to a subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, the French petroleum giant. **********Industry analysts said the industrial and organic chemical divisions were solid businesses but had never been well integrated into Schering's overall activities and did not hold the profit potential of pharmaceuticals, which are the Berlin-based company's traditional strength. **********\"Schering makes 60 percent of its sales and 80 percent of its earnings in pharmaceuticals,\" said Petra Zamagna, chemical industry analyst for Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt. \"The industrial chemical and natural substance divisions were built up by acquisitions in the 1960's and 1970's. They were never meshed well with Schering's other businesses.\" **********That is also a risk for Witco. But Mr. Toller believes integrating the new divisions into Witco's European activities will not be a problem. The company is setting up a European headquarters in Frankfurt to oversee its operations. **********\"We have been marketing our products in Germany for some time, supplying it from our other European operations,\" he said. \"So we were very familiar with the two divisions we have acquired. They are a good fit. We were interested in them long before Schering had made up its own mind.\" **********Ted Semegran, chemical analyst at Shearson Lehmann in New York, said the acquisition was \"an absolute jewel.\" He added: \"It's a good mix of complementary businesses. In the United States, for example, Schering's businesses are in the same product area as Witco's, but just different enough that they expand Witco's businesses.\" **********To get the two divisions, Witco had to outbid Germany's Viag A.G., an industrial and trading conglomerate that has been pursuing a global diversification of its own. But Viag's bid fell short, prompting some Geraman analysts to suggest Witco had overpaid. Miss Zamagna of Deutsche Bank disagreed: \"It was a fair price. The timing of the sale was unfavorable for Schering. For the past few years, the global chemical industry has been struggling. If they had sold it two or three years ago, when the overall picture was brighter, they would have received a higher price.\" **********For Witco, calculating the bid was complicated by a sharp drop in the dollar's value against the German mark during the summer. When Witco began considering the acquisition, one dollar was worth 1.62 marks. By midsummer, the exchange rate had slid to near 1.40 marks. **********\"We were very concerned when the dollar began dropping,\" Mr. Toller said. \"It did not outweigh the strategic considerations, but it was a factor that had to be watched closely. Once we had made the bid, we went into the market and hedged our currency exposure. I slept a lot better after that.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/21/business/corporate-tax-cut-deleted-as-democrats-polish-bill.html": {"writer_name": "Adam Clymer", "pub_date": "1992-02-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 932, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Corporate Tax Cut Deleted As Democrats Polish Bill", "print_headline": "Corporate Tax Cut Deleted As Democrats Polish Bill", "body_text": " **********Congressional Democrats moved today to increase the chances for passage of their tax proposals. House leaders dropped an unpopular corporate tax provision and a powerful Senator said he would try to include a politically attractive health insurance measure in the bill. **********House Democrats, after a second day of party caucuses dominated by continual criticism of a proposed one-percentage-point cut in the corporate income tax rate, decided to eliminate the provision from the bill entirely. On Wednesday, they had decided to limit the cut to two years rather than make it permanent, as first planned. **********Those shifts were aimed at winning Democratic votes for the six-year tax bill, whose centerpiece is a tax credit of up to $400 for married couples, financed mainly by raising the highest personal income tax bracket to 35 percent, from 31. The corporate tax cut provision had attracted no visible support, even from corporations. **********The bill now has $79.1 billion in tax cuts and $93.5 billion in tax increases. **********Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in an interview that he would seek to attach a measure intended to improve access to private health insurance to the tax bill. The measure would set Federal standards for insurance companies and prohibit them from discriminating against people with existing medical problems, who now have difficulty obtaining insurance at affordable rates. It would also make it easier for small businesses to obtain group policies. **********Mr. Bentsen said his proposal, which has wide support in Congress and has been generally endorsed by President Bush, should be part of the tax bill, both to get action on the insurance measure quickly and to make the overall package more attractive politically. **********He said including the health insurance measure would make it harder for Mr. Bush to veto the bill, as Republicans have threatened because of the provisions raising taxes. **********\"It sure makes it a positive package,\" he said, adding that he did not think that overall health care reform could be enacted this year, but that this was an important \"interim step.\" **********Mr. Bentsen also announced, after a caucus among Senate Democrats, that any tax-cut bill his committee reported would be financed by tax increases. Last fall he had proposed paying for tax cuts with a cut in military spending. The shift in approach puts him on the same track as House Democrats. **********He said he thought that along with \"better access to health care,\" any Senate bill should include a tax cut for the middle class, probably focused on children, and a cut in capital gains taxes \"targeted to try to encourage new business and small business and venture capital.\" **********Mr. Bentsen said he did not want to get into numbers today, but would make a proposed bill public on Monday. He does not dominate his committee the way Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, dominates the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, if not his party, in the House. The Finance Committee consists of 10 Democrats, some of them quite conservative, and 9 Republicans, some of them fairly liberal. **********The committee will begin voting on the measure on Thursday, and Mr. Bentsen may find he has broader support for his insurance proposal, which has considerable Republican backing, than for the underlying tax measure. Military Savings at Issue **********The acknowledgement that any tax cuts would be paid for with tax increases also ended a disagreement with Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who has insisted that any savings from military programs go to domestic needs. **********In fact, under the 1990 budget act, military savings this year can be used only to reduce the deficit. But the House Government Operations Committee voted today to amend that act so that the savings could be used for domestic programs. Before the vote, Representative John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads that committee, called the restriction \"an outdated and unnecessary budgetary straitjacket.\" **********The Bush Administration is generally opposed to eliminating the so-called internal firewalls in the budget act. The proposed change is expected to come to the House for a vote in late March or early April. Foley Predicts Passage **********The tax bill is expected to come up next Wednesday or Thursday. \"The bill will pass,\" Speaker Thomas S. Foley said after today's caucus. **********He said the House would also vote on Mr. Bush's proposals. \"It's my view that in that comparison, this does more for tax equity and fairness, this does more for economic growth, and it's more fiscally responsible,\" he said. **********Asked if Mr. Bush's promised veto did not reduce the Democratic bill to no more than a \"political document,\" Mr. Foley replied: \"No. Is not the President's threat just a political threat? We have to make our judgments, and the President has to make his.\" He said that if Congress gave way every time a President threatened a veto, that would \"create a dictatorship.\" **********Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is his party's senior member on the Ways and Means Committee, complained today that the Democrats were being unfair in not permitting him to make changes in the President's proposal that will be offered on the floor. Since the Democrats were changing their bill from day to day, he said in an interview, he should have the same chance. \"I've got 100 changes I'd like to make,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/19/business/company-news-hewlett-shows-new-fast-chip.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hewlett Shows New Fast Chip", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Hewlett Shows New Fast Chip", "body_text": " **********The Hewlett-Packard Company announced the next generation of its microprocessor technology.

In the talks, Mr. Larson said the Russians \"recognized that their export control regime is not adequate and that there is a serious problem with sensitive technologies, and they expressed an extreme willingness to work with us.\" 'Deal They Could Not Refuse' **********Mr. Berdennikov said Russia was determined to insure that the country could not become a platform for the spread of weapons of mass destruction. **********At the two-day meeting, which ended today, Cocom countries -- which include all NATO countries except Iceland, plus Australia and Japan -- offered their former enemies what Mr. Larson called \"deal they could not refuse\": act rapidly to control exports and show that Western technology will be put only to civilian use, and in return gain increasing access to sensitive technology and wide-ranging Western assistance. **********The United States said it would provide $11 million to help the former East bloc countries set up export control systems, as well as offer technical assistance on the drafting of laws and training for customs and licensing officials. **********Countries seeking greater access to Western technology would have to guarantee that the equipment would be used for civilian ends, allow Western countries to make spot checks and introduce a comprehensive export control system capable of insuring that a country to which sensitive goods are being sent is indeed the end user, American and European officials said. Applications by Year's End **********\"We believe it essential that governments carefully consider the potential of sensitive exports to enhance the indigenous weapons manufacturing capability of countries of concern to the international community,\" Mr. Larson said. **********West European officials said that countries wishing to take up the Cocom offer were expected to apply by the end of the year. Once they demonstrated that they had complied with the conditions, controls on technology exports to them would be relaxed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/22/business/market-place-changing-world-of-fund-investors.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Antilla", "pub_date": "1992-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 766, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Changing World Of Fund Investors", "print_headline": "Market Place; Changing World Of Fund Investors", "body_text": " **********THE sweeping changes for the mutual fund industry that the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed yesterday may raise an important question in the mind of the individual investor: What about me? **********Investor advocacy groups have raised no hue and cry about the suggested revisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which governs those who manage America's $1.5 trillion in mutual funds; many of these changes were expected. Indeed, some revisions strike consumer groups as particularly friendly to investors. Workers with a stake in a retirement fund, for example, would get prospectuses and semi-annual reports on their investments under the S.E.C. proposals -- a plus for investors. **********But several proposed revisions in the rules governing mutual funds may not be in the best interests of investors. Topping the list: a suggestion that investors be able to buy a fund by \"coupon clipping.\" **********Current regulations allow mutual fund companies to solicit investors through newspaper and magazine advertisements, but not to actually sell investments in the funds through those ads. When they receive a customer's request for more information, funds send back a prospectus describing their management, investment philosophy and fees. If the investors like what they read, they can then sign on the bottom line and mail in a check to the fund company. **********The S.E.C. is proposing, however, that investors be able to fill out a coupon in the local newspaper and simply mail it in with a check -- without having seen the fund's prospectus. That proposal does not sit well with some groups that get regular feedback on the problems that average investors face. \"Too few people read the prospectus as it is,\" said John Markese, director of research at the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago. \"I have a feeling that this coupon-clipping procedure will even lessen that number.\" **********In Massachusetts, state regulators review all mutual fund advertisements in local newspapers and magazines, hoping to stop misleading pitches from reaching unsophisticated investors. \"Of all the areas of mutual fund regulation, that's been our biggest concern -- aggressiveness in the mutual fund advertising area,\" said Barry Guthary, director of securities at the Massachusetts securities division. \"This proposal strikes me as a little problematic.\" **********The S.E.C., which has restrictions on fund advertising, argues that the ads would become more informative, thus giving investors an easier way to compare funds. And the S.E.C. notes that any investor who wants to read the prospectus would still be able to do so. Right now, brokers can sell stocks by phone, S.E.C. officials say, so why not let them do the same for mutual funds? **********Also suspect to some investor advocates is the S.E.C.'s push to allow fund fees to be negotiated. While the goal of greater leeway to haggle is an admirable one, it may not help those who need it most, Mr. Markese said. \"The ones with the least negotiating power would likely be smaller investors,\" he said. But large institutional investors, who own 25 percent of all mutual fund assets -- up from 11 percent in 1970 -- might well benefit. That was the case when commissions on stock trading were deregulated in 1975, which marked the beginning of a plunge in rates paid by institutions. **********\"You know who is going to win, and that's the institutional investor -- the one with the bargaining power,\" Mr. Guthary said. **********Still, individual investors face a plethora of problems in buying funds and could use a little help. Not the least of those problems is simply understanding the complicated explanations in fund prospectuses, which increasingly seem to be written for lawyers, not investors. There have also been complaints that some brokers do not disclose the risks when they sell funds. In 1990, regulators in New York, Maine and Massachusetts brought charges complaining of misleading sales pitches by the First Investors Corporation, whose brokers \"targeted unsophisticated investors to sell them high-yield funds,\" Mr. Guthary said. **********The nation's mutual fund regulations already provide the muscle for the S.E.C. to tackle the sort of problem that First Investors and others have posed for small investors, Mr. Guthary said. \"They have all the power in the world, but it's a matter of them directing their efforts,\" he said. **********If the S.E.C. should be successful in getting its proposals through Congress, however, the new mutual fund products that are introduced as a result are likely to add to the agency's policing work. Among other things, the S.E.C. would like to make it easier to use \"securitized\" products, like credit-card receivables, in mutual funds."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/09/business/progress-reported-in-talks-on-north-american-trade.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1992-04-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 602, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Progress Reported in Talks On North American Trade", "print_headline": "Progress Reported in Talks On North American Trade", "body_text": " **********The United States, Canada and Mexico have narrowed differences on issues ranging from autos to energy in negotiations on a North American free trade area, ministers of the three countries said after three days of meeting here.

Canada and Mexico both want the 50 percent maintained, arguing that at 60 percent the United States would take Asian investment away from them. **********Washington is also seeking to open parts of Mexico's energy industry, which was nationalized in 1938 and is protected as part of the national patrimony in Mexico's Constitution. **********While Mexico does not want to be seen giving away control of oil to the United States, its oil industry needs huge sums to modernize and increase output. **********Negotiators are looking for ways to allow for foreign investment and other participation in the industry without touching off a domestic political storm. The Political Consequences **********Mrs. Hills said she thought the political consequences of an agreement could be positive. \"Those voters who believe that it is good for the region to find ways to become more competitive globally will mark that as a plus,\" she said. \"Those who are resigned to the belief that a free trade area is not in their best interest will mark it as a minus.\" **********Gov.

This year, the group estimates that food service sales will reach $262 billion, up 5.6 percent from the $248 billion spent in 1991. **********Such statistics have helped the stocks of most publicly traded restaurant companies hold their own fairly well this year, after a banner performance in 1991.

But the real growth potential lies abroad, Mr. Doyle says. **********\"In normal times, McDonald's foreign business can grow at a 20 percent annual rate,\" he said. \"But right now there are recessions abroad as well, which tells me that this year's foreign earnings might grow in the area of 13 to 14 percent.\" **********McDonald's stock closed at $42.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, off 25 cents. **********Other analysts are more cautious about McDonald's, a company they say is being squeezed by hamburger chains like Rally's Inc., whose restaurants mostly have only drive-up counters, and by companies developing niche markets by catering to aging baby boomers, like Brinker International and Applebee's International. **********Chili's, a chain owned by Brinker, \"is perceived now as offering better value than many fast-food chains,\" said Caroline Levy, the restaurant and food analyst at Lehman Brothers. **********Ms. Levy, who called Brinker's management \"one of the best\" in the country, said she was also excited about the potential of Romano's Macaroni Grill, a Brinker division that next year will have 23 restaurants across the country. **********\"Macaroni Grill is one of the hottest new concept restaurants today,\" she said of the Italian food chain.

The American uranium industry, in a longstanding lawsuit, is trying to make all uranium from the republics subject to the prohibitive duties that the Commerce Department imposed May 29 on low-grade imports from the republics. **********The decision to open negotiations follows an active effort by Russia to turn the trade dispute into a diplomatic issue.  Taking Their Case to the Top **********\"They've raised it at the highest levels,\" Robert Strauss, the United States Ambassador to Russia, said in an interview today. \"They've raised it with me; they've also raised it with President Bush.\" **********In the last two months, the Bush Administration has almost completely reversed its position in the highly political case, a case study in effective lobbying and in the sensitivity of Federal agencies to the mood of the capital -- in this case, to a desire not to throw roadblocks in the way of economic growth in the former Soviet Union. **********Not only does the case involve Mr. Strauss, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, but also Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., who was chairman of the Republican National Committee during most of the Reagan Administration. **********Until mid-May, the Energy Department enthusiastically supported the uranium industry in its suit for steep punitive duties on all imports of uranium from the republics. Then, startling and angering the domestic uranium producers, the Energy Department asked that weapons-grade uranium be excluded from the case because it was unsuitable for commercial use, Government documents show. **********Weapons-grade is the type of uranium that the department and several American companies are now talking about buying from Russia. The material would have to be diluted before it could be used in reactors. **********Mr. Fahrenkopf, who represents the Russian exporter of the uranium, said the Energy Department had been discussing the possible purchase \"for some period of time.\" **********Meanwhile, the Commerce Department has decided to open negotiations under a never-used provision of American trade law that would allow the department to impose a settlement on the domestic industry without its consent, said a department official who insisted on anonymity. The section only applies to trade cases filed against countries with nonmarket economies and was enacted in 1988. **********The settlement would impose a tonnage limit on uranium shipments but not a duty.

The times when you tried to persuade somebody to vote your way are over.\" Importance Dismissed **********With little time left before the vote, Israeli politicians and professional analysts are stunned by the apathy that voters have shown to what on paper should be one of the more important elections here in many years. **********In many ways, the country is at a crossroads, involved as it is in difficult peace talks with its Arab neighbors, worried about ragged relations with the United States and faced with profound demographic change as a result of large-scale immigration from the former Soviet Union. **********But those dominant issues have been little discussed as the major parties focus instead on personal attacks, evocations of old triumphs and disasters, and Tarzan-like chest-pounding over who really cares about Israeli security, the implication always being that the other side would sell the country down the river. **********Moreover, there is no big-party leader with the commanding presence or tub-thumping speaking style of, say, Menachem Begin, the former Prime Minister who died three months ago. **********As a result, signs of indifference are everywhere. **********Campaign meetings are so sparsely attended that the parties have started canceling them.

Likudnik Is 'Fed Up' **********Labor and Mr. Rabin are banking on people like Nomi Shamai, who lives in the poor Jesse Cohen neighborhood of Holon, near Tel Aviv, with five small children in two and a half rooms and money problems stacked up to the ceiling. She is fed up. **********\"I've always been a Likudnik,\" Mrs. Shamai said. \"But Likud just spins its wheels. If Rabin is a human being, he'll help us.\" **********A staccato of scandals has hardly helped the governing party. A new one burst open this week over allegations that Jewish farmers, including settlers in the occupied Gaza Strip, had embezzled millions of dollars from the Government by submitting deliberately inflated bills from Palestinian contractors who had built greenhouses for the Israelis. **********According to the newspaper Hadashot, investigators are looking into the possibility that part of the payments to the contractors ended up in the hands of Palestinian terrorists as a form of protection money. **********Opinion polls consistently show Labor to be leading Likud, but they also suggest a virtual dead heat on which of them will be in the better position to form a new government. Since no party in Israel has ever commanded a parliamentary majority on its own, the important question is not so much who winds up in first place but rather who is more likely to find enough coalition partners to control 61 of Parliament's 120 seats.  Less Interest, Less Violence **********A commonly held view among political specialists is that neither of the big parties will be able to form a Government on its own, and so inevitably they will turn to each other to reconstitute the \"national unity government\" that they maintained from 1984 to 1990. It is not an exciting prospect for many Israelis, and that, too, may explain the low-key nature of the campaign. **********Not that relative calm is all bad. **********Campaigners on the political left are particularly relieved, for in the past they could anticipate violence from supporters of Likud and small far-right parties, who would smash their cars and even drop lighted cigarettes into their opponents' pockets. **********\"It's a lot milder than anything in the past,\" said Galia Golan, a Hebrew University professor of political science and a campaigner for the left-wing Meretz Party. \"I think the passions aren't there on the right the way they once were.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/05/business/media-business-advertising-lieu-satisfaction-s-lure-threat-consumer-peril.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-08-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 811, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; In Lieu of Satisfaction's Lure, A Threat of Consumer Peril", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; In Lieu of Satisfaction's Lure, A Threat of Consumer Peril", "body_text": " **********SINCE nicotine patches were introduced, their makers have wooed worried smokers with ads emphasizing the benefits of kicking the habit.

Patches are the most heavily advertised of the products in the relatively new category of prescription drugs marketed directly to consumers; it has been estimated that the four marketers will spend more than $100 million this year to advertise them. **********Those ads have, to date, featured confident, smiling people, ostensibly satisfied users of patches.

The ads for Pacific Air Lines, as Newsweek magazine recalled two years later, \"frankly called attention to the fears many people have of flying.\" **********In a telephone interview from Beverly Hills, Calif., Mr. Freberg, who is now also a radio commentator, read from one of the ads hanging on his wall: \"Hey there, you with the sweat in your palms. Do you wish the pilot would knock off all that jazz about 'That's Crater Lake on the left, ladies and gentlemen,' and tell you instead what the devil that funny noise was you just heard?' \" **********\"To this day,\" Mr. Freberg said, \"when I get on an airline, the pilot very frequently will come back and say, 'That's the only honest airline ad that's ever run.' \" **********Mr. Sailer said Parke-Davis had no plans to promote Cancer Care or make references to smoking's dangers in Nicotrol's mainstream consumer ad campaign, which will begin with print advertisements by Sudler & Hennessey in New York.

Though foundation officials refuse to give interviews, Adweek has estimated the cost of the campaign at $20 million. **********Viewers of Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s four networks -- CNN, Headline News, TNT and WTBS -- have been watching two soft-selling spots shot in a warm, fuzzy fashion evocative of emotional commercials for greeting cards. **********The theme of both 30-second commercials is \"Life. What a beautiful choice.\" One presents children, dressed in school uniforms and Halloween costumes, described as the result of \"unplanned pregnancies that could have ended in abortion.\" The other, centering on adoption as an alternative, depicts a couple about to meet a newborn daughter-to-be. **********If the spots are reminiscent of the glowing, upbeat \"It's morning in America\" advertising for President Reagan's re-election in 1984, it is no coincidence. At least one executive who helped the Reagan effort, Phil Dusenberry of BBDO, helped with the De Moss spots. **********A primary issue raised by the ad blitz is the gate-keeping role of the media, particularly when networks providing news and information run advocacy commercials on subjects they cover. **********Brian Lewis, a spokesman for CNBC in Fort Lee, N.J., a news and information cable network owned by NBC, said yesterday that CNBC stopped running the spots four days after complaints from more than 100 employees. **********\"Since we are a news organization,\" he said, \"people here felt it was important there be an audio disclaimer,\" which would have stated the spots were sponsored, in addition to a visual disclaimer on screen. **********Lifetime, a cable network in Astoria, Queens, that carries entertainment programming aimed at women, also stopped running the spots. A spokeswoman there said it was over \"a business issue,\" but that, too, was believed to be over disclaimers. **********\"Maybe you can have a debate with us for accepting advocacy ads on a news network,\" said Steve Haworth, a spokesman for CNN in Atlanta. But, he added, CNN only takes spots that \"make responsible claims and pass through our standards and practices committee for review.\" And they run only during talk and feature programming like \"Larry King Live\" and \"Sonya,\" he continued. **********Mr. Haworth disputed complaints by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America that CNN holds the organization to more rigorous standards; two of four Planned Parenthood spots were rejected by CNN for being too graphic or hard to substantiate. **********David J. Andrews, the federation's acting president in New York, complained that \"we are told our ads are too hard-hitting, or too controversial.\" **********He acknowledged that the organization's commercials rejected by CNN, which included one in which an actress who faints after a botched abortion, \"are perhaps more direct.\" Asked if low-key spots, produced by executives from large agencies, stand a far better chance of surviving network scrutiny, he replied: \"I suppose you could say it's the style that's affected the networks. But even if you accept that's true, the underlying problem is the double standard.\" **********Such an ad executive is Mr. Dusenberry, who as chairman and chief executive at BBDO New York lists among his clients the Pepsi-Cola Company.

But Congressional aides and a Treasury Department official said that the bill still might be put back on the House agenda. **********The Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac, are Government-created, publicly traded companies that have issued or guaranteed securities made up of $900 billion worth of mortgages bought from lenders. They were created to help provide more money for mortgages. Question of Guarantees **********But critics have said that the mortgage securities carry an implicit Government guarantee, and that taxpayers could face a repetition of the savings and loan industry fiasco if mortgage defaults surged and forced Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to seek Government assistance. Both companies deny that such a risk exists, emphasizing that mortgage defaults tend to come in limited regional surges. **********Henry B.

The House had been scheduled to begin debating the bill on Tuesday, with a vote expected by Wednesday. **********Frank T.

Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee. **********Mr. DeStefano said the bill was still likely to come to a vote. \"There's room for some reasonable changes -- they have to be reasonable,\" he said this evening. \"We don't intend to cut down significantly the capital requirements or anything like that.\" **********Other Congressional aides said that most of Fannie Mae's lobbying had been directed at the House, not Mr. Riegle. Mr. Gonzalez did not return telephone calls for comment. **********The House and Senate passed two similar bills in the last year concerning Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which the companies supported. The bills would require the companies to finance many low-income and inner-city mortgages and would set up an office in the Department of Housing and Urban Development to set standards for how much capital Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should keep to protect against defaults **********House and Senate staffs produced a compromise bill late Thursday reconciling technical differences between the two measures.

'No Attempt to Mislead' **********\"In all of this there was no attempt to mislead anyone or cover up anything,\" she said in a telephone interview. \"But some mistakes have been made.\" **********At issue are two separate questions about the C.I.A.'s willingness to be forthcoming in the case. One is a Sept.  17 letter to the Atlanta prosecutors, later released publicly, stating that the C.I.A. had no independent secret information about the case, when in fact the C.I.A. had already received several classified reports about it. The other is the C.I.A.'s disclosure that it has recently found new reports about the bank's activities, which calls into question its previous assertions that it had cooperated fully with the prosecution. **********Ms. Rindskopf's statement today is likely to fuel speculation that, despite the President's denials, the Bush Administration concealed information about the case so as not to hinder the Administration's foreign policy. **********The Government has denied any political interference in the case, but in an abrupt reversal during a sentencing hearing last Thursday, a day after the C.I.A. informed the Justice Department of its errors, the prosecution decided to allow the defendant, Christopher P. Drogoul, to withdraw his guilty plea. The move was a reversal for the U.S. Government, which had hoped to win a stiff sentence for Mr. Drogoul. Instead, the case will now go to trial.  On Monday, Federal Judge Marvin H. Shoob sharply criticized the Government for its handling of the case, charging that it had failed to \"investigate seriously\" whether officials in Rome had known that its Atlanta branch was lending huge sums of money to Iraq in violation of bank policy. **********The C.I.A. admission also follows a Sept. 29 letter to Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, from the Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee suggesting that the agency misled the Justice Department, Federal prosecutors and a Federal judge in Atlanta. **********The letter expressed concern about the C.I.A.'s statement in a Sept. 17 letter to Atlanta prosecutors that was entered into the court record later. It said the only information the C.I.A. had about the case was what was known publicly. In fact, the C.I.A. had received several classified reports about the matter, some of which were given to the judge and to members of Congress. Wondering What Is Missing **********Committee members say that the misleading statement leads them to question what else the C.I.A. may be withholding and whether both prosecutors and the judge were given access to all relevant intelligence reports. **********The intelligence committee letter -- signed by Senator David L. Boren, the Oklahoma Democrat who chairs the panel, and Senator Frank Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who serves as Vice Chairman -- referred to three classified reports written in October 1989 \"which indicate that B.N.L.-Rome officials knew of the activities of B.N.L.-Atlanta with respect to Iraq.\" **********The letter expressed concern that the C.I.A.'s failure to acknowledge the existence of the reports is \"misleading,\" and called it \"imperative\" that the C.I.A. inform the court of the existence of the documents. **********\"I was very upset when I saw the C.I.A. report, which seems so misleading and contradicts the facts,\" Senator Boren said. \"It was obviously crafted to give a false impression, and I think that has to be cleared up.\" **********Ms. Rindskopf called the omission of a reference to classified material \"a regrettable but human error.\"  Embarrassment for Bush **********The Boren-Murkowski letter is an embarrasssment for the Administration because it comes from a committee staunchly supportive of American intelligence agencies. . **********The senators' letter is one of several they have sent to Mr. Gates in recent months asking him to disclose what information the agency had on both the bank scandal and Iraq's weapons buildup at a time when the Bush Administration was engaged in a policy of improving relations with Iraq. With each query comes new information, Senator Boren said, which leads him to believe that the agency may still be withholding even more."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/07/business/a-less-aggressive-salomon-sees-its-profits-decline-30.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Faison", "pub_date": "1992-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 736, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Less Aggressive Salomon Sees Its Profits Decline 30%", "print_headline": "A Less Aggressive Salomon Sees Its Profits Decline 30%", "body_text": " **********Amid a flurry of reminders that Salomon Inc. has yet to emerge fully from the fallout caused by last year's Treasury auction scandal, the company reported yesterday that its first-quarter profits were down 30 percent from the period last year. **********The profit decline reflected the retreat by Salomon Brothers, the company's investment banking unit, from the trading prowess it demonstrated a year ago, before the scandal broke. But the profits also marked a turnaround from the $29 million that Salomon lost in the quarter that ended Dec. 31. **********For the first quarter, ended March 31, the company said it earned $190 million, or $1.51 a share, down from $273 million, or $2.30 a share, a year earlier. **********Salomon Brothers had a pretax profit of $374 million, down 26 percent from $503 million in 1991's first quarter, while the company's oil subsidiary, Phibro Energy, lost $30 million as oil prices remained sluggish. Salomon's total assets grew to $103 billion. **********Analysts said the main cause of the earnings decline was the less aggressive posture toward trading that Salomon has taken since Warren E. Buffett took over as interim chairman in August and began stressing stability over volatility. Since the scandal, Salomon has retained its role as a primary dealer at Treasury auctions, but has been banned from trading on behalf of customers. **********\"It's not so surprising that revenues were down somewhat,\" said Perrin Long, a securities analyst at the First of Michigan Corporation in Detroit. \"This is the new Salomon, not the old Salomon with its trading strength.\" **********Robert E. Denham, Salomon's general counsel, told shareholders at the company's annual meeting yesterday that legal and other costs related to the scandal would require more than the $200 million set aside in a reserve last fall. Mr. Denham said it was too early, before an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission was completed, to say how much more would be needed.  Investigation Going Slowly **********The S.E.C. recently reported to Congress that its investigation of Salomon had been slowed because of record-keeping so shoddy that in many cases it was indecipherable. The commission is examining trading records and securities allocations to determine the extent to which Federal regulations covering bond sales were violated. **********\"I think it's a sign,\" Mr. Long said, referring to the S.E.C. and Salomon, \"that this is not going to be as simple as both sides may have hoped.\" **********On another front, Salomon said that Phibro Energy's $116 million investment in an oil development project in Russia was troubled by unfavorable taxes, pipeline tariffs and unpaid bills from various Russian entities. **********\"If these problems cannot be resolved satisfactorily, Phibro may very well be unable to recover its investment,\" Salomon said in a statement. **********Phibro's chairman, Andrew Hall, told shareholders yesterday that the company would need to invest an additional $150 million in refinery improvements this year. **********In yet another problem, disclosed yesterday, Salomon has been named as one of seven defendants in a $36 million suit that was filed by a New Jersey-based investment bank. The suit charges racketeering offenses related to the Treasury auction scandal. **********Mr. Long noted that Salomon's stock price, which closed at $32.25, down 75 cents on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, was among the best performing of the major brokerage stocks so far this year. Mr. Buffett's Message **********Salomon's interim chairman, Mr. Buffett, reiterated to the gathering of shareholders that he would not leave the firm until the investigation had been resolved. He announced in March that he would step down both as chairman of Salomon Inc., and as chief executive of Salomon Brothers, once the investigation was over. **********Mr. Buffett provided details of the company's compensation plans, saying that individual divisions in the firm's investment banking unit had been informed of the profit level each must achieve in order to earn bonuses for its members. Individuals within each unit, he said, will be paid for performance, and they have not yet been informed of their individual bonuses. **********Mr. Buffett also said that under a proposed stock plan, top employees would receive a portion of their bonuses in company shares. The plan is intended to give employees a vested interest in improving the company's stock price. **********Salomon said it wanted to increase the number of shares available for employee awards to 30 million from the 10 million that have already been allocated under the plan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/30/business/new-rival-for-intel-s-key-chip.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1992-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 917, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Rival For Intel's Key Chip", "print_headline": "New Rival For Intel's Key Chip", "body_text": " **********Competitive pressure on the Intel Corporation will intensify this week as yet another company announces a chip that it claims is compatible with Intel's corporate treasure, its advanced microprocessors. **********Word of the new challenge, from the Cyrix Corporation of Richardson, Tex., caused Intel's stock to fall almost $10 last week, culminating in a $3.50 drop on Friday, to $55.25, when Intel was the most heavily traded over-the-counter issue. **********And in what has become a familiar chain of events, Intel on Friday filed a patent-infringement lawsuit in United States District Court in Dallas, seeking to prevent Cyrix from selling its chip, which Cyrix says is compatible with Intel's 386 and 486 chips. Plans to Introduce Chip **********Cyrix, which is privately held, plans to announce its chip officially on Monday, becoming the third company to introduce a \"clone\" of Intel's advanced microprocessors, which are used in millions of personal computers and have made Intel the envy of the semiconductor industry for its fast growth and high profits. **********Advanced Micro Devices Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., and Chips and Technologies of San Jose, Calif., began selling 386 clones last year. Intel also has copyright or patent lawsuits pending against those companies. **********Cyrix has already been a competitor of Intel, selling a chip that competes directly with Intel's 387, which performs mathematical operations. Cyrix's 1991 revenues were about $60 million, roughly double the level of a year earlier. **********Cyrix's new microprocessor, known as the Cx486SLC, appears to be somewhat of a hybrid. It has much of the internal structure, the company said, of Intel's 486SX chip, but is designed to plug into computers that use the less powerful, and less expensive, 386SX chip. The company said the computer makers that now build 386SX-based machines could get a boost in performance by using Cyrix's chip without changing the computer design. **********Cyrix says the chip offers nearly as much performance as Intel's 486SX, but at a far lower price. The Cyrix chip, which will be shipped in 30 to 45 days, will sell for $119; Intel's 486SX has list prices ranging from $200 to more than $300, depending on speed. But Intel has already vowed to continue to cut prices regularly and aggressively. **********Jerry Rogers, president and chief executive of Cyrix, said the company was aiming its chips at the notebook computer market. He said he expected that as early as next week some large computer companies would announce that they would use the Cyrix chip, but he declined to identify those companies. Extra Protection Plans **********Analysts said the company appeared to have found a niche in the market. \"I think they have, for the most part, a very strong offering,\" said Michael Slater, editor of The Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter published in Sebastopol, Calif. He said that Intel, which has vast resources, would be able to remain ahead in the most advanced chips, but would have to share the market and cut prices for less-advanced processors. **********Mr. Rogers said Cyrix's chips did not infringe Intel's patents. But as extra protection, he said, the company has its chips made for it by SGS-Thomson, a French-Italian company that he said has a license to use Intel patents. **********Last week, Cyrix asked the United States District Court in Sherman, Tex., to declare that its microprocessor is protected from Intel's patent suits because of this relationship. \"We were concerned that Intel was going to try to intimidate our customers,\" Mr. Rogers said. **********Cyrix is already using its relationship with SGS-Thomson as a defense against an Intel patent-infringement lawsuit concerning the math-processing chip. The judge in Sherman has heard the arguments but has not yet issued a decision. **********Such a defense will also be used by Chips and Technologies, which plans to have its 386 clones made by Texas Instruments, which has a patent-licensing agreement with Intel. If successful, this defense could eviscerate the value of Intel's patent protection and open the floodgates for other companies to clone Intel products. **********Intel, following the general practice in the semiconductor industry, routinely cross-licenses patents with other large companies to avoid having to haggle over individual patents. But Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., argues that such licenses were never intended to allow unlicensed companies to circumvent Intel patents, a process Intel has branded \"patent laundering.\" **********F. Thomas Dunlap Jr., Intel's general counsel, said the Cyrix math chip and microprocessor were not SGS-Thomson products and were therefore not covered by the cross-licensing agreements. Rather, SGS-Thomson is merely doing the manufacturing as a service, much as Fotomat processes film. \"Does Fotomat sell you the picture?\" Mr. Dunlap asked. **********Lawyers say the court decisions will depend on interpretation of specific language in each company's cross-licensing agreement with Intel. But even if Intel prevails, Cyrix, Chips and Technologies and others might be able to get around the patents by actually selling their designs to the manufacturing company and buying back the finished products for resale. \"That would be tougher,\" conceded Mr. Dunlap, who said Intel would nevertheless argue that these were merely ruses to get around patents. **********On Thursday, Intel asked the Superior Court in Santa Clara County, Calif., to vacate part of an arbitrator's decision that granted Advanced Micro Devices the Intel intellectual property it needs to continue selling its clone of Intel's 386.

If it was urgent, I might have risked the indignities I probably would have faced if the Israeli soldiers stopped me. But I would rather not go through that. I waited until the next day to take her to the doctor.\" **********For a woman who identified herself only as Amneh, who lives not far from the professor in a crowded refugee camp called Al Amari, the curfew that falls each day at 5 P.M. means a nightly struggle with a bedlam of noise and tension. There are 14 members in her family jammed into two meager rooms, and No. 15 is on the way -- a mixed blessing at best, Amneh says.  'Children Are Fighting' **********\"We're afraid that if the children go out to play, they'll be arrested,\" she said. \"So everyone is on top of each other. The children are fighting. We are all nervous. Psychologically, we are not free.\" **********Ramallah, an important Palestinian center six miles north of Jerusalem, is one of several West Bank towns that have been contending with some form of military curfew for nearly two months, with no sign that it is about to end. **********It was imposed on Dec. 1, after a sniper in the abutting town of El Bireh shot and mortally wounded a Jewish settler, Zvi Klein, who lived a few miles away.  Ambush Attacks on Israelis **********Mr. Klein was one of four Israelis killed, along with more than a dozen who were wounded, in recent ambush attacks at night in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. After those incidents, settlers have grown increasingly militant and the army has felt besieged. One of its responses has been to restrict Palestinian movement during a hunt, so far unsuccessful, for the killers. **********At first, Ramallah was under a round-the-clock curfew, for two weeks. Since mid-December the restrictions have been eased. Nonetheless, everyone must be indoors by 5 P.M. and, aside from a few exceptions like doctors and pharmacists, they may not leave until 4 the next morning. **********\"I understand that it is a hardship,\" an Israeli military officer said. But as long as the killers are on the loose, he said, \"the fear is that if we go back to business as usual, we're just going to find ourselves with another person killed.\"  Curfew During Gulf War **********Such restrictions are hardly new. Palestinians were under strict curfew for 10 weeks during the Persian Gulf war, a period of great nervousness throughout Israel as the country came under Iraqi missile attack. **********In the more than four years of the Palestinian uprising, there is virtually no town in the occupied territories that has not experienced curfews. There also are few Palestinians who do not tell of being fined for infractions, of being routinely questioned by soldiers, of being dealt with coarsely at times, of being beaten on occasion. **********But people in Ramallah, a town of 70,000 with a large middle class and a well-educated population, say the current restrictions trouble them more than the \"war curfew\" of a year ago, even though they have more freedom now. **********At that time, they say, it was not surprising that Israel would take measures against Arabs who supported Iraq and were seen as a potential threat. **********This time, however, they say they do not understand the security concerns invoked by Israel. From their vantage point, it amounts to collective punishment, and resentment runs high. Some accuse Israel of trying to make them so frustrated that they will leave the territories entirely. **********What gets to them perhaps even more than major dislocations like arrests, they say, is the daily wear and tear, the erosion of their regular lives. **********Usually, this is not the stuff of high drama. That is the point, Ramallah residents say; distress comes from the relentless forfeiture of small pleasures and privileges. **********\"You lose touch with your own normality,\" said Salim Tamari, a sociology professor at Bir Zeit University, a few miles north of Ramallah. \"You become subject to drudgery and therefore you vegetate.\"  Changes in the Work Day **********For the many here who commute to jobs in Jerusalem, curfew means having to figure out how to leave work early to be in one's house by 5 P.M. For a chocolate factory, it means shutting down the night shift. For taxi drivers, it means a big reduction in the work day. **********For children, it means being off the streets earlier than they like or their parents can stand, and taking their games indoors. One common diversion is playing Israeli soldier, which includes pointing imaginary rifles at one another and shouting, \"Mamnouwa a tajawool!\" -- Arabic for \"curfew is imposed!\" **********And for almost everyone, it means long periods without seeing relatives and friends, thus deepening the isolation that was already considerable under the multiple blows of long military occupation and the repeated strikes imposed by the uprising. **********Mazen Asad, a marketing consultant, lives alone and says he uses the telephone more than ever \"to break the loneliness.\" Hussein Farah Taweel, a journalist, acknowledges that he is not as patient with his children as before. Others say they smoke more than ever and suffer from higher blood pressure. **********\"It seems to me that Israel is trying to put Palestinians in a ghetto,\" said Dr. Youssef Abu Samra, a Ramallah psychologist, who added that the uprising is responsible for its share of frustration, too. **********Professor Abdel-Jawad said: \"You feel that you are worth nothing. You feel that they took a decision without once taking into account your feelings. It's as though you don't exist.\" **********The two weeks of 24-hour curfew that followed the Zvi Klein slaying were especially difficult, residents say. **********They never got advance word about when the restrictions would be temporarily lifted to permit them to replenish supplies, and some learned that they were free to move about only after it was too late. Often, neighborhood stores were empty or reduced to rotting fruits and vegetables. In a winter that has been uncommonly cold, fuel supplies ran low. **********For the last six weeks, curfew has not set in until 5 P.M., and it is therefore easier to arrange one's life. Even so, a dentist here says that almost no patients show up in the afternoon because they are afraid of the most remote chance that they might violate the curfew. **********One problem, many Palestinians acknowledge, is their own uprising, which imposes an austerity of its own. Still, even with the uprising, there are diversions, and for Suhier Azzouni one of them was an aerobics class that used to begin at 5:30 P.M. Now it is gone.  'Longing for Normality' **********In a world of mayhem, it may not seem like much of a loss, Mrs. Azzouni said, but she added: \"It was something that made you feel like life was normal. We are longing for normality again.\" **********A few people defy the rules, risking arrest by running down empty streets to relatives' houses. Most residents are too afraid to try that, though. **********One recent evening, a young woman went to a friend's house for dinner, but she did so, she said, only because there was a visitor from Jerusalem who could drive her home. **********The visitor's car had yellow license plates, signifying that he lived in Israel proper, and so most likely he would not be stopped by soldiers. Cars for West Bank residents have blue or green plates. She would never have ventured forth in a blue-plated car, the woman said, but, after the sort of risk evaluation often done here, she decided she should be safe with a yellow plate. **********But she hated having to think like that. **********\"You don't stop feeling humiliated the whole time,\" she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/23/world/spain-s-tamed-civil-guard-friend-of-wildlife.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 744, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Spain's Tamed Civil Guard: Friend of Wildlife", "print_headline": "Spain's Tamed Civil Guard: Friend of Wildlife", "body_text": " **********A failed coup attempt in 1981, in which it played a leading role, gave the paramilitary Civil Guard of Spain a serious image problem, but today it is winning nothing but praise for its crackdown on the illegal trade in endangered species. **********The picturesque caped uniforms and three-cornered patent leather black hats of the Civil Guard went out a decade ago and its forces, 60,000 strong, now wear more mundane olive green as they pursue missions ranging from fighting terrorists and drug traffickers to traffic patrol. **********But it is the guard's Nature Protection Service that is winning the plaudits of conservationists.

He said the 60 to 80 remaining bears would have disappeared without the Civil Guard's protection. **********The only two brown bears left in the Spanish Pyrenees have full police protection, with Civil Guard squads tracking their whereabouts. **********Serprona also polices environmental legislation and has made thousands of arrests for illegal dumping of toxic materials. \"Basically, we are the official police for anything related to ecology, wildlife and nature,\" said Col. Jose Delgado, who is in charge of the 1,200-member division. **********The Nature Protection Service was first organized to combat illegal hunting and poaching. **********\"We were surprised at first when the General Direction of the Civil Guard called us for advice,\" Mr. Harta Sanchez recalled. Now, he said, the Foundation for the Protection of Wild Animals works hand in hand with Serprona. \"We even go on patrols with them and share our equipment,\" he said. \"Thanks to arrests of bear hunters, people have started to view poachers as criminals.\" **********Other ecology groups were also consulted when the Nature Protection Service squads were created and they continue to work together. The Association for the Defense of Nature helps train the patrols. **********\"We have a very fluid and cordial relationship and work closely with them,\" Mr. Valladares said. \"Before their existence there was no authority in charge for crimes against the ecology.\" **********Santiago Martin of CODA, an umbrella organization of 170 ecology groups, said: \"Initially some ecology groups were a little wary of the Civil Guard, but attitudes have changed. We all cooperate and the results have been extraordinary.\" **********Confiscated animals are sent to recovery centers controlled by Icona, Spain's Conservation Institute, and then returned to the wild or sent to appropiate centers. Already the Madrid and Barcelona zoos are saturated with chimps, other apes and exotic birds confiscated by the Civil Guard squads.

Eventually they will be sent to Barcelona's zoo as a return to the wild is deemed too risky.

He is best known for matching Michael Jackson with Pepsi-Cola and the Rolling Stones with Jovan Musk. **********\"There is an approach when a company asks itself, 'Is there a different way to make a lot of noise?' \" Mr. Coleman said during a recent interview in a memorabilia-filled conference room at the Manhattan headquarters of Entertainment Marketing and Communications International Ltd., of which he is founder and president. \"That is what we're all about.\" **********The project that has perhaps brought Mr. Coleman, who is 41 years old, the most acclaim, not to mention a measure of noisy notoriety, was a special live edition of Fox Broadcasting's \"In Living Color\" on Jan. 26, sponsored by Frito-Lay's Doritos tortilla chips. The stunt lured a hefty 20 million to 25 million viewers from CBS's telecast of the halftime festivities during Super Bowl XXVI. **********The special with a mouthful of a title -- \"The Doritos Zaptime/'In Living Color' Super Halftime Party\" -- was based on an idea of Mr. Coleman's for Super Bowl XXV in 1991: a \"Hammertime Halftime\" that would have featured a performance by the rap musician Hammer on Fox, sponsored by Pepsi. Time constraints, and the Persian Gulf crisis, scotched that idea. **********In the meantime, Pepsi's Roger Enrico, with whom Mr. Coleman had discussed the project, became chairman of Frito-Lay, which, like Pepsi, is owned by Pepsico Inc. So Mr. Coleman proposed the idea again to Mr. Enrico, this time for Frito-Lay, and \"Zaptime\" was born as a promotional vehicle for a new bite-sized version of Doritos. **********In retrospect, Mr. Coleman, Frito-Lay and Fox say they were happy with the special, which marked the first time a network offered counterprogramming to a Super Bowl. Indeed, they are already discussing plans for a halftime special during Super Bowl XXVII next January. **********\"During the most marketing-intensive day of the year, we found a way to cut through the clutter,\" Mr. Coleman said. **********Yet Frito-Lay does not mask its disappointment with several aspects of the show. And that underscores the primary pitfall of entertainment marketing: it involves elements that cannot be controlled by even the most obsessive-compulsive of corporations. **********\"We're pleased, but we're not necessarily satisfied,\" said Steve Liguori, Frito-Lay's vice president of marketing in Dallas. \"We'd like to do better on the second pass.\" **********Perhaps most distressing was a skit called \"Men on Football,\" featuring two cast members of \"In Living Color,\" Damon Wayans and David Alan Grier, portraying flamboyant homosexual characters who ad-libbed provocative statements of a personal nature about the actor Richard Gere and the athlete Carl Lewis. **********That was particularly discomforting for a company like Pepsico, anxious enough about its corporate image to cancel an elaborate, expensive Pepsi campaign starring Madonna when religious fundamentalists threatened a boycott over an unrelated Madonna video clip featuring Christian icons. **********\"The show went a little bit further than we'd hoped,\" Mr. Liguori said. **********\"To work again,\" he added, \"it needs to be different again.\" That means, he continued, that \"we have ruled out\" a second live \"In Living Color\" for next year's stunt. **********Mr. Coleman was philosophical. \"When you're looking to distinguish yourself, you take some risks,\" he said. \"From our perspective, it would have been fine if Fox had 'bleeped' it, but we had no control over that.\" **********Until the next Super Bowl, Mr. Coleman, whose company had revenues last year of $10 million, is busy on other deals, including a music-related project that he hopes to announce later this month.

I hope the Carsey-Werner people know what they're doing.\" **********Mr. Jacobs said the shortfall was not a serious problem. \"I didn't guarantee advertisers a 10,\" he said. \"I sold all the advertising on a scale.\" That means, he said, that the show would not have to give advertisers free commercials -- called make-goods -- to make up for audience they didn't receive, but would rather adjust the payments they receive later. **********Unlike network television, which collects a lot of advertising money before a season even starts, Mr. Jacobs said no advertiser paid in advance for \"You Bet Your Life.\" Instead, the production company, headed by two former \"Cosby Show\" producers, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, put up the production costs in anticipation of collecting ad revenue later. **********Mr. Jacobs contended that \"You Bet Your Life\" would right itself and slowly build popularity. He said it had been hurt mainly by its weakness in the country's two biggest television cities, New York and Los Angeles, and that its national rating has actually climbed, even as its rating in the bigger cities has declined. The show is broadcast on Channel 2 in New York at 7:30 on weeknights. **********Some reviews have praised Mr. Cosby's warmth with the guests and his ad-lib comedy; others suggested that the format, in which the somewhat oddball guests play a quiz game after being interviewed by Mr. Cosby, might be a bit tired. **********\"I learned a lesson from this,\" Mr. Jacobs said. \"It takes a long time to break out a show.\" But he added that \"You Bet Your Life\" had entered a syndicated marketplace short on excitement of any kind. \"There are no sensations,\" he said. **********Indeed, most of the top syndicated shows have shown significant erosion from the period a year earlier. \"It's a fair statement to say very few syndicated shows are doing well,\" Mr. McAlpine said, though he added that it might be too early in the season to draw definitive conclusions. The Critical Impact of Time Slots **********Some of the established shows have clearly suffered more than others. The biggest loser so far is the tabloid magazine show \"Hard Copy,\" which has seen its ratings fall by 20 percent and more in almost all audience age groups. **********But that drop partly reflects one competitive reality of syndicated television: shows that lose favored positions in important cities will surely see their ratings decline. \"Hard Copy\" lost some of its 7 or 7:30 P.M. time slots to \"You Bet Your Life\" and other shows, and it was relegated to times like 4 in the afternoon. **********The year's biggest winner is King World's magazine show, \"Inside Edition,\" which is up about 15 percent over last year. Part of the reason: better time periods. It got some of those good spots that \"Hard Copy\" used to occupy. **********Indeed, one of the crucial factors in whether Mr. Cosby's new effort eventually builds itself into the hit Mr. Jacobs and others thought it would be will be its ability to hold onto the good time periods it has in most cities. **********\"Stations will wait to see how a show does in November,\" Mr. McAlpine said. \"They sometimes will make a change beginning in January. But before you do anything, you've got to have something better to put on. And there obviously isn't much out there that's working.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/12/business/executive-changes-691992.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 89, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP INC., New York, an insurance organization, appointed James S.

Mohamed Farah Aidid, which controls southern Mogadishu and most of the southern part of this dogleg-shaped country, was making plans to swoop into the famine-hit town of Bardera and oust the forces of Gen. Mohammed Siad Hersi Morgan. General Morgan, a son-in-law of former President Mohammed Siad Barre, wanted to ride into Kismayu, the southern port city, and fight General Aidid. **********\"We are afraid that if the Americans come they may say stop the fighting,\" said Abdullah Ahmed Shire, an adviser to General Aidid, after being asked about the planned offensive against Bardera. \"We must be rid of these people because they are the remnants of the Marehan of Siad Barre.\" Deep Clan Animosity **********The offensive has been delayed, reportedly because General Aidid's fighters are stuck in mud some 30 miles east of Bardera. But Mr. Shire's passion against the Marehan, the sub-clan of Mr. Siad Barre, whose 21-year dictatorship ended in 1991, illustrates the ferocity the clan fissures here. **********The clan divisions have overcome other factors that would seem to make Somalia an unlikely candidate for civil war. **********Unlike virtually any other country on the African continent, everyone speaks the same language. The Sunni version of Islam is embraced by more than 90 percent of the people, and almost everyone does the same thing: raises and sells cattle and camels. A Nation's Collapse **********Yet almost 30 years after independence from the British and the Italians, Somalia has become riven by internecine clan politics backed by armories of cold war weapons to the point that it has ceased to exist as a nation. **********\"One can scarcely think of a significant domestic or foreign development in Somali politics since independence that was not influenced to a large degree by an underlying clan consideration,\" David D. Laitin and Said S. Samatar wrote in \"Somalia, Nation in Search of a State.\" \"Ethnicity remains the paramount factor.\" **********The intense clan competition poses the greatest potential threat to the American-led military operation to protect the delivery of food and other humanitarian aid to the country if the Americans are seen to favor some groups over others. Somalis will defend their honor if they feel that it is being impugned. **********\"It is going to take a very enlightened group of officers working with the local people,\" said Stephen Tomlin, the director of the International Medical Corps, a Los Angeles-based agency, who has been here for more than a year and narrowly missed being killed by a bullet aimed at his head by an angry security guard. \"Life for outsiders is very frustrating. You have to drink lots of tea and talk lots of hours at all levels. This is not the American way.\" **********The Somali resilience in tough environmental conditions and their warrior tradition impressed the Europeans who started to colonize Somalia in the last century. **********\"It is wonderful how little we have yet managed to impress the Somalis with respect of our superior power,\" wrote J. W. C. Kirk, the British consul in Zanzibar, as the British started to make inroads into northern Somalia in the 1880's. **********Significantly for the Americans, these characteristics persist. **********Six major clan families account for the vast majority of Somalia's 4.5 million to 6 million people: the Darod, the Hawiye, the Isaak, the Dir, the Rahanwayn and the Digil. Within these clan-families are sub-clans and sub-sub-clans. Mr. Barre was a Darod who belonged to the Marehan sub-clan. During most of his 21 years of rule, the non-Marehans viewed all political and economic decisions as disenfranchising them, a belief that has driven many of the clans who were on the outs during Mr. Barre's rule to claim a larger share of the spoils left behind, and to fight when the other groups resisted. **********The Hawiyes have emerged strongest from the fighting. Mohammed Ali Mahdi, who controls the north side of Mogadishu and little else, and General Aidid are Hawiyes. But Mr. Ali Mahdi is from the Abgal sub-clan, whose members managed to become a merchant class and consider this city theirs. General Aidid is a Habir Gidir from a village in central-western Somalia near the Ethiopian border. **********Humanitarian agencies, contracting out the transport of large amounts of food assistance, say they must be constantly aware of clan allegiances and be as inclusive as possible when hiring staff. **********But people of the Hawiye clan say physical characteristics give no sign to which sub-clan someone belongs to and that except for the inflection on some letters it is almost impossible to tell whether one of their clansmen is a Habir Gidir or an Abgal. **********Even further distinctions exist, and aid agencies must be careful to spread their hiring of guards according to a careful calculation based on the relative power of the various groups. For example, the Habir Gidir includes four sub-sub-clans, and the International Committee of the Red Cross employs members of the two strongest of these sub-sub-clans for transport services."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/08/business/at-work-toward-the-factory-on-a-hill.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Noble", "pub_date": "1992-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 873, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At Work; Toward the Factory on a Hill", "print_headline": "At Work; Toward the Factory on a Hill", "body_text": " **********SOME guys just get lucky. On Tuesday, the candidate who inhales policy thrillers between campaign speeches prevailed over the candidate who might rather have been reading \"A River Runs Through It.\" Otherwise, \"Negotiating the Future: A Labor Perspective on American Business\" (Basic Books) could have been consigned to the testy oblivion of academic conferences, and Irving and Barry Bluestone, the pere et fils team that wrote the book, could have been just a kinship curiosity. **********But now all the might-have-beens are history. \"Negotiating the Future\" was published last week with an ecumenical list of blurbs, including one from \"Bill Clinton, Governor of Arkansas.\" \"We wouldn't mind if the publisher changed his title,\" Irving Bluestone said. **********The book calls for a rehabilitation of the traditional adversary relationship between labor and management into a civil, cooperative new industrial order dedicated to restoring American competitiveness. It is a message that will find a warmer audience in Mr. Clinton's Washington than in a Bush Administration that did not so much bother to oppose labor as simply to render it invisible. **********And it may be a message that business -- especially at companies tired of the wars of attrition that some disputes with labor have become -- will be relieved to hear. Last week, General Motors indicated it was ready to try to find common ground with union leaders as it begins what it hopes will be a march back to viability. Managers will find familiar the book's emphasis on worker empowerment and involvement, even if they pause to gulp over the utopian \"enterprise compact\" that would replace the typical contracts now governing industrial relations. **********\"Negotiating the Future\" is, first of all, a primer on workplace issues in the extraordinary post-World War II economy. Labor and capital's \"glory days\" began in the consumer abstinence of the war. After, a convergence of pent-up demand, rising income and full employment created almost unprecedented abundance. With war-damaged foreign competition turned inward to rebuild, the United States was able to assert economic dominance internationally. **********THE dream lasted a quarter of a century and ended prosaically, in congestion at the gas pumps during the oil crisis of the early 70's. For the 20 years since, the high amperage of the 80's notwithstanding, the long-term American economy has looked ever more vulnerable and volatile. **********The decline of the unionized work force may account for the slighting of labor-management relations in prescriptions for the country's economic troubles. The Bluestones emphasize the dignity and importance of worker-employees. They do not however argue for enlightened self-interest, but in favor of the mutual interests -- \"co-responsibility\" -- of workers and employers in making a high-quality, competitively priced product. **********Their vision is considerably more expansive than the total-quality worker empowerment-employee involvement programs now so fashionable. \"We are talking about strategic decision-making at very high levels,\" Barry Bluestone said. G.M.'s Saturn plant uses aspects of this approach. **********The \"enterprise compact\" is modeled on the Mayflower Compact, a self-conscious break with the past to establish a utopian community, and it may be too much of an errand into the wilderness for some executives. The compact would give workers more than a hand in all kinds of decisions -- pricing, productivity goals, strategic decisions -- that management now reserves to itself, as well as a voice in more traditional labor issues like seniority, layoffs and compensation. \"   Quality    of the product,\" the book says, \"will be a strikeable issue.\" **********Though much of what the Bluestones argue for would happen in the workplace, Government should have a role. They propose labor law reform and re-establishment of programs in the Labor Department gutted during the Reagan-Bush years. Would Barry Bluestone like to run Labor? Hmm. \"Ray Marshall is a possibility,\" he said, referring to President Carter's Labor Secretary. \"I'm looking on with a great deal of interest.\" THE ACADEMIC AND THE UNION GUY **********SOME families came apart much as the nation did during the 1960's. But when Barry Bluestone decided to go South to join the struggle for civil rights, his parents gave him their car. \"In terms of basic social issues, we've always seen eye to eye,\" said Irving Bluestone. **********It is not surprising, then, that both men say differences that arose during their collaboration on \"Negotiating the Future\" were more of nuance than substance. Barry, 47, a political economist at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, contributed his academic perspective; Irving, 75, a retired vice president of the United Automobile Workers union who now teaches industrial relations at Wayne State University, brought his practical experience. \"My father will stress the importance of dignity,\" Barry Bluestone said. \"Dignity is critical, but you can't eat it.\" **********General Motors, a company that has featured large in the Bluestones' lives, could take a lesson from their book. \"They could take a crack at an enterprise compact right now, to see if they can forestall cuts, build product and rebuild market share,\" said Barry Bluestone. Both Bluestones hope G.M. resists pressure from Wall Street to, in Irving Bluestone's words, \"sack and use the axe.\" \"That would be a terrible mistake,\" he said.  \"It's tough as hell to get decent quality out of workers you're killing off one by one.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/07/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-012992.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1992-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; People", "body_text": " *********** David Ogilvy, as expected, retired yesterday as chairman at WPP Group P.L.C., London.

Yeltsin's efforts to curb Government spending, the Russian budget deficit is growing at a rapid rate, undermining the Government's attempt to sign a lending agreement with the International Monetary Fund. **********The rising deficit, described in interviews and public statements this week, was seen as putting pressure on the I.M.F. to accept, at least temporarily, what many officials describe as the Russian reality: that it will take longer for Moscow to carry out economic reforms than earlier anticipated. **********Stepping up efforts to negotiate an agreement, Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s director general, flew here from Washington today for talks aimed at concluding an agreement before Mr. Yeltsin travels to Munich on Tuesday to meet with the leaders of the seven major industrial nations gathered at their annual economic summit. **********An agreement on controlling spending and borrowing by Russia is a key to the I.M.F.'s providing Russia with up to $24 billion in credits to pay for imports and modernize its economy. 'There Is No Time table' **********Mr. Camdessus, whose trip was not announced, joined a high-level I.M.F. team in Moscow all week negotiating with the Russians. I.M.F. officials declined to comment on the talks. A spokesman for the Russian Government's Committee on Foreign Economic Relations said, \"The I.M.F. and the Government are working as fast as they can, but there is no timetable.\" **********Given the rising deficit, the I.M.F. was seen as under pressure to try to reach an initial agreement that would fall well short of the original plan to provide quickly up to $24 billion in foreign assistance. **********After talks between Mr. Camdessus and acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar in Washington two weeks ago, I.M.F. officials said that Russia might get only a $1 billion loan now, to help pay for imports, while talks continued on a broader lending agreement. **********Among other goals, the I.M.F. wants the Russian Government to shrink the budget deficit slowly. The recent run-up means that the Central Bank of Russia must increase its lending to the Government. Doubling of Debt Seen **********Already the Government owes the Central Bank between 500 billion and 1 trillion rubles, or between $5 billion and $10 billion, and the current deficit spending could nearly double this debt over the next several months, Russian Central Bank officials said. **********To make the loans to the Government, the Central Bank must in effect print more rubles. But the concern of Western economists is that more rubles, in turn, can cheapen the currency and raise the inflation rate, particularly when industrial production is falling and the economy is shrinking -- leaving fewer goods that can be purchased with the greater supply of rubles. **********A ruble that is declining in value cannot easily be converted into dollars or other hard currencies at a more or less stable exchange rate, a goal shared by the I.M.F. and the Yeltsin Government. Without a stable ruble, Russia would have difficulty repaying foreign loans and repatriating profits from foreign investments, which Mr. Yeltsin says the nation needs to make the transition to a market economy. **********The ruble's value in relation to the dollar is about 135 rubles to the dollar. Consumer prices in May rose between 11 percent and 14 percent, representing an annual rate of more than 225 percent, the Central Bank said. 'Increasing the Cash Flow' **********\"We are increasing the cash flow -- the supply of rubles -- by 10 percent every month and that is very fast,\" said Serge Ignatiev, vice chairman of the Central Bank. \"I.M.F. officials understand the reason for this but they are very worried. They want it to be less and we want it to be less too. But you have to take into consideration the political situation.\" **********Addressing Parliament today, Mr. Gaidar said that over the next two years \"it will be impossible to radically improve the economic situation,\" the Interfax news agency reported. Earlier this week he said that the budget deficit in May had risen to more than 60 billion rubles, or nearly half of the 123 billion ruble total deficit from January through May. **********Other republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States have also drained away rubles. During the first five months, the Central Bank advanced them 250 billion rubles. \"This is a major problem and we are trying to bring it under control,\" Mr. Ignatiev said. **********I.M.F. officials have said in the past that before the I.M.F. signs a lending agreement, the republics using the ruble as their currency must agree to a single monetary policy, preferably one controlled by the Russian Central Bank that would seek to shrink the supply of rubles. **********The Yeltsin Administration and the Central Bank are also moving toward the adoption of a program to help major state enterprises repay roughly 500 billion rubles in debts that some giant state enterprises owe to others.

But on the topic of jobs, the area is much like many elsewhere in the nation, devastated by the decline of an industry -- coal -- and the consequent reverberations throughout communities and families. **********In Whitesburg, the small town where Ms. Johnson lives and works, and, in 1989, did most of the filming of \"Fast Food Women,\" the waning of the coal industry has led to 40 to 50 percent unemployment. The jobs paid coal miners, almost always men, salaries of $12 to $17 an hour, depending on whether they worked in union or nonunion mines, as well as medical, vacation and retirement benefits. **********The men, naturally enough, want, and wait for, work that allows them to support their families at the level they had come to enjoy. The wives have picked up the pieces. **********\"We had everything,\" Sereda Collier, a fast-food cook whose husband was laid off after 17 years in the mines, tells the off-camera interviewer. \"Well, we didn't have everything,\" she laughs. Her uniform includes a trompe l'oeil-hamburger hat. \"But he had a good job.\" Jobs are in the local service economy, which in Appalachia, as in many post-industrial regions, is not dominated by high- or even medium-paid consulting or other \"knowledge work\" but by fast food. **********\"Ninety-five percent of the applications I take in are female,\" says Marion Clark, co-owner and manager of the local branch of the Druthers restaurant chain. Indeed, few men, are in evidence in Mr. Clark's restaurant, or in the McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken or Pizza Hut outlets where Ms. Johnson took her videocamera. **********As any woman knows, the absence of men in a workplace is one of the danger signs of low wages, and, indeed, the women's pay ranged at the time of filming from the waiter's minimum wage of $2.05 an hour plus tips to 10 or 15 cents over the standard minimum wage of $3.35. The current range, after an increase in 1990, is $2.13 an hour plus tips to $4.25 an hour. **********Like most fast-food industry jobs, these pay no benefits. One company spokesman explains that the teen-agers who generally work behind a fast-food counter aren't looking for a pension and other frills. \"Susie is 16 years old. Her father works in the coal mine,\" says Mike Super, the human resources manager at Druthers' corporate office in Louisville, referring to an archetypal teen-ager. \"Susie doesn't need benefits.\" **********Nor, apparently, are teen-agers looking for excitement, at least at work. Industry efficiency experts have reduced the tasks of making fast-food into irreducible elements. The work is hard, repetitive and, true to its name, fast. It presents employees with few challenges and little hope for advancement, financially or otherwise. \"We are not looking for creativity as much...\" one Druthers executive acknowledges, looking over at a colleague who finishes his thought: \"...as looking for somebody that would be more content with following procedures and practices and getting their sense of achievement from an area other than being creative about it.\" **********It is a strength of the film that Ms. Johnson doesn't turn the company representatives into villains or the women into superheroes. But it is impossible to watch the women's tired testimony without wondering about the social costs of a cheap burger. **********Not one of the film's fast-food women is making more than 25 cents over the current minimum wage. Nellie Kincer had to leave her long-time cooking job at Kentucky Fried Chicken to have an operation she paid for. She earns about $4.50 an hour and puzzles on camera about how she will manage in old age with only her Social Security \"benefits.\" Her children are on their own but she is helping support her elderly parents. After nine years at Druthers, Sereda Collier is supporting her family on roughly $4.40 an hour. The moment her husband gets a job, she says, she's gone. A FILM MAKER FROM COAL COUNTRY **********Anne Lewis Johnson didn't have to look far for the topic of her documentary film \"Fast Food Women.\" One of the fast-food restaurants she filmed was across the street from her office at Appalshop, a filmmaker's collective in Whitesburg, Ky. \"We began noticing that the people working at fast-food restaurants were not kids,\" she said in an interview last week. **********She was given access to restaurants for filming, she thinks, because they are owned by local franchisees and because she and Appalshop -- the name is condensed from Appalachian Workshop -- are fixtures in Whitesburg. \"I wasn't an outsider looking in,\" she said. \"They had seen our work.\" **********Ms. Lewis has been a film- and video-maker for almost 20 years, much of it \"in the coal fields.\" She was an associate director on \"Harlan County U.S.A.,\" the acclaimed film of a miner's strike, and has won awards for her own work, which includes \"On Our Own Land,\" about strip mining, and, with Mimi Pickering, \"Chemical Valley,\" about a toxic waste spill near Charleston, W.Va. **********She allows the women in the film to speak for themselves, without narration. That, to some degree, obscures her own voice, which, if quiet, is nevertheless firm. She has been asked how companies can pay their workers more without having to charge more for a burger. She points out that the burgers have hidden costs because most of the women can't make it without government benefits. \"I help pay for food stamps and health care,\" she said. \"They are charging me more.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/26/world/envoys-report-wave-of-ethnic-cleansing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 276, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Envoys Report Wave of 'Ethnic Cleansing'", "print_headline": "Envoys Report Wave of 'Ethnic Cleansing'", "body_text": " **********Returning here from a one-day trip to the Serbian-controlled Bosnian town of Banja Luka, the co-chairmen of the international peace conference on Yugoslavia said tonight that a new wave of \"ethnic cleansing\" is under way in the region. **********\"We heard rumors,\" said Lord Owen, the European Community's chief negotiator on Yugoslavia and co-chairman of the peace conference. \"We went there, and they were confirmed.

The Saudi Government is also paying the costs of the conference because Russia, which has succeeded the Soviet Union as a co-sponsor of the talks with the United States, cannot afford it. **********Mr. Siegman said the delegates told Prince Saud that they were upset with Saudi Arabia's refusal to vote to rescind the 1975 United Nations resolution equating Zionism with racism. The General Assembly voted overwhelmingly for repeal last month. **********\"They described to us the political difficulty for them to have voted otherwise in the absence of Israeli concessions,\" Mr. Siegman said.

The auctioneer's estimate of the value of the collection is more than $250,000. **********The small and undistinguished renderings of churches, street scenes and buildings were painted in the period before World War I from 1910 to 1914. **********This is not the first sale of Hitler's watercolors, but it has drawn Italy's national Government into a debate, forcing Culture Minister Alberto Ronchey in Rome to order that the paintings may not be exported, and stirring some comment from prominent Jews here, too. \"They are horrible, almost childish; they could have been drawn by a child or an adolescent,\" said Tullia Zevi, president of the Union of the Italian Hebrew Communities, which represents Italy's 35,000-member Jewish minority. But she said: \"I would prefer that no big sensation be raised about this because with this atmosphere in Europe, I don't think it should be. We have enough problems.\" **********Hitler lived in Vienna from 1908 to 1913. Despite artistic pretensions, he twice failed to win a place at the city's Academy of Fine Arts. To make a living he painted postcards and advertisements. But no one, not even the people selling them, credits his watercolors with much artistic value. 'No Artistic Value' **********\"They are rather wishy-washy postcard views of Vienna and Munich,\" said Stephen Cristea, the British auctioneer who is to conduct the sale. \"They are reasonably decorative. I might cross the street to look at them out of curiosity, but I wouldn't go any further.\" **********Before he died last week, the Italian art historian Carlo Giulio Argan dismissed them, too, saying, \"Their only value lies in the fact that they show how a dictator can also be an imbecile.\" **********And Giorgio Morales, the Mayor of Florence, where the watercolors were kept for many years, said they had \"absolutely no artistic value.\" **********But that is not the point at issue. **********At the insistence of Mr. Morales and Florence's director of culture, Pierluigi Baldini, the Italian Government issued an injunction this week saying the buyer of the paintings may not remove them from Italy. The order also empowers the authorities to buy them back at the price they fetch at auction. Germans Are Not Amused **********\"We cannot accept that this collection of watercolors be broken up and bought by a neo-Nazi group, which is the worst hypothesis, or an American millionaire,\" Mayor Morales said at a news conference in Florence on Tuesday. **********\"It's clear we were worried that these watercolors could be taken to Germany and shown in an exhibition which would prompt political initiatives,\" Mr. Baldini said. **********Even that is disputed. \"Any neo-Nazi who had one of these in his hand would be bored out of his mind,\" Mr. Cristea, the auctioneer, said, pointing out that the paintings hailed from a period long before Hitler aspired to dominate the world through Nazism. **********The debate has drawn in German officials, too. **********Citing the \"huge historic interest\" of the paintings, Mr. Morales suggested that instead of being sold, the Hitler collection should be placed on permanent exhibition in the Uffizi in Florence, one of the world's most celebrated art galleries, alongside masterpieces of the Italian Renaissance. **********The idea elicited a response from the German Minister of Culture, Ulrich Roloff-Momin. \"This is an intolerable provocation to good taste and to all victims of fascism,\" he wrote to Mr. Morales in a letter made public in Germany today. How They Got to Italy **********Displaying the watercolors in the Uffizi, Mr. Roloff-Momin said, would turn the gallery into a \"place of pilgrimage\" for neo-Nazis. Of all the watercolors, possibly the most contentious in this sense is a depiction of the Hofbrauhaus in Munich, said to have been the same beer hall that was used as a gathering place for the Nazis in the early days of their movement. **********By tonight, the Mayor of Florence had apparently gotten the message, transmitted not only by Mr. Roloff-Momin, but also by Jewish groups in Germany and Italy. Whatever happened, he said, the collection would not be displayed in the Uffizi. **********The association with Hitler is particularly embarrassing for Italy, since Mussolini led the country into a wartime alliance with the German dictator. **********The collection of watercolors is being sold by Imelde Riviero, the sister of the late Rodolfo Riviero, an Italian official who earned the nickname 007 of the Art World through his efforts to track down looted Italian art in Germany and Austria after World War II. **********There are several versions of how he came upon the Hitler watercolors. One is that the wife of Martin Bormann, Hitler's personal secretary, gave them to him. Another is that he found them hidden behind a bunker. **********Mr. Riviero bequeathed the watercolors to his sister, and they were left for many years at the Uffizi for safekeeping. They are now on display at the Trieste hotel, where the auction is to be held. **********Nobody is taking too much notice of them, Mr. Cristea, the auctioneer, said. \"It's as if people were ashamed of being seen looking at them.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/06/business/new-scandal-from-old-issue-on-wall-st.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1992-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1056, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Scandal From Old Issue on Wall St.", "print_headline": "New Scandal From Old Issue on Wall St.", "body_text": " **********A new Government case charging the existence of a large insider trading ring has raised fresh doubts about whether the behavior on Wall Street has really changed despite years of sensational insider trading prosecutions, tougher securities laws, larger prosecutorial staffs and better computer surveillance of the financial markets. **********The Securities and Exchange Commission filed insider trading charges on Thursday against seven corporate executives and investors, including a former director of Bear, Stearns & Company who is the son-in-law of Henry Ford 2d, and a co-founder of the Revlon cosmetics empire. **********In the audacity and scope of what it charges, the case has surprised many lawyers and securities experts. The Government says that the wrongdoing occurred at the end of the 1980's, at the height of the widely publicized prosecutions against inside traders on Wall Street, and that it involved at least $23 million in illegal profits. **********\"It shows that insider trading will always be with us because, by definition, it involves a combination of very high potential profit and relatively small risk of detection compared to other crimes,\" said Prof. John C. Coffee Jr., who has taught criminal and securities law at Columbia University. **********William R. McLucas, head of the S.E.C.'s division of enforcement, said the case showed \"that there are people out there who don't think they will get caught, despite the high-profile arrests and the advances that we have made.\" **********And lawyers in New York and Wall Street officials said prosecutors were preparing another significant but unrelated criminal case involving trades of junk bonds in the late 1980's and early 1990's. **********It must be said that prosecutors and other experts say that the number of insider trading transactions has probably declined somewhat since the 1980's, but not because of any fundamental change in attitudes or because of the increase in prosecutions. Rather, it is thought, the crucial factor was the financial reality at the end of an era. **********The number of corporate mergers and acquisitions, which provided great troves of highly valuable confidential information, has plummeted in recent times. And the options market, a traditional haven to invest heavily on insider information by betting on future prices and reaping large profits on relatively small stock price fluctations, has declined in volume. As a result, prosecutors and officials at the stock exchanges say the number of referrals of suspicious trading activity from the markets to the Government has declined by 30 percent or more in recent years. Some Problem Areas **********Many problems remain for law-enforcement officials, however. For one, it is still difficult to police off-shore accounts like the one that the Government says played a role in the current case. And despite all the computer advances in monitoring the markets for suspicious trades, insider trading remains a crime that cannot be proved without the assistance of at least one of the culprits. **********Proving the crime presents a prosecutorial paradox: Government lawyers must depend almost entirely on confessions from people who profited from deliberate and repeated deceptions. **********The cases are so nettlesome to develop that the hundreds of lawyers with the Securities and Exchange Commission filed only 43 of them last year nationwide, the most they have ever brought in a single year, but a minuscule number considering the billions of stock transactions and hundreds of suspicious trades that are referred to the commission from the stock exchanges. **********The case filed Thursday had been in prosecutors' hands for years; officials at the New York Stock Exchange said today that they had begun to raise red flags with the S.E.C. about the trades in question in the middle of 1987, even though the S.E.C. contends that the defendants continued to execute improper trades through 1989. **********Federal investigators say the case broke open only after they applied enough pressure to get the cooperation of one defendant, Edward R. Downe Jr., the former vice director of Bear, Stearns and the husband of Charlotte Ford, the auto heiress. Mr. Downe, they said, insisted at first he had done nothing improper. **********Another defendant, Fred R. Sullivan, former chairman of Kidde Inc., has offered to settle charges against him by paying $58,000. The other defendants in the case have either denied the charges or could not be reached for comment Previous Scandals **********The case suggests that some wealthy investors may not have been affected by the trading scandals that brought down Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and tarnished Kidder, Peabody, and sent to jail Wall Street financiers like Ivan F. Boesky and Michael R. Milken and investment bankers like Dennis B. Levine and Martin A. Siegel. **********The case demonstrates, too, that the New York regional office of the S.E.C., which had been rudderless and deeply demoralized a few years ago, has emerged under a new regional head from the shadows of the larger Washington office to take a leading role in enforcing the securities laws. **********For nearly a year, the office, the largest of the commission's outposts, has been headed by Richard H. Walker, a Manhattan litigator who had known Mr. McLucas from their days together as classmates at Temple University School of Law.  Competitive Offices **********Cases are typically assigned randomly to the branch office, and they often wind up with the office that first developed leads. Still, the New York office has always labored under the shadow of the much larger Washington headquarters, which has significantly greater resources and throughout the last decade has handled the largest cases. Also, when it comes to attracting new talent, the New York office is in friendly competition with the nearby Manhattan office of the United States Attorney, which often has a better pick of the brightest young lawyers and law students. **********In 1987, the S.E.C.'s New York office was described as deeply demoralized and rudderless under the direction of Kathleen A. Warwick, an outsider with little securities-enforcement experience whose confrontations with career officials led to an exodus of top talent, and who was ultimately pressured from Washington to resign from the agency. **********Agency officials said that Mr. Walker's predecessor, Lawrence Iason, a defense lawyer now back in private practice, had made some strides in stabilizing the office. Mr. Iason, a friendly low-key lawyer, was described by other officials as taking a less aggressive approach in prosecuting cases than Mr. Walker did."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/06/business/us-puts-a-200-punitive-tax-on-white-wines-from-europe.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1992-11-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1065, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Puts a 200% Punitive Tax On White Wines From Europe", "print_headline": "U.S. Puts a 200% Punitive Tax On White Wines From Europe", "body_text": " **********After years of skirmishing over European farm subsidies, the Bush Administration fired the first shot today in what may become a trade war, announcing that in 30 days it would begin collecting a 200 percent import tax on all still white wines from the European Community. **********The new taxes cover popular wines like Chablis from France, which currently sells for about $13 a bottle; riesling from Germany, about $10, and verdicchio from Italy, about $9. In addition to about $270 million in wine, about $30 million worth of cooking oil and pet food ingredients will also be taxed. Sparkling wines, including Champagne, are not affected. **********While the taxes would triple the prices that consumers pay, the impact is not likely to be visible until sometime next year. Importers of wine, French Cognac and other distilled spirits have been stocking their warehouses in anticipation of the trade war, fearful that if they have to sell the wine at higher prices many customers may turn elsewhere -- perhaps to the white wines of California, Australia and South America.  Current Shipments Not Affected **********Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said the delay before the taxes were actually collected would allow for the arrival of wine already bought by American importers and would allow time for further negotiations. With one exception, similar delays in the past have not resulted in negotiated settlements and the United States has gone ahead and collected the punitive taxes. **********But there is added pressure for a settlement this time because the amount of money and the prestige of the exports involved are greater than in previous disputes. **********The United States decided to single out white wines because France, the European Community's leading shipper of white wine to the United States, with sales of $125 million last year, has been the most steadfast opponent of compromise in the subsidies dispute. France's farmers are a potent political force and general elections are scheduled for the spring. **********The American decision today means a wine importer in the United States who buys a bottle of European wine for $5 will have to pay a $10 tax, in addition to the Federal excise tax of 7 cents a bottle that is already in place. Retailers usually charge about 87 percent more than the importer's price of the wine, industry executives say, so a bottle for which an importer now pays $5.07 now is likely to be sold by a retailer for about $9.50. When the importer is paying $15.07, the retailer is likely to sell it for about $28.25. **********Harry F. Mariani, the president and chief operating officer of the Banfi Products Corporation, a large wine importer in Old Brookville, L.I., said prices could climb this winter as white wine stocks dwindle. \"Whoever has some white wine left will probably raise the price at the end, even if they didn't pay the tax,\" he said. Dispute Over Subsidies **********Mrs. Hills also released a list of $1.7 billion worth of manufactured goods, including perfume and construction materials, on which the United States may also impose taxes. **********The Bush Administration's willingness to impose punitive tariffs rather than find a compromise with the European Community's insistence on continued subsidies is a sign of the Government's determination to punish countries that do not open their markets to American exports. **********Over the last 30 years, the United States has repeatedly complained that European farm subsidies unfairly reduce demand for American exports. The disintegration of the Soviet Union and its diminution as a military threat have freed the United States to take a more aggressive stand. **********Tran Van Thinh, the European Community's Ambassador to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the organization in Geneva that oversees world trade, said Wednesday that the broad trade talks that have been struggling for six years to try to reduce trade barriers could be severely hurt if the United States went ahead with the taxes. **********The European Community challenged the legality of imposing import taxes without GATT's permission. \"In effect, this constitutes an illegal position according to GATT rules,\" Frans Andriessen, the European Community's External Relations Commissioner, said today. The foreign ministers of the community's 12 members will meet on Monday in Brussels. **********Two GATT panels have ruled that the European Community has violated world trade rules with its indirect subsidies for soybeans, rapeseed and other oilseeds. But the European Community has used its veto to block American efforts to get GATT approval for its retaliatory taxes.  Europeans Refused Arbitration **********Robert E. Hudec, the Melvin C. Steen Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota, said the Bush Administration appeared to be on strong legal ground in imposing duties. **********\"If you offer to arbitrate the action you propose to take and the other side turns you down, then under international law you have the right to take the action,\" he said. **********Agriculture Minister Jean-Pierre Soisson of France called today for the European Community to raise taxes on an equal amount of American goods. Mrs. Hills said the community would have no legal basis for such action but refused to say what the United States would do if the European Community did retaliate. **********Mrs. Hills said she had not discussed today's move with any representative of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the President-elect. She noted that Mr. Clinton had emphasized on Wednesday that President Bush remained in charge until Inauguration Day. Mr. Clinton strongly supports the strategy of punishing nations that do not open their markets. **********The American action today comes after the failure on Tuesday night of talks in Chicago between Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan and Ray MacSharry, the European Community's Agriculture Commissioner. Mr. MacSharry stepped down today as the community's negotiator on GATT agricultural issues. **********After France, Italy is the largest exporter of white wine to the United States, with $97 million in sales, followed by Germany with $36 million and Portugal with $5.5 million. **********Mrs. Hills identified the 251 wines on the list today as white wines. But as the French Embassy here pointed out to her office this afternoon, several of the wines, such as Sancerre, are also available as red wines. The red wines also appear to be subject to the taxes, given the wording of Mrs. Hills's official order this morning."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/16/business/company-news-e-ii-holdings-files-prepackaged-chapter-11-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "E-II HOLDINGS FILES PREPACKAGED CHAPTER 11 PLAN", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; E-II HOLDINGS FILES PREPACKAGED CHAPTER 11 PLAN", "body_text": " **********E-II Holdings Inc., which owns Samsonite luggage and McGregor men's wear, filed under the bankruptcy laws yesterday after trying to restructure its debt for almost two years.

Baker 3d and Israel's new Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin. The official said he was now hopeful that an arrangement for loan guarantees could be worked out in a way that would \"match their needs as well as ours.\" **********Israel is seeking $10 billion in guarantees from Washington to help it provide housing and jobs for immigrants from the former Soviet Union.  Election-Season Bonus **********The conclusion and announcement of a deal would be left for a meeting between Mr. Rabin and President Bush that is expected to take place at Mr. Bush's Kennebunkport, Me., home some time early next month. In an election year, Mr. Bush would presumably like to gain the greatest political benefit he can with Jewish voters by announcing a deal with Mr. Rabin at his side. **********Mr. Baker seems to be trying to set up the basis of that deal on this trip, before his expected resignation as Secretary of State and move to the White House to help steer Mr. Bush's re-election campaign and shape overall Administration policies. **********An announcement of Mr. Baker's job switch could come as soon as the end of this trip on Sunday. After his swing around the Middle East, Mr. Baker will fly to Manila for a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. **********Neither Israeli nor American officials would provide details of the loan guarantee arrangement they are working on. But they said that in broad outline it involves Israel announcing its intention to substantially limit all settlement activity in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as a condition for the American guarantees. **********The United States is apparently ready to allow the Israelis to finish a certain number of housing units under construction in the territories, as well as permit a limited degree of \"natural growth\" in existing settlements in the Jerusalem area and the Jordan River valley. Mr. Rabin considers both of these security regions where some building must be allowed.  Calculus of Vital Interests **********The Jordan valley divides Israel and Jordan, and the Israelis have military installations there. Jerusalem has been reunited as the Israeli capital since East Jerusalem was captured from the Jordanians in the 1967 war. Every Israeli Government has insisted on building in and around Jerusalem to emphasize that the city will not again be divided. **********Natural growth would involve either adding rooms to existing houses or constructing roads and bridges to accommodate growing families. Israeli and American officials stress that the exact numbers in these categories was still to be determined. **********Mr. Rabin's officials are still sorting through the records of the previous Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, trying to get a grip on what sort of building commitments it had undertaken in the West Bank and Gaza, Israeli officials said. The officials added that the records were a mess and that there was a lot of activity they were not yet fully aware of. **********While Mr. Baker and Mr. Bush had told the previous Government that they would allow it to finish housing units under way in exchange for loan guarantees, they were strict on the numbers involved and the limits on natural growth. Given Mr. Rabin's intention to shift spending away from the territories, the Bush Administration is ready to be somewhat more flexible with him. **********Today, the Prime Minister had his Finance Minister, Avraham Shochat, and the Governor of the Bank of Israel, Jacob Frenkel, brief Mr. Baker on the general economic policies of his Government. The officials made clear that Israel intends to transfer as many resources as possible from the occupied territories to towns and factories inside the nation's pre-1967 boundaries. **********Speaking to reporters after that briefing, Mr. Baker said: \"We just had a full discussion with our colleagues about the reordering of national priorities that the new Government is undertaking. I hope and believe that I have made it clear to the Prime Minister and his colleagues that President Bush and this Administration in the United States attach a very high priority to the absorption of immigrants to Israel.\" **********Nevertheless, American officials say, what is still needed is wording that will demonstrate that the Bush Administration is maintaining its position that settlements do not \"promote peace\" while at the same time allowing enough of a loophole for Mr. Rabin to finish a certain number of houses previously contracted and to augment those settlements he considers vital to national security. **********Mr. Baker and Mr. Rabin were discussing the precise wording of that diplomatic formula tonight.  Considering Palestinians, Too **********Such a formula also has to be one that the Palestinians can live with. Palestinian leaders say they cannot go on cooperating with Washington if it is perceived to be subsidizing Israeli settlement building. **********Mr. Baker and other American officials met today with a Palestinian delegation led by Faisal al-Husseini and Hanan Ashrawi. During their talks, the Secretary apparently told the Palestinians that whatever deal he worked out with Mr. Rabin would involve broad limits on settlement building, with some small exceptions. **********He seems to have urged them to keep their eye on the broad limits and not get caught up in the exceptions, inasmuch as Mr. Rabin is clearly shifting Israeli priorities. **********Mrs. Ashrawi, speaking to reporters right after the talks, signaled that the Palestinians had gotten the message and were apparently willing to tolerate such a deal, provided that it really does involve a near-total freeze on settlements and provided that the Americans insure that none of their funds would be spent in the occupied territories. **********Mrs. Ashrawi said the Palestinians would not demand \"a total settlements freeze before negotiations\" with the Rabin Government, just as they did not insist on such a freeze as a condition for talks with Mr. Shamir. They would prefer a freeze, she said, but are realistic about the situation. **********She added that the Palestinians could tolerate a granting of loan guarantees by Washington and would not walk out of the peace talks \"if the U.S. insures that its funds are not used for settlement activities and has the ability to adequately monitor\" Israeli spending. **********The loan guarantees that Israel is seeking are not grants. They involve the United States' guaranteeing repayment of loans Israel takes out from private banks in the event of an Israeli default on those loans. The guarantees will enable Israel to get loans at favorable interest rates. **********The cost to Washington would be several hundred million dollars that the Treasury would set aside to cover potential defaults, with the exact amount depending on the total of the Israeli loans."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/09/world/siege-is-resumed-in-bosnian-town.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1992-09-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1063, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SIEGE IS RESUMED IN BOSNIAN TOWN", "print_headline": "SIEGE IS RESUMED IN BOSNIAN TOWN", "body_text": " **********Serbian forces that lifted their siege of the Muslim-controlled Bosnian town of Gorazde late last month have returned to the offensive, contending that the withdrawal led to Muslim killings of Serbian civilians. **********At an international peace conference in London last month, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs agreed to lift the siege of Sarajevo and other Bosnian cities like Gorazde. Dusko Kornjaca, the commander of Serbian militia forces attacking Gorazde, said in an interview in this village 12 miles from the Gorazde front that his troops pulled back from Gorazde on Aug. 27, the day the London conference ended. **********\"We gave up 25 percent of the territory we were holding around Gorazde, but it was too costly,\" he said. \"The Muslims are massacring us and every Serb house and every Orthodox church on the left bank of the River Drina is burning. So now we are fighting back to retake the town.\"  River Divides Armies **********Shortly after he spoke, the sound of shelling and machine-gun fire could be heard coming from Gorazde, where the prewar population of 40,000 was about 70 percent Muslim and 30 percent Serb. The Drina divides the town, with Serbian forces gathered on the southeast bank and Muslims holding the town's center on the northwest bank. **********Because of the danger of going through the front lines around Gorazde it was impossible to independently verify many of the statements of Mr. Kornjaca, a fiercely nationalist Serb with a clear interest in giving the most damning account possible of Muslim actions. **********The Serbian warlord's account of events in Gorazde broadly coincided with newspaper photographs and reports now appearing in Belgrade, including interviews with Serbs from Gorazde who have made their way to Serbia after an apparently harrowing journey. The Belgrade press is not immune from the Serbs' nationalist fervor, but portions of their accounts were based on reports of a recent United Nations humanitarian convoy into the town. **********But regardless of the accuracy of the reports, they are widely believed and have solidified Serbian hatred of the Muslims, suggesting that any diplomatic commitments to wind down the five-month war in Bosnia may be very difficult to apply on the ground. **********It appears that on Aug. 27, Serbian forces in the hills above Gorazde on the southeast bank of the Drina began to pull back, lifting a siege described as having caused greater deprivation and civilian suffering than in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Whether this was to honor commitments made in London or whether it was a military necessity is unclear; Kemal Knijun, the Muslim Mayor of Gorazde, has asserted that the besieging forces were swept off the hills by a Muslim counterattack. **********The accounts suggest that at about the same time, a convoy of several hundred Serbian inhabitants of Gorazde, particularly from the hills on the southeast bank who had effectively lost their protection, began to travel north by bus, truck and car toward the Serbian-controlled town of Rogatica, about 10 miles away. The Serbs say that along the road, close to the village of Kukavice, they were attacked by Muslim forces. **********\"About 300 people were killed by Muslim machine-gun fire on the road, and who knows if they will ever be buried,\" Milomir Matovic said in an interview with Vecernje Novosti, a Belgrade daily. \"I lost my own 11-year-old son, Dalibor.\" **********Another Serb, Otas Kosoric, said in a newspaper interview that the Serbian command had ordered the Serbian inhabitants to leave Gorazde \"after the Serbian troops moved back following the London Conference.\" But he said that many of the Serbian civilians had been killed before they reached safety. **********Mr. Kornjaca, who like many Serbian warriors here wears the long, shaggy beard that was favored by Serbian guerrillas known as chetniks during World War II, said that \"events in Gorazde show that the London Conference did not help at all. We tried to be fair but the Muslims swept through and burned everything.\" **********Referring to another promise made by Mr. Karadzic in London, the assembling of heavy weapons under United Nations supervision, Mr. Kornjaca was emphatic. \"We are ready to give up our heavy guns, but only if the other side does the same,\" he said. \"And it is now clear that they will not.\"  Bishop Honors Troops **********Mr. Kornjaca, a 32-year-old physician with no formal military rank but all the trappings of power in this village that serves as his headquarters, spoke after attending a Sunday service in the Orthodox Christian church here. After the service he was the guest of honor at a lunch offered by the bishop, Nikolaj Mrdja, at which churchmen and soldiers repeatedly toasted each other. **********Throughout the interview, he referred to the \"ex-state of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\" making clear that he does not accept the Government of President Alija Izetbegovic, which was recognized by the international community in April. Rattling through a list of the percentage of Serbs living in major Bosnian towns, he said that the United States made an enormous mistake in recognizing Bosnia and Herzegovina while failing to secure guarantees for the roughly 1.4 million ethnic Serbs living there. **********\"We want self-governing cantons for the Serbs, Muslims and Croats of Bosnia, but the Muslims don't accept this because they want the whole state,\" he said. **********Throughout the village, Mr. Kornjaca was embraced by other soldiers, many of whom addressed him as \"Serb brother.\" He says he has 50,000 men under his command and no longer receives any help from Belgrade. **********This power is being channeled into what Mr. Kornjaca several times described as \"the imperative of stopping Islam in Europe.\" **********Fingering the crosses around his neck, he added: \"In London we wanted to show we were prepared to take steps to stop the war. But what has happened in Gorazde since then shows this war will not be over for a generation.\" **********A map with the article gave an incorrect location for the village nearest the site where Serbs say Serbian civilians were massacred by Muslim fighters.

They had also intended to go to the gate of a Beijing prison to request permission to visit dissidents who are known to be inside. **********\"They engaged themselves in activities inconsistent with their status,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry said this afternoon. \"The Beijing Municipal Public Security Department has therefore ordered them to leave China immediately.\" **********The incident underscores China's fundamental quandary in trying to address human rights issues. A Shift in Strategy **********After the 1989 crackdown, in which hundreds of protesters were killed and thousands wounded, Beijing's initial response was to avoid the issue of human rights and accuse critics of interfering in China's internal affairs. Then just over a year ago, the Government switched strategies and expressed a willingness to receive human rights delegations and discuss human rights issues. **********People's Daily has thus been full of tributes to the importance of human rights -- and sympathy for homeless Americans, who it says lack the human right to shelter. But the Chinese are clearly concerned that foreigners, like the Canadian M.P.'s, will use China's willingness to discuss human rights to embarrass the Government. **********The Canadians made no effort to keep their plans to lay a wreath secret. They invited reporters to go along, speaking on telephone lines that are known to be tapped, and presumably there were urgent meetings among Chinese State Security and Foreign Ministry officials about how to deal with the problem. **********In September, guards jostled three members of the United States Congress who tried to unfurl a memorial banner at Tiananmen Square. The three were denounced but not expelled. Canadian's Reaction **********\"If this is the kind of human rights the Chinese demonstrate to legislators of the Canadian Parliament, then God help the people of China,\" Geoffrey Scott, one of the legislators, said after arriving in Hong Kong late this afternoon, The Associated Press reported from Hong Kong. The other M.P.'s were Svend Robinson, a New Democrat from British Columbia, and Beryl Gaffney, a Liberal from Ontario. Mr. Scott is a Conservative from Ontario. **********The Canadian Ambassador, Fred Bild, declined this evening to comment on the matter, but a spokesman for the Canadian Embassy said Mr. Bild had been summoned to the Foreign Ministry to be informed of the expulsion and had responded that he was unaware of any action by the legislators that was illegal. The embassy spokesman said he did not know if there would be any further protest from Canada. Protection of Copyrights **********In another issue involving relations with the West, the Chinese Government warned today that it is considering imposing retaliatory duties totaling $1.2 billion against American products, if the United States imposes duties against Chinese goods. The warning, in the form of a report this evening from the official New China News Agency, comes as Chinese and American negotiators are about to hold a final round of trade talks in Washington at the end of this week. **********If China and the United States have not reached agreement by Jan. 16 on measures to protect American copyrights and other intellectual property, then Washington is prepared to levy retaliatory duties against a variety of Chinese exports. So far, China offers little meaningful protection to American books, computer software and chemicals, and even President Bush's autobiography has been sold in pirated editions in Beijing. **********American industry groups estimate that China obtains $300 million worth of American software and $118 million worth of sound and video recordings without paying for them. **********China has taken steps to address American concerns, but by American reckoning the steps are too little and too late. The Chinese protest that protection of intellectual property takes time, and that anyway it is customary for developing countries to be somewhat cavalier about foreign copyrights and patents. **********\"As the U.S. retaliatory date approaches, the Chinese side is also considering counter-retaliatory measures against the U.S. by levying retaliatory duties on some of the U.S. commodities,\" the New China News Agency declared.

Now a British company has developed a digital \"camera on a chip\" that can be integrated into these systems to provide an instant visual verification when an alarm is sounded. **********The system, called TVX, was developed by Edinburgh University and is produced by Automated Security Holdings P.L.C. It combines a camera and lens on one chip the size of a postage stamp. As many as 24 chips can be retrofitted onto an existing alarm system, providing coverage of a broad area. An infrared strobe light allows the cameras to function in darkness without alerting intruders. **********When an alarm is tripped, the TVX camera produces four digital video images of the area in rapid succession. Within seconds, these images are processed by a video data compression device, which allows them to be sent to the monitoring station over ordinary telephone lines. Before the last picture is received, the compressor is automatically calling the station using its built-in modem. At the monitoring station, the images are received on an ordinary personal computer, where they can be evaluated in sequence or stored on disk. **********\"The application is a niche that basically has never been developed or even looked at by the Japanese,\" said Tom Buffet, Automated Security's chairman and chief executive. This is because Japanese digital camera development stems from video camcorders, which require color and a level of definition far too costly to build into a tiny camera on a chip suitable for alarm systems, he said. **********Visual verification allows security personnel to determine whether an alarm was tripped by a wandering cat or an intruder. Since the images can be stored, they can provide evidence to aid prosecutors. The cameras can also provide verification of fire alarms at remote sites and could be used for other verification tasks, like identifying employees at magnetic card entries. The unit is small enough to be mounted on a police officer's badge as a mobile camera. **********Automated Security has delivered more than 50 TVX systems in Europe, with another 300 on order, and the company is setting up subsidiaries to distribute it in the United States.

To be sure, no one here knew they were missing it. But this week, in a gesture of self-interested humanitarian aid, the National Peanut Council of America presented this hungry nation with its first peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich. **********The formal tasting took place at the Exhibition of National Economic Achievements, a centerpiece of gilded fountains, giant airships and other monuments of the Soviet era. The first verdict by a troupe from the Moscow Children's Theater was that peanut butter -- or arakhisovoye maslo -- was \"on the salty side.\" No one complained about it sticking to the roof of his mouth. **********The mission of American peanut farmers, shellers and producers here is double-edged. The delegation came here with enough peanut butter (30 tons) for 500,000 sandwiches, which will be donated to needy children through the Moscow Children's Fund. But they also brought another one and a half tons to be tested at stores around Moscow as a trial balloon to see if Russia could one day become a market for America's surplus peanuts. **********\"We thought it was a fortunate confluence of events,\" said Wayne Lord, president of Southco Commodities, of Georgia. \"They have a need for food supplies, and if ever there was a market for peanut butter, it would be here, since it's a substitute for meat, at 25 percent of the cost.\" 98 Planeloads of Aid **********Since February, when the first C-5 transport planes unloaded military rations left over from the Persian Gulf war, the United States Government has sent in 57 planeloads of food, 41 planes of medical supplies for a total of 4,450 metric tons of humanitarian aid to the republics of the former Soviet Union. **********Now, the emphasis of United States help to Russia and the other former Soviet republics is shifting away from donations of food toward offers of technical support and assistance, aimed at creating a market economy, but also new markets for American investors. **********\"The humanitarian aid stage is now dropping off, and what we want to do now is create an atmosphere for future investment,\" said one aide to Richard Armitage, who is the deputy coordinator of aid to the old Soviet republics. **********\"What we hear from the Russians now is: 'Thanks for the sausage. Now we need help setting up a sausage factory,' \" the aide, who asked not to be identified, said.  Food Not Now a Problem **********The initial batch of American aid was intended mainly as a show of support for President Boris N. Yeltsin's economic reform program. Now, after a closer look, Washington is coming to the conclusion that Russia's food shortages are not as acute as their perennial problems of distribution. \"There are pockets of need, but our general assessment is that food right now is not a problem,\" the aide said. **********Instead, the latest visitors to Moscow, ranging from Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger to former President Richard M. Nixon, have emphasized the need to make the economic climate in Russia more amenable to long-term investment rather than outright government-to-government aid. **********After the first rush of bulk donations of canned goods and used clothing, private aid projects have also become more focused. Several United States hospitals have set up relationships with Russian medical institutions, sending in American doctors and nurses to set up specialized clinics, and providing for Russian medical personnel to get advanced training in the United States. Business schools and other training courses are also offering to help prepare specialists in specific fields. **********The National Peanut Council's trip here came, not coincidentally, after a record peanut crop in the United States last year produced a 75,000 metric ton surplus. If the peanut growers, with their Moscow market survey, can prove that Russians have a taste for peanut butter, then they will try to persuade Washington to include it on the list of surplus foods eligible to be sent overseas as aid. **********Other American farm groups have been here recently. Besides the wheat and grain industries, which have been doing business here for years, the California Dry Bean Board has been through on an exploratory mission, armed with a donation of 30 tons of beans, while an American rice grower not long ago signed a contract to sell 15,000 tons of rice to a Central Asian republic, according to Agriculture Department officials. **********Last year, Billy Hatcher, a peanut farmer from Baconton, Ga., went to Eastern Europe as part of delegation sent to examine the possibilities for American peanuts. Concluding that Western Europe had already sewed up that market, he advised the National Peanut Council to move further east. **********\"I told them, the Soviet Union, that's where we need to go because they are in need,\" he said. \"It is a good time to get started.

Hills, said of the negotiations before leaving Washington on Friday. \"But the agenda is awfully long, and I don't think they will get done this weekend.\" **********In meetings this week in Washington, negotiators from the three countries made some progress on several of the most complex and politically sensitive topics left, Mexican and United States trade officials officials said. Corn Is What It's About **********On agriculture, where Mexico has sought to balance the potentially devastating effects of foreign competition on its heavily subsidized corn farmers against its desire for easier access to United States vegetable and citrus markets, one Mexican official said the three parties were close to agreement. **********Specifically, Mexican officials said they were offering a quota for corn imports that would begin at 2.5 million tons each year and increase by 3 percent annually. Tariffs on other corn imports would be reduced over 15 years, but even that would involve a major transition for the country's 2.4 million corn growers, most of whom farm small plots for subsistence. The Government now pays those farmers about double the world market price for their corn. **********In return for its concessions on corn and other basic grains, Mexico is to receive greater access to United States markets for its citrus, vegetables and sugar. But one Mexican official acknowledged that even the considerable increase in access is less than Mexico sought. The Unresolved Issues **********Mexican and United States officials said that they were similarly close to an accord on energy issues, and that they had made some progress on new rules for foreign investment and services. **********But along with the further discussion on those issues, the thorny topic of automotive trade loomed especially large over the weekend talks among Mrs. Hills; the Canadian Trade Minister, Michael H. Wilson, and Mexico's Commerce Secretary, Jaime Jose Serra Puche. **********The topic has created a series of shifting allies and opponents: Mrs. Hills and Detroit's Big Three car manufacturers against United States auto workers and Mexican parts suppliers; Mexico against the United States, and Mexico and the United States against Canada. But trade officials said the remaining difficulties are less political than technical. What Is an American Car? **********After lengthy bargaining, officials said the three countries have agreed on how to determine the North American content of their cars, but they have not yet decided what level of North American content should be required for free trade. But the more difficult debate may be about how much trade they would open up to imports. Mexico, for example, now requires that its automotive producers export 1.75 cars for each one they import. **********Trade officials said today that they would not comment on the progress of their talks before Sunday. **********Mexican officials have been pushing to resolve the outstanding issues so a treaty can be signed before the Presidential elections in the United States and the State of the Union address by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Nov. 1. **********The Bush Administration, which has come to see the trade pact as a potential source of political support, particularly with voters in the Southwest, had hoped for an agreement in time for the Republican National Convention. There's a Deadline, Maybe **********But it is not clear that the Bush Administration would be similarly eager to sign a final treaty just days before the November election. **********And because the Administration must notify the Congress of an agreement 90 days before a treaty is signed, a treaty concluded early in August would come due for a signature then. **********Moreover, as critical issues have resisted solution, Mexican and United States officials have reiterated their insistence that they will not make unwarranted concessions to meet a deadline."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/22/business/ibm-to-introduce-software-for-the-blind.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 343, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.B.M. to Introduce Software for the Blind", "print_headline": "I.B.M. to Introduce Software for the Blind", "body_text": " **********I.B.M. plans to introduce today a software program that enables blind users to take advantage of the \"graphical user interface\" that comes with its OS/2 operating system. **********A graphical interface increases the ease of use and productivity by letting users issue orders to the computer by clicking a mouse device on icons and menus, instead of typing in commands.

In the short-term, however, turbulence is likely to remain the order of the day. **********After falling steadily for much of the summer, share prices on European stock markets generally rose after Germany lowered interest rates and a tidal wave of speculation forced Italy and Britain to devalue their currencies by withdrawing from the European exchange rate mechanism. **********But market experts are not calling the modest gains the start of a rally because of continuing uncertainty over the future of the European Community's drive for economic unity. **********The potential for recovery on Europe's stock exchanges is seen as improved because of the lower interest rates, which could stimulate economic growth. The devaluations, which included the Spanish peseta, are also seen as positive, because they link the values of the currencies more closely to the state of the nations' economies. **********\"Taking the Olympian view, there is a case to be made for the realignment of currency parities within the European Monetary System, stimulating growth and benefiting European equities,\" said Richard Reid, chief European economist with UBS Phillips & Drew in Frankfurt. \"It could become a significant step toward rethinking European monetary union and releasing the stranglehold of fixed exchange rates, which would promote growth. But getting from here to there, that will be the trick.\" **********The French vote on Maastricht will probably not clarify matters. **********Last year, leaders of the 12 community nations reached agreement in the Dutch town of Maastricht on a treaty calling for a single European currency and pan-European central bank by the end of the decade. Now, the viability of that treaty is in question and its fate may well be decided by French voters. **********For many experts, Maastricht has already become synonymous with mess. If the French vote against the treaty, economists expect a fresh bout of speculative convulsions on the global currency market. Should France give the treaty even modest approval, such as a 65 percent \"yes\" vote, the turbulence that preceded the balloting makes it likely that the timetable and terms of the treaty will still have to be revised because the convergence of economic policies it requires is nowhere in sight. **********But the central question in the financial markets is whither German interest rates, not whether France approves the Maastricht treaty. **********Germany's high interest rates have been blamed for squelching economic growth in Europe by forcing other nations to keep their rates high to defend their currencies' value. Last week, the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, lowered its short-term Lombard rate to 9.50 percent from 9.75 percent and its discount rate to 8.25 percent from 8.75 percent. That created some maneuvering room for other countries to lower interest rates, which would stimulate recovery and give share prices a boost. **********But without further cuts in Germany's rates, which the Bundesbank shows no sign of making, the growth is likely to be slow in arriving and limited in scope. In theory, the nations whose currencies were devalued should experience rising stock prices first, because that automatically makes their shares less expensive. **********International investment fund managers said the devaluation touched off heavy buying on the London Stock Exchange that pushed the Financial Times Index on Friday to 2,557.60, a gain of 73.70 points from Thursday. That left the index at its highest level since mid-July. **********But the Milan and Madrid exchanges posted only slight gains on the week, reflecting investors' fears that further devaluations may come after the French vote and that German interest rates are not going to be lowered again soon. **********Although the Bundesbank did not lower interest rates when it met Thursday, German Government officials are expressing cautious optimism. **********\"Interest rates in Germany can fall further as long as we keep to a strict austerity in state spending and employers and trade unions show reason and good judgment,\" Theo Waigel, Germany's Finance Minister, wrote in an article published in Bild Zeitung, a tabloid newspaper with daily circulation of more than four million, the nation's highest. Last week, Mr. Waigel presented a 1993 budget limiting growth of state spending to 2.5 percent. **********If interest rates in Germany are reduced, the growth scenario brightens considerably, economists said. **********\"The European stock markets were looking more attractive before the currency crisis,\" said J. Paul Horne, economist at Smith Barney International in Paris. \"If the French vote no, there is bound to be a loss of confidence that hits the markets for a while. But on balance, once the realignment is past, there is a far better chance of a generalized easing of interest rates in Germany and the European nations that peg their rates to the Bundesbank's rates. That makes prospects for a recovery in 1993 brighter and that would lift the equities markets.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/01/technology/a-state-financed-boarding-school-made-just-for-the-science-deprived.html": {"writer_name": "Joseph Berger", "pub_date": "1992-07-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1831, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A State-Financed Boarding School Made Just for the Science-Deprived", "print_headline": "A State-Financed Boarding School Made Just for the Science-Deprived", "body_text": " **********Todd Rose was something of a misfit. A sturdily built teen-ager from a family swarming with farmers, he did not want to farm. He wanted to study science. **********In his small town of Nashville, in tobacco and soybean country in eastern North Carolina, the local high school could offer him shop classes in plowing and welding but nothing in advanced science. **********But Todd was a good-enough student to be accepted into the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics here, a public boarding school for bright students from around the state. He could pick from a banquet of academic delights -- genetics, anatomy, organic chemistry and fractal mathematics -- and even spend six hours a week at local hospitals, trailing cardiologists into operating rooms. **********\"That just blew my mind, that I was sitting here, at 17, looking at a person on a table while a doctor is explaining to me everything that's going on,\" Todd said. \"It made me think this is something I want to do.\" Example for Other States **********As it has done with Todd, the North Carolina School has cultivated hundreds of aspiring scientists after discovering them in the state's backwaters as well as its cities. Its success with those students since it opened in 1980 has inspired imitators in Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. **********Together, say leading scientists and educators like Dr. Leon Lederman, these state-financed dormitory schools are one of the most potent antidotes to the country's deteriorating performance in science. **********Dr. Lederman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who founded the Illinois school, said that youngsters ardent about science often felt isolated at conventional schools and would withdraw into themselves, grow bored or even become discipline problems. By contrast, he said, those who go to specialized schools find that suddenly \"everyone is like them, they don't have to hide, and they start to flower.\" In the State's Self-Interest **********But the motivation for these pioneering states is far from altruism. They want to leapfrog their agrarian and blue-collar economies into the more scientific and technological world of the future. **********Many of these largely rural states faced a policy maker's Catch 22. Without a scientifically literate population, they could not lure advanced industries like those dealing with computers and pharmaceuticals. Yet with their old-fashioned industries, they lacked the tax base to give every school the laboratories and trained teachers could produce a scientifically literate population. **********\"You can get a ninth-grade education and work in a cigarette factory for the rest of your life,\" said Dr. William W. Youngblood, an administrator at the North Carolina School. \"You can't get a ninth-grade education and work in a pharmaceutical company. You're frozen out of the 21st century.\" **********North Carolina, which had long ranked near the bottom on almost every educational measure, decided to concentrate its resources on a single state school. Wealthy people had long sent their children to private boarding schools, but would the population of a largely rural state be willing to finance a public one? **********In 1980 North Carolina opened the nation's first government-financed residential high school, but it had been a hard sell. The state's expense for the first four years was $19 million. **********Because of smaller class sizes, sophisticated science equipment and, most of all, room and board, a single student's education at the school costs $12,000 a year, four times the amount spent on a conventional student. And there there were complaints from school boards that the school would skim off their best students for its enrollment of 550. **********The school's proponents had to promise to train teachers from around the state and generate curriculums and textbooks that other schools could use. Also, arguing that the school's graduates would provide skilled employees for the many research-driven companies in the college-saturated area around Durham, they attracted $7 million from those companies in the school's first four years, for building renovation and new laboratories. **********The payoff came in 1989, when a student, Celeste Posey of Cary, submitted her DNA research project to the prestigious Westinghouse Science Talent Search and finished fifth in the nation. Two years later, another student, Ashley Reiter of Charlotte, took first place for her project in fractals, winning $40,000. **********Less glorious but perhaps more prized by the school is the roster of graduates who go on to become scientists and engineers. A survey showed that of the 1,349 students who graduated from 1982 to 1989, 80 percent went on to major in science and engineering. **********Despite this record, however, funding the school remains an issue of perennial debate in the Legislature. **********Situated in a Spanish-style 16-building campus that had been a decaying county hospital, the school has its own observatory and greenhouse and a laboratory outfitted with gel boxes and transilluminators for cutting-edge research on DNA. **********The staff of 58 is as exceptional as the school's courses and equipment. Half the teachers come from colleges or private industry, and 37 percent hold doctorates. **********To attract such people, the school's founders had to persuade the state to exempt it from normal teacher certification requirements; this was accomplished through a gimmick: the school was designated a branch of the state university system. **********The teachers earn $23,000 to $43,000 a year, about the same as colleagues with similar education levels in the rest of the state. Many said they were drawn by the chance of working with exceptionally bright youngsters in the high school's intimate ambience. **********Though many of the teachers have never before taught in high school, they often bring a firsthand grasp of their fields. Stephen J. Warshaw, for example, came after a career as a government water-quality expert. **********On a muggy late-spring day, he took his ecology class to the Eno River, a shimmering stream in the piney woods nearby. Slogging into the shallow water, they used rigidly framed nets to jog aquatic insects from under rocks, and then identified the creatures using microscopes and charts arranged by body traits. **********Trekking back to school, 17-year-old Julie Bass confided why she could not have had such a satisfying scientific experience back home in Asheville. **********\"First of all, we wouldn't have ecology,\" she said. \"Second of all, we wouldn't have a field trip. In that school, everything is from a textbook.\" Days of Cerebral Fun **********In Kevin G. Bartkovich's class, where the air is thick with terms like bifurcation trees and iterations, students are not just learning mathematics, they are also practically inventing it. Dr. Bartkovich teaches a class in fractals, one of only a handful in the country. Fractals, a word that did not exist 20 years ago, is a mathematical tool for imposing order on the seemingly chaotic geometry of mountain ranges, clouds, even lung tissue -- and is also a fertile field for just plain cerebral fun. **********\"It's not as though there's this well-defined theory we can learn,\" Mr. Bartkovich said outside his class. \"People are still figuring out what this is all about.\" **********The North Carolina School admits only juniors and seniors, because the founders believed that sophomores were too young to flourish on their own, away from home. It tries to balance race, sex and state geography, using a 24-member admissions committee that is itself diverse, and judging students on interviews as well as grades. **********In 1992, 47 percent of the students were female. In proportions that roughly mirror the state's ethnic breakdown, 23 percent of the study body was black, 10 percent Asian, 2 percent Indian and 1 percent Hispanic. Ninety-four of the state's 100 counties were represented. Changes From a Tiny Town **********The school has provided a haven for young people who might have felt out-of-place in their hometown schools. Julie Woosley, an effervescent 1986 alumna who is now a chemist at the Research Triangle Institute here, recalled that back home in Cullowhee, population 1,200, the physics teacher was about one month ahead of the class. **********\"We did not have chalk or paper, but the football team had a VCR and a wide-screen TV so they could see tapes of how they played,\" she said. \"When I got to Science and Math, the thing that impressed me the most was that there were people who were curious about current events, religion, you name it.\" **********For those singleminded about science, the most compelling classes are in research. After a crash course in deciphering scientific treatises, using the Duke University library, the biology research students learn how to distinguish varieties of bacteria, inject pathogens into plants and separate strands of DNA. **********Once they are ready to tackle a professional-scale project, the school offers them two commodities they could not get in most public high schools -- space and time. It has laboratories restricted to research students, where they can be sure their agar plates and fish tanks will not be disturbed by the general stream of students. **********Elizabeth Smith, 17, of Ayden, has been investigating the impact of nitrogen deficiency on plants she grows in the greenhouse. \"At home we don't have the chemicals I need, we don't have a greenhouse, we don't have the money for vermiculite or pebbles,\" she said. \"Before I came here, I was thinking about being an architect. Now I'm thinking about botany.\" **********North Carolina Science and Math also has a less demanding program than research to give students a feel for careers in science. Like Todd Rose, who now wants to be a neurosurgeon, students are paired with researchers and doctors at nearby universities or at technological companies in Research Triangle Park. **********Most students seem to thrive in the residential atmosphere. The dorm rooms are as unkempt as their college prototypes, except that the objects scattered about are closer to childhood -- a stuffed Winnie-the-Pooh or a Happy Birthday balloon. In one boy's room, a picture of Einstein is next to one of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. **********Students wander into each other's rooms to work through baffling math questions or to gossip or just get relief from the homesickness that many feel from being away about nine months a year. Each year, about 10 percent of the starting juniors return home to their local schools. **********\"Many of these kids have made nothing but 98 and 99,\" said Mr. Warshaw, who becomes principal next year. \"Then they come here and get a C on their first test, they realize they're not at the top of the heap anymore and that's a big adjustment.\" **********Yet most students eventually get A's and B's and go to respected colleges. Two-thirds attend college within the state, a fact that has vindicated the chauvinistic founders. **********\"We tell students they are here as the seedcorn of North Carolina's future,\" said Dr. John J. Friedrick, the school's executive director."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/10/business/executive-changes-687992.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-09-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 221, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********ADVACARE INC., Horsham, Pa., which provides accounts-receivable management services to physicians and hospitals, named William Joe Davis 3d president and chief executive.

It would also receive a $3 million consulting fee payable over five years. **********The deal also includes a complex transaction between Metromedia and New Line. Roughly a year ago, having already invested some $250 million in Orion, Metromedia, which is controlled by John W. Kluge, lent Orion an additional $29 million, secured by revenues from two films: \"Mermaids\" and \"Silence of the Lambs.\" Metromedia has not yet received revenues from that note. **********In the newly proposed arrangement, New Line would receive that note, valued at $29 million, for which it would pay Metromedia 1.6 million shares of New Line stock, valued at $18.50 a share. The payment would also include warrants to buy an additional 200,000 shares, half at $19 a share and half at $25 a share. **********Thus, Mr. Kluge would own stock in both New Line and Orion. Since New Line's share price was $18.50 at yesterday's close, Mr. Kluge would be paying a premium over the current market price, thus betting that New Line's share price would move well past the $18.50 level. **********New Line, for its part, would forgive that $29 million note, so that its total investment in Orion would actually be $12.5 million in cash and an additional $29 million in newly issued New Line stock, which would account for about 10 percent of New Line's total shares outstanding.  41.5% of Orion for Bondholders **********The plan also supposes that subordinated bondholders would get about 41.5 percent of Orion's outstanding capital stock and $30 million in principal amount of the new 10 percent subordinated debentures due in 2007, to be issued by a reorganized Orion. Existing trade creditors and profit participants in Orion's films and other production would be paid in full. **********The deal would also require the support of such creditors as Columbia Pictures. Columbia, owned by the Sony Corporation, has a contract for the foreign home video rights to about 30 more Orion films."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/03/world/argentine-sees-falklands-return-but-pledges-never-again-war.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1992-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 478, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Argentine Sees Falklands' Return But Pledges, 'Never Again War'", "print_headline": "Argentine Sees Falklands' Return But Pledges, 'Never Again War'", "body_text": " **********Marking the 10th anniversary of Argentina's ill-fated invasion of the Falkland Islands, President Carlos Saul Menem predicted today that his country would recover the archipelago in the South Atlantic \"before the year 2000.\" **********But he added that Argentina would gain sovereignty over the islands, which the Argentines call the Malvinas, \"by diplomatic channels and methods.\" **********\"Never again war,\" President Menem said after leaving a Roman Catholic Mass in Lujan, 40 miles north of Buenos Aires. \"We lost a lot more than what we had gained through dialogue, which now, with an open and strong diplomacy, we are recovering.\" **********On April 2, 1982, Argentina's military leader, Gen.

They come demanding it with four technicals, and they say what they want in a relatively threatening way -- so it's given to them.\" **********\"Technicals\" are the souped-up jeeps with machine guns that all aid agencies hire to protect supplies. **********The United Nations also has 500 guard troops here from Pakistan, but they are not allowed to shoot unless they are fired on. A Debate Over Numbers **********In mid-October, the former United Nations special representative to Somalia, Mohammed Sahnoun, said that up to 40 percent of the donated food was being stolen by gunmen. Last week Andrew S. Natsios, the coordinator for humanitarian affairs for the United States Agency for International Development, said 80 percent was being looted or lost to extortion. **********Many aid officials, including those with the United Nations, said the estimate of 80 percent was excessive if all the food brought into Somalia by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations was counted. The Red Cross has suffered less from looting than the United Nations has, they added. **********The United Nations pays $150,000 every month to maintain the port with 900 security guards and 11 jeeps with armed fighters, according to Jim Stearns, the deputy head of CARE, the international aid agency, which also organizes the delivery of United Nations food in Somalia. Guards' families are also allotted food from the aid shipments.  Jeeps and Trucks **********As well as now being paid in cash, the security staff also receive more food for their families. From the last United Nations ship, the guards got 240 tons of the cargo aboard the 4,000-ton ship. \"That's what it says on paper,\" Mr. Ulray said. \"It's the demand on top of the 240 tons that is the killer.\" **********If the food leaves the port in southern Mogadishu on a truck convoy, it is accompanied by a battalion of jeeps with fighters hired by the trucking contractor, often one jeep for every two and a half trucks, United Nations officials said. The jeeps and their guards can cost from $75 to $120 a day each; much of that is spent by the fighters on khat, a plant they chew that has some of the properties of amphetamines. **********The security guards may accompany a shipment to a warehouse in the city's southern sector, which is controlled by one clan leader, Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid; or to the city's northern sector, which is controlled by Mohammed Ali Mahdi, who describes himself as Interim President, or perhaps 150 miles inland to a distribution point where starving Somalis gather in the hope of nourishment. **********When the convoy reaches a checkpoint, there are often more payouts. The gunmen at the checkpoint between the south and north of the divided capital originally demanded 20 tons of food per ship. **********\"They don't keep track of the ships,\" Mr. Stearns said, \"so it becomes 20 tons per convoy. You've got no choice but to acquiesce to the demands, because metaphorically you've got a gun at your head every time, even for five bags of rice at the port.\" **********The United Nations has suffered more losses and faced more blackmail than some other organizations for several reasons, several Somalis contend. For example, the United Nations food dispatchers are poor negotiators, they said. **********Ahmed Duale, the manager of the SITT Transport Company, a major trucking concern that transports food for the Red Cross, said he had created incentives against looting. **********For example, a truck owner with a vehicle in a Red Cross convoy was paid 700,000 shillings, or about $120, he said. But he was fined 50,000 shillings, or about $8, for each bag looted. That did not leave much room for losses on a 200-bag truck. **********By contrast, Mr. Duale said, the United Nations paid only 400,000 shillings, or about $60, to the truck owners, a low amount that invited stealing. **********\"In the middle of a ship-unloading for the Red Cross, truckers deserted me to go to the United Nations ship, even though they were only getting 400,000 shillings there,\" he said. \"The drivers said they could take 50 bags to make up for it. The United Nations is too lenient and has no control.\" **********Another prominent Somali businessman, Hussein Dimbil, who has not been involved in trucking the food, said he blamed both the United Nations and the Somali contractors. **********\"If a trucker says $100 a ton, the United Nations should go somewhere else,\" Mr. Dimbil said. \"But if you say O.K., they will ask for more. I think the organizations have been too weak and too generous.\" **********Mr. Dimbil said that outsiders in Somalia, including relief organizations, should bear in mind a Somali saying: \"If you don't look after yourself personally, you don't care for life.\" **********More roughly translated, he said, the working motto in Somalia is, \"You have to be greedy for yourself.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/05/business/company-news-lufthansa-hopes-to-eliminate-1000-jobs-in-1992.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LUFTHANSA HOPES TO ELIMINATE 1,000 JOBS IN 1992", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; LUFTHANSA HOPES TO ELIMINATE 1,000 JOBS IN 1992", "body_text": " **********Lufthansa A.G., the German state-owned airline, said it wanted to cut about 2 percent, or 1,000 of its 50,000 jobs in 1992, with more reductions next year, a Lufthansa spokesman said. \"We haven't decided how we are going to cut those jobs and where, and we haven't decided how many jobs we're going to cut in 1993,\" the spokesman said. \"But this much is clear, there will be more cuts next year.\" Lufthansa had a pretax loss of 400 million marks, or about $243.3 million in 1991, compared with a pretax loss of 142 million marks in 1990.

Or unless you think a new recession will have begun by Election Day. **********That, at any rate, is one way to read the history of the stock market and Presidential election campaigns. In this country, there has been no better time to own stocks than in the last half of an election year. On average since 1900, the Dow Jones industrial average has risen 10.4 percent during such periods. **********But third-party candidates have played an important role in two of the four elections when stock prices ignored the usual trend, and recessions have been present during the other two. So it could be argued that this year, with both factors at least possibly at work, is unlikely to be a normal election year. **********In 1912, the only election in the past century in which the Democratic and Republican candidates did not take the top two spots in the Presidential popular-vote totals, the Dow fell 3.4 percent. In that year, Theodore Roosevelt ran as an independent, splitting the Republican Party and finishing second to Woodrow Wilson. **********In 1948, Strom Thurmond was the candidate of breakaway Southern Democrats, and Henry Wallace of disaffected liberals, making it obvious to virtually all observers that President Harry Truman had no chance to win the election. But he did, and the stock market ended the second half of the year down 6.4 percent, all of it coming after the surprising election results. **********One explanation for the generally strong tendency for stock prices during election years is that share prices react to economic trends and that while governments always care about the economy, they care most during the months when the public has a right to change governments. And Presidents have generally done a reasonably good job of arranging to have the economy growing during elections. **********Indeed, in 1920 and 1960, the other election years in which stock prices dropped in the second half, the economy was officially in recession at the time of the vote. And in both years, the incumbent party was thrown out. In 1932, when a Depression was under way at the time of the vote, the stock market rallied nicely in the second half, with the Dow up 39.9 percent, but the incumbent party was also thrown out. In 1948, when the incumbent party surprisingly won, a recession began the month of the election, but the voters didn't know that. **********This year, the Perot candidacy has thrown election year politics into confusion, and the recession that began in July 1990 has not yet officially been declared over, although most economists think it ended either last year or early this year. But last week's report that the jobless rate rose to 7.8 percent in June has increased talk of a \"triple dip\" recession. **********Whether a third-party candidacy will seem serious in November is not always clear in July, and the stock market has done fine when some insurgent candidacies have fizzled. In 1980, John Anderson looked like a possibly serious candidate to some observers, but he faded by November and the Dow was up 11.1 percent in the final six months of the year. And in 1968, George Wallace never seemed like a winner, but he did win 46 electoral votes and for a time there was talk about the election being thrown into the House of Representatives, as happens if no candidate wins a majority of electoral votes. But the Dow went up 5.1 percent during the final half of that year. **********Another way to look at the Presidential election campaign stock markets is to assume that investors and voters are, in general, the same people. And since the majority of voters get their way every four years, perhaps it stands to reason that investors would also be happier about the future when they were being given the option to change it. **********In fact, of course, investors are generally richer than the population as a whole, and for most of this century, they have been more likely to vote Republican. And the stock market has reacted much better in years when Republican candidates won than in years when the Democrats prevailed. Stocks have risen during the final six months of 12 of the 13 election years that the Republican candidate won, for an average move of 13.7 percent. But they have gained in just seven of the 10 years when a Democrat won, for an average gain of 6.2 percent. **********As for this year, the Dow ended June at 3,318.52. Through yesterday, it is up two-tenths of 1 percent. If this proves an average Presidential election year, presumably with the Perot candidacy fading, the Dow will end the year up 10.4 percent, at 3,654."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/26/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-american-express-in-global-campaign.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising -- Addenda; American Express In Global Campaign", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising -- Addenda; American Express In Global Campaign", "body_text": " **********For the first time, American Express is introducing a global multimedia advertising campaign aimed exclusively at international travelers. **********\"We feel it's time to communicate with the traveler's mindset at every stage throughout the trip,\" said Elisabeth Coleman, a spokeswoman at the American Express Travel Related Services Company in New York. **********The campaign, created by Ogilvy & Mather in New York, carries the continuing theme \"Don't leave home without it.\" There will be television commercials, run on media outlets like CNN International, and print advertisements in media like in-flight magazines.

What it has not talked much about is that on hundreds of routes, including ones as well traveled as New York to Chicago, its rock-bottom fare actually rose -- sometimes as much as doubling. **********Between Chicago and Birmingham, Ala., for example, the lowest American round-trip fare has gone from $128 to $260. Typical of an airline's lowest fare, the former price was for non-refundable tickets requiring an advance purchase, and the price was available only on certain flights each day. **********Robert Crandall, the chairman of American, said the aim in simplifying the fare structure was to eliminate fares with such complex restrictions. But for travelers willing to put up with any restriction as long as they get from one place to another, the result is a higher fare. **********Though roughly 95 percent of fliers have been receiving some type of discount, under the old system relatively few could take advantage of the lowest fare because they did not have the flexibility to meet all of the restrictions. **********American has also followed the unusual policy of keeping these higher fares in effect even as leading airlines have often failed to match them. It thus stands to lose business to carriers offering lower rates, but American apparently hopes the others will fall in line. A Spot Check of Routes **********On Monday, American announced that it was lowering full-coach and discount fares on many routes, in a calculated warning to weaker carriers that had undercut the simplified fare structure American announced less than two weeks ago. **********Even with those cuts, however, American's lowest fares in many other markets are now higher than they were before the company's fare-simplification plan went into effect. **********In a spot check of 286 routes, mostly out of Chicago, Andrew Shepp, an airline industry consultant, has found that in 41 markets American's lowest fare is now higher than the lowest fare before its broad changes. **********Barbara Amster, American's vice president for pricing and yield management, said, however, that the former lowest fares were those \"that comedians make jokes about\" because of the complexity of the restrictions. **********If one takes into account the more widely used regular discount fares, she said, in most markets there was a considerable cut. Thus for the New York-to-Chicago route the more widely used discount fare was $338, she said, while American's new lowest round-trip discount fare is $260. A highly restricted round-trip fare of $178 was good on only certain flights, while the $338 fare was available on all of American's 20 daily flights, with fewer restrictions, Ms. Amster said. **********With all the cuts, it is not clear whether the ratio for the spot-check sample used by Mr. Shepp, in which American's fares were higher in 15 percent of the markets, would hold up if other markets were analyzed. American flies between about 12,000 pairs of cities.

They wouldn't.\" **********As the world's eyes remain focused on the plight of Sarajevo, the capital, the Serbs are continuing their \"ethnic cleansing\" campaign in the hinterlands of the republic, which was 42 percent Muslim before the war began. Refugee Center in Croatia **********These Muslims were from a village near a town of 41,000 called Bosanski Novi, about 60 miles southeast of Zagreb. At a makeshift refugee center in the Croatian city of Karlovac, they recounted this week how their Serbian neighbors had begun pushing them out of their villages in May. **********The trains took them to Doboj, a city deep in Serb-held territory. Women and children were separated from the men and allowed to flee to Croatia. The males were then transported back to Bosanski Novi, where they were herded into a stadium and joined other Muslims rounded up in the city. They were held for as many 46 days, the witnesses said. **********Asked if the Serbs ever explained their motivation, one Muslim who had been on the train responded: \"They told us nothing. They just said this is politics doing things to you, it is not us.\" **********The refugees' testimony is, for the moment, the main means of finding out what is happening in the vast swaths of Bosnia and Herzegovina seized by the Serbs. Access to much of this territory has been cut off by armed militiamen. **********From their actions, it appears that the Serbs are trying to rearrange the intricately intermingled ethnic map of Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********The aim of \"ethnic cleansing,\" a term first used by a Serb radical nationalist in Belgrade, is to forge purely Serb areas in regions that were once mixed. Creating refugees in this conflict is thus the aim, not the consequence, of the fighting. **********More than 700,000 people have been driven out of Bosnia since the war began earlier this year, with an additional 588,000 refugees within the country, according to United Nations figures. Most of these are Muslims. **********The refugees in Karlovac hail from a county of 40,000, which was 27 percent Muslim in the most recent prewar census. Croatian officials say that 9,000 people, mostly Muslim, were driven out in the last week or so from this area. **********Nearby in this region of western Bosnia and Herzegovina are heavily Muslim areas, including Cazin, a county listed in the census as 98 percent Muslim with 66,000 people, and Bosanska Krupa, a town of 80,000 that is 67 percent Muslim. East of these areas are heavily Serbian regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina; to the west are the Serbs in Croatia living in areas guarded by United Nations troops.  Swelling Tide of Refugees **********The Serb strategy in this region appears to be aimed first at forcing Muslims from the mixed towns, and then isolating the remaining pockets of Muslims. The chief of operations for the United Nations refugee relief in Croatia this week expressed concern that the roughly 350,000 Muslims left in this area could soon be forced to flee. **********Emir Medjedovic, a 31-year-old owner of a grocery store in Bosanski Novi, was taken captive in a separate roundup of Muslims. Unlike the men from the village of Hozici, he was taken directly to the stadium, and released after only four days' confinement. **********He said the Serbs acted in his part of town on June 1, after a local Serb was killed fighting elsewhere. \"From 8 P.M. that night until the morning of the next day, the Serbs began burning mosques and killing,\" he said. \"They burned all the mosques.\" **********In his shorts and incongruous pair of beach shoes bearing the inscription \"Yacht Club,\" Mr. Medjedovic looked tan and healthy.

He also spoke of humiliations the Muslims had been made to endure, of being forced to sing traditional Serb songs, and of kneeling for hours at a time before their captors. He said that he and his neighbors had been forced by armed Serbs to sign documents saying they had voluntarily given up \"all of their possessions forever.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/28/world/syria-giving-jews-freedom-to-leave.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1992-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1042, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SYRIA GIVING JEWS FREEDOM TO LEAVE", "print_headline": "SYRIA GIVING JEWS FREEDOM TO LEAVE", "body_text": " **********Syria informed the United States over the weekend that it was lifting a travel ban on its 4,500 Jewish citizens, the State Department announced today. **********Most of them are expected to leave. If they do, there will be no more significant Jewish populations left in the Arab world, outside of Morocco. The once flourishing Jewish populations of Baghdad, Cairo, Alexandria, Tunis and Algiers have either been evicted or fled since 1948, as a spillover from the Arab-Israeli conflict. **********The move by Syria constitutes a fundamental shift in policy toward its Jewish citizens, and appears to be part of an effort by President Hafez al-Assad to make his country more acceptable to the United States now that Damascus has lost its longtime Soviet patron. Peace Talks Resume **********The Syrian decision came as Israel and its Arab neighbors -- Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and the Palestinians -- resumed peace negotiations, their fifth round since the Madrid peace conference in October. Israel used the opportunity to broach a very general proposal today for municipal elections for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********On the eve of the talks, the Syrian Foreign Ministry informed the United States Embassy in Damascus that it was lifting most of the restrictions on travel and sale of property by its Jewish citizens, the State Department said. Previously, Syrian Jews wishing to travel abroad had to leave at least one family member behind and had to post bonds in the range of $1,000 per person, to insure their return. **********Except for the prohibition on traveling to Israel and back, Syrian Jews are now free to come and go like any other Syrian citizen. But those who might wish to leave permanently for Israel, by way of a third country, could probably do so. **********Rumors of the Syrian decision, which was made on Saturday, had been circulating among Syrian Jews since their representatives met with President Assad last week, but were confirmed only over the weekend. **********The United States had repeatedly urged the Syrian Government to let its Jews travel abroad, and Israeli negotiators had insisted that one of the most tangible signals the Syrians could give that they were sincere about peace would be to lift the travel ban. **********\"This means that Syrian Jews will now be allowed to travel abroad as a family on business and for vacations,\" said the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler. \"Further, the Syrian Government has removed difficulties encountered by its Jewish citizens with regard to the sale and purchase of property in Syria.\" **********Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, who has been trying for several years to have the travel restrictions lifted, said: \"This is an extraordinary development. I can only say that it is as gratifying as it is unexpected.\" **********Jews in Syria suffer everything from arbitrary arrests and discrimination to limits on what jobs and businesses they can enter. **********In Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told the Army Radio that he was \"content with the progress toward easing restrictions on our brethren in Syria and I am glad for them.\" He said he hoped that the process \"will continue and the Jews will soon be allowed to emigrate.\" **********American officials say they are not quite sure what motivated the Syrian President to change policy, and were taken by surprise by his move. Mr. Assad had previously argued that if he let Syrian Jews travel freely and emigrate, they would all go to Israel and only strengthen his enemy. Also, he had argued that if he allowed free emigration, it would undermine his demands that the former Soviet Union not let its Jews go to Israel. Cultivating New Ties **********Now that the Soviet Union no longer exists, Jews there are basically free to emigrate. And because of its demise, the Syrians have also lost their main patron in world affairs and have been seeking to cultivate a new relationship with the West in general and the United States in particular. **********Lifting travel restrictions for the Syrian Jews, therefore, may be seen as part of Mr. Assad's general reaching out to the West, which began last October with his participation in direct American-sponsored peace talks with Israel -- something he had also opposed his whole political career. **********A senior American official expressed great satisfaction for this Syrian \"confidence-building gesture,\" but said there were no plans at this time to take Syria off the State Department list of countries supporting terrorism, which remains a major impediment to improving United States-Syrian relations. **********Miss Tutwiler went out of her way to note the role played by the Bush Administration in the release of the Syrian Jews, something the Administration clearly wants acknowledged given the recent tensions between it and many leaders of American Jewish groups. Bush-Baker Efforts Cited **********\"President Bush discussed Syrian Jewry with President Assad in their meeting in Geneva in November 1990 and Secretary Baker has raised this issue on several occasions with President Assad in Damascus,\" she said. **********In the resumed peace talks, the most noteworthy development was Israel's proposal for holding \"pilot municipal elections\" in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which the Palestinians did not reject out of hand. **********The Palestinian spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, said the Israeli election proposal \"was not a complete plan\" and appeared to fall short of Palestinian demands for elections of an overall Palestinian legislative and administrative body that could oversee Palestinian self-rule during the five-year transition phase, before the final status of the territories are determined. Nevertheless, she seemed to indicate that there might be some Palestinian interest if Israel was ready to establish a link between local elections and transfer of power to some larger, region-wide Palestinian ruling body. **********Because no Israeli officials would spell out their proposal, it was hard to determine whether it is a fully developed plan for elections, or just a general inclination they intend to negotiate with the Palestinians. **********\"I made a general direction obvious,\" said the Israeli spokesman, Benjamin Netanyahu, an aide to Mr. Shamir, \"and I think it's important to allow the details of this direction to be worked out behind closed doors.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/09/world/taped-order-loud-and-clear-burn-it-all.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1992-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 457, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Taped Order Loud and Clear: 'Burn It All'", "print_headline": "Taped Order Loud and Clear: 'Burn It All'", "body_text": " **********A recording of what the Bosnian Government says are three senior Serbian officers in the hills above Sarajevo registers a detailed discussion of which residential districts to hit with heavy artillery.

But some funds have bucked this trend, like the Chicago-based Skyline Special Equities Fund, which rose a healthy 16.5 percent through Sept. 30, according to Morningstar Inc., a mutual fund research group. **********Skyline, just over five years old, is a real sleeper. For the 12 months ended Sept. 30, the fund returned 24.9 percent, more than triple the small-company average; and it has gained 14 percent a year, on average, for the last five years, roughly six percentage points more than the average small-company fund. **********Investors are catching on. Skyline, part of Mesirow Asset Management, has more than tripled in size since the end of 1990, to a still-small $70 million, probably because it \"has historically offered one of the smoothest and best rides available,\" Morningstar says. **********Bill Dutton, the fund's 38-year-old manager, buys small companies with market capitalizations mainly in the $200 million to $250 million range, because they have \"more consistency to their earnings results than smaller companies,\" he said. **********But they are still small enough to be ignored by Wall Street. Most companies owned by Skyline are followed by one or two analysts, not the usual 5 or 10, and that means they are \"more likely to be undervalued or mispriced,\" Mr. Dutton said. **********One factor reducing the fund's overall risk is that it is more diversified than many small-company funds. Mr. Dutton holds roughly 60 stocks, no one of which accounts for more than 3 percent of the fund's portfolio. In fact, most of the stocks represent about 1.5 to 2 percent of the fund. He also keeps less than 5 percent of the fund in cash. **********Nor will Skyline be too heavily weighted in a single industry. While the diversity is not deliberate -- Mr. Dutton takes a bottom-up approach, picking stocks that meet his criteria and not worrying about what category they fall in -- Skyline's stocks are spread among more than 20 industries. **********But Skyline's overriding feature is its value approach to stock-picking. Because Mr. Dutton insists on low price-earnings ratios, the fund's stocks usually trade at a 20 to 25 percent discount to market multiples. Today the fund's portfolio trades for about 13 times the previous 12 months' earnings, compared with 19 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500. **********But unlike many managers who focus on value, Mr. Dutton won't buy any cheap stock he unearths. He wants to see above-average earnings growth, at least 8 percent a year but more typically 12 to 16 percent. **********Because of that two-prong approach, most of the fund's companies, while small, are not start-up ventures. They are often leaders in niche areas with small markets, like PCI Services, one of the largest independent packagers serving the pharmaceutical industry, or Nu-Kote Holding, which manufactures toner and ribbons for computer printers. **********The companies also have good profit histories. Mr. Dutton wants earnings of at least $1 million each quarter for at least three years, ideally for five. Its focus on profit served Skyline well last year, when most value managers stumbled. While small-company growth funds gained 50 percent on average and value funds rose 30 percent, Skyline rose 47 percent, Morningstar said. **********Knowing when to sell is critical, and Mr. Dutton has a straightforward method -- he buys stocks with low earnings multiples and sells when they hit market levels. **********He is also much more impatient than most value managers, who may hold a stock for years until others recognize its value. Once he hears bad news -- a poor earnings report, perhaps -- he dumps the stock. **********Because of this, the fund has a short average holding period, about a year, and a much larger annual turnover rate than most value funds. Its oldest holding is Crown Books, which it has owned for five years. **********Investors looking for clues in Mr. Dutton's background to explain his numbers-oriented, disciplined approach would not be surprised to learn he has a master's degree in accounting from the University of Illinois, having returned to numbers after receiving an undergraduate degree from Princeton in English literature. He spent a year working for an accountant and earned a C.P.A. before joining Mesirow as an analyst. **********He switched to money management and began running a partnership fund three and a half years later. In 1987, Mesirow started Skyline, modeled on the partnership, which Mr. Dutton still manages. All told, he manages $160 million -- the $70 million fund, the $20 million partnership and $70 million in separately managed accounts. **********The fund's biggest holdings are two Des Moines companies: the Allied Group, a property and casualty insurer, and Younkers, a department store chain. Next come Community Health Systems, a hospital chain based in Houston; Trimas, an Ann Arbor, Mich., conglomerate that produces towing products, specialty fasteners and containers; and Kaydon, in Clearwater, Fla., which manufactures custom-engineered industrial products. **********A final note: In the past, Skyline has levied a 3.85 percent front-end sales charge, but in an effort to draw in more money, it has dropped that until March 31."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/19/business/executives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 54, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "body_text": " *********** Alliance Capital Management, New York, an investment adviser, appointed Robert W.

We focus on our domestic market, where the competition and the opportunity have been, instead of overseas, where significant oportunity now exists. American business has been so successful here that we did not believe we needed to pursue other markets. But complacency is a luxury that we can no longer afford. **********The statistics are sobering. Foreign direct investment in the United States during the 1980's soared 616 percent; American outbound investment rose just 9.9 percent. According to the General Accounting Office, only one-fifth of American companies in a position to export actually do so -- and half of this activity is by American units of businesses with offshore ownership. **********For years, American companies looked abroad when the cost of land, labor and other essentials helped them produce a product more cheaply -- one that could be brought home and sold at a profit. Now when we look abroad, we should be thinking about markets, not resources. The United States used to be the world's largest single market, but that honor now belongs to Europe, which offers a market with a gross domestic product of $5 trillion and 700 million potential consumers, if you include the former Soviet Union and the other Eastern bloc nations. **********The enormous changes became clear to me a year ago, when I was interviewed by the press in Taiwan, just as I had been in the 1970's. Then, the questions went like this: \"Are you going to keep your labor force employed here? Are you going to continue investing in your facilities here?\" Last winter, they were more like: \"Will the United States economy perform well enough to support our investment in America? What is the outlook for potential investors in the United States? What are you doing to reduce your deficit?\" **********We now pay closer attention to how our products are made in this country, and that's a good thing. Production is more efficient. Prices are going down. We're becoming more competitive and it looks as though we'll continue to progress in the 90's. But our competitors are doing the same thing. And that means any notion that our new production techniques and quality control will put us on top again -- a view held by many American executives -- is off target. **********Starting around 1985, European countries came alive in seeking and solidifying markets. Today, three of the four top national investors in the United States are European. Europe has become a major player in the our marketplace. **********Of the $153 billion worth of cross-border mergers, joint ventures and acquisitions consummated worldwide in 1990 and the first three quarters of 1991, 52 percent included the sale of a company located in the European Community. More important, more than 56 percent of the acquirers were other E.C.-based companies, while American-based companies accounted for only 18 percent of the activity. In other words, Europe transformed itself from what many considered a sleepy, provincial competitor into a real powerhouse, prowling the world for markets. **********Our firm recently surveyed more than 700 top executives at American companies to see what strategies they were pursuing in Europe. Among those who were active abroad, three strategies -- all of which make good business sense -- were repeatedly seen as being key: Expanding production and service capabilities; entering a joint venture or an alliance, and acknowledging that Europe eventually will be one market. Today it is not, but companies should start rationalizing operations, perhaps setting up one plant rather than one in every European country. **********The winners in this global competition will be world players and the United States should get in the game -- now."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/01/business/shifts-at-top-of-an-insurer.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-01-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 104, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shifts at Top Of an Insurer", "print_headline": "Shifts at Top Of an Insurer", "body_text": " **********The Niagara Exchange Corporation said today that Edward G.

Since the introduction of the restructured fares, business travel has increased modestly, but leisure traffic has hardly gained, according to Northwest. **********Moreover, the carrier estimated that last month's restructured leisure fares averaged almost 10 percent more than last summer's fares. **********\"We felt that isn't stimulative,\" said John H. Dasburg, Northwest's president and chief executive. \"So we decided to entice the leisure traveler back into the marketplace this summer with an affordable product.\" **********Under Northwest's new fare, an adult and a child aged 2 to 17 can fly round trip between New York and Chicago for a total of $250. Before last night, the lowest round-trip fare (a 14-day advance purchase) for two people on that route was $500. And the lowest round-trip fare on that route last summer for two people (on a \"companion fare,\" applicable to child or adult) was $303. **********Between New York and Miami, Northwest's new round-trip fare for an adult and a child is $310, half the fare before last night and $106 cheaper than a companion fare last year. **********Between New York and Los Angeles, the new round-trip fare for adult and child is $400, also half the previous fare and $136 lower than last summer's companion fare. **********Tickets for the new fare must be purchased no later than June 5 but are valid through Sept. 13, six days after Labor Day. They are nonrefundable but, as is true of tickets purchased under the simplified structure announced by American on April 9, flights can be rescheduled by paying a $25 service fee.  Some Carriers Resist **********While most of the large carriers went along with American's revamped fare structure last month, Trans World Airlines has continued to offer lower fares. America West, Continental and USAir have each offered low fares over certain routes. And even American lowered fares to match Southwest Airlines, the discount airline. But most carriers adhered to the basic four-tier structure. **********To qualify for Northwest's new fares, tickets for both child and adult must be purchased at the same time for the same flight. \"If you show up at the airport without the other person,\" said Mark E. Abels, vice president of corporate communications, \"you can't get on the flight.\" **********The fare applies to any adult, not just parents but also siblings, relatives and friends. In an unusual interpretation of the regulations, a child is defined as anyone from age 2 to 17, while an adult is defined as anyone age 12 or older. Northwest said that would allow a family of six, for example, to pair up two children with their parents to obtain the lowest fare, and the remaining two children to pair up -- one as an adult, the other as a child."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/22/business/few-texas-oil-gushers-for-bush.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1992-08-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1261, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Few Texas Oil Gushers for Bush", "print_headline": "Few Texas Oil Gushers for Bush", "body_text": " **********Texas oil executives provided a financial gusher for George Bush's 1988 bid for the White House. They counted the Republican candidate, who was a West Texas oilfield executive before he entered politics 30 years ago, as one of their own. **********But now, with drilling in the nation's oil and gas fields depressed, 400,000 jobs lost during 12 years of Reagan and Bush Administrations, and frustration with Washington's acceptance of big oil imports, many Texas oil executives insist that the Bush camp cannot take them for granted this time in the race against Gov. Bill Clinton. **********\"Texas oil people are extremely disappointed, especially the independent operators, with what the Reagan and Bush Administrations have done,\" George P. Mitchell, chairman of the Mitchell Energy and Development Corporation, a large independent producer, said today. Too Close to Call **********Fund-raisers for the President \"can't raise money with oil people,\" he said. \"Maybe he'll win some back in the next three months, but very few are helping him at this time.\" **********Julian Martin, executive director of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners, a trade group of independent drillers, said the race for the White House was too close to call among drillers in Texas. **********\"The support for either candidate right now is fairly soft,\" he said. \"Neither party has seen fit to project energy as a major issue in this campaign.\" **********With reference to the President's acceptance speech Thursday, in which he attacked Congress for failing to enact his energy program, Mr. Martin said both Mr. Bush and Congress should share the blame. **********\"If the President had vigorously pursued, in the early stages of the bill, incentives for oil and gas, this would have saved some time. But that's the fault of both parties, not just the Democrats,\" he said. **********The most vocal of the disgruntled oil executives are independent drillers like Mr. Mitchell, who for years have focused most of their search for oil and gas on the United States, while oil giants like Exxon, Mobil and Chevron now spend more than half of their exploration budgets abroad. **********Drilling in the United States is more costly, partly because new oilfields are harder to find but also because of Congressional drilling bans in many fields and stiff environmental rules. The Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, estimated that domestic producers of all sizes spent a total of $99 billion to meet environmental laws last year. **********Some producers say they are angry that the President and Congress have still not passed laws to stimulate drilling and to pare the nation's reliance on imported oil. **********The independent oil producers see a bias against them in the Administration's decisions to restrict imports of autos, computer chips and steel, but not oil. Foreign oil accounted for 50.9 percent of total demand in July and contributes more than $50 billion yearly to the nation's trade deficit. **********The Texas Independent Drillers Group has called for a Monroe Doctrine-style energy policy that would support trade within the Americas to develop and import oil, natural gas and other energy sources and reduce Persian Gulf imports. **********\"The development of the National Energy Strategy is a strong indication that the Administration still counts on oil flow from the Middle East as the center point of energy supply,\" Mr. Martin said. \"It's the cheapest source in the world and keeps prices down, but there are tremendous costs for defense and transportation. The closer to home energy is developed, the better.\" **********Neal Anderson, executive vice president of a small Houston-based independent exploration concern, the Anderson Oil Company, said he was a registered Democrat who endorsed the Republican ticket in the last three elections. He is leaning toward Mr. Bush again this time, mainly because he thinks taxes would rise under Mr. Clinton, but, he said, \"There was a lot more optimism four years ago about what could happen with George Bush in office than after four years of seeing George Bush in office.\" **********\"The attitude now with a lot of people is, 'We know you're not going to help us, but please don't hurt us anymore,' \" he said. \"If I had to pick now, it would probably be the devil I know rather than the one I don't.\" Seeking the Positions **********A group of independent producers, oilfield service companies and others in the Southwest that calls itself People for an Energy Policy, has asked both parties to provide detailed views on energy by Sept. 1. **********\"I can't say I can support either one of them until I receive the facts,\" said Les Mallory, head of the group and chairman of an oil-spill cleanup concern, Serengeti International. \"The Administration doesn't have an energy policy in place. That concerns us.\" He, too, referred to the President's criticism of Congress for delays on the energy bill. \"Bush should share the blame,\" he said. **********Yet Mr. Bush has many loyalists. T. Boone Pickens, chairman of Mesa Inc., a major natural-gas producer, said the Administration's embrace of the Clean Air Act of 1990 and the National Energy Strategy now before Congress would help reduce the nation's reliance on imported oil. **********\"A lot of producers blame the Administration for what's happened to them, but I always ask, 'What could the Administration have done differently?' \" Mr. Pickens said. \"The National Energy Strategy will bring a great deal of help. Bush has to get credit for that, and the Clean Air Act.\" **********Kenneth L. Lay, chairman of the nation's biggest natural-gas company, the Enron Corporation, and head of the committee in Houston that was host to the Republican National Convention this week, said several positive steps by the Administration on energy had been overlooked by many in the industry. **********For example, he said, the energy bill now before a Senate-House conference committee would pare drilling costs by repealing taxes imposed by Congress in 1986; markets for natural gas will grow more rapidly because pipelines can be built faster with fewer regulations, and prices for natural gas and oil were decontrolled and the windfall-profits tax on oil was eliminated in the Reagan-Bush years. **********\"I'm a strong supporter of the President and his Administration,\" Mr. Lay said. \"As an industry, we've pretty much gotten what we felt we wanted 10 or 15 years ago.\" **********He said some major gas drillers had much to do with the plunge in natural gas prices during the last five years because they let gas flow from their wells at maximum rates after prices were deregulated. Gas prices hit a 15-year low last February, but have recovered in recent months. **********\"I don't feel we should blame that on the Administration when some not-too-smart decisions were made by some participants in our industry,\" Mr. Lay said. Too Few Pockets **********Robert A. Mosbacher Jr., an energy executive in Houston who is the son of the former Commerce Secretary and Bush campaign adviser, Robert A. Mosbacher, said that one of the problems facing the Bush fund-raisers was that there are fewer oil executives and less money today than in past years. **********But he said that when oil executives compared the Bush and Clinton positions on energy, most would probably line up behind the President. **********\"Most of what this President said he would do to help the energy industry, he has done,\" he said. \"We have the burden of making our case as clearly as we can, and that's what we're about to do.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/02/world/japanese-governor-resigns-in-campaign-scandal.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1992-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 361, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japanese Governor Resigns in Campaign Scandal", "print_headline": "Japanese Governor Resigns in Campaign Scandal", "body_text": " **********A widening political scandal claimed its second prominent victim when the Governor of Niigata prefecture announced today that he was resigning because one of his aides probably accepted an improper contribution from a trucking company with ties to organized crime. **********The resignation of Kiyoshi Kaneko, a rare event for a sitting governor, follows the stunning news last week that the governing Liberal Democratic Party's shadowy kingmaker, Shin Kanemaru, was stepping down from his party posts because he had accepted an improper contribution from the same company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. **********Mr. Kanemaru admitted an aide had taken 500 million yen, or about $4 million.

As a result, 9.2 million people are now out of work, nearly 800,000 fewer than in June. **********Some private economists said the figures, which were better than most expected, meant that moderate expansion had replaced weak recovery.

In New York State, unemployment fell to 8 percent, from 8.7 percent in October; in New York City to 10.5 percent from 11 percent. But in New Jersey, unemployment rose to 8.7 percent, from 8.1 percent in October and 7.1 percent in November of last year. Data for Connecticut were not released this week.  [ Page 47. ] **********\"Some of the darkest clouds over the tristate economy are breaking up and moving on,\" said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"But it is much too soon to throw your hat up in the air.\" He said the recovery in jobs could be slow and uneven. **********In California, unemployment rose to 10.1 percent, the highest rate among the large industrial states, from 9.8 percent in October and 7.3 percent a year earlier. In Illinois, the rate rose to 6.2 percent from 5.5 percent, while in Ohio it rose to 7.4 percent from 7.2. But Michigan's rate fell to 7.9 percent from 8.6. **********The November unemployment report, the first comprehensive measure of the economy's performance for the month, was quickly interpreted as a likely brake on the stimulus package being prepared by President-elect Bill Clinton. That notion reassured investors worried about inflation, producing a small rise in long-term bond prices and a corresponding drop in interest rates. Figures Are 'Quite Nice' **********Alan Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton University and an informal adviser to Mr. Clinton, said: \"The last four to six weeks of data have been quite nice. My guess is, if we get another six weeks of improving data like the last six weeks, the whole idea of fiscal stimulus\" -- that is, spurring the economy through increased deficit spending -- \"will be stillborn.\" **********In Little Rock, Ark., George Stephanopoulos, the spokesman for the President-elect, called the jobs report \"good news.\" He added, \"One of the more encouraging signs is that actually more jobs were created\" and pledged that the Clinton team would continue to watch the job market \"very closely.\" **********His tone was noticeably different from the grudging approach to post-election economic reports that the Clinton team took until now. Response of Bush Adviser **********The Bush Administration adopted a largely hands-off approach to the economy, hoping a recovery to the prolonged slump would appear before the election. During the campaign, President Bush pointed to six straight quarters of economic growth, but the turnaround seemed too weak then to overcome the public's restiveness over lackluster job and income growth. **********Michael J. Boskin, the President's top economic adviser, said the data \"provide further evidence of continuing improvement in the economy.\" It is particularly encouraging, he said, that \"the good news is spreading to the labor market.\" **********Assuming that the employment gains are sustained, he added, \"this would be the final piece in the puzzle of a more normal, self-reinforcing expansion.\"  Economists were encouraged not only by the job gains -- 105,000 for nonfarm payrolls and 420,000 as gauged by the department's survey of households -- but by the fact that people worked longer hours. In addition, a third of the payroll increase took place in factories.  The unexpected increase of 35,000 factory jobs followed declines totaling 205,000 in the preceding three months, with gains widespread among industries producing both durable and nondurable goods. **********The labor-market report was not, however, without sober elements. Retailing jobs, for example, rose by less than they usually do in November, resulting in a 46,000 decline after seasonal adjustment. And construction jobs fell 11,000, reversing a small October rise and leaving the number of construction jobs virtually unchanged over the last year. **********Analysts also noted that 45,000 of the 105,000 additional payroll jobs last month reflected only the very brief employment at polling places on Election Day. **********\"There are still a number of things troubling the economy,\" observed William C. Dudley, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, citing in particular a lag in income growth and a deterioration in the nation's recently thriving export sector, now that the economies of various large trading partners are in decline. He estimated that if the Clinton team came forward with a stimulus package, it might involve $25 billion, half of what was once discussed. **********The average workweek in the private sector rose 12 minutes, to 34.7 hours, the highest in more than five years; the average includes part-time jobs. The workweek in factories, meanwhile, also expanded 12 minutes to match its highest reading since 1966. Long hours are often seen as a precursor to new hiring as employers exhaust their ability to handle increasing amounts of business with the existing work force. **********The combination of more workers and longer workweeks drove the index of aggregate hours to 122.2, from 121.4 in October, indicating a sizable increase in industrial output for the month. **********Yet another favorable sign in today's report was upward revisions in the payroll numbers for September and October, the former turning a 72,000 decline into a 12,000 advance. **********\"The economy looks stronger across the board,\" said Norman Robertson, chief economist for the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. \"It's not really in much need of a shot in the arm.\" Adds to Positive News **********Today's figures follow a string of recent positive economic statistics. Those included falling first-time claims for jobless benefits and a report on gross domestic product for the third quarter that raised the growth rate to 3.9 percent from a 2.7 percent rate that itself had been higher than analysts expected. **********According to the Labor Department's household survey, the labor force expanded by 279,000 last month after losses totaling 600,000 from June to October. This combined with the biggest job gain in 14 months to cut the ranks of the unemployed by 141,000. **********Although two-thirds of the November job gains were accounted for by adult women, a large number of women also entered the labor force; their unemployment rate remained at 6.1 percent. **********The volatile teen-age jobless rate jumped 1.9 points to 20.2 percent, but remained under the September level. **********But the jobless rate for adult men showed substantial improvement. It tumbled four-tenths of a point to 6.8 percent as fewer men sought work while jobs grew moderately. **********Geographically, the department also reported, the jobless rate eased a tenth of a point in each of three regions: the Northeast, to 8 percent; in the South, to 6.8 percent, and in the Midwest, to 5.9 percent. The rate in the West climbed a tenth of a point, to 8.7 percent. **********The report also indicated some lessening of unemployment-related hardship, with jobless spells of more than six months dropping by 170,000, the first significant decline since mid-1989. This helped push the average duration of joblessness down to 18.2 weeks, the level prevailing for most of the summer, from 19.4 weeks in October. Gains Among Self-Employed **********And the number of people who lost their last job -- as opposed to those who quit or were entering or re-entering the labor force -- tumbled by 435,000. **********Just over half of the rise in employment under the household survey occurred among the self-employed. That gain more than made up for a sharp decline in October. **********Average hourly earnings for private production workers advanced six-tenths of a percent last month, with weekly earnings up a hefty 1.1 percent, an indication of improved spending power. **********The payroll report found that the proportion of manufacturing industries adding workers soared to 56.5 percent in November, the highest level since April, from 37.1 percent in October."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/05/world/britain-wary-of-using-us-air-power-in-bosnia.html": {"writer_name": "William Schmidt", "pub_date": "1992-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 718, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Britain Wary of Using U.S. Air Power in Bosnia", "print_headline": "Britain Wary of Using U.S. Air Power in Bosnia", "body_text": " **********While the British say they are helping to draft a United Nations resolution that would bar Serbian combat flights over Bosnia and Herzegovina , policymakers here are leery about using United States or allied warplanes to enforce an air-exclusion zone over the embattled republic. **********Among other things, both the British and the French have indicated in recent weeks that they are concerned that United States air power could put European troops serving with United Nations peacekeeping forces in Bosnia at greater risk of reprisal attacks from the Serbs.

A 'Deliberate Attack' **********The victims who died had tried to escape the fighting by locking themselves inside a camp hut, but the hut was set afire by the brawlers, officials said. Alistair Asprey, the colony's Secretary for Security, said the dead were northern Vietnamese who had been surrounded and outnumbered in the fight. **********\"It was a deliberate attack on a group of people and a deliberate case of arson,\" he said. **********Firing tear gas, hundreds of riot police officers restored order to the camp in the remote New Territories area about four hours after the fighting started. **********Officials said late today that 400 of the 2,600 northerners in Shek Kong had been moved out of the camp, which houses a total 9,000 boat people. They were taken to other camps, the officials said, adding that the rest of the northerners would be evacuated in the next day or so.  Preventing False Rumors **********Some 90 boat people have been detained for questioning, but so far there have been no arrests in connection with the riot. **********The Governor, Sir David Wilson, and top security officials toured Shek Kong early today. Mr. Wilson called the incident \"a terrible tragedy,\" and said he had ordered officials at all other camps to release the details of the fire and the fighting, to prevent false rumors from igniting new outbreaks of violence. **********The fighting started in a special section of the camp that housed some 800 boat people who had volunteered to return home to Vietnam under a United Nations program. The volunteers, an official said, were to have been flown back to Vietnam within a few weeks. Officials said the riot would not affect plans to repatriate refugees. **********Relief workers have long warned that tensions inside the crude, crowded camps could erupt into serious violence, and in the past there have been deaths and injuries from factional fights and gang rivalries. Officials acknowledged that despite adequate patrols and supervision, the camps were in fact powder kegs. Tension in the Camps **********Speaking at a news conference, officials were at a loss to explain specific factors and causes behind the gang rivlaries and north-south tensions within the camps. Northern and southern Vietnam have vastly different cultures and levels of economic development, and political differences stemming from the long civil war won by the Communist North. Officials say people from the South who arrive here typically have higher education levels than those of the northerners in the camps, many of whom were farmers and fishermen in Vietnam. **********In addition, tension has grown in the camps between those who are willing to go home and those who still dream of a life in the West. Other factors are the realization that the majority of boat people have little chance of qualifying as political refugees, and the bleak conditions of the camps."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/11/business/market-place-buying-exxon-commission-free.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1992-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 837, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Buying Exxon, Commission-Free", "print_headline": "Market Place; Buying Exxon, Commission-Free", "body_text": " **********DO you want to own stocks, but hate brokers? The Exxon Corporation has a program for you. **********Exxon, the nation's largest oil company, announced a plan yesterday that for the first time enables investors to buy Exxon shares without ever talking to a broker, or ever paying any commissions. **********The plan, a substantial enlargement of Exxon's dividend reinvestment program, made that program one of the broader ones in terms of features, but it broke no new ground in providing features for investors. It is generally agreed that such plans, which exist at hundreds of companies, are a good deal for individual investors, but relatively few investors choose to participate. **********The change will make it possible for investors to buy shares every week through the plan, up to a maximum investment of $8,000 a month, or $72,000 a year, up from $60,000. For investors who do not already have a stake in Exxon, an account can be opened for as little as $250, with additional investments as low as $50. Formerly, an investor needed to own at least one share acquired outside the plan, presumably through a broker. **********That weekly feature is unusual. Many plans allow purchases only every month, and some only quarterly. **********As in most plans, there will be no commissions or fees charged on shares bought through the Exxon plan. But anyone who sells shares through the plan will pay the commissions Exxon incurs, plus a $5 fee. **********An unusual new feature is that Exxon, which is based in Irving, Tex., will keep investors' stock certificates if they wish. That cuts down on paperwork costs for the company, and makes it possible for shareholders to be certain the share certificates will not be lost or stolen. Another unusual feature is that investors may transfer shares to other investors' accounts at no charge. A person might, for example, open plans for each of five grandchildren, and put 10 shares in each account. **********One aspect of the plan that has not been changed is that it enables investors to reinvest all or part of their dividends in additional shares automatically, without incurring brokerage commissions. Exxon's plan buys those shares on the open market, rather than issuing new shares, as some companies do. And it does not provide a discount on the market price, as do about 100 companies, mostly banks and utilities. **********More than 900 companies now offer some form of dividend reinvestment program, according to a new book by Charles B. Carlson, \"Buying Stocks Without a Broker,\" published by McGraw-Hill. Mr. Carlson argues that for many investors it makes more sense to accumulate a portfolio of shares in such companies without paying commissions, rather than either buying them through a broker or paying fees to a mutual fund company. **********Exxon shares fell 12.5 cents, to $55.375, yesterday. The company's relatively high annual dividend, now $2.68 a share, for a yield of nearly 5 percent, has helped make the shares attractive to individual investors, and the company estimates that about 60 to 65 percent of its shares are held by individuals, an unusually high percentage. **********Exxon's current plan has about 120,000 shareholders in it, but they collectively own only about 3 percent of the company's shares. Aside from the dividends, only a few million dollars a year are invested through the plan in Exxon's shares, despite the substantial savings on commissions. **********Why so little? One answer is that most investors get their information through brokers, and the brokers have no interest in promoting such plans. Another is that most plans, including Exxon's, are not open to holders who keep their shares in brokerage accounts. Failure Group Falters **********It pays to pay attention to the analysts who work for a company's underwriters. **********The truth of that old Wall Street saying was demonstrated again yesterday for holders of the Failure Group, a company that specializes in explaining why things go wrong in engineering and scientific projects. Yesterday morning it announced that business was not up to expectations and said it planned to reduce its staff of 540 employees by 5 percent to 10 percent. **********Failure's shares dropped 75 cents, to $10, yesterday. But the big fall, of $2.50 a share, had come the day before when Michael Lundy, who follows Failure for Hambrecht & Quist, cut his earnings estimates and when Laura Conigliaro, who watches the company for Prudential Securities, put out a report on the stock. Neither analyst returned phone calls yesterday. The firms were the lead underwriters in 1990 when Failure went public at $13 a share. **********Jonathan Wolter, Failure's comptroller and acting chief financial officer, said he had no idea why the two analysts had acted the day before, although he said they might have been notified on Monday of the company's plan to hold a conference call yesterday morning. It was on that call that the company released the bad news."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/10/business/us-sees-months-of-talks-needed-for-world-trade-pact.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1992-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 928, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Sees Months of Talks Needed for World Trade Pact", "print_headline": "U.S. Sees Months of Talks Needed for World Trade Pact", "body_text": " **********The Bush Administration said today that weeks or months of negotiations would be required before it could accept a proposed GATT agreement to pull down international trade barriers. **********With the European Community already unhappy about reductions in agricultural subsidies called for by the proposal, the Administration reaction today insured that the five-year-old talks known as the Uruguay Round, for the country in which they began, will drag into the spring on a wide range of issues. There are 108 countries in the negotiations, which seek to reduce obstacles to trade and broaden the authority of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based organization that sets rules for international trade. **********Julius Katz, the deputy trade representative overseeing the United States negotiating team, told the House Agriculture Committee today that \"considerable work remains to be done with respect to the negotiations on market access for goods and services and the schedules for internal support and export subsidy in agriculture, and only when these negotiations are completed can we assess the true worth of the entire package of agreements.\" **********The United States and other countries will give their formal responses to the proposal in Geneva on Monday. Originally envisioned as a chance for countries to endorse or turn down the pact, the meeting now is likely to be the beginning of further talks. **********One requirement of the current proposal, presented by GATT's Director General, Arthur Dunkel, in late December, is for countries to reduce their spending on agricultural export subsidies by at least 36 percent in six years and the tonnage by at least 24 percent. Farmers picketed President Bush during his visit to Australia last week to protest America's wheat-export subsidies, which were enacted by Congress in response to Europe's even larger farm-export subsidies. **********The proposal would also reduce some Japanese trade barriers that have resisted American efforts during President Bush's current visit to Tokyo, such as Japanese limits on imported rice. **********President Bush in Tokyo and several Administration officials here said today that the broad proposal put forward on Dec. 20 was a step forward but would require changes and clarifications. Administration officials had hoped that they would need very few amendments to the text. **********\"Both the United States and Japan believe that Director General Dunkel's proposed text is an important step that helps establish momentum to bring the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion,\" said a communique issued at the end of President Bush's meetings with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan. \"Of course, the Dunkel proposal is not a final text.\" **********The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said Mr. Dunkel's text \"is probably where we should have been a year ago.\" **********But the Administration believes the proposal still does not address enough subjects in adequate detail for the plan to win any immediate endorsement. The proposal does not cover the opening of markets currently closed to services, like insurance, and goods, like computers. It also does not provide details by country of how much agricultural subsidies are to be reduced each year. April 15 Target **********These issues are to be negotiated by April 15, and the Administration response today indicates that even the issues included in Mr. Dunkel's text will not be settled until then, and possibly later. **********Mr. Katz expressed skepticism about Mr. Dunkel's goal of concluding all negotiations by early April. \"I do not know at this point whether such a timetable is achievable,\" he said. \"The United States will not rush to sign an agreement just to meet a deadline.\" **********On a related trade issue, a senior American trade official said today that the United States would definitely impose up to $1.5 billion in sanctions on imports from China next Thursday unless an agreement on patent and copyright protection is reached in talks scheduled to begin today.. **********China announced on Tuesday that if its exports were penalized it would impose up to $1.2 billion in sanctions on imports from the United States. The senior United States trade official, who insisted on anonymity, said he believed the Chinese were serious but that this would not affect the Administration's willingness to act. **********Chinese retaliation would not help the Administration's efforts to insure that China retain its most-favored-nation trade status without restrictions, the official added. Dimming Chance in Congress **********The prospects of a GATT pact winning Congressional approval have also been slowly dimming this year as trade increasingly becomes an issue in the Presidential campaign. Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Subcommittee on International Trade and sometimes supports the Administration, today became the first senior member of Congress with trade responsibilities to criticize Mr. Dunkel's proposal. **********Industries that would lose their protection from imports will oppose the agreement in Congress, and the proposed pact contains too few benefits for exporters to back it enthusiastically, he said. **********\"In order to overcome their opposition, mainstream U.S. agricultural, manufacturing and service industries must be willing to strongly support the round,\" Mr. Baucus wrote in a letter to Mrs. Hills. \"I do not see this support as forthcoming.\" **********Administration officials offered specific criticisms today of the pact's visions on agriculture, patents and copyrights. **********Mrs. Hills said Mr. Dunkel's proposed schedules for introducing international protections of patents and copyrights was \"a little excessive.\" Pharmaceutical patents would not be protected in developing countries for 10 years under the proposal, and the poorest developing countries would be allowed extensions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/11/business/the-media-business-robertson-withdraws-upi-bid.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1992-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1251, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Robertson Withdraws U.P.I.

Three Decades of Losses **********U.P.I. has run losses for most of the last three decades, and in the last 10 years has been been handed off through a succession of owners who all proved unable to turn a profit. With the collapse of the Robertson deal, the 85-year-old news agency remains $60 million in debt with almost no place to turn. **********While U.P.I. has shown a persistent knack for escaping shutdowns and said today that it was still talking to alternative bidders, its prospects are bleak. In the court auction, the only bidders besides Mr. Robertson were companies that wanted to buy individual assets at prices ranging from $12,000 to $125,000. **********The likely demise of U.P.I., at least as an organization with bureaus around the world, would mark the end of an news service that was first to report the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and scores of other major stories and also started journalists including David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite on their careers. Scoops and Penny-Pinching **********In the annals of journalism, U.P.I. was uniquely scrappy, notorious for pinching pennies, but frequently managed to scoop its bigger competitor, The Associated Press. **********U.P.I. news reports are received by 2,000 news outlets worldwide, said Steve Geimann, the agency's executive editor, who declined to say how many of those were broadcast stations. National Public Radio subscribes to U.P.I.'s service and broadcasts its reports during news broadcasts. **********There is no longer much room for cutting costs without curtailing much if not most of U.P.I.'s network of correspondents. The staff has already been cut to 500 from about 1,840 in 1984, and reporters and editors, who were never well paid, are working under a 20 percent pay cut. **********Mr. Robertson said his auditors had concluded that he would have to invest at least $31 million over the next 18 months in new technology and, even then, would not necessarily turn a profit. Among other problems, he said, about 32 percent of U.P.I.'s clients decided to drop the service because it no longer has the \"depth and breadth\" needed to compete with The Associated Press and other news organizations.  Victim of the Bottom Line **********Unless a buyer comes forward, or U.P.I. makes Draconian cuts to stop losing money for the first time in years, the lawyer representing the company's creditors said his group would have to cease operations. **********\"It's a terrible dilemma for us,\" said Dennis O'Dea, general counsel for the creditors, which include A.T.& T., GTE Spacenet and the union representing reporters and editors. \"We do understand the desire of the company to remain in place, and we do feel a civic responsibility. But this is a very hard dollars-and-sense decision.\" **********Mr. Van Bennekom, the U.P.I. president, said the company was still evaluating its options. \"We of course had every intention of going through with this,\" he said at a news conference with Mr. Robertson. \"This is not the desired outcome.\" **********Many U.P.I. alumni said today's news was regrettable but not surprising, and some said the time had come to end the prolonged agony. **********\"It is time to turn out the lights and provide a decent funeral,\" said H. L. Stevenson, who served as U.P.I.'s editor in chief from 1972 to 1983. \"The media in the last decade decided it could not or would not support the concept of two strong, competing wire services. It may be a year or two, but the result surely will be less information and less competition, and the loser will be the average reader or viewer.\"  'I Will Miss It,' Says Brinkley **********Mr. Brinkley, who worked for U.P.I. in Alabama in the 1940's and now is host of the ABC News program \"This Week,\" said: \"I will miss it, but I don't know how many others might. I don't think the public really pays attention to which news service writes the stories.\" **********The end of U.P.I. would mark the end of a distinctively American institution with reporters who slaved to be first to bring the world news of major events. Founded as United Press by E. W. Scripps in 1907, it became United Press International in 1958 when it merged with William Randolph Hearst's International News Service. It was conceived as an alternative to The Associated Press, a cooperative news organization owned by its member newspapers across the country; U.P.I. always ranked second to A.P. in size and the number of subscribers. **********Always struggling for profitability, U.P.I. developed a legendary reputation for its stinginess on expenses. At the same time, it invested heavily in building a worldwide corps of reporters and broke major news stories time and again. In 1940 a U.P.I. reporter, Edward Morgan, was the first to report the assassination of Trotsky in Mexico by agents of Stalin. Mr. Morgan went on to become a radio and television correspondent at ABC. Pearl Harbor and J.F.K.'s Slaying **********For several days U.P.I. was also the only news organization at Pearl Harbor after the Japanese attack in 1941. U.P.I. was also the first news organization to alert the world to the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas, a classic story of journalistic one-upmanship. The U.P.I. White House correspondent, Merriman Smith, was riding with with the press pool and grabbed the car's radio telephone before anybody else could move. To the furor of his rivals, he refused to give up the line as he filed an initial report. **********The Scripps family sold U.P.I. in 1982 to two Tennessee businessmen, Douglas Ruhe and William Geissler. They filed for bankruptcy, and U.P.I. was subsequently bought at a bankruptcy sale in 1986 by a Mexican businessman, Mario Vazquez Rana, and a Houston developer, Joe Russo. In 1988 Mr. Vazquez Rana, who controlled 90 percent of the company, sold it to Infotechnology Inc. **********Infotechnology filed for bankruptcy in August, and the company's creditors have been struggling to find a new buyer ever since. **********Part of the problem is that U.P.I. was barred by the bankruptcy judge from talking to alternative bidders during the 30-day period that Mr. Robertson was given to analyze the company's finances. That left the company and its creditors scrambling for new investors with very little time remaining before it ran out of cash. **********Steven Geimann, the executive editor of U.P.I., said he remained optimistic that a last-minute deal could save the company. \"All afternoon we've been having discussions with groups interested, people interested, in doing a deal with U.P.I.,\" he said. \"Given that there's still interest, I'm still optimistic.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/11/business/media-business-advertising-vogue-s-plans-for-centennial-big-issue-big-party.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1992-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 662, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Vogue's Plans for Centennial: A Big Issue and a Big Party", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Vogue's Plans for Centennial: A Big Issue and a Big Party", "body_text": " **********THIS is the season for prominent New York institutions to boast about their ages. First, Brooke Astor celebrated her 90th birthday with a party for hundreds at the Seventh Regiment Armory. The Metropolitan Opera recently marked 25 years at Lincoln Center. Now Vogue, another New York staple, is celebrating its 100th anniversary with a record number of pages for its April issue, a hardcover book and a party at the New York Public Library. **********For magazines, not only is aging proof of survival of the fittest, but editors and publishers view anniversaries as a golden opportunity to sell advertising. And in this bleak magazine environment, no sales stone can be left unturned. **********Not since Cosmopolitan celebrated Helen Gurley Brown's silver anniversary two years ago has a publication begun such an aggressive campaign as Vogue has planned for its own birthday. Vogue's publisher, Anne Sutherland Fuchs, said this week that the April issue would carry a record 379 pages, up from 231 in April 1991, and that revenues would jump to $11.8 million, from $6.6 million a year earlier. **********That the Newhouse family, which owns Vogue, also owns Random House, has its advantages. Random House will publish \"On the Edge: Images From 100 Years of Vogue.\" And on April 2, the magazine will be the host to 700 for dinner at the library. **********The special Cosmopolitan issue in May 1990 brought a record number of advertising pages, said the publisher, Seth Hoyt. Cosmopolitan also held a party at the Rainbow Room that was broadcast on \"Entertainment Tonight\" and on several network news programs. **********Good Housekeeping also reported a record number of ad pages, 281.4, for its Centennial issue in May 1985. **********If anything, the turmoil in the magazine industry has given Vogue an advantage. While Harper's Bazaar will mark its 125th anniversary in October, it is the midst of bringing in a new editor, Elizabeth Tilberis, who joins the magazine in May, leaving it rudderless for now. Harper's plans to celebrate with a special issue honoring its birthday, but \"Everything surrounding that issue is in transition,\" a Hearst spokeswoman said yesterday. **********Elle, on the other hand, is still an American baby, having just begun here in 1984, so anniversaries are perhaps not yet appropriate. **********What is interesting is that some advertisers are apparently willing to buy additional pages in a magazine that is bound to be accused of the worst clutter yet. Even so, Chanel's Karl Lagerfeld is designing a special ad for Vogue, though the company generally avoids tailoring ads to individual publications. **********Arie Kopelman, Chanel Inc.'s president and chief executive, said Chanel would slightly increase the number of pages it buys. \"I think the book will be around for a long time, and will have high pass-along, so we wanted to make a bigger splash,\" he said. **********Mr. Kopelman added that what advertisers were seeking now was more editorial support. \"A magazine is a vehicle for our advertising, and we want editorial support,\" he said, referring to coverage of Chanel products in the magazine. Chanel could only expect what was fair, he added. **********Vogue's editor in chief, Anna Wintour, said the nation's top 10 models will be on the cover of the special issue, which will carry a 24-page excerpt from the book. **********With retailers in the doldrums, some are willing to do tie-in campaigns with Vogue. Bergdorf Goodman will design a set of windows tied to the Vogue anniversary issue, and the Saks Fifth Avenue store in Los Angeles will do the same. **********Ms. Fuchs said Vogue's biggest category of advertisers was beauty aids, with 120 pages, followed by fashion, with 119 pages; shoes, with 49 pages, and retailing, with 35 pages. **********She added that through May, the magazine will carry 1,097 pages, up by four-tenths of a percent from the previous year's 1,076 pages."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/19/world/assailing-iran-algeria-recalls-its-envoy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 626, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Assailing Iran, Algeria Recalls Its Envoy", "print_headline": "Assailing Iran, Algeria Recalls Its Envoy", "body_text": " **********Reflecting the deterioration of what used to be warm relations, Algeria recalled its Ambassador to Iran today and asked the Iranian Ambassador here to leave the country. **********The moves were a reaction to Teheran's unabashed support of Algeria's Islamic fundamentalist opposition, which was in the process of winning a majority in the new Algerian Parliament before the Government canceled the vote. A senior Algerian foreign affairs official said tonight that Algeria had demanded a \"clear and public\" reversal of the criticism of the Algiers Government that has appeared in the official Iranian press in the week since the cancellation. **********The Ambassador to Paris was also recalled, apparently over France's denunciation of the suspension last week of elections that would have given the fundamentalists control of the Algerian Parliament. But more severe measures were apparently being contemplated for the Islamic Government of Iran, which often relied on Algeria as an intermediary with the West. **********Al Watan, an independent Algerian daily that is close to the Government of Prime Minister Sid Ahmed Ghozali, said today that the Government was considering severing relations with Iran. \"The verbal warfare that has been launched by the Iranian regime ever since the resignation of President Chadli has gone beyond any tolerable limits in the view of Algerian authorities,\" the newspsper said.

Runoff elections, set for last Thursday, were also canceled.  President Chadli Benjedid, who championed the democratization process, resigned after what is widely believed to have been a stern warning from the top command of the Algerian Army, which opposes any sharing of power with the fundamentalists.

The Foreign Ministry said relations between the two countries were very tense but would not confirm that a break in diplomatic relations was imminent. **********There are indications that Algerian fundamentalists have multiplied their contacts with the Iranian Government, although officials of the Islamic Salvation Front have vehemently denied a report in The Independent, the British daily, that Iran has given the party $3 million in financing.

The official added that during the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, which lasted until 1988, Algeria did \"the best we could\" to keep Iranian-Arab relations on good terms when many other Arab countries openly sided with Iraq. **********The only Arab government that seems to be siding with the fundamentalists against the Algerian Government is that of the Sudan, which is run by a military junta largely made up of Islamic fundamentalists. **********While Islamic movements including the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Jordan and a group called Al Nahda in Tunisia supported the fundamentalists, virtually all Arab governments seemed to a utter a collective sigh of relief when the Algerian Army stopped the fundamentalists' ascent to power."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/05/business/canada-s-mighty-banks-on-a-march-to-the-south.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1992-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1489, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canada's Mighty Banks on a March to the South", "print_headline": "Canada's Mighty Banks on a March to the South", "body_text": " **********A new group has joined the cross-border shopping spree: Canadian banks. Prodded by the drive for free trade between America and Canada and the recent wave of bank mergers in the United States that has threatened their North American standing, Canada's banks are jockeying to acquire American assets. *********** Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the country's second-largest bank, bought $750 million of secured loans from the failed Bank of New England in 1990 and now has its line out for a full-scale bank. *********** The National Bank of Canada, the country's sixth-largest, bought secured commercial loans from the Bank of New England and nine branches outside of New England from the New England Financial Corporation, an arm of the Boston Bancorp, giving it 16 offices in the United States, more than any Canadian bank. \"Our strategy is to build on what we have in mid-size lending to mid-sized business,\" said Pierre Paquette, senior executive vice president. *********** Since it was acquired seven years ago by the Bank of Montreal, Harris Bancorp of Chicago has bought 13 suburban banks. Anticipating the purchase of at least one more significant financial institution in the United States, Matthew W. Barrett, chairman and chief executive of the Bank of Montreal, said he expects the United States to account for 50 percent of earnings by the year 2000, up from less than 30 percent today. **********Canadian banks are foraging to the south in part because they are reaching expansion limits at home. Although Canada has only a handful of banks, compared with 12,400 in the United States, it is perhaps the most overbanked country in the world in terms of branches per customer, with more bank branches than bars, according to Peter C. Newman, a columnist for Mclean's. **********\"We have 25 percent of the market here,\" noted Allan R. Taylor, chairman and chief executive of the Royal Bank, Canada's largest. \"To achieve 30 percent would take a great deal of doing. The United States is the most logical place for expansion.\" **********And American regulators seem to be welcoming Canadian buyers wholeheartedly, in part because they are more robust and profitable than their cousins to the south. The southern expansion is not likely either to be slowed by the crisis afflicting Canada's richest family, the Reichmann brothers, whose Olympia & York real estate empire, one of the world's largest, recently ran into a liquidity crisis. Bank shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange have fallen about 15 percent since Jan. 1, due to the difficulties of the Reichmanns and profit-taking after setting new highs last year. But the banks seem well postioned to weather any losses. **********Analysts say the Olympia & York developments might even provide greater impetus for banks to push into the American consumer market. \"Once again, as in the failure of Dome Petroleum or Campeau Corporation, we're finding that corporate banking tends to be high risk,\" said Alain Tuchmaier, financial services analyst for McLean McCarthy Inc., a subsidiary of the Deutsche Bank of Frankfurt. \"This will intensify efforts to diversify into retail banking -- clearly one of the potential avenues of growth in the U.S.\" **********Canadian banks are among the most profitable and secure in the world. While loan losses have been rising during the recession, which has hit Canadians far harder than Americans, four of the Big Six banks still reported record profits for last year. Over the past two decades, just 20 thrifts and two small regional banks failed in Canada, compared with hundreds in the United States. **********The reasons for their good performance are a savings rate that is two to three times that in the United States and a friendly regulatory environment. Seen as a great unifying force, banks here have been left relatively free to run their own affairs. Nationwide banking is encouraged. Banks even own investment houses, whereas in the United States banks have been largely barred from stock market activities since 1933. **********Thanks to the favorable regulatory environment, Canada's Big Six national banks -- Royal, Canadian Imperial, Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto Dominion and the National Bank of Canada -- control about half of all Canadian personal deposits, nearly two-thirds of personal loans and one-third of all mortgages outstanding. The rest of the Canadian market is divided by 58 smaller banks, 56 of them foreign owned; 80 trust companies and 3,000 credit union branches. **********But some analysts say they need to expand in the United States if only to protect their positions in Canada. As barriers come down under the 1989 Canadian-American free trade agreement, warned James L. Darroch, professor of international business at York University, \"Canadian banks risk losing market share in Canada if they can't help their clients in the United States.\" **********The merger wave in the United States has also added a sense of urgency. Since the marriage of Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover, the Royal Bank has dropped to third place among banks in North America, from second. \"The Canadians desperately want to find the right property,\" said Jeffrey N. Wieser, former president of the Manufacturers Hanover Bank of Canada. **********High in the towers above Bay Street overlooking gray-blue expanses of Lake Ontario, senior officers of Canada's top banks sift piles of data on American banks. \"What we have in mind is buying something that is really small and then adding to it,\" said Mr. Taylor of the Royal Bank. \"We'll start regional, but of course we have national aspirations because that's what we know best.\" **********The Royal Bank was rumored last year to be interested in linking with the Chase Manhattan Bank of New York, which would give it access to a huge retail business. But both banks have stoutly denied any such marriage plans. Royal's chief acknowledges that his special acquisitions committee has looked closely at \"maybe 30 or 35\" American banks, but will not name prospective candidates. **********Yet the name of one candidate came out last fall in a bidding war for Security Bancorp Inc. of Southgate, Mich. Royal faced off with the First American Bank Corporation of Kalamazoo, Mich., which won with a share swap worth $552 million, nearly three times book value. Price rather than country of origin seemed to be the deciding factor. \"I think three times book is too much, just way too much of a premium,\" Mr. Taylor said. **********Jeffrey S. Chisholm, vice chairman of the Bank of Montreal, said his institution is also looking hard at the Middle West. \"We need a good cultural fit,\" he said. **********Southward expansion is not without pitfalls. Royal Trustco Ltd. for example, talked glowingly about North American prospects in 1989, when it paid $212 million for the Seattle-based Pacific First Financial Corporation. It has since had to write off an unexpected large volume of bad loans. **********Misjudgment of cross-border market risks were spotlighted in the collapse of retail empire of Robert Campeau; Peoples Jewellers Ltd., whose Texas-based Zale Corporation recently filed for Chapter 11, and Canadian Tire, which muffed an expansion in Texas a few years ago. **********Not all Canadian banks even agree that an American presence is desireable. \"You can't buy a bank in the United States that would give you a reasonable amount of market share without spending a huge amount of money, and you can't make money in the United States unless you have a big market share,\" said R. M. Thomson, chairman and chief executive of the $68.9 billion Toronto Dominion Bank, which has been especially hard hit by the economic downturn in Ontario. \"We feel we can build a strong North American position without buying anything.\" PREPARED FOR OLYMPIA & YORK **********Noting that assets of the Reichmann family's Olympia & York real estate and natural resources empire still outweigh their debts, many banking analysts here see the crisis as essentially a short-term cash problem that should not impair banks. **********Canadian banks' outstanding loans to the Reichmanns are believed to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion, representing about 10 percent of the industry's equity base. **********Kersi Doodha, a banking analyst at Maison Placements Canada Inc., said the banks over two years might eventually have to write off 20 percent of their Reichmann exposure, or about $600 million. But the industry traditionally makes generous provisions for possible write-offs -- $3.2 billion this year at the Big Six banks. Against such numbers, Mr. Doodha said, \"the Olympia and York situation is really quite manageable.\" **********Allan R. Taylor, head of the Royal Bank, said that even if there should be some Olympia & York write-offs, he sees no need to alter the $740 million in loan-loss provisions his bank has set for this fiscal year. Olympia & York's debt restructuring, Mr. Taylor observed, \"is not a life-threatening event for the Royal Bank of Canada.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/27/business/company-news-credit-card-for-kmart.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 104, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Credit Card for Kmart", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Credit Card for Kmart", "body_text": " **********The Kmart Corporation, the nation's second-largest retailer, will accept American Express cards in its Kmart stores starting in the spring, the two companies said.

Previously, the wholesale price has been lightly regulated. Under the ruling, the resellers could also buy \"unbundled\" service, or some of a carrier's services, for 30 cents a minute, rather than all of a carrier's services for $1. This could result in lower retail prices and higher reseller profit margins. **********Pacific Telesis fears this arrangement would reduce its profit margins and force it to raise retail prices, which it does not want to do, or invest less money in its cellular network, which it also does not want to do. **********Nearly four years ago, the California commission began investigating the duopoly structure adopted by the Federal Communications Commission in 1982. Under that plan, no more than two carriers can offer wireless telephone service in each of 734 markets. The local telephone company, often GTE or a regional Bell company, got one license for service; the other was determined by lottery. **********The F.C.C.'s theory was that few people would be interested in cellular service and that competition between two carriers would eventually bring down initially high cellular prices.

Moreover, a decade after the start-up of cellular systems, prices have remained high and in most major markets are identical, a study by the General Accounting Office found last summer. **********\"We remain concerned about the actual level of competition in the cellular market,\" the California Public Utilities Commission said last week. \"We also observe that the demand for cellular has expanded to the point where there are signs we may be reaching a broader market more quickly than anticipated.\" **********New wireless systems known as personal communications services are also on the horizon, prompting the commission to note: \"Our regulation of the marketplace for mobile communications will require further examination.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/03/business/manufacturing-grew-by-a-little-last-month.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1992-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 472, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Manufacturing Grew By a Little Last Month", "print_headline": "Manufacturing Grew By a Little Last Month", "body_text": " **********After sliding into a decline in September, the nation's manufacturing economy posted minuscule growth in October, according to a survey of the nation's purchasing managers.

Intent Must Be Proven **********But Jon F. Ash, an aviation consultant with the Global Aviation Association, who has followed many legal cases, said that Continental would have to show that American dropped its prices specifically to drive other airlines out of business and that it would raise its prices again once that was accomplished. **********\"I have not seen a set of circumstances in the industry like that,\" Mr. Ash said. \"And I have been in the industry 25 years.\" **********Morris Garfinkle, a Washington lawyer specializing in aviation, said Continental had \"an enormous uphill battle to demonstrate predatory pricing.\" **********Even if evidence showed that American's fare structure was intended to drive Continental out of business, Mr. Garfinkle said, the presentation of the case involves such complex data that it would be difficult to convince a judge or jury. **********He said Continental's motivation in filing the suit might have been to demonstrate to the creditors' committee in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding that action was being taken to salvage the airline. **********Mr. Garfinkle added that Continental might also be seeking to win support from travel agents who have been upset by the turmoil that American's price cuts have caused. **********Late yesterday, the shareholders of America West Airlines Inc. were authorized by a judge to investigate whether American's pricing strategies were intended to drive the carrier out of business. **********The order requires American to provide documents detailing its rationale for its price cuts and its 1991 and 1992 operations in markets in which it competes with America West. **********Like Continental, America West is operating under Chapter 11. **********Continental's suit accused American of setting price levels \"that would result in ruinous losses to weaken and destroy competitors.\" **********American intends to recoup its losses from lower fares, Continental said, \"by raising its prices to supracompetitive levels once those airlines and perhaps others were driven out of business or were sufficiently weakened so that they would not offer effective competition.\" **********An American spokesman, Al Becker, said the notion that American was trying to drive competitors out of business is \"preposterous.\" **********Robert L. Crandall, American's chairman, has denied trying to hurt the weaker airlines.

Checci and Wilson bought Northwest because it holds one of the most valuable aviation franchises in the world -- very broad rights to fly to Japan from the United States and to carry local traffic beyond Japan to various points in Asia. Those rights were granted to Northwest by the U.S. Government in 1946, absolutely free of charge. **********\"American cannot compete with Northwest in Asia because we have no hope of ever being granted equivalent rights,\" Mr. Crandall said. **********Mark Abels, a Northwest vice president, replied yesterday, \"Mr. Crandall's lust for our Asian route system is well known and his estimation of its great value is well founded.\" **********In a separate action, American on Tuesday asked a Federal court in Chicago to declare its pricing practices proper and lawful.

But analysts warn that there is also an issue to worry about: credit quality. **********\"The quality of municipal risk has been deteriorating because of the deteriorating condition of state and local governments,\" said Peter B. Coffin, a senior vice president and municipal bond portfolio manager at Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston. \"You simply cannot take it for granted that because it is a municipal bond you are going to get paid.\" **********William T. Reynolds, director of the municipal bond division at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, said the yield spread between bonds with top credit ratings and those with medium ratings was narrow \"and can only widen in the next few years.\" **********The credit problem has several facets. One is seen in Brevard County, Fla., the home not only of Cape Canaveral but also of a taxpayer revolt that could lead the county to refuse to pay the interest and principal on bonds, called certificates of participation, that it used to finance a county office building. Possibly Widespread Impact **********The impact of such a refusal could be felt well beyond Brevard County because this is not a case of being unable to pay; the county has the money, but may refuse to pay because it is caught in a political battle. **********Another site of concern is California, where the state's fiscal problems, which led to a prolonged budget crisis this year, are expected to continue, resulting in a further downgrading of the state's credit ratings. **********A third area is hospital bonds, especially for big city hospitals, whose credit quality could be damaged by cost-containment programs that will accompany President-elect Bill Clinton's effort to revamp the American health-care system. **********In Brevard County, the Board of Commissioners plans to vote this week on a referendum that would let voters decide if the county should continue paying what it owes on the $23.9 million it borrowed for the new government center in Viera. Payments Derive From Income **********These certificates of participation, or lease-obligation bonds, are different from general-obligation bonds in that they are not backed by the full faith and credit and taxing authority of the local government. Instead, payments of interest and principal come from income earned by the project built with the bonds, and the payments must be appropriated by the government every year. In this case, the income comes from rent the county pays for the office building. **********The reason the bonds are popular with local governments cuts to the heart of the issue in Brevard County. Because the interest and principal payments have to be appropriated each year, courts have ruled that unlike a general-obligation bond, a certificate of participation is not long-term debt and does not have to be approved by voters before it is sold. **********The government operations center in Viera has become a big political issue since the certificates were sold in 1989, in part because there was no vote on the bond issue first. The move for a referendum on whether to continue appropriating the payments of interest and principal has gained such momentum that in November two new commissioners, who promised to support a public vote, were elected to the board, giving it a 4-to-1 margin in favor of a referendum. **********Robert J. Froelich, director of municipal research and investment strategy at Van Kampen Merritt in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., said the ramifications of a vote against honoring the certificates of participation \"could be absolutely overwhelming.\" The bondholders would not be hurt, because the issue is insured. Higher Rates Held Likely **********Mr. Froelich said Brevard County could be denied access for some time to the municipal market for general- obligation or other bonds. And when it could borrow again, it would be at a much higher interest rate than it now pays. **********In addition, he argued, all other certificates of participation and lease-obligation bonds around the country would be affected, with their prices falling as investors wondered if another community would take the same route. **********The Public Securities Association says about $65 billion of certificates of participation and lease-obligation bonds are outstanding, accounting for about 5.8 percent of the $1.1 trillion municipal bond market. About $10 billion were issued in 1991, and $8 billion have been sold so far this year. **********Neil Budnick, a senior vice president of the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, the company that has insured the Brevard issue, is less worried about the consequences. He said that the impact would fall mostly on Brevard County and that he would expect investors to judge other issues on their own merits. **********As for California, Mr. Reynolds of T. Rowe Price noted that the economy there was still being hammered by cuts in military spending and was having trouble creating jobs. These and other factors, he said, will mean the state's budget crisis will continue, making the credit of the nation's largest single issuer of municipal bonds riskier and not very attractive. **********In general, Mr. Reynolds said he thinks that although the national economy is beginning to grow again, there are still signs that fiscal strains in states and local governments will continue, especially as the Federal Government pushes costs on to states and the states push them to the local level. **********Mr. Reynolds said hospitals had enjoyed a stable period for several years, adding that interest rates on hospital bonds are not \"dramatically higher\" than on other sectors of the municipal bond market. But he says this situation will probably change as the Federal Government seeks to cut the costs of medical care, resulting in revenue declines at hospitals. **********\"You will see the weaker hospitals show the strain and become greater credit risks than they are today,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/22/world/chinese-set-off-their-biggest-nuclear-explosion.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1992-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 916, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chinese Set Off Their Biggest Nuclear Explosion", "print_headline": "Chinese Set Off Their Biggest Nuclear Explosion", "body_text": " **********China today set off the largest underground nuclear test it has ever conducted, the State Department said. The explosion was thought to have a yield of about one megaton, equivalent to a million tons of TNT. **********The blast, which took place about 1 A.M. Eastern daylight time, had 70 times the explosive power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and exceeded the 150-kiloton limit observed by Washington and Moscow under a 1990 treaty, scientists said. **********The Bush Administration said it regretted the action by Beijing and urged restraint. Limit on Underground Tests **********There were sharp condemnations of China in Congress. Legislators from both major parties have been critical of what they see as an unacceptably conciliatory policy toward China by President Bush. **********[ The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement confirming that Beijing had held a nuclear test. The statement said China was in favor of \"complete prohibition on nuclear tests within the framework of effective nuclear disarmament.\" ] **********The Chinese test was only one-fifth as powerful as the largest underground test by the United States, a five-megaton blast in Alaska on Nov. 6, 1971, the most powerful underground nuclear explosion on record. A megaton is 1,000 kilotons. **********The largest underground test by the Soviet Union was a 2.8 to 4 megaton blast on Oct. 27, 1973, a year before Moscow and Washington signed a treaty limiting the size of those explosions to 150 kilotons. The pact was ratified in 1990. **********The Chinese test comes on the heels of persistent reports that Beijing is selling missile technology to Middle Eastern nations, and at a time when Beijing is rejecting all criticism of its human-rights record. **********Arms-control experts also seized the chance to criticize the Bush Administration for its opposition to a comprehensive international test-ban treaty. **********China's last and largest previous underground test, an explosion of between 50 and 200 kilotons, was on Aug. 16, 1990. **********The United States set off two underground nuclear explosions this year in Nevada, on March 26 and April 30. Both were reported to be less than 150 kilotons. **********Large underground tests, even on the scale of today's blast in China, are considerably smaller than the atmospheric explosions of the 1950's and 1960's. On Feb. 28, 1954, the United States tested a 15 megaton bomb at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. The largest atmospheric test on record was conducted by the Soviet Union, a 58-megaton explosion on Oct. 30, 1961. **********Atmospheric tests were prohibited by the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, signed by more than 100 countries. **********Today's Chinese underground explosion was situated in Xinjiang Province in northwestern China by Scandinavian seismologists, according to reports from Stockholm. In Hong Kong, scientists at first thought they were registering an earthquake. **********\"This suggests that the Chinese must be trying to develop large yield, offensive nuclear warheads for long-range missiles,\" said Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. \"This is a city-buster.\" **********But he emphasized that China was still no threat to the United States in the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles. **********Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said, \"We regret that the Chinese have conducted this test and that they are not demonstrating the same restraint as shown by Russia, ourselves, or the other nuclear weapons states.\"  Cold-War Mentality **********China is not a party to the Threshold Test Ban Treaty between the former Soviet Union and the United States, which came into effect in December 1990. Under that pact, underground tests are limited to 150 kilotons. **********\"It is rather ironic that the United States would criticize other countries for testing,\" said Dunbar Lockwood, senior analyst at the Arms Control Association, a private research organization. \"The United States under the Reagan and Bush Administrations has been one of the major impediments to progress toward a comprehensive test ban.\" **********Mr. Milhollin described the Chinese test as illustrative of a cold-war mentality in Beijing. He added: \"This is the price we're paying for not having a worldwide comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. It means China can improve its ability to destroy U.S cities at long range by testing.\" **********Leonard S. Spector, a nuclear-weapons expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has recently been in China, said in an interview that Beijing's test could take the pressure off the Bush Administration to agree to a comprehensive test ban. Pressure has been growing internationally and in Congress for that action. Moratorium on Tests **********In October 1991, the former Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, announced a one-year moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons. Boris N. Yelstin, the Russian President, has suggested in public remarks that he is preparing to resume testing this fall if there is no reciprocal movement from the United States. **********The French have also stopped testing to encourage international action on a comprehensive ban. **********\"Thoughtful advocates of testing restraint think that a comprehensive test ban might draw in India,\" Mr. Spector said. **********Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on East Asia, reacted to reports of today's test by calling China a \"renegade nation.\" **********\"This test will strongly reinforce Congressional efforts, which I once again will help lead, to deny China most-favored-nation trade staus unless China complies with international non-proliferation standards,\" Senator Cranston said in a statement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/16/business/philip-morris-share-price-plunges-5.html": {"writer_name": "Eben Shapiro", "pub_date": "1992-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 816, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Philip Morris Share Price Plunges 5%", "print_headline": "Philip Morris Share Price Plunges 5%", "body_text": " **********The stock of the Philip Morris Companies plunged about 5 percent yesterday, after the company warned that its tobacco shipments in the United States would drop sharply in the fourth quarter because of heightened competition from low-priced cigarettes. **********The forecast set off a flurry of selling on Wall Street as investors grew worried about a slowdown in growth at the critically important domestic tobacco unit, which accounted for about half of Philip Morris's earnings last year. **********The shift to cheaper cigarettes heightens the pressure on Philip Morris to shore up its flagging full-priced brands. The company has been frantically changing ad campaigns and introducing new lengths and varieties of Marlboros and Benson & Hedges, in efforts to keep consumers tantalized by more expensive brands. **********Philip Morris stock fell $4.25, to $79.75, in New York Stock Exchange trading.  Recession-Weary Smokers **********\"I am concerned about this development,\" said Lawrence Adelman, a Dean Witter Reynolds analyst, who removed Philip Morris from his recommended list yesterday, and like several other analysts, cut earnings estimates for the company. Philip Morris said fourth-quarter tobacco shipment in the United States would be 10 percent below the level a year earlier. **********The unexpected jump in demand for cheap cigarettes could not have come at a worse time for Philip Morris and appears to have caught the company off guard. Flush with new products this year, the company aggressively pushed more cigarettes through its system in an effort to avoid being out of stock at retail stores. At the same time, however, recession-weary smokers switched to lower-priced brands at a record pace, leaving warehouse filled to the brim with cigarettes. **********There is a month of inventory in stores and warehouses, about a week more than the desired level. As a result, for the rest of the year the company will ship fewer cigarettes to let inventories fall back. **********\"They had to pay the piper at some point,\" said John M. McMillin, an analyst with Prudential Securities. **********The weak economy was blamed for the shift to cheaper cigarettes.  \"George Bush and the Marlboro Man are facing the same problem,\" said David A. Goldman, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company \"It's the feeling that things are not looking so good\" in the economy, he said. **********The least expensive pack of generic cigarettes, in a black and white package, is 30 percent less than a pack of Marlboros, which can sell for as much as $2.60. Some other budget cigarettes are 20 percent less. **********Analysts estimate that discount cigarettes will account for 30 percent of the 503 billion cigarettes that are expected to be sold in the United States this year. There are two tiers of discount cigarettes. Sales of the cheapest cigarettes, the generics, nearly doubled this year, and they now account for 13 percent of the market. Mr. Goldman predicts that discount cigarettes will account for 40 percent of the market in two years. **********The cigarette industry and Philip Morris have been battling a steady decline in smoking in the United States for years. But with full-priced Marlboro's accounting for the majority of its cigarette business, \"Philip Morris feels the pressure more than most\" tobacco companies, said Mr. Goldman. **********The company said that for the first nine months of the year, premium brand sales fell by 16 percent in the industry. Philip Morris premium sales declined by 4 percent in that period. In the same period, discount sale increased by 18 percent, while Philip Morris's sales of inexpensive brands grew only 3 percent. **********While Philip Morris has some low-priced brands, it strongly favors its more profitable brands. Earnings Report **********The gloomy projection was included in an otherwise strong third-quarter earnings report for the tobacco, beer and food giant. Profit increased 16.4 percent and per-share earnings jumped 20 percent. **********Michael A. Miles, chairman and chief executive of Philip Morris, said the company was pleased with the third-quarter performance, despite the \"recent growth of discount products in several of our categories.\" **********For the quarter, net income increased 18 percent to $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion in the third quarter a year earlier. Per-share earnings rose to $1.44 from $1.20. **********Revenue advanced 9 percent, to $15 billion from $13.8 billion. **********For the quarter, operating income from worldwide tobacco was up 11.5 percent.

In the United States, food earnings climbed 9.7 percent.

From the looks of the second-quarter results of the nation's publicly held companies, even the heavy hitters are falling short at anticipating the fates of the companies they cover. And that can wreak havoc with stock prices and cause more than a little discomfort to investors who make decisions based on those predictions. **********Earnings surprises \"are the single biggest driver of stocks,\" said Daniel Benton, the \"All-America\" analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company who covers Compaq Computer. A Tricky Business **********Shares of a number of well-known companies soared or plunged in the recent reporting period as those companies announced earnings that took analysts by surprise. Cray Research's shares, for example, dropped $4.625, to $23.875, after the company said it earned 5 cents a share for the quarter, less than half the 13-cent average of analysts' predictions. Kodak's shares gained $1.125, to $43.875, after that company said its earnings were better than analysts had thought. **********And on Friday, shares of the Hewlett-Packard Company plunged $12.625 to $58.875, responding to the company's estimate Thursday evening of earnings for the quarter that ended July 31. The company said earnings would come in at 76 cents to 87 cents a share; analysts had been expecting $1.12. **********It is a tricky business divining the dollars and cents of a corporation's fate on a quarterly basis. But this job, in addition to writing research reports and making buy and sell recommendations on stocks, is a chief reason why analysts get paid so well. Of 1,950 companies that had reported earnings through Aug. 3, only 12 percent came in at exactly the consensus average of analysts' predictions, said Ben Zachs of Zachs Investment Research. Fifty percent came in better than expected, he added, and 38 percent came in worse than the average prediction of the analysts covering them. **********\"There's no question that even on a quarterly basis, the forecasts are missing actual results more than in the past,\" said David Dreman, a money manager at Dreman Value Management. Mr. Dreman conducted a study last year of earnings estimates of 1,221 stocks followed by at least six analysts, and found a steady erosion of analysts' accuracy from 1973 to 1990. By 1990, the average earnings estimate was either 65 percent too high or 65 percent too low. In 1973, the first year of his study, the average estimate was off by 31 percent from actual earnings. The trend to greater inaccuracy continues, Mr. Dreman said. **********Why can't Wall Street pros equipped with a wealth of research tools and M.B.A. degrees from the best training grounds in the country hit the mark? **********For one thing, while they are called research analysts, they have surprisingly little time to do research. This year in particular, securities analysts spent an inordinate amount of time working with their firms' corporate finance departments. **********When the initial public offering market is hot, as it was earlier this year, analysts help smooth the way for colleagues in corporate finance to meet key executives at companies in the industries they follow -- a helpful ingredient in snaring an I.P.O. client. Analysts also make themselves available as a brain trust for corporate finance executives on the lookout for new prospects. **********But even without the unusual demands of I.P.O. work, analysts already had a full plate, with decreasing room for research. The \"morning call\" that is broadcast over firms' squawk-box systems regularly requires analysts to spout their latest views on companies; after that, the sales force wants a report in writing to show to customers. Then they must write reports for institutional clients, visit brokers in regional offices, and make sales calls to big out-of-town clients, said Jay Bennett, partner at Greenwich Research Associates, which tracks trends in Wall Street research. **********Oh, and then there is research, too, he added, almost as an afterthought. In all, \"It's easily 25 hours in one day,\" Mr. Bennett said. Little surprise that a number of analysts said in interviews that they rarely if ever did first-hand research akin to the retailing analyst poking around in a department store. **********\"There isn't time to do research,\" said John Keefe of Keefe Worldwide Information Services. \"You've got to sell. You've got to be on the phone to your clients.\" Mr. Keefe formerly worked as a brokerage industry analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert and other firms, but said, \"I left the sell side because I like to do research.\" Now he runs his own consulting firm. **********Richard Pucci of Institutional Brokers Estimate System, which tracks earnings estimates by Wall Street analysts, said analysts, \"like all human beings making forecasts, are particularly poor at inflection points.\" The inflection point in this case is that of the changing economy, Mr. Pucci said. \"But once a trend is established, they will be better at forecasts.\" **********That, however, will not solve the problem of the increasing markets they serve and the growing number of roles they play. Mr. Bennett noted that analysts were also bearing the additional burden of an ever-bigger list of international stocks to cover, which means more companies to visit and greater travel. That comes, by the way, at a time when the ranks of analysts have already shrunk. From a total of 3,095 American analysts at the end of 1987, the number had dropped to 2,113 by the end of 1991, according to Nelson Publications, a publication of research analysts. Wall Street firms have gone on an analyst-hiring binge this year, though, largely in response to the boom in initial offerings. By Aug. 1, there were 2,453 research analysts in the United States, Nelson said. **********If the new additions are being made largely in response to corporate finance demands, though, that does not help improve the quality of research. And at many firms, analysts are covering more companies than ever before. Analysts at Lehman covered 10.9 companies each in 1988, but that number rose to 12.3 companies on average by 1991, according to Nelson. At Goldman, Sachs, analysts covered 12.9 companies in 1988; today, the Goldman analyst covers 16.4. **********When analysts blunder on earnings, it is not just the marginal player at a no-name firm who is off the mark. A surprising number came from the ranks of the \"All America Research Team,\" a list turned out each year by Institutional Investor magazine that purports to include only the cream of the analytical crop. Yet those stars made up a disproportionate number of those making the worst estimates. A list of the Institutional Brokers Estimate System of 18 analysts most caught by surprise in the latest quarter included 10 from the \"All America\" list, including Joseph Kozloff, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company who was overly optimistic over prospects for Royal Appliance, and Barry Bosak, computer analyst at Smith Barney, who was too sanguine on prospects for Cray Research. **********Another such star, B. Alex Henderson of Prudential Securities, said the surprise good news on Kodak last month that left him so off the mark was simply \"unknowable.\" Indeed, the company itself had told analysts it would be tough to even come close to the 1991 earnings of $1.10 a share in the second quarter. (The company earned $1.11.) Thus, the average analyst was expecting 94 cents; Mr. Henderson expected even less. **********Depending upon whom you talk to, the projecting of earnings is either sacrosanct or just another Wall Street game. In the struggle to appear more accurate, some analysts are constantly switching their estimates. \"You have to be careful about the I.B.E.S. numbers\" because analysts engage in a last-minute scramble to change their estimate just before companies announce earnings, said Jonathan Stone, the toy industry analyst at Adams Harkness & Hill. **********Mr. Stone said he wound up as one of the two most negative analysts on Fisher Price last month -- when surprisingly good earnings were announced -- because other analysts scrambled to revise their estimates upward, but he didn't. **********So can analysts get better at it? Skeptics like Mr. Dreman figure that they won't. Too many unpredictable factors enter into a company's earnings, he said, making the exercise largely a futile one. And even in those cases where an analyst is an expert with perfect estimates on the company, it doesn't necessarily translate into good stock picks, Mr. Keefe added. \"I've seen analysts who had earnings analyzed to the tiniest bit, but can't pick a stock to save their lives,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/09/world/reopening-ivan-case-stirs-the-israeli-psyche.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1992-08-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1642, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reopening 'Ivan' Case Stirs the Israeli Psyche", "print_headline": "Reopening 'Ivan' Case Stirs the Israeli Psyche", "body_text": " **********No, Eliyahu Rosenberg says, he has no second thoughts. **********Five years ago, he stood right in front of the defendant John Demjanjuk in an Israeli courtroom. This, he said, is \"Ivan the Terrible,\" the monstrous operator of the gas chamber at the Treblinka extermination camp in Poland, where 850,000 Jews were killed by the Nazis in 1942-43. **********Eliyahu Rosenberg was there. His job was to carry bodies from the gas chamber and then to help burn them. In August 1943, suspecting that their time had come, the Jews assigned to such ghastly work details rebelled, some managing to escape. Mr. Rosenberg, an Israeli now, was one of those who got out of Treblinka alive. **********\"I don't know the name Demjanjuk -- I only know the name Ivan,\" he said. \"In my heart, there is no doubt until the day I die. For me, he is Ivan from the gas chambers.\" **********Any day now, a five-judge panel of the Israeli Supreme Court is expected to decide whether it agrees that there is no doubt and whether Mr. Demjanjuk was justly convicted as a war criminal and properly sentenced to hang by an Israeli lower court in 1988. It is, many Israelis say, one of the more difficult rulings that these justices may ever have to make, one with implications that go beyond law and that could potentially plumb the depths of the national psyche.  Lost His U.S. Citizenship **********On one hand, they have the unflinching testimony in court of Mr. Rosenberg and four other Treblinka survivors. All of them pointed accusing fingers at Mr. Demjanjuk, a 72-year-old native of Ukraine who immigrated to the United States in the early 1950's, settled in Cleveland, worked in an auto plant, then lost his American citizenship in 1981 because of suspected war crimes and ended up being extradited to Israel five years later. **********On the other hand, there are batches of documents that have surfaced recently from old K.G.B. files and disclose the recollections of 21 Treblinka guards who fell into the Red Army's hands near the end of World War II. As far back as the late 1940's, they told Soviet interrogators that the man they knew as Ivan the Terrible was someone called Ivan Marchenko, whereabouts unknown. **********In essence, the justices must decide whether reasonable doubts have now been cast on the five survivors' testimony, as graphic and compelling as it was. And aside from the legal considerations, some Israelis say there is an overhanging existential question for anyone in the Jewish state: **********How do you tell Holocaust survivors, sorry, but we must listen to death-camp guards who would have killed you had they had a bit more time, who now speak to us through pieces of paper and who are beyond cross-examination, most of them having been executed years ago by the Russians?  Prediction of Release **********\"If the Supreme Court lets him go, as I think it will, the general reaction among Israelis will be that it proves what a great legal system we have,\" said Tom Segev, a columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, who has followed the Demjanjuk case closely. **********\"The problem is that you don't want to insult these five witnesses,\" Mr. Segev said. \"There is a feeling that if you don't believe these witnesses, then you're denying the Holocaust. I don't believe the Supreme Court thinks in these terms. Still, it will be very difficult to look into these people's eyes and say that they made a mistake.\" **********The Soviet records produced other information as well. Israeli prosecutors say that even if one forgets about Treblinka, the new evidence supports charges that Mr. Demjanjuk had been at Sobibor, another death camp in Poland, and at Trawnicki, where Ukrainians captured by the German Army were trained as camp guards. **********He was never, prosecutors say, the innocent young man he claims to have been, a victim of the Germans himself as their prisoner throughout the war.  U.S. Court Reopens Case **********But the Ivan the Terrible charges are what make the Demjanjuk case special, and the questions now raised about them have led a Federal appeals court in Cincinnati to reopen the case to see whether Mr. Demjanjuk's extradition was based on wrong information. A hearing is scheduled for next week. **********The \"Ivan\" charges are what persuaded the Israeli authorities to bring Mr. Demjanjuk here in the first place and to put him on trial in spectacular fashion. Until then, the only case remotely comparable in Israel was the war-crimes trial of Adolf Eichmann, an architect of the Nazis' \"final solution\" for European Jews, found guilty in 1961 and hanged the next year. **********If Eichmann represented the evil of the Nazi leadership, then \"Demjanjuk was supposed to be the ultimate collaborator case,\" said Efraim Zuroff, Israeli director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. It was a last chance for Israelis to stare the Nazi Holocaust in the face, an educational opportunity of incalculable value. For that reason, the courtroom was Jerusalem's spacious convention center, and the proceedings were broadcast live on radio. **********\"I describe it as a fair show trial,\" Mr. Segev said. \"It was a show trial. But it also was a fair trial.\"  Regret Over Trial **********Now, however, many Israelis wish that it had never happened and that they had stopped with the Eichmann case, leaving it to stand by itself as the Holocaust's legal legacy for future generations. No matter what the Supreme Court justices do now, they are in a bind, some say. **********\"If they are convinced that Ivan the Terrible is Ivan Demjanjuk and he should be executed, they will have to convince not only us but the entire world, and it seems that that will not be easy,\" said Ran Kislev, another Haaretz writer. \"And if they acquit him, even to give him the benefit of the doubt, it will be a harsh blow to our judicial system. Worse than that, it might constitute a harsh blow to attempts to bring Nazi criminals to trial around the world.\" **********Mr. Zuroff, for whom Nazi-hunting has been a career, agrees. Moreover, he argues that exonerating Mr. Demjanjuk would aid and abet revisionists who insist that the Holocaust never happened. \"Much of what we know about the Holocaust is from survivor testimony,\" he said. \"It will be that much easier for them to attack survivor testimony in general.\" **********To Noah Klieger, an Auschwitz survivor and a journalist for the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot, these worries are overwrought. There is no reasonable doubt about Mr. Demjanjuk's guilt, he said, and he predicted that the Supreme Court would reach the same conclusion.  'Public Relations' Blamed **********First, Mr. Klieger argued, there is no way to verify what the 21 Treblinka guards told their Soviet interrogators, and under what circumstances. Second, he said, the doubts about the guilty verdict are the result of \"an orchestrated public-relations campaign.\" **********Finally, he noted that the survivors had identified Mr. Demjanjuk not only in court but also in the 1970's from an old photograph -- a procedure that critics say was suggestive and therefore tainted but that Mr. Klieger defends as valid. **********\"I can guarantee that if you show me a picture of a guard in my camp, taken only three or four years later, I will be able to identify him today,\" he said. \"The witnesses can't be wrong. There is no such thing.\" **********Complicating matters, according to Israelis who have followed the case, is the new evidence dealing with Mr. Demjanjuk and Sobibor, where it is estimated that 250,000 Jews were killed. **********What if, for the sake of argument, the court concludes that there indeed are problems with the \"Ivan\" verdict but finds the Sobibor material persuasive? Must it throw out the entire case, as the defense insists? Or could it say Sobibor was a bad enough crime and therefore keep him in prison? Or might it say he has been held long enough and is free to go, although where to is not clear because he is no longer an American citizen? Or might it conclude that a new trial is necessary, even though probably few people here would have the stomach for one?  Opinion Is Divided **********Whatever the decision, most people familiar with the case are convinced that Mr. Demjanjuk will not become the only person other than Eichmann to be executed here. But should he be set free, \"it will not be a popular decision at all,\" Mr. Klieger said. **********Others are not so sure, however. **********\"If the evidence is not compelling to convict, then exoneration would be a major statement that being haunted by this memory of the Holocaust does not free me from being bound by due process of law,\" said Rabbi David Hartman, director of the Shalom Hartman Institute for Advanced Judaic Studies. \"It is the idea of the victim never falling into retributive justice.\" **********Mr. Segev argued that the judges would not necessarily be insulting to the Treblinka survivors if they overturned the Demjanjuk conviction. \"They can say: 'We accept your testimony. We feel your pain. You have helped us, and rendered an important historical service to the nation. But we think you may have made a mistake,' \" he said.  The Survivors' Reaction **********What do the survivors say for themselves? **********Most do not want to talk about it. \"There's a court, and the court will rule,\" said Josef Czarny, an Israeli citizen. \"Afterward, I will say what I have to say. I am a simple man. I'm one of the people.\" **********Eliyahu Rosenberg is also reluctant to speak. But he said he was not worried that Mr. Demjanjuk might go free because, he insisted, there was no mistake. **********\"Now, of all times, to listen to what Ukrainians said in a stupid interrogation!\" he said in a brief telephone interview, referring to the material from the Soviet files. \"It's all stupid nonsense. What I said was correct, and what the court ruled was correct, and what the court will rule is correct.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/16/world/serbs-following-a-twin-strategy.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Engelberg", "pub_date": "1992-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 669, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SERBS FOLLOWING A TWIN STRATEGY", "print_headline": "SERBS FOLLOWING A TWIN STRATEGY", "body_text": " **********Serbian forces today permitted a United Nations convoy to reach Gorazde, one of Bosnia and Herzegovina's beleaguered cities, in an operation that underscored the limits of this week's United Nations resolution on the Balkan war. **********As fighting continued around Gorazde, eight truckloads of food and medicine were delivered to the city, which has been cut off from supplies since April, said Peter Kessler, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. **********The actions today by the troops surrounding Gorazde suggest that the Serbs are pursuing a two-track strategy in the war, continuing to capture territory while allowing food to reach civilians in the handful of Muslim cities and towns still resisting their control. **********The wording of the United Nations resolution authorizing the use of force to protect shipments of food and medicine allows Serbian forces to avert a confrontation with the West by permitting United Nations convoys to roll unimpeded through Bosnia. **********The Security Council on Thursday authorized the use of force in the conflict, but only to guarantee the delivery of supplies like food and medicine to civilians.

He said a place the size of Gorazde normally needs about 35 tons of food daily. **********The convoy was guarded by four armored personnel carriers provided by a French peace force in Sarajevo. The trucks were driven by Ukrainian soldiers. **********The French troops operate under the same rules of engagement used before the United Nations adopted its resolution this week. Shannon Boyd, spokeswoman for the United Nations peace force, said the French soldiers were instructed to fire only in self-defense, and then only if the attack represented a serious threat to life. **********Ten days ago, a similar United Nations attempt to reach Gorazde ended 30 miles short of the city when the trucks became trapped in a minefield. The local Serbian militiamen refused to show the drivers how to negotiate the route, and several trucks were damaged when they hit mines. **********Other besieged Muslim cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina include Tuzla, north of Sarajevo, with a prewar population of 130,000, and the area around Bihac, in northwestern Bosnia, which is now said to be home to about 300,000 people fleeing the war."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/23/world/reports-of-falklands-war-executions-spur-inquiry.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1992-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 651, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reports of Falklands War Executions Spur Inquiry", "print_headline": "Reports of Falklands War Executions Spur Inquiry", "body_text": " **********Argentina and Britain are looking into reports that Argentine soldiers were summarily executed by British soldiers in the Falklands war in 1982. **********The inquiries, announced this week by both countries, spring from accusations in a book written by a former British soldier who says he saw Argentine soldiers who had surrendered being pushed off a cliff and shot to death by British troops. **********Officials of the British Embassy here said that since the book was published last fall and excerpts appeared in local newspapers, the Ministry of Defense had conducted an internal inquiry. **********They said that last weekend ministry officials asked the Crown Prosecution Service, the British equivalent of the Justice Department, to investigate.

Katz, a Harvard labor economist and co-author of one of the studies, said of the minimum wage. \"But it can, in the short run, provide extra income to those who work.\" Winners and Losers **********Both liberal and conservative economists have long been convinced that the minimum wage law priced bottom-tier workers out of jobs. They recognized that a more generous minimum wage was good for those who were not dismissed as wages were raised, but worried that the losers outnumbered the winners. **********Now, two unorthodox studies by economists at Princeton University and Harvard University have concluded that the most-recent rise in the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour -- a 90-cent increase phased in from April 1990 to April 1991 -- did not prompt employers to chop jobs. **********That finding makes the case for modest increases in the minimum wage as an ingredient in future anti-poverty measures. But liberal politicians are not likely to push for another increase soon. **********Still, Gov. Bill Clinton, in his Presidential campaign, recently announced that he favored indexing the minimum wage for inflation, which is tantamount to increasing it annually. And a battle over minimum wage levels looms next spring, with the expiration of a provision in the law that permits employers to pay newly hired teen-agers less than the minimum. **********The findings of the new studies, which ignited a controversy among economists and sparked criticism from other researchers, were borne out in interviews with executives employing minimum-wage workers. **********\"It really hasn't affected the number of jobs we have,\" said Jim Hennessey, operations manager for Andy Frain, a Chicago agency that provides 600 ushers for sports and entertainment events each week. **********When the minimum wage was raised, the company increased its starting salaries even higher, from $3.90 an hour to $4.40, 15 cents more than the Federal minimum. **********\"Paying that extra 50 cents helped us recruit,\" Mr. Hennessey said. \"We're getting better kids.\" **********Tim Supples, manager of several Roy Rogers restaurants in Mercer County in rural Pennsylvania, reported a similar experience. **********\"Our head count didn't increase or decrease,\" he said. \"You're just going to manage a lot more tightly to get more out of the people we've got.\" **********The Princeton and Harvard researchers focused on teen-agers -- about a third of the low-wage workers affected by the increase in the minimum -- to get a handle on the entire low-wage labor market. **********\"Whatever you find for teen-agers, my guess is true for low-wage workers,\" said David Card, a Princeton economist and one of the authors of the studies. **********About two million workers earn the minimum wage or less. They are hamburger flippers and garment workers, sales clerks and janitors. Two-thirds are adults, and though some of the remaining third are teen-agers from affluent families, most teen-agers earning minimum wages are members of low-income families for whom the wages are an important source of income. **********It was concern for these workers that led Congress to raise the minimum wage. Until the 1990 and 1991 increases, the Federal minimum had been frozen since 1981 at $3.35 an hour. As other wages rose, the minimum wage fell to its lowest level relative to average hourly pay since the 1950's. Isolating the Effects **********One problem economists face in studying how raising the minimum wage affects jobs is the difficulty in isolating the effect of a wage increase from that of the myriad other economic forces influencing the labor market. **********But in the Princeton study, Mr. Card created a control group from states not affected by the Federal minimum wage increase because they already had higher or equal minimum wage levels of their own. **********Comparing states where as many as 50 percent of the teen-agers earned less than the new Federal minimum with states where virtually all teens were already earning as much or more, Professor Card found that teen-age pay rose sharply in low-wage states where the higher Federal minimum wage had the biggest impact. But, contrary to expectations, teen employment did not suffer as a result. Comparing the States **********Take, for example, what Mr. Card found in 3 of the 50 states he studied: In Georgia -- where teen-age wages are among the lowest -- the new Federal minimum increased wages 14 percent, but employment edged up by four-tenths of 1 percent. **********In Minnesota, by contrast, where teen-agers were already earning more than the new Federal minimum, wages went up only 3.9 percent but employment fell 4.1 percent. For New York -- another high-wage state -- wages went up 2 percent but employment fell 3.2 percent. **********By comparing fast-food outlets in Texas in the same way that Mr. Card compared states, Professor Katz at Harvard and Alan B. Kreuger at Princeton found more hiring in stores where wages were most affected by the new Federal minimum. **********What is more, Professor Katz and Professor Kreuger found that only a small number of the Texas fast-food employers were using the sub-minimum \"training\" wage that lets them pay new teen-age employees less than the minimum for six months.  Aimed at First-Timers **********Before the passage of the 1989 minimum wage law, President Bush, supported by many economists and fast-food companies, fought to exempt newly hired teens from the full increase in the adult minimum. The hope was that employers would be more willing to train first-time workers if they could pay them less and that this would hold down the job losses from an increase in the minimum wage. **********But Professors Katz and Kreuger found that just 6 percent of the Texas restaurants surveyed were using the training wage, despite the fact that most were aware of that option and many had been able to hire workers at wages below the new minimum before the change in the law. More than 95 percent of employers paid trainees the adult minimum or higher. **********\"If anyone was going to use the sub-minimum, you'd expect it to be these companies with high turnover,\" Professor Kreuger said. Roughly half of fast-food workers are teen-agers, turnover averages 200 percent in many stores and most teens can learn their jobs within a few weeks. Some Unanswered Questions **********The standard economic model predicts that if something costs more, in this case labor, consumers, in this case employers, will buy less of it. Speculating about why businesses did not react as expected to the latest minimum wage increase, the authors of the studies said that the labor market may not work that simply. **********\"Some employers thought it was O.K. because they were already paying more,\" said Professor Card, \"and others said they wouldn't mind paying more if everybody paid more because it made life easier for them.\" **********He added: \"You can have high wages and low turnover and less recruiting, or you can have low wages, high turnover and more recruiting.\" **********The new studies have already circulated as National Bureau of Economic Research working papers. They will also appear in the October issue of the Industrial and Labor Relations Review along with critiques and earlier surveys of California and Texas by the same authors.  Position of Critics **********But critics contend that the new studies are flawed because they were conducted too soon after the increase in the minimum wage. **********\"It's not that everybody goes out and fires workers, but that job growth is slower than it would otherwise have been,\" said William Washer, an economist at the Federal Reserve whose own study of 50 states from 1977 to 1989 supports the established view that higher minimum wages lead to job losses. **********He and others also argue that the recent contrary experience, even if it is verified by future studies, cannot necessarily be generalized. **********But the studies' authors argue that the wage increase was well publicized in advance, and that restaurants had fully adjusted to it. They also note that the latest wage increases -- 12 percent or so in real terms -- were relatively modest. A Blunt Instrument **********Professor Katz admits that the minimum wage is a blunt instrument for fighting poverty and that other ways of providing relief to the working poor are far more efficient. **********\"It's untargeted,\" he said. \"A bunch of middle class teen-agers benefit, too.\" **********But given the new evidence and the fact that the Federal budget is tied in knots by the high deficit, the idea of levying a hidden tax on employers to provide assistance to the poor in the form of higher wages is likely to gain appeal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/01/business/company-news-postal-service-suspends-emery-from-new-work.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-07-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 191, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POSTAL SERVICE SUSPENDS EMERY FROM NEW WORK", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; POSTAL SERVICE SUSPENDS EMERY FROM NEW WORK", "body_text": " **********Consolidated Freightways Inc. said its Emery Worldwide air freight unit had been temporarily suspended from being awarded future contracts by the United States Postal Service because of disputed reimbursement claims.

The \"era of excess\" of the 1980's is history, she insists, and marketers must catch on to that quickly. **********She was speaking as part of a panel of advertising, marketing and media executives who urged the nation's retailers to revamp drastically how they communicate with customers or suffer the loss of their businesses. **********\"The marketing challenge of the 90's will be to sell more in an era of less,\" she told more than 400 people who attended the presentation, called \"The New Normalcy: Marketing to Recession Reality.\" \"This is where you guys are missing it, and it makes me so nuts.

They invoked the stages of behavior in reacting to death, as described by the psychiatrist Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, from denial to anger to depression to introspection to acceptance. **********At the moment, Ms. Farmer said, consumers are angry, and they think \"less equals loss.\" But \"somewhere along the way,\" she added, because \"the American personality is optimistic, we will convince ourselves that less is better.\" **********As part of that process, Ms. Cutler said, \"the consumer becomes an investor,\" prudently and cautiously guarding \"what little is left of his or her disposable income.\" That is a key reason, she added, for the sharply rising popularity of \"value brands,\" products that promise good quality at reasonable prices. **********Ms. Cutler listed, as successful purveyors of such brands, the Gap; the designer Donna Karan, with her lower-priced DKNY apparel, and the designer Giorgio Armani, with his new A/X: Armani Exchange casual clothing. Even expensive goods can qualify as good values, she said, citing how Toyota marketed its Lexus line of luxury cars as a lower-priced alternative to Mercedes-Benz. **********All of those marketers are shrewdly capitalizing, she said, on shoppers' decisions \"not to make trade-downs, but to make trade-offs.\" The recession \"is nature's way of telling us it's time to change,\" she added, \"and giving us permission to change.\" **********Ms. Farmer also cited the Gap, along with Smith & Hawken, the catalogue retailer; Patagonia, a retailer specializing in practical outdoor apparel, and the Costco Wholesale chain of warehouse stores. **********Another panelist who stressed that retailers must shift their emphasis from sales to value -- \"the V-word,\" as she termed it -- was Ann C.

While many companies have hunkered down with the tight-fisted consumer, some took risks and got noticed.\" Examples she gave included Range Rover, which is running advertisements by Grace & Rothschild, chiding consumers to \"Buy something,\" and the Target discount-store chain, which ran ads for shirts and ties that featured men wearing pants they already owned. **********The media must also change their ways, said Ray Gaulke, the ad bureau's executive vice president and chief marketing officer. \"Our mission must be to become more than vendors of blank pages,\" he said, and to assume a role as \"a review board for your advertising.\" **********\"If we see things that we don't believe will work,\" he added, \"we have to tell you.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/11/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-mta-selects-korey-kay.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "M.T.A.

White House Hails News **********Nevertheless, the White House immediately trumpeted today's news as a belated confirmation of Mr. Bush's campaign assertions that the economy was doing better than other candidates acknowledged or the American people seemed to believe. **********\"The Bush recovery is coming on strong,\" Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, shouted over the roar of the President's helicopter on the South Lawn of the White House as Mr. Bush headed to his family home in Maine for the Thanksgiving weekend. \"I'm talking about this economy that is showing signs of life and looking good, looking strong, living up to our predictions of the last several months.\" **********The economic news provoked wistful speculation among some Republicans who suggested that if the good economic news had come in the second quarter rather than the third quarter, President Bush might have won on Nov. 3. \"President Bush's Thanksgiving turkey arrived too late,\" said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. **********The Commerce Department frequently makes upward or downward revisions in its initial estimates of gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced in the nation -- as it gathers information that was not available when the first estimates are released. **********Today's report raised growth estimates after more complete statistics showed that exports, business inventories and consumer spending were all higher than October's less-complete statistics showed. **********The G.D.P. figures and the unemployment rate are the nation's two most closely watched statistics, providing businesses, investors and elected officials an important gauge for the health of the economy. Other Healthy Reports **********In addition to the Commerce Department report, several other reports today showed the economy picking up. Sales of existing homes jumped 9.1 percent in October, to their highest level in four years, the National Association of Realtors said. New applications for state unemployment benefits fell by 12,000, to 374,000, during the week ended Nov. 14, the sixth decline in eight weeks, the Labor Department reported. **********And those come after surveys by the Conference Board and the University of Michigan showed a significant jump in consumer confidence, which could portend a strong rise in consumer spending. In addition, on Tuesday the Government reported that orders for durable goods rose 3.9 percent in October, their biggest increase since July 1991. **********\"I think now we've turned a corner,\" Commerce Secretary Barbara H. Franklin said in an interview. \"This is a big present to President-elect Clinton as we go out the door.\" **********But Mr. Clinton and his aides took a different view, arguing that the strong third quarter did not necessarily signal a robust recovery. **********George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director, called the report \"good news, but still probably not good enough,\" He said economists were \"not at all clear on whether or not we're going to have real growth in the fourth quarter.\" **********He added, \"We have to wait and see and see if it's necessary\" to have a stimulus program \"at the beginning of the year.\" Reich Is Cautious **********In an interview, Robert B. Reich, the head of Mr. Clinton's economic transition team, added, \"To the extent that it's a one-time blip turning on new investments resulting in larger inventories and additional exports due to a low dollar for that particular period, then we probably can't count on that figure to signal the beginning of a buoyant recovery.\" **********The stock market reacted favorably to today's news, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 17.56 points on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at 3,266.26. **********Today's report on gross domestic product seemed to contradict suggestions by the Clinton camp that the Bush Administration had, with an eye to Election Day, overstated growth in its preliminary estimate in October, which said that output rose by 2.7 percent in the July-through-September period. Coming in the heat of the campaign, that figure stunned most economists, who were forecasting feeble growth of around 1.5 percent in the third quarter. **********A final report on third-quarter gross domestic product will be issued on Dec. 22. **********\"These numbers show an improving economy, but hardly a booming one,\" Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview. \"The economy has grown at a rate averaging 2.75 percent over the last three quarters, that's certainly better than the last three quarters of 1991 when it averaged 1.25 percent.\" Slower Quarter Seen **********Most economists predict that growth will slow down in the fourth quarter. \"I don't think 3.9 percent is sustainable,\" said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, the investment bank. \"The fourth and first quarters will be relatively sluggish. There won't be a measurable improvement in jobs and fortunes of average Americans. We're still not on Easy Street.\" **********He predicted growth of 2 percent in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, saying the third-quarter numbers included some one-time positive factors. Inventories grew for the second consecutive quarter, government spending, especially military spending, was up sharply, partly to carry out certain expenditures by the end of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. He also suggested that some businesses are deferring investments that had been planned for the fourth-quarter because they want to wait until Congress approved Mr. Clinton's proposed income tax credits. **********\"There are a lot of conflicting things here,\" Mr. Clinton said as he was leaving what aides described as a routine checkup by his internist. \"There's some increased activity. But manufacturing is still in some trouble. There's still a lot of structural layoffs planned and Boeing announced another layoff today.\" **********Even though Bush Administration officials and many economists expect growth to be weaker in the fourth quarter, the strong third-quarter numbers could persuade Mr. Clinton to scale back any plans to create jobs through increased deficit spending. **********Today's report said output rose by $47 billion in the third quarter, fueled principally by growth in consumer spending, exports and government purchases. Consumer spending was up a robust 3.7 percent, or $29.9 billion, $2.3 billion more than the October estimate. Business inventories rose by $12.4 billion, up $5.5 billion from the October estimate. Government purchases rose $7.6 billion, up 3.3 percent overall and up 6.7 percent in just military spending. Exports rose $12.8 billion, which is $10.2 billion more than the October estimate. **********The Commerce Department also reported today that corporate after-tax profits, in their biggest fall in six and a half years, slumped by 6 percent, or $14 billion, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $218.8 billion. The main reason for the decline was that Hurricane Andrew in Florida and Louisiana and Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii devastated insurance company profits and caused many companies to write off nonrepairable damage. Without the hurricanes, corporate profits would have increased by more than $20 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/06/business/jobless-rate-rose-to-7.5-for-may-highest-since-1984.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1163, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JOBLESS RATE ROSE TO 7.5% FOR MAY, HIGHEST SINCE 1984", "print_headline": "JOBLESS RATE ROSE TO 7.5% FOR MAY, HIGHEST SINCE 1984", "body_text": " **********The nation's unemployment rate climbed to 7.5 percent in May from 7.2 percent in April, as young people and other job seekers flocked into a labor market with relatively few openings, Labor Department figures disclosed today.

Those who have given up looking are not counted among the unemployed. **********Michael J. Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser, declined to elaborate on Mr. Fitzwater's statement. **********But the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, declared, \"Unemployment is getting worse and the President doesn't realize it.\"  Many Face Loss of Benefits **********He said that high school and college graduates were failing to find work and added that he was also troubled by \"the number of long-term unemployed workers -- now 3.5 million strong -- who could face an interruption in their benefits.\" **********Among the changes in the largest states, New Jersey's jump to 9 percent from 7.8 percent was the biggest, while the rate for New York State edged up to 7.9 percent from 7.6 percent.  [ Page 44. ] **********The rate for California, which suffered an unspecified loss of jobs from the riots in Los Angeles, rose to 8.7 percent from 8 percent, while the rate for Michigan, benefiting from an automotive upturn, declined to 8.6 percent from 9.4 percent. **********While the Administration could take some comfort in the reasons for the higher unemployment rate -- and in some other figures, like a further lengthening of the average workweek -- there were some clear negatives. **********Among these were that sizable increases in the ranks of both the newly jobless and the hard-core jobless, a rise in the duration of spells of unemployment, a surge in the number of people who lost, rather than quit, their last jobs and a jump in number of people working part time who would have rather had full-time work. **********And by both of the department's surveys, the one that samples 60,000 households and the one that samples more than 350,000 business establishments, jobs were decidedly scarce. **********The household survey showed that the labor force rose 330,000 last month, continuing at the stepped-up pace that has prevailed since November, but that the number of jobs actually shrank, by 19,000. This swelled the jobless ranks by 349,000, to a total of 9,504,000, or about 40 percent more than when the latest recession began in July 1990. **********Nearly half of the growth last month in the labor force, which had been anemic during most of the recession, was among those aged 16 to 24, the department noted. **********Some private analysts questioned the adequacy of the department's seasonal-adjustment procedures in dealing with the end of the school year. They noted that the jobless rate rose two-tenths of a percentage point in May 1991, one of very few increases of that magnitude for the year. Gain Entirely in Services **********The payroll survey, which is watched by economists, posted a gain of 68,000 jobs in May, somewhat less than expected. All of this gain was in services as opposed to goods-producing jobs. Factory jobs fell 10,000 following a 5,000 April gain. **********\"There's still an awful lot of caution on the part of businesses,\" said Robert V. Di Clemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers. **********But Mr. Di Clemente and others said they were heartened by the longer workweek, which generally is taken to mean that employers will soon need to hire more workers as they exhaust their ability to squeeze more production from existing ones. **********The private-sector workweek expanded by six minutes, to 34.5 hours last month, while for manufacturing alone the workweek grew 12 minutes, to 41.3 hours, the highest level since 1966. Factory overtime also rose. **********Today's report also showed that the index of aggregate weekly hours, which eased slightly in March and April, rose to 121.5 last month and that the proportion of industries adding workers stood above 50 percent for the second straight month. Short of Expectations **********And while the 68,000 rise in business payrolls fell short of the 100,000 or so that had been expected, analysts also noted that the gains for the two preceding months were revised upward. March now shows a 58,000 gain instead of 39,000 while April's gain is now 182,000 instead of 126,000. **********\"The economy is making headway, though at a painfully slow pace,\" said Walter M. Cadette, an economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. **********The 76,000 gain in payroll service jobs was the sixth in a row for this sector and included 39,000 in business services, 20,000 in health services, 13,000 in local government and 11,000 in finance. Retail trade, however, lost 44,000 after rising 83,000 in April, a swing that some analysts thought might not reflect reality. **********Goods-producing jobs fell 8,000, with weakness continuing in the military-dependent industries producing transportation and electronic equipment. A rise for machinery was entirely the result of a return of strikers at Caterpillar Inc. **********The household survey showed that joblessness among young people, those aged 16 to 24, was worse among men. Their rate climbed to 15.9 percent from 14.9 percent while the rate for women in this age group rose to 12.9 from 12.1 percent. **********But unemployment for men 25 and older also rose, by nearly 200,000, a change whose significance cannot be determined without additional months of data, William G. Barron Jr., the deputy commissioner of labor statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. **********The jobless rate for adult men rose five-tenths of a point, to 7.3 percent, while that for adult women eased two-tenths of a point, to 6.1 percent. **********Regionally, the jobless rate rose one-tenth of a point in the Northeast and South, to 8 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively. The increase was three-tenths of a point in the Midwest and West, to 7 percent and 7.7 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/03/business/futures-options-gas-losses-in-storm-increased.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1992-09-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 740, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gas Losses In Storm Increased", "print_headline": "FUTURES/OPTIONS; Gas Losses In Storm Increased", "body_text": " **********The Federal Government today nearly tripled its estimate of the natural gas output temporarily lost to the nation in the wake of Hurricane Andrew's battering of production and pipeline equipment in the Gulf of Mexico. **********The revised calculation by the Minerals Management Service, which governs oil and gas production in Federal waters, is that 2.5 billion to 2.75 billion cubic feet of daily gas output would be halted for at least two weeks. That is equal to at least 20 percent of the region's production and 5 percent of the nation's daily output. **********Analysts and industry executives said that the higher estimate, compared with one of about one billion cubic feet made by the Government on Monday, would probably push gas prices higher for some days. But the increases will be temporary if substantial repairs are completed, as expected, by the end of the month. Ruptured Pipe Reported **********Scott Sewell, director of the Minerals Management Service in Washington, said the report of a ruptured gas pipeline operated by Texaco Inc. in the coastal waters of the Eugene Island field 30 miles south of Houma, La., was the main factor in his revised estimate. **********He said it was \"highly likely\" that Hurricane Andrew had ripped a nearby platform from its footings, then dragged anchors tethered to the platform platform through the pipeline. **********Most oil and gas production in the region was halted before the storm hit the region last Wednesday. But companies that had shipped gas produced from wells through that pipeline cannot produce again from those wells until the pipeline is repaired. **********That means crude oil output will also be limited more than expected, Mr. Sewell said, because crude oil and natural gas in most cases are produced simultaneously from wells. He put the number or production platforms damaged by the storm at 120, up from 100 on Monday. Output Down by a Third **********He estimated that one-third of the gulf's crude production, or 240,000 to 270,000 barrels a day out of total production near 720,000 barrels a day, will be halted. Drillers produce slightly more than seven million barrels a day from the nation's oilfields. Some Gulf Coast refiners could face tight supplies for a few weeks because of the disruption, he said. **********The Exxon Corporation said that it had restored about 60,000 barrels a day out of its pre-hurricane production of 75,000 barrels a day of crude in southern Louisiana and nearby offshore fields. Its gas production was up to 600 million cubic feet a day compared with 800 million cubic feet a day before the storm. **********One reason that the temporary halt of some gulf gas output will not push cash prices sharply higher is that many natural-gas producers sold huge volumes of gas supplies through futures contracts after Hurricane Andrew tore through the heart of the gulf's gas production region. **********The revised Government estimates today came after the futures markets closed. **********After surging 31.5 cents last week, the price of the October gas contract has eased this week in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It settled down 3 cents, at $2.051 per million British thermal units, or about 1,000 cubic feet, today. **********The price for light sweet crude continued its rise, adding 5 cents, to $21.69 a barrel for October delivery, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

A platform is a chassis with a set configuration and size for its wheelbase, engine, transmission and other mechanical components, to which differently styled passenger compartments are mated. **********But several of G.M.'s platforms are similar to one another in size and other characteristics, so Mr. Smith and other executives are trying to insure that engineering tasks are not duplicated. **********G.M.'s Buick LeSabre, Oldsmobile and Pontiac Bonneville, for example, are different compartments built on the same H platform. The cars are roughly similar and sell for the nearly the same price. **********Because design of new models requires hundreds of thousands of hours of engineering work, G.M. believes it can save considerable sums by cutting the number of engineers needed for its platforms. **********But G.M. tried, and failed, once before to reorganize engineers. In 1984 the auto maker assigned all car engineering to the Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac large-car group or the Chevrolet-Pontiac-G.M. Canada small-car group.

Mutual Benefit provided a $5.6 million acquisition loan.

While a few institutions, like Mutual, may offer seller financing it is usually to owner-users with substantial credit, Mr. Hauspurg said. Foreign equity is also entering the market, he said. **********Low sales prices also allow buyers to offer lower rents, which, in turn, suppresses leasing rates and inhibits new construction, brokers say. Still the activity shows that \"the sales world is approaching bottom and will be out of the woods in one year,\" Mr. Massey said, adding that a recovery in leasing will take longer. **********Touko bought the building three years ago when the market was buoyant.

J. Nicholas Jr., the designated successor to the company's chairman, Steven J. Ross, had resigned and would be replaced by Gerald M. Levin, the vice chairman. Many in the company saw the unexpected resignation as a result of a clash between Mr. Ross and Mr. Nicholas, whose total 1990 compensation of $96.4 million made them the nation's highest-paid executives. But it also meant the collapse of a succession agreement central to the 1990 merger of two corporate empires, Warner Communications and Time Inc., to form the world's largest media company. Mr. Ross and Mr. Nicholas fell out over the company's ultimately successful search for foreign investors, according to two people closely involved in the company's affairs. Mr. Ross wanted to sell minority interests while maintaining control of all the company's properties, while Mr. Nicholas sought other ways for the heavily indebted company to raise money. Expressed No Regrets The company said Mr. Levin -- like Mr. Nicholas, a longtime employee of Time Inc. -- would serve as Time Warner's president and co-chief executive, the title that Mr. Nicholas had shared with Mr. Ross. Mr. Ross, the former chief executive of Warner Communications Inc., and Richard Munro, the former chairman of Time Inc., had agreed at the time of the merger that Mr. Nicholas would first share executive authority, then take charge by himself in the mid-1990's. Although the company's statement simply said Mr. Nicholas resigned, Mr. Ross, in a memo to employees, expressed no regrets and left no doubt that he favored Mr. Nicholas's departure. Several who know Mr. Nicholas well say he was intent on remaining with the company but was forced out. Mr. Ross, 64 years old, is an obsessive deal maker known for fostering loyal and skilled managers. Lately, he has been undergoing intensive chemotherapy for prostate cancer and since December has scarcely been seen at the office. Even if he returns, it is widely expected that he will focus chiefly on strategy, leaving operations to Mr. Levin. Mr. Levin and Mr. Nicholas, both 52 years old, have long been rivals. Mr. Levin was dropped from Time's board in the early 1980's as Mr. Nicholas advanced, but it was Mr. Levin who conceived of the Warner merger to further the company's global ambitions. Strong Ties Forged Since then, say some executives, Mr. Levin has forged strong ties with Warner officials, including Mr. Ross, while Mr. Nicholas did not develop the same rapport. According to one executive at Time Warner, Mr. Nicholas was asked to come back from his vacation home in Vail, Colo., for an unscheduled board meeting, but chose not to do so. The board approved the changes unanimously. Mr. Nicholas's wife, reached in Vail, said her husband would not comment. Graef S. Crystal, a leading expert on executive compensation, said Mr. Ross received compensation of $82.6 million, Mr. Nicholas $13.8 million and Mr. Levin $8.6 million in 1990. The company has disputed Mr. Crystal's figures, which include bonuses and stock options. Wall Street analysts said yesterday that they thought the news, which came after the stock market closed, was favorable for the company. \"The most important ingredient for the leader of the company, and the area in which Steve excels, is broad stratetgic thinking,\" said Emanuel Gerard, a partner at Gerard Klauer Mattison, an investment firm. \"I think Jerry is a much stronger strategic thinker than Nick and has a broader base of support from both the Time and Warner people.\" Industry analysts credit Mr. Nicholas, a reserved and rather formal executive, with building Time Inc.'s cable operations and watching over the company's spending. 'Difference in Philosophy' But several executives said Mr. Ross's illness, and the uncertainities it raised, had helped pushed the board to change the line of succession yesterday. But one person with close ties to the company added that such a shift was only a question of timing. \"I think there has been a very, very real difference in philosophy between the two men for some time,\" he said. He said Mr. Nicholas had initially opposed Time Warner's decision to sell a stake in its entertainment business to the Toshiba Corporation and C. Itoh and Company, two big Japanese companies, because he opposed bringing in foreign investors. Mr. Nicholas preferred to sell some properties outright, a course that Mr. Ross opposed. Ultimately, Mr. Nicholas voted for the Toshiba deal. \"You patch things up for a while, but they do not go away,\" said this person, who has detailed knowledge of the company's affairs. \"Jerry was much more in tune with Steve's vision.\" Indeed, Mr. Levin had accompanied Mr. Ross to Japan to negotiate the deal. Another person with close ties to the company said Mr. Ross had approached the board about designating a new heir. In yesterday's memo, Mr. Ross acknowledged that he and Mr. Nicholas had clashed over the company's direction. \"Nick's decision was based on his sense that there was sufficient difference regarding our strategic focus, between him on the one hand and the board and his management colleagues on the other,' Mr. Ross's memo said. Mr. Ross said that Mr. Nicholas had left with \"a sense of great and well-deserved pride\" in the company's achievements and \"a host of friendships forged during the merger.\" As for Mr. Levin, Mr. Ross was effusive, saying he \"had been unfailingly impressed by Jerry's judgment, his insightful understanding of all our businesses and his commitment to fully realizing Time Warner's enormous potential.\" In two years, Mr. Levin has come to be a favorite with the board, distinguishing himself in explaining complicated financial and strategic actions. Mr. Levin had a good sense ofthe board members' personalities and outlooks, one person close to the board said. Several executives in the industry say Mr. Levin was also well liked by Warner's chairman, Robert Daly, and its president, Terry Semel, and had a strong knowledge of the movie business from his days at Home Box Office Inc., a Time Warner cable television subsidiary. Mr. Nicholas, meanwhile, did not manage to form alliances with the top executives at Warner Brothers, the movie studio, and Warner Records, one executive said. Praise for Rising Executive Yesterday's news shows that Mr. Levin made a strong comeback. Until yesterday, Mr. Levin had served as chief operating officer, but had gradually been accruing power for a year. Mr. Levin was also a favorite of Mr. Ross's closest confidant, Ed Aboudi, who worked with Mr. Ross in negotiating the merger. In a recent interview, Mr. Aboudi spoke glowingly of Mr. Levin but failed to mention Mr. Nicholas. In Los Angeles, film executives predicted that the shift would have no substantive effect on Warner Brothers. Officials at the studio declined to comment. But film executives close to the studio said the parent company had adopted a hands-off policy towards decision-making, even on controversial Warner films, like Oliver Stone's \"J.F.K.\" \"It's always been a hands-off operation, and we expect that it will continue to be so,\" said one film executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Although the two have been friends and colleagues for years, recent headlines have strained their relationship. **********\"Will He Overthrow Kohl?\" demanded the mass-circulation Bild in a front-page banner the other day.  \"Chancellor Schauble, Take Over!\" urged the magazine Super Illu. **********In an interview at his Bonn office not long ago, Mr. Schauble (pronounced SHOY-bleh) refused to be drawn into discussion about his political plans. Asked about articles that portray him as an emerging rival to Chancellor Kohl, he smiled and replied, \"I don't even take the time to deny them any more.\"  Chancellor Not Pleased **********But according to press accounts the Chancellor has not been pleased by suggestions that his long-faithful protege is hatching political plots. At a meeting of Government leaders last month, he reportedly confronted Mr. Schauble and won a renewed pledge of loyalty. **********Mr. Schauble is no radical, and a government under his leadership would probably pursue policies similar to those Mr. Kohl favors. Recent opinion surveys show him to be Germany's most popular politician, favored to be the next Chancellor over both Mr. Kohl and Bjorn Engholm, leader of the opposition Social Democrats. **********This level of popularity is considered especially impressive because of Mr. Schauble's physical condition.  Since being shot by a deranged assailant at a campaign rally in October 1990, he has used a wheelchair, and expects to do so for the rest of his life.  He says that although the experience of life in a wheelchair has made him a bit slower, it has also made him more patient. **********Mr. Schauble, who was born in the Black Forest town of Freiburg, became active in Christian Democratic youth groups while still a student.  A Favorite of Kohl's **********After winning election to Parliament in 1972, when he was 30 years old, he became a favorite of Mr. Kohl.  Their friendship continued after Mr. Kohl's election as Chancellor, with Mr. Schauble rising to the key post of Interior Minister. **********In June 1991, when Parliament debated whether to move the German Government from Bonn to its traditional home in Berlin, Mr. Schauble delivered a highly persuasive speech that some said turned the tide in favor of Berlin. **********Soon after that debate, Mr. Schauble left his post as Interior Minister to take over parliamentary leadership of the Christian Democrats. It is a crucial post because if there is to be a parliamentary coup against Mr. Kohl before the next scheduled election in 1994, it must be mounted by Christian Democrats.  'Special Feeling for Power' **********Mr. Kohl works assiduously to maintain his power base in Parliament, and he appears to be in no imminent danger of losing a no-confidence vote. Many members say they are not ready to vote against him. **********Mr. Schauble's greatest strength in the contest to succeed Mr. Kohl may be his ability to work with opposition parties. He has good relations with members of Parliament from all major parties, and consults them regularly when planning legislative strategy. **********Several Christian Democrats in Parliament declined to be interviewed about Mr. Schauble. But speaking off the record, they agreed that he was highly intelligent and also capable of coldness, arrogance and cynicism. **********A Government official who has worked with Mr. Schauble for years said: \"Because of his health, he knows that if he wants to be Chancellor, he has to move relatively soon.  But the people who would have to make him Chancellor are not ready to give up on Kohl right now. That is his problem.\" **********If Mr. Schauble has another problem, it is the rise of a second ambitious Christian Democrat, Volker Ruhe, the new Minister of Defense.  Each man celebrated his 50th birthday last month, and rumor-mongers in Bonn are divided about which of the two would become Chancellor if Mr. Kohl's Government were to fall and be replaced by a \"grand coalition\" between the Christian Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats.  Worried Over European Unity **********At his office beside the Rhine, casually dressed in a sweater and open-necked shirt, Mr. Schauble discussed a variety of political issues. A convinced Europeanist, he is troubled by recent setbacks on the path toward European unity. **********\"It's worrisome, especially when you see how powerless Europe has been to stop the war in Yugoslavia,\" he said. \"If unity doesn't work out, it will be a truly historic mistake. We have to make it clearer to people that close European cooperation is not going to mean the loss of national cultures or identities.\" **********Mr. Schauble scoffed at fears that a strong European Community would be a platform for the expansion of German power. \"The opposite is true,\" he asserted. \"Anyone who fears Germany should be strongly in favor of European integration.\" **********Like many German politicians, Mr. Schauble is alarmed by the wave of anti-foreigner violence that has spread through Germany. He predicted, however, that the violence would be brought under control. **********\"Changes in the law are necessary because there are organized groups of people in countries like Romania who are bringing thousands of illegal immigrants over our borders with the promise that they can live here at Government expense,\" he said.  \"Once those people start showing up back at home a week after they leave, they won't keep coming in such numbers.\" **********\"Our police also have a lot to learn.  In the past we taught them to be gentle with protesters, but that was in the days when protesters were mostly kids demonstrating against nuclear power. This is something very different. People involved in these attacks belong behind bars.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/30/world/despite-criticism-bush-will-meet-chinese-premier.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1992-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 906, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Despite Criticism, Bush Will Meet Chinese Premier", "print_headline": "Despite Criticism, Bush Will Meet Chinese Premier", "body_text": " **********President Bush is to meet Prime Minister Li Peng of China in New York on Friday, the White House announced today. **********It will be the first meeting between the leaders since Chinese troops crushed the democracy movement in Beijing in June 1989, killing hundreds of unarmed protesters. Hundreds of others remain in prison. **********Prime Minister Li, making his first trip to the United States since the Tiananmen Square crackdown, will be attending a one-day Security Council summit meeting. China and the United States are permanent members of the Council. Meeting Is Criticized **********The decision by Mr. Bush to hold talks with Prime Minister Li has prompted sharp criticism from Congress and human rights organizations. At least 28 senators and representatives have written to the President this week urging him not to meet Mr. Li, who is considered a hard-liner, unless China first makes concessions on issues of importance to the United States. **********Members of Congress are hoping to begin debate as early as next week on whether conditions should be attached to a continuation of China's most-favored-nation trade status, which President Bush must review in May. **********Chinese students in New York are planning to demonstrate against Mr. Li's visit outside the United Nations on Friday. **********Mr. Bush, who served in 1974 and 1975 as head of the United States Liaison Office in Beijing, the precursor to an embassy, has more experience with the Chinese than any previous American President and has played an active role in China policy. Like a number of European leaders, he is thought to favor continuing a dialogue with the Chinese despite differences with the current leadership. Session Termed 'a Courtesy' **********An Administration official said today that the Chinese had requested the meeting, and that it was \"a courtesy\" extended to them. The meeting is to take place at about 5 P.M. Friday, just after the conclusion of the Security Council session. The Administration views the talks as an extension of the United Nations session, held on neutral ground. **********\"The President will discuss a number of items, even though it's only a 15-20 minute meeting,\" the official said. \"They include missile proliferation, human rights and trade. He'll be interested in hearing Chinese views on whether there's any movement on those.\" **********The vocal critical minority in Congress, drawn from both parties, says the Chinese not only continue to detain supporters of democracy despite a worldwide outcry, but have also been stalling in formally agreeing to adhere to the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international agreement limiting the export of weapons technology. **********Beijing wants the United States to first lift sanctions imposed last June and July barring the sale of high-speed computers and satellite parts to China. It was understood when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d visited Beijing in mid-November that the sanctions would be lifted in return for Chinese pledges on missile sales. Sanctions imposed after the 1989 crackdown were to remain in place. **********On his visit to China, Mr. Baker urged the Chinese to improve their human rights record. Administration officials say that face-to-face meetings with the Chinese are necessary, and that nothing is to be gained by boycotting the Chinese leadership. This month, long negotiations finally produced an accord on copyrights and patents. Chinese violations of intellectual property rights had been an irritant to trade and technology exchanges. **********Prime Minister John Major of Britain is also expected to meet Mr. Li in New York on Friday. In September, Mr. Major became the first Western head of government to go to China after the Tiananmen crackdown. He said at the time that it was important to raise human rights issues, and London's qualms about the future of Hong Kong, directly with the Chinese. **********In the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from San Francisco who has been leading a campaign to attach conditions to the continuation of China's most-favored-nation trade status, said in an interview this week that a meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Li would be \"a devastating blow to democracy advocates in China.\" **********Mrs. Pelosi and six other representatives wrote to the President on Tuesday, advising against separate talks with Mr. Li outside the Security Council summit session. The letter drew attention to China's use of prison labor, suppression of Tibetan nationalism, limitations on the practice of religion and the continued detention of dissenters. **********Today, 21 senators, led by Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, sent a similar letter to the White House. It not only urged President Bush to reject Mr. Li's request for a meeting but also asked that the United States raise human rights violations in China at the annual meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, beginning this week in Geneva. **********Mike Jendrzejczyk, the Washington director of Asia Watch, a human rights monitoring group, called China's record in human rights under Prime Minister Li \"an anachronism in the new world order.\" **********In New York, Asia Watch said: \"The conciliatory approach of President Bush and Secretary of State Baker toward China has largely failed. At best a few token pro-democracy prisoners have been released. Yet over 1,000 are known to remain in prison. No foreign observer has yet attended a political trial or seen a major political prisoner from the 1989 movement.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/11/world/mission-to-somalia-somali-gunmen-pushed-away-from-capital-take-terror-inland.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1992-12-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1064, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Somali Gunmen, Pushed Away From Capital, Take Terror Inland", "print_headline": "MISSION TO SOMALIA; Somali Gunmen, Pushed Away From Capital, Take Terror Inland", "body_text": " **********Gunmen, some of them flushed from Mogadishu by the arrival of American troops, have terrorized this town at the epicenter of the Somali famine in the last few days, killing, looting and preventing relief agencies from feeding the hungry. **********Local people, more afraid than usual, said food was of secondary importance. They wanted the guns confiscated. **********\"I'm very nervous,\" Adan Ahmed Isaak, a field officer for the Somali Red Crescent Society, said today. \"The Americans made a big mistake by coming only to Mogadishu instead of coming to the whole country. At what time will they come here? They are so late. If they don't come soon, we will be in big trouble.\" Deadly Guns and Hunger **********The foreign troops, including 1,700 United States Marines and 150 French Foreign Legionnaires, control the port and airport of Mogadishu and have set up a handful of checkpoints in the city. But several gunbattles were reported in the capital today, including one clash between Somali gunmen and French and American troops that left two Somalis dead and seven wounded. It was the first blood drawn by the United Nations-backed military mission to Somalia. **********After solidifying their position in Mogadishu, which will become the command and supply center for their mission to protect the delivery of food and other aid to starving Somalis, the American-led military force is expected to take control of Baidoa. But the Americans' initial plans to make Baidoa their next target appear to have changed somewhat with the American seizure of the airstrip at Uanle Wen, a town between Baidoa and the capital. It was unclear whether the change was related to the possibility of resistance in Baidoa. **********When they do arrive in Baidoa, the foreign troops will find a town where most people look remarkably better than the barely moving skeletons of six months ago. But it is a place that has plenty of despair. Tens of thousands of people have died since the famine hit here earlier this year, and about 30,000 people are still dependent on food handouts even though the surrounding countryside is now green after heavy rains and, in some places, sprouting maize. The cattle that would have grazed on the new grass, providing milk that would have fed most of the Somalis in this region, died or were stolen long ago. **********In a success for the fitful diplomatic efforts under way to stem the violence, the leaders of two warring Somali factions agreed to meet at the newly reopened United States Embassy on Friday and on a French warship on Saturday. Herman Cohen, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, was expected to attend Friday's meeting of the two clan leaders, Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid and Mohammed Ali Mahdi. **********\"It is possible this meeting could lead to a solution to Somalia's problems,\" Washington's special envoy to Somalia, Robert B. Oakley told Reuters today. **********Perhaps more than anywhere in Somalia, Baidoa has symbolized the deadly combination of hunger and guns. Last month, a convoy of 400 tons of grain was looted just outside the town, and since then food has been flown but not trucked into Baidoa. **********On Wednesday, a truck of the Somali Red Crescent picked up the bodies of 65 people who had died overnight of disease and hunger, 44 of them adults. It was not an unusually high number; every day, more than 50 bodies are collected and buried, and such figures are a vast improvement compared to the more than 300 who were dying daily in September. But the deaths enrage Mr. Isaak, who blames the armed men. **********\"Today, the first meal at our kitchens went O.K.,\" Mr. Isaak said. \"But we couldn't give the second meal because of the gunmen. We couldn't get food out of the warehouse.\" **********About half a dozen of the gunmen's armed vehicles blockaded the food warehouse of the International Committee of the Red Cross this morning, preventing aid workers from transporting the beans, rice and oil to the kitchens, Mr. Isaak said. **********But by mid-afternoon, the vehicles and their gunmen had moved away from the dilapidated warehouse on the edge of town, probably to enjoy their afternoon chewing of khat, the leaf narcotic that is common in Somalia, before returning to town for an evening of shooting. **********In a 24-hour period this week, 64 Somalis died in gun battles here, according to foreign aid workers. **********The danger has become so intense that almost all foreign aid workers have left Baidoa. **********\"They are afraid of this moment before the American troops come,\" Mr. Isaak said. **********Even the Red Cross, always reluctant to evacuate its staff, flew four of its employees out of Baidoa on Friday, leaving only three behind. Today the four-wheel-drive cars of Western aid organizations were full of Somali employees, but no foreign aid workers could be seen. The aid agency compounds appeared empty, and a few miles out of town, a feeding center with the sign World Vision, an American aid agency, looked deserted. **********Word had started to spread around the marketplace -- filled with barrows of fruit and sacks of stolen international aid grain -- that the Americans were coming. **********\"We don't mind if they come,\" said Abdullah Ali, who works at the Bay Bakool and Ged Hotel, his lips tinged green from chewing khat. \"They should come and make peace and take away the guns. I will give my gun to them and hope to get some money. I hope to get $100 and make some business from it.\" **********It seemed unlikely that Mr. Ali would get money. Farther down the road toward Mogadishu, American troops had already collected guns at the airstrip at Uanle Uen, 60 miles north of the capital. On their first move out of the capital since arriving, the Americans secured the airstrip and confiscated weapons from local fighters camped there. **********\"They told us that if we took our guns to the airport in the morning they would welcome us,\" said a young boy at a tea shop at Uanle Uen. \"If we don't bring them, they said they would use helicopters to hunt down the technicals and the weapons. The community has promised to take the weapons to the Americans tomorrow morning.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/23/business/late-buying-pushes-dow-up-by-32.42.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1992-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 485, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Late Buying Pushes Dow Up by 32.42", "print_headline": "Late Buying Pushes Dow Up by 32.42", "body_text": " **********Stock prices posted crisp gains in active trading yesterday, as investor confidence returned after two days of losses.

Every race should remain in its own land.\" **********Roberto Vallacchi, a 27-year-old \"Nazi-skin\" leader, said in a published interview, \"I like Nazism; I don't deny it.\" He added: \"The Holocaust is a lie. Crematoriums and gas chambers never existed.\" **********The remoteness of such groups from the mainstream of Italy's politics is such that several of the country's leaders hastened to disassociate their land from the \"Nazi-skins\" after the Jan. 20 attack on Mr. Mellouhi, who is from Algeria, and Mr. Dridi, from Tunisia. **********\"I told them that I was certain that not all Italians are like that,\" President Francesco Cossiga said after meeting the two men as they recovered in the hospital. Harsh behavior toward immigrants is a peculiarly delicate issue because so many Italians escaped poverty and made their fortunes after immigrating to the United States. **********Other Italians see a broader phenomenon related not only to the long-running economic-based tensions between Europeans and those who come from afar to work in their lands, but also to a wider historical shift. **********\"Now nationalism emerges as well as hatreds between races, the contrast between Islam and Christianity, fear of the foreigner,\" said Giulio Salierno, a left-wing sociologist. **********\"I think that even in Italy, as in the rest of Europe, we are witnessing a rapprochement with the traditional German culture, which means we are all as a people taking another look at our own past and our own identity,\" he said. \"From this comes friction and open conflict.\" **********Shortly after the attack on Mr. Mellouhi and Mr. Dridi, newspaper reports said, an unidentifed assailant beat a third North African man until he fell unconscious on a bus in Rome. The man was said to have screamed: \"You blacks are taking our jobs away from us. We are sick of supporting you.\" The bus driver drove on, the reports said. **********According to official statistics issued by the Department of Immigration, 726,000 immigrants are known to reside among Italy's 57 million people, more than one quarter of them from North Africa.

In dollars of equivalent purchasing power, a German worker produced $44,200, a Japanese worker $38,200 and a British worker only $37,100, according to the study by the McKinsey Global Institute, a Washington offshoot of the McKinsey consulting firm, together with three of the nation's top productivity experts, including the Nobel Laureate Robert Solow. Competition Is Cited **********America's secret productivity weapon, the report concluded, is not bigger companies, more robots or even brainier managers. Instead, it is Washington's relative reluctance to protect companies from the rigors of competition, domestic or foreign. **********The study shows that the United States is farthest ahead in the service sector, which now employs three out of four American workers. **********\"We were all surprised by the extent of the U.S. lead in services,\" said Martin Baily, an economist at the University of Maryland who wrote parts of the report. \"Most of us had concluded that the U.S. had been overtaken.\" **********The study is not the first to reach this conclusion. But it is more convincing than earlier research because it is based on better data for manufacturing as well as detailed case studies of several service industries. Ultimate Yardstick **********Productivity is the ultimate yardstick of international competitiveness. It determines not only a nation's standard of living but also status in the world. Whether it was Italy from the 13th to 15th centuries, the Netherlands in the 18th, England in the 19th or the United States in the 20th, the reigning superpower has always been the global productivity leader. **********'We're trying to take the position that competitiveness is not just machinery and semiconductors but the entire economy,\" Professor Baily said. \"The service sector is terribly important to overall living standards.\" **********General merchandise retailing, for example, is more than twice as efficient in the United States as in Japan, largely because Japan's zoning laws save mom-and-pop stores from annihilation by the Japanese equivalents of Wal-Mart, according to one of five case studies of service industries in the report. And the deregulated American telecommunications industry is at least twice as productive as Germany's government monopoly, while the fragmented American consumer banking industry is a third more efficient than Germany's gargantuan banking oligopolies. **********The United States has not had to sacrifice consumer choice or quality for greater efficiency either, the authors say, citing retail banking and telecommunications. First Place Confirmed? **********Some conservative economists say the report confirms what they have long maintained: that the United States is still No. 1. \"It's nice when the evidence says that what you thought was the case is the case,\" said John Taylor of Stanford University, a former member of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. **********The report did not attempt to explain why the productivity of the United States economy has been growing more slowly since 1973 than it has, on average, during the last century. \"There's nothing in here that should make a reasonable person conclude that the trend rate of growth in productivity since 1973 has been O.K.,\" said Francis Bator at the Kennedy School of Government, another academic who helped shape the study. **********For manufacturing, the McKinsey report draws heavily on new data, not widely disseminated here, from a Dutch research team at the University of Groningen led by Angus Maddison, one of the world's leading authorities on international economic comparisons. The Dutch comparisons are based on more appropriate and more detailed data than have been available before, in particular on hours worked and prices of factory goods needed to convert different countries' production into dollars of the same purchasing power. **********It found that German and Japanese factory workers produced just 80 percent as much on average as American workers on an hourly basis. **********While Japan has pulled ahead of the United States in several heavy manufacturing industries, including cars and machinery, it lags far behind in at least half of its manufacturing base. And while the United States lead in manufacturing has continued to shrink in recent years, it shrank more slowly during the 1980's -- and actually widened against Germany -- than in the first three and a half decades after World War II. **********Referring to manufacturing, the authors said, \"It seems likely that the United States will retain a modest productivity lead for some years to come.\" **********That may seem surprising since the United States has been investing a far smaller fraction of its resources than Germany or Japan. But the study also found that the United States seems to have gotten more mileage from its investments than other countries, because freedom from heavy-handed regulation has allowed many industries, but especially in the service sector, to function more efficiently. **********In fact, the second surprising conclusion is that America's biggest advantage consists of Washington's relatively hands-off attitude, compared with Tokyo or Bonn. This means, for example, that American companies are relatively free to lay off unnecessary workers, to change prices or to enter new businesses or leave old ones compared with their counterparts elsewhere. **********America's competitors, on the other hand, have forgone higher living standards for all in order to protect the jobs of some. **********\"It's not obvious that the U.S. should be copying a model elsewhere,\" said William Lewis, director of the McKinsey Global Institute and an Assistant Secretary of Energy under President Jimmy Carter. The United States has moved faster in this direction since the mid-1970's, deregulating airlines, telecommunications, trucking and some parts of banking, among other things. Today, United States airlines are almost a third more productive than European airlines, the study reported, based on the number of workers needed to book passengers, fly them and serve them. **********The researchers said they had expected the far greater size of the American passenger air market to explain most of that difference. **********\"Big enterprises ought to have advantages over smaller enterprises,\" Professor Solow said. \"There are traces of that. But over all, it's not important.\" **********In the case of airlines, for example, the cutthroat competition turns out to be far more effective in keeping the airlines efficient, than their large size or their ability to use the hub system, which brings together large groups of passengers headed for different destinations. In fact, the researchers found the much-vaunted hub system actually reduces the productivity of American airlines by requiring peak staffing. **********\"It means you have ground crews and ticketing agents and a lot of them,\" Professor Baily said. \"You can't service one plane at 4 and another at 4:30 with the same crew.\" **********If the analysis in the report is correct, it suggests that Americans bent on improving the nation's competitiveness would be ill advised to retreat from freer trade, openness to foreign direct investment or the deregulation, all of which have characterized the Carter, Reagan and Bush years. **********\"The case studies of service industries point up the role of competition much more sharply than the rest of the economy,\" Mr. Lewis said. Competition Need Seen **********Indeed, the report urges the next administration -- no matter who is elected -- to stimulate more competition in services as a way of ultimately lifting living standards, along with efforts to increase saving and investment and improve worker skills. **********\"Deregulation of services, where it could be accomplished, is likely to pay off,\" Professor Solow said. \"There are still plenty of restrictions on banking and I have a feeling there's less competition in writing insurance than there might be.\" **********Professor Taylor at Stanford pointed to some other important opportunities, too: \"The findings suggest to me the importance of promoting competition in other services, especially in health and education,\" he said. Health, education, government and nonprofit organizations that are not subject to intense market pressures employ 28 percent of America's workers, compared with 22 percent in Germany and 12 percent in Japan. **********The report's authors -- all long-time Democrats -- also stressed that future administrations should press harder to get other nations to open their borders wider to American service companies. The advantage to the United States, which has been closing its trade deficit with the help of billions of dollars in service exports, is obvious, but the report also stresses that greater competition in Japan and Europe will ultimately benefit businesses in those countries as well as consumers. **********But the authors argue that along with a free market approach government must also pursue full employment policies and provide cash and retraining for those who lose jobs as companies strive to become even more efficient. Supports Earlier Ideas **********Though the report contradicts today's conventional wisdom, the study's conclusions support earlier research by economists like William Baumol and Edward Wolff at New York University, Dale Jorgenson at Harvard University and Robert Summers and Alan Heston at the University of Pennsylvania as well as the theme of Michael Porter, the Harvard Business School author of \"The Competitive Advantage of Nations.\" **********The detailed case studies that the team of McKinsey consultants prepared shed light on issues that have been troubling researchers like these who have been working with aggregate national income account data for years. **********\"There's no way to get at services through the macro data,\" Professor Baily said. \"I was staggered by how systematic the McKinsey guys were,\" he added. \"Somebody would raise an issue. We'd say, 'There's no data' and these guys would fly off to Europe to ask other consultants and their clients to find out for for them.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/05/business/rtc-plans-an-auction.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "R.T.C.

But there has also been a general scramble by investors and speculators to get ahead of the game, to buy the dollar early so that any rally will mean really nice profits. **********\"The market is largely speculative,\" said David Gilmore, senior foreign exchange economist at MCM Currency Watch in New York, \"and you make money by getting on trends early on and promoting them as best you can.\" **********But as with last winter's upturn, this rally was not really expected. And now, forecasters are wondering if this year's rally will last; last year's fizzled. More Confirmation Is Needed **********\"From a trading point of view, the dollar went pretty far pretty fast,\" said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation in New York. \"Now, this story has to be ratified by fundamental evidence.\" **********Some of that evidence came in the retail sales and industrial production increases in February. But more confirmation is needed in the March and April economic reports to get the dollar moving higher. **********Forecasters contend that as long as data support the expectation of an economic recovery, the dollar will remain in its current range of 1.64 to 1.68 against the German mark. It closed Friday at 1.6714 marks. **********And the dollar could move to the 1.80 range as the recovery gains momentum and increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to keep inflation from reigniting. Such a jump would mean an increase of almost 19 percent from the end of 1991. **********But some forecasters expect the dollar to fall later in the year to its current levels as the German and other European economies recover from their recessions or economic slowdowns. **********If there are disappointments in the United States economy, the dollar will fall, as it did last year when the hoped-for recovery did not materialize. In that cycle, the dollar rose by 23 percent by the summer and then fell back to end the year up just 1.8 percent. **********On the Japanese yen, views are more mixed. Some forecasters say it will fall. But some analysts say that although the dollar has risen against the yen to the 134 level in the last three months, they expect the yen to rally later in the year. On Friday, the dollar closed at 133.85 against the yen. **********The late-year-rally view is based, in part, on the growing trade surplus that Japan has with the United States and the rest of the world. There is also a belief that a rising yen, by making Japanese exports more expensive, would help curb the surplus, which otherwise adds to trade frictions. A turnaround in the Japanese economy is also forecast to support the yen. **********\"We have a very aggressive forecast on the yen,\" said Geoffrey Dennis of James Capel Inc. in New York. The rise in the surplus, he added, is a \"psychological thing\" that should draw support to the yen. **********The dollar rally this year is in part a result of the new suddenness in the dollar's ability to change direction. It is not that the dollar, during any day, cannot turn quickly. That kind of shift has always happened. But the dollar these days seems to move far ahead of the signs -- economic, technical and otherwise -- that forecasters have depended upon in the past. **********The guideposts of forecasting -- interest rate differentials, central-bank policy, capital flows and others -- are not giving the early warnings of change that they are supposed to. They are, in fact, often too late. **********\"The speed of the move means that you do not have the luxury anymore of waiting for the data to make up your mind,\" said Nicholas Sargen, the managing director of Prudential's Global Fixed Income Advisers. \"You have to be much quicker on your toes in catching these changes in market sentiment. You have to be more anticipatory.\" A 7.7% Move in a Week **********This year, the sudden switch in direction came between Jan. 9 and Jan. 15, five trading days in which the dollar soared 7.7 percent against the German mark. And the move came at a time when the so-called signposts seemed to point to a weaker dollar. **********Some analysts say that the rally this year, which has seen the dollar rise almost 10.2 percent against the mark and 7.3 percent against the yen, is being helped by a new reluctance in the Bush Administration to intervene in the foreign exchange market. They argue that in this election year a stronger dollar helps President Bush by lessening inflationary pressures and, in turn, easing the upward push on long-term interest rates that could threaten an election-year recovery. **********Both these factors have made forecasting the path of the dollar more difficult this year and help explain why many analysts, who thought the dollar would remain weaker in the beginning of the year, were wrong. These same factors could also affect the dollar's course from here. More Betting on Anticipation **********The reason the traditional signposts for following the dollar are less useful is that the foreign exchange market and the millions of investors and speculators in it are placing their bets more on anticipation than they have in the past. Instead of waiting for evidence of a change in the direction of the dollar, they are trying to get on the bandwagon in advance. **********Even with short-term interest rates on the German mark five percentage points higher than those on the dollar, many investors are counting on better gains from a quick rally of the American currency. But to better their chances they have had to buy the dollar early. And it is these purchases that have pushed the dollar higher. **********\"The market has gotten more reactionary,\" said James T. McGroarty, senior vice president of Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. in Greenwich, Conn. \"The discounting mechanism of the market has gotten much more sophisticated, and investors and speculators are positioned now well in advance.\" **********Mr. Sargen, a former Salomon Brothers economist, offered a specific example of how the signposts had changed. He said that until recently the dollar had not made a major turn upward until it was quite clear that the Federal Reserve Board had changed its policy on interest rates from easing, which can undercut the dollar, to tightening, which can support the dollar. **********But in the last two years this sequence has not been the case. In 1991, the dollar rallied from a post-World War II record low of 1.4475 marks in February to around 1.83 marks in July, even as the Federal Reserve was still easing interest rates in an effort to revive the economy. **********The same has been true this year. For example, Salomon Brothers expected the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates one more time early in the year. Thus, it expected the dollar to remain weak. But the dollar defied the traditional signposts again by beginning to rise in January. Evidence of Fed's Shift **********The apparent change in the Administration's position on intervention in the foreign currency market has also helped the dollar rally, said David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. Mr. McGroarty said he, too, had sensed a change in policy. **********The change is apparent in the policy actions taken in January and since then. In January, the Federal Reserve, on the instructions of the Administration, intervened to sell dollars against the yen. This move was, at the time, a clear signal that both the Bush Administration and the Japanese Government wanted the dollar to fall against the yen. **********But since then, although the dollar has risen almost 8 percent against the yen, there has been no further intervention."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/02/business/executive-changes-387692.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 206, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********ACU-TRAC INC., Easton, Md., a coupon management and data base company, named Charles P.

Eastern standard time, the \"no\" side had captured 56.6 percent of the vote and the \"yes\" side 43.5 percent. \"Yes\" forces were also headed for defeat in Nova Scotia, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia. In Ontario, voters narrowly approved the referendum. In the Atlantic provinces, with the exception of Nova Scotia, the tide ran strongly in favor of the \"yes\" side. **********Nationally, with 73 percent of the vote counted at 10 P.M., the \"yes\" side had 47.7 percent against the \"no\" side's 52.3 percent. **********\"The Charlottetown agreement is now history,\" Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said in Ottawa. He said that the vote ended discussion on constitutional issues for the foreseeable future and that the country must now turn to fostering \"strong and durable economic renewal.\" **********Jacques Parizeau, who leads the separatist Parti Quebecois, told cheering followers in Montreal: \"We have tonight said what we don't want. Next time we will say what we want.\" **********Both Mr. Parizeau and his separatist colleague Lucien Bouchard, who leads the Bloc Quebecois, a group dedicated to Quebec separatism in the House of Commons, have said a \"no\" victory will mean accelerating plans to quit the 125-year-old Canadian federation. But the Parti Quebecois would still have to win elections in Quebec and then ask Quebecers to vote in another referendum on whether they want to leave. **********Quebec's Premier, Robert Bourassa, a main backer of the \"yes\" side, said tonight that his program would continue to be \"build Quebec within Canada.\" He will be under pressure to call elections before his mandate expires at the end of 1994. **********Canada's 18.5 million eligible voters -- 4.8 million of them in Quebec -- faced this question: \"Do you agree that the Constitution of Canada should be renewed on the basis of the agreement reached on Aug. 28, 1992?\" Special Status for Quebec **********The so-called Charlottetown agreement, named for the capital of Prince Edward Island where Canada's federation founded, was framed by the country's political leadership to meet Quebec's demands for greater autonomy. **********Representing the sixth time in the last 25 years that Canadian Governments have sought to amend their Constitution, the agreement would have granted Quebec special constitutional status because of its distinct culture and legal system, which is based on the Napoleonic Code. **********Quebec is not a signatory to the Canadian Constitution. The principal aim of Mr. Mulroney and other framers of the Charlottetown accord was to get Quebec's signature on the document and drive a stake through the heart of Quebec separatism, which has sent tremors through the 10-province confederation for decades. **********In an effort to win the support of western voters who balked at an earlier proposal recognizing Quebec as a \"distinct society,\" the Charlottetown pact would have also created a popularly elected Senate. Aboriginal peoples would have been given powers to govern themselves. **********But as a patchwork of political compromises, the agreement had been under heavy attack. Quebec nationalists said it did not go far enough in meeting their demands, while those with anti-Quebec feelings saw it going too far. **********\"They see it as a way of voting against French on the cereal boxes,\" said one \"yes\" campaigner after returning from a promotion trip out west. By law, commercial products have been sold with bilingual labels in Canada since the early 1970's. **********Opponents also cited distrust of politicians and dislike of Mr. Mulroney, who has the lowest poll rating of any Canadian leader in the last 50 years. Economic Issues Cited **********Those voting \"yes\" generally said it was a vote for caution. Many feared the economic and financial consequences of more Canadian disunity. Interest rates in Canada have risen sharply as a result of opinion polls showing the \"no\" vote maintaining a lead in several provinces in the weeks leading up to the vote. **********\"Canadians want their political leaders to concentrate on economic issues,\" said Tom d'Aquino of the Business Council on National Issues. **********The referendum is technically nonbinding, and is supposed to merely guide the provincial assemblies, whose unanimous approval would be needed to formally ratify the pact. **********It was only the third time since confederation in 1867 that Canadians have voted in a national referendum, and support for the union, in whatever form, has never been submitted to a direct electoral test nationwide. But there have been provincial referendums on the issue, most recently in Quebec in 1980 when the governing Parti Quebecois sought a mandate to negotiate independence. Sixty percent of the voters voted \"no.\" **********The results of today's votes could have implications far beyond the defeat of the Charlottetown agreement. It could affect the political future of Mr. Mulroney and his Conservative Government. **********Although the Canadian leader has said a \"no\" vote will not be a personal defeat for anyone, voters apparently think otherwise. According to a poll taken last week, 73 percent said Mr. Mulroney should resign or call an election, a year earlier than required, if the \"no\" side won."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/22/world/to-counter-iran-saudis-seek-ties-with-ex-soviet-islamic-republics.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 573, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "To Counter Iran, Saudis Seek Ties With Ex-Soviet Islamic Republics", "print_headline": "To Counter Iran, Saudis Seek Ties With Ex-Soviet Islamic Republics", "body_text": " **********Saudi Arabia has established diplomatic relations with Uzbekistan, one of the newly independent Central Asian republics that were once part of the Soviet Union, in a move to blunt Iran's diplomatic offensive to win influence in that Islamic region. **********The development, announced here today, came as several pro-Western Islamic countries -- notably Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia -- appeared to have begun significant efforts to establish ties with the Islamic republics of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, among others. **********The Saudi gesture was buttressed by an offer from King Fahd to pay the expenses of Muslim pilgrims from Uzbekistan who wish to visit Mecca over the next two years and to finance the restoration of several mosques and religious sites in the region.

Confident About Payment **********With a tax payment of about $75 million due on July 1, city and company officials said last week that options had been explored about whether some or all of that payment might be delayed. **********But city officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, expressed confidence late last week that payments would continue to be made and pointed out that relative to the $7 billion to $8 billion in property taxes the city collects each year, Olympia & York's contribution is fairly small. **********Analysts tended to agree.

The genesis of the deal goes back to 1987, when Aetna decided to explore the sale of its reinsurance unit for two reasons, said Edward B. Jobe, president and chief executive officer of the American Re-Insurance Company, who will continue to run the company after the sale to Kohlberg, Kravis, which will rename the company the American Re Corporation. **********One reason is that many American Re-Insurance customers were competitors of its parent, Aetna Life and Casualty. Insurance companies use reinsurers to distribute their risks. \"There has been concern by some of our clients about having their reinsurer being owned by one of their principal competitors,\" Mr. Jobe said in an interview from American Re-Insurance's offices in Princeton, N.J. **********In addition, Mr. Jobe said Aetna had grown increasingly concerned about its combined exposure with American Re-Insurance to catastrophes. \"With all the building along the Atlantic coast,\" he said, the exposure to hurricanes \"has become very substantial.\" Weston Hicks, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, also said the deal made sense for Aetna because the reinsurance unit, which handles property and casualty insurance, was less profitable than many of Aetna's other units. \"It's a tough business,\" he said. **********Whatever the roots of the deal, analysts said the sale to Kohlberg, Kravis for $1.4 billion, including $1.2 billion in cash, would help Aetna increase reserves for real estate losses, a move that underscores the defensive posture of many insurers worried about their image among credit-rating agencies and customers. **********Daniel Murray, an analyst with Argus Research, said Aetna had less adequate reserves against real estate losses than its largest competitors. **********Aetna closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $41.25, up 37.5 cents."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/13/business/company-news-the-lion-stalks-the-hunter-will-combining-2-flops-be-a-hit.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1992-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 440, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS: The Lion Stalks the Hunter; Will Combining 2 Flops Be a Hit?", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS: The Lion Stalks the Hunter; Will Combining 2 Flops Be a Hit?", "body_text": " **********The MGM film studio, which has spent the last few years nearly paralyzed by financial problems, has come up with a novel solution to its woes: acquire another ailing movie company. **********The MGM-Pathe Communications Corporation, as the company is formally known, said today that it had submitted an offer to the Orion Pictures Corporation to distribute 10 films completed by Orion but not released, and possibly to acquire its film library. The unreleased films and the library are the primary assets of Orion, which has stopped making movies and has lost most of its top executives. **********Orion filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection last year but has managed to create some of Hollywood's best films, including \"The Silence of the Lambs\" and \"Dances With Wolves.\" **********In recent weeks the company has attracted a lot of attention. MGM's offer is the third that has been put on the table. The others are from the Republic Pictures Corporation, which produces television movies and mini-series and has a large library of old films and television programs, and Savoy Pictures Entertainment, a newly formed company headed by Victor A. Kaufman, who ran Columbia Pictures in the 80's. **********Orion said it had received several \"indications of interest\" in addition to the three offers, and that it had set a deadline of Thursday for any further bids. **********Despite its own financial troubles, MGM has been interested in bidding for all or part of Orion for several months, and industry executives said the deal would make sense for MGM. MGM needs to be able to offer movie theaters more films to keep its distribution system competitive with those of the major studios, and acquiring 10 completed films from Orion would help. The unreleased films from Orion include \"Love Field,\" an interracial love story starring Michelle Pfeiffer, and \"Robocop 3.\" **********MGM is operating under the control of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, which last week completed the process of seizing the studio from Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier whose acquisition of MGM collapsed when he was unable to pay his debts. Credit Lyonnais, which was reportedly owed as much as $1 billion by Mr. Parretti and his complex web of companies, has said it plans to re-establish MGM as a viable competitor in Hollywood. **********MGM's offer includes provisions for an advance to Orion of $50 million against fees for distributing the films, as well as a commitment to spend $30 million to $35 million for marketing and distribution. MGM said its bid also included an option to buy Orion's film library, although it did not put a value on it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/17/world/bush-says-politics-is-not-motivation-in-plans-for-iraq.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1992-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1317, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSH SAYS POLITICS IS NOT MOTIVATION IN PLANS FOR IRAQ", "print_headline": "BUSH SAYS POLITICS IS NOT MOTIVATION IN PLANS FOR IRAQ", "body_text": " **********President Bush angrily denied yesterday that he wanted to provoke a clash with Iraq to help his re-election campaign, but he confirmed that he was consulting with allies about using any means necessary to force the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, to submit to United Nations weapons inspections and to end his repression of Iraqi Shiites. **********\"The United States has plans to be sure that Saddam Hussein does what he is supposed to do,\" said Mr. Bush, when asked if the United States was ready to use military force today to back up an anticipated request by the United Nations to inspect sensitive Iraqi ministries. Mr. Bush added that the Iraqi President will no longer be allowed \"to dictate what can and cannot be inspected.\" **********In Baghdad this morning, a United Nations team left its hotel for its last day of inspections, Reuters reported from the Iraqi capital, where the time is eight hours later than in New York. The head of the team did not disclose its destination. **********In a new development, American and allied officials said a consensus was emerging among the gulf war coalition partners to intervene in some way in southern Iraq to protect the Shiite Muslim population there from repeated attacks by President's Hussein air force, just as the coalition intervened in northern Iraq to protect the Iraqi Kurdish minority. Charge of Provocation **********The President, returning to Washington from a weekend at his Camp David retreat, was reacting to a report in The New York Times yesterday, which quoted American officials as saying that the United States and its allies had decided to provoke a confrontation today by insisting that United Nations weapons inspectors be allowed access to sensitive Government ministries in Baghdad. The report also quoted officials who said that Mr. Bush may have initiated this step, on the eve of the Republican Party's convention in Houston, to demonstrate the same sort of toughness that won him plaudits during the Persian Gulf war. **********The suggestion of a political motivation angered Republican officials gathered in Houston for the convention. Mary Matalin, Mr. Bush's deputy campaign manager, denounced it as \"total trash,\" and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney called it \"goofy.\" **********But neither the President, the Secretary of Defense nor any other official in the chain of military command denied that the Administration had prepared plans for a military strike, and in his remarks yesterday Mr. Bush acknowledged that \"there's been a clear breach of security\" in the information contained in The Times's report. 'Ugly and Uncalled For' **********\"I totally deny that we are trying to pick a fight, and I totally deny that I'm trying to pick a fight for political reasons,\" said Mr. Bush, barely containing his anger as he spoke to reporters on the East Lawn of the White House. Any suggestion otherwise, said the President, was \"ugly and uncalled for.\" **********Mr. Bush said that in this election season \"some will accuse me of political opportunism for every step I take. But that will not deter me.\" **********While the President insisted that he was not politically motivated, he left no doubt that his Administration has decided that it will no longer tolerate President Hussein's challenge to the authority of the United Nations and the cease-fire agreements that Iraq signed after its defeat in the gulf war. Standoff in Baghdad **********In particular, the Administration has decided that it will not tolerate a repetition of last month's 21-day standoff in Baghdad, when President Hussein barred United Nations inspectors from the Agriculture Ministry, which they planned to search for documents on Iraqi weapons programs. Mr. Hussein eventually backed down, but only after getting Washington to agree that no Americans or citizens of other nations that fought against Iraq in the gulf war would be on the inspection teams. **********At that time, said a senior Administration official, the gulf war allies -- particularly Britain, France, the United States and Saudi Arabia -- \"were not focused\" on how, if at all, to respond. As a result of consultations during the last two weeks, the official said, \"what you have now is a real determination to obtain unconditional and immediate access to Iraqi programs involving weapons of mass destruction.\" **********American officials confirmed that the Pentagon dispatched an air war planning unit to Saudi Arabia last week to prepare United States air units already there for possible military action. NBC News first reported that Gen. Michael Nelson took 30 air warfare experts from Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina to Riyadh on Thursday. **********\"We're determined that U.N. Resolution 687 will be fully implemented,\" said Mr. Bush. \"Now this requires U.N. teams to inspect and destroy the Iraqi network of weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, chemical, biological and missile.\" Timing of Inspections **********Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney insisted that the timing of any inspections was a matter to be determined by Rolf Ekeus, the head of all United Nations inspection teams, who takes his instructions from the Security Council. Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney cited this as proof that the Administration could not possibly be timing a confrontation with Iraq to coincide with the Republican convention. **********. \"Those are all decisions that are made by the United Nations,\" Secretary Cheney told reporters at Andrews Air Force base yesterday. \"The United Nations has been inspecting, with U.S. help, sensitive installations in Iraq since the summer of 1991, and that process continues. **********\"We cannot halt the inspection process or suggest that it ought to be halted because there is a political campaign underway in the United States,\" Mr. Cheney continued. **********But the United States, Britain and France have dominated Security Council planning and decision-making regarding Iraq.

They say that conditions of life in eastern cities like Rostock contributed to the violence and that by some standards, those conditions are worse now than in Communist days. **********\"In that section of Rostock there are 25,000 people living in close quarters, half of them unemployed and many of them without any prospects,\" said Karlheinz Blessing, general manager of the Social Democrats, the main opposition party. \"They were promised that after unification things were going to go a certain way. But these promises haven't been kept, and that has made people very angry.\" **********Anticipating Parliament's return on Monday from the summer recess, legislative leaders have begun discussing a series of responses to the Rostock violence, ranging from new investment in eastern Germany to better training for the police and social workers there. But most of their attention is fixed on the hotly debated immigration question. A Porous Border **********Because Germany's immigration law is part of its 1949 Constitution, any change requires a two-thirds vote in Parliament and therefore must be approved by the Social Democrats, who until recently had resisted pressure to alter their longstanding opposition to tighter immigration laws. **********But events in Rostock have evidently changed their minds. Senior Social Democrats have decided to call a special party congress, to be held this fall, at which members will be asked to change the party's immigration policy. Party leaders who support the change say the Social Democrats have no hope of winning the 1994 federal election unless they respond to public pressure to curb immigration. **********Under existing German law, all foreigners who say they have been persecuted at home for political reasons may ask for asylum here. While their cases are being investigated, which can take years, the Government pays to house, feed, clothe and otherwise care for them. **********The allure of the asylum process is made greater by the relative ease of entering Germany along the Oder and Neisse rivers, its border with Poland. **********\"The Oder-Neisse doesn't even reach your knees in the summer,\" said Defense Minister Volker Ruhe, a Christian Democrat and an outspoken advocate of tighter immigration laws. \"You're in Germany with a triple jump, and you don't even get your socks wet. Then all you need is one word, asylum, and you're in the German system.\" **********Far more asylum-seekers come to Germany than to any other country in Europe. A decade ago, the number was fewer than 50,000 a year, but this year more than 400,000 are expected. Polls suggest that most Germans favor severe tightening of the system that permits them easy entry. **********With unemployment so high in eastern Germany, and with social services so badly deteriorated and living space so hard to find, citizens have turned their anger on the foreigners among them, especially those who are supported by the state. **********Far-right parties have made startling gains by using slogans like \"The Boat Is Full\" and \"Germany for the Germans.\" Established politicians fear that in 1994 these parties could win seats in Parliament. **********Besides threatening German political stability, xenophobic attacks like those in Rostock undermine the country's postwar image as a peaceful place, one with a near-ideal investment climate. **********\"When it comes to right-wing extremists, the world is watching Germany closely because of its past,\" Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told the newspaper Berliner Zeitung. \"Hostility and hatred of foreigners is the last thing we can afford.\" **********Government officials who have investigated the weeklong disturbance in Rostock, which ended only when 200 asylum-seekers were moved out of the area, said many of the rioters were bored local youths frustrated by their lack of opportunity. Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger described them as people who \"have no apartment, no job, and possibly no education to prepare them for life.\" **********But the frustrations of these young people, officials concluded, were fanned by a core group of neo-Nazis from other parts of Germany. Poor Living Conditions Noted **********Alwin Zien, Interior Minister of the eastern state of Brandenburg, said organizers of the riots communicated by citizens' band radio and monitored police frequencies. **********\"They weren't just doing what came to them spontaneously,\" Mr. Zien said in a televised interview. \"We have to adjust to that.\" **********Although many politicians pointed to poor living conditions in Rostock and other eastern cities as the underlying cause of racist violence, some insisted that the police had to adopt tougher tactics. **********\"If the state does not exercise its monopoly on the use of force with all determination, if it does not take drastic action, we are threatened with a conflagration of violence,\" Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the centrist Free Democratic Party, asserted at a news conference. **********The police were unprepared for the violence in Rostock, and even after it began they seemed to have no plan for suppressing it. Senior local and state officials rejected calls for their resignations, arguing that the Bonn Government had not given them the tools they needed to fight lawlessness. Rostock Police Understaffed **********The Rostock police force is supposed to have 5,300 officers, but 600 are away at training courses in western Germany and 700 slots have gone unfilled for budget reasons. Of those who remain, 70 percent are veterans of the old East German police, despised by many citizens. **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl's senior adviser on issues relating to foreigners, Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, said in an interview today that resolving the current crisis would require a package of measures from Parliament, rather than simply an amended asylum law.  She said it was a mistake to have placed such a concentration of foreigners in the midst of such a deprived and unhappy neighborhood in Rostock. **********The Social Democratic leader, Bjorn Engholm, said last weekend that at the coming party congress, he would urge support for a law to deny asylum to citizens of countries where there is no political persecution, and also to those who arrive without identity papers. Mr. Engholm also advocated adoption of a quota system to permit the immigration of limited numbers of economic refugees. **********Some leaders of Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democratic Union advocate going further. They want a law banning all immigration except in cases where individuals can prove they have been made examples by repressive governments. **********Nearly a year ago, neo-Nazis and their supporters launched a wave of violent attacks that drove asylum-seekers out of their apartments in the eastern town of Hoyeswerda. Any hopes that the Hoyeswerda incident might have been an aberration were erased by last week's disturbances in Rostock. In both places, thousands of citizens stood by, some of them applauding, as hundreds of racists threw firebombs and other objects at places where foreigners live. **********\"Hoyeswerda and Rostock are not the revolt of a new rightist youth movement,\" said Thomas Kruger, who is in charge of youth programs in Berlin.  \"They are cases of resistance by people who have become weak as a result of unification, and who are no longer willing to accept their weakness.\" **********\"The applause of Rostock people is no accident,\" he added. \"It is a reaction against the failure to set serious political priorities, and it should be taken very seriously.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/12/technology/bias-against-girls-is-found-rife-in-schools-with-lasting-damage.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1992-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1288, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bias Against Girls Is Found Rife In Schools, With Lasting Damage", "print_headline": "Bias Against Girls Is Found Rife In Schools, With Lasting Damage", "body_text": " **********School is still a place of unequal opportunity, where girls face discrimination from teachers, textbooks, tests and their male classmates, according to a report being released today that examined virtually all major studies on girls and education. **********Girls and boys start school roughly equal in skills and confidence, but girls trail by the end of high school, said the study, \"How Schools Shortchange Women: The A.A.U.W. Report,\" commissioned by the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation. **********\"This latest report presents the truth behind another myth -- that boys and girls receive equal education,\" said Alice McKee, president of the A.A.U.W. Educational Foundation, in the report's foreword. \"The wealth of statistical evidence must convince even the most skeptical that gender bias in our schools is shortchanging girls -- and compromising our country.\" The Specifics of Bias **********The A.A.U.W. foundation calls the report one of the most comprehensive of its kind ever undertaken. Researchers at the Wellesley College Center for Research on Women examined more than 1,000 publications about girls and education, including hundreds of research studies. From the material, most of it from the 1980's, the researchers drew a number of conclusions. ***********Teachers pay less attention to girls. ***********Girls still lag in mathematics and science scores, and even those who do well in those subjects tend not to choose math and science careers. ***********Reports of sexual harassment of girls by boys are increasing. ***********Some tests remain biased against girls, hurting their chances of scholarships and getting into college. ***********Textbooks still ignore or stereotype women, and girls learn almost nothing about many of their most pressing problems, like sexual abuse, discrimination and depression. **********The report does acknowledge that girls generally get better grades than boys, but it argues that, when all their experiences are examined, girls are still shortchanged. The United States Department of Education says that 61.6 percent of the girls who graduated from high school in 1989 were enrolled in college that fall, compared with 57.6 percent of the boys. **********\"This is truly a wake-up call to the nation's education and policy leaders, parents, administrators and guidance counselors that unless we pay attention to girls' needs today, we will find out 15 years from now that there is still a glass ceiling,\" said Anne Bryant, executive director of the association. The report addressed the experiences of girls in public schools from preschool through high school. **********The report makes 40 recommendations, including training teachers and changing teaching methods to meet girls' needs, encouraging girls in mathematics and science, toughening school policies against sexual harassment and placing girls' problems on the agenda of education reformers. **********While the individual research programs that the report synthesized have been published previously, together they paint a damning picture of girls' lives in school. The findings, many educators said, will surprise many teachers and administrators and could help them. **********\"I think this is dynamite stuff,\" said Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association, the country's largest teachers union. He said the research \"makes the point very clearly that there are many subtle and unknown things teachers do in the classroom\" that hurt girls. **********Both he and David Imig, executive director of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, said they planned to distribute the report to their members to help teachers learn how to treat girls more fairly. **********In one of the best-known studies cited in the report, Myra and David Sadker observed teachers over three years and found that most teachers called on boys more often than girls, offered boys more detailed and constructive criticism and allowed boys to shout out answers but reprimanded girls for doing so. **********Although there is very little research on the experience of black girls in school, one study did find that when black girls tried to approach teachers, teachers tended to rebuff them and paid more attention to white girls. Girls May Be Ignored **********These and other examples of bias have held girls back in math and science, the report argues. Two recent studies found that many science teachers, and some mathematics teachers, tended to ignore girls in favor of boys. **********Boys not only continue to score higher than girls on science standardized tests, but the gap may be widening, the report found. Moreover, even those girls who did well in science and mathematics tended not to pursue careers in those fields. Studies of girls who continued to study science after high school showed that encouragement of teachers was crucial in their decisions. **********Researchers cited in the report also found that girls had less confidence in their math abilities than boys did, and that as their confidence diminished, so did their performance. **********But the report also offered some good news: the gap between boys' and girls' mathematics scores is narrowing, according to a review of standardized test results. The report pointed to the success of special programs in math and science for girls in the summer or after school as one way to bolster girls' confidence and interest. Tests Still Fall Short **********Yet the report cautioned about over-relying on standardized test scores, which it found underestimated girls' performances, particularly in mathematics and science. The report found that girls' grades are far higher than their standardized test scores, and said that while many test developers have worked to eliminate obviously biased test questions, instances of bias remain. For that reason, the report said, tests should be given less weight in determining scholarships and college admissions. **********Teachers who want to help girls in the classroom can draw on a range of techniques that researchers have found effective. One such approach is \"cooperative learning,\" in which students study in groups rather than being pitted against one another. Because several studies show that girls often learn better in single-sex environments, the report also suggests creating all-girl work groups within mixed classrooms. Researchers also recommend that teachers eliminate sexist language, strive for a congenial classroom atmosphere and videotape themselves teaching to monitor their behavior toward girls. **********Girls in school are also enduring increasing sexual harassment from their male classmates, but many teachers tolerate such behavior, the report said. But these and other problems central to many young girls' lives -- like sexual abuse, sexism in society, sex education or depression -- are rarely discussed in the classroom, the report said. **********Some of these problems actually contribute to girls' dropping out of high school, the report said. Despite widespread perceptions, less than half of girls drop out because they are pregnant. Many are asked to take on too many family reponsibilities at home -- something that more active discussion of female roles and sexism might equip women to resist, the report suggests. Those teen-agers who are pregnant often find that schools discourage their return, or are not flexible enough to help them graduate. **********In a widely-discussed study issued last year, the A.A.U.W. reported that girls' self-esteem drops markedly, even faster than that of boys, as they approach adolescence. Although the writers of this report say no research has been done to document a cause-and-effect connection, they speculate that a sexist curriculum may be one reason. **********\"Students sit in classrooms that, day in, day out, deliver the message that women's lives count for less than men's,\" the report said. Only one of 10 books most commonly assigned in high school English classes was written by a woman, and while many textbooks have added more material on women, there is still too little, the report argues. **********Copies of the report are available through the A.A.U.W.

In 1959, Sir Run Run brought his growing fortune to Hong Kong, where he earned a reputation for careful, shrewd real estate investments. **********\"He is a very, very conservative investor,\" said Terry Fok, research director at Kim Eng Securities in Hong Kong, who tracks Sir Run Run's flagship company, Shaw Brothers. \"He's got vast personal wealth, but is unlikely to ever do anything dramatic with it.\" **********Shaw Brothers, now valued at about $255 million, includes movie studios, theaters and a 30 percent stake in Hong Kong's largest television station.

Such programs in Europe, where they are often compulsory, make millions of young people into sophisticated entry-level workers. And now youth apprenticeship in a voluntary form is becoming fashionable in the United States -- in theory, at least. **********Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, seeking the Democratic nomination for President, advocates youth apprenticeship. Various bills in Congress and in state legislatures push the concept. And the Labor Department, along with several private foundations, helps finance pilot projects. But after two years of efforts to start programs, the results are still meager: fewer than 1,000 apprentices nationwide, the Labor Department reports. **********\"It is undeniable that youth apprenticeship has caught people's imaginations, but it may just stay in that realm,\" said Richard Kazis, a director of Jobs for the Future, an organization financed by foundations and the Government that promotes apprenticeship programs and other work training. **********The foot-dragging seems embedded in national attitudes. Youth apprentices are supposed to be bright teen-agers, not dropouts or youngsters who are failing in school. But in a nation that puts so much value on a college education, able students do not rush to join a program that shunts them into special classes in such subjects as technical writing and computer programming -- first in high school and then usually at a junior college -- and rules out the standard bachelor's degree. **********\"We had one student recruited in Williamsport who summed it up best,\" said Jean Wolfe, director of the Pennsylvania Youth Apprenticeship program. \"He said: 'If I start at 16 and the program is four years, I'll be about 20 when I graduate. I suppose that is not too old if I really don't like what I am doing then.' \" **********Corporate America is equally wary. The youth apprentices must be given jobs two or three days a week as part of their training. To justify that outlay on a grand scale, tens of thousands of companies must be constantly upgrading their operations and drawing on a pool of skilled workers to man their ever more sophisticated machinery. That constant upgrading is not yet happening in the United States, said Stephen Hamilton, a Cornell University professor who oversees a youth apprenticeship program in the Binghamton, N.Y., area. He cited three reasons. **********The recession is one; companies find it hard to justify hiring youth apprentices when they are laying off skilled workers. More important, companies like Motorola, Xerox and I.B.M. that do spend heavily on worker training, traditionally invest their money in existing employees and not in a future work force of apprentices still in school. **********Finally, American companies generally try to compete in world markets by simplifying work and lowering labor costs. \"Youth apprenticeship runs up against this mindset of viewing labor as a cost to be minimized,\" Mr. Hamilton said. \"You have to view workers as an investment, and when you do, you try to get as much output from them as possible, and you train them accordingly.\" **********Youth apprenticeship is intended to be the first step in this investment process. Its goal is distinct from traditional apprenticeship programs, which are preparing 300,000 young people already out of high school to be licensed carpenters, electricians, bricklayers and the like. Youth apprenticeship, in contrast, is intended to steer high school juniors not likely to go to college into skilled jobs -- avoiding the risk that after high school they will drift and get no training at all. **********Whatever the merits, so far only hospitals chronically short of technicians, and manufacturers equally starved for highly skilled machinists and metal workers have responded to youth apprenticeship projects. **********Such worker shortages certainly persuaded the Textron Corporation's airplane engine plant in Williamsport, Pa., to hire 6 of the 12 high school juniors recruited into a youth apprenticeship program in that city last fall. **********\"We have skilled workers on layoff now, but if the economy goes back up to where it was in 1989, they'll all be called back, and we'll be forced to hire unqualified people and train them,\" said Paul Batkowski, Textron's manager of labor relations. \"That's wasteful.\" **********But employing the six teen-agers two days a week at $4.45 an hour is not without headaches. Once their training is over, the teen-agers are not obligated to take regular jobs at Textron, although Mr. Batkowski hopes they will, lured by the pay of $15 an hour, plus benefits. And while they are in training, there is always the risk that Textron will be accused of using minimum-wage apprentices to displace regular workers. **********\"In this country, there is no national tradition of youth apprenticeship,\" Mr. Hamilton said. \"There will have to be a huge selling job.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/17/business/company-news-741792.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-06-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 268, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS", "body_text": " **********ASEA A.B., Stockholm, a holding company, said its A.B.B.

Of this, over 4.5 million tons of corn and one million tons of other grain will be consumed in South Africa, according to Frans Loots, a spokesman for Agriculture Minister Kraai van Niekirk. Imports for Neighbors **********The other 4.5 million tons of corn are being shipped to Zimbabwe, Zambia and other countries facing dire food shortages. By one estimate, two million million tons of corn are being transported to Zimbabwe and at least 800,000 tons each to Malawi and Zambia. Corn meal forms the dietary staple throughout southern Africa. **********The logistics of food distribution were thrashed out at a conference in Pretoria on April 22 and attended by officials from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zamibia, Botswana and Malawi. **********The United States has pledged $382 million in food and cash assistance to the southern Africa region to combat the drought. The recipients have not included South Africa, which sold 100,000 tons of its grain to Zimbabwe and Zambia before realizing the extent of its own deficit. Because of the drought, South Africa's food imports are expected to rise by $1.3 billion. **********Agriculture Minister van Niekirk said it would cost South Africa $661 million just to import 4.6 million tons of corn, or 70 percent of its domestic requirement, up to next April. **********The relief effort has given South Africa the opportunity to display its regional indispensability at a time when it has won new acceptance in Africa because of the steps taken by President F. W. de Klerk to dismantle apartheid. **********About half of the grain imported into South Africa is being channeled through Durban, with the rest handled at other ports in Cape Town, East London and Port Elizabeth. Describing the logistics involved, Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha said moving one million tons of imported food would require 30 large ships, 750 freight trains or 33,000 truckloads. **********The magnitude of the supply effort raised fears of congestion on railways and roads unaccustomed to such a volume of traffic, but the initial delays were bureaucratic. South African trucks carrying the first grain into Zimbabwe were held up at the border while Zimbabwean customs officials imposed various taxes and road fees. No such problems have been reported for trains delivering most of the grain. **********At the same time, South Africa must cope with its own grain shortage. Its annual grain harvests averaged 7.5 million tons, of which up to two million tons were once exported.

The stumbling block was an increasingly familiar problem: the reluctance of many Americans to risk much money on the transition process. **********By the end of their three-day conference in Harriman, N.Y., the experts had agreed that a list of policy recommendations would not be enough; their final report, issued yesterday, also had to explain to Americans why their tax dollars should be invested in Russia and the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The payoff is to be rising American exports, more jobs and new corporate income from investments in Russia. **********Given the risks involved in investing in countries as chaotic as those emerging from the former Soviet Union, the conferees urged the Bush Administration to be a partner in the process. The Administration, they said, could help companies through the current risky phase by insuring their investments and allowing tax credits for some losses. **********The report, like the debate itself at a conference sponsored by Columbia University's American Assembly, suggested that without Government backing, American corporations would be unwilling to invest heavily in the Commonwealth nations.

Becker, director of international business development for the Cummins Engine Company, the Indiana maker of truck engines, which is trying to sell engines in Russia through a joint venture with Komaz, a Russian truck maker. \"We no longer have the people to send to Russia, and the technical resources that I rely on have been cut back.\" **********Bills now before Congress would lift current ceilings on Federal insurance for corporate investments in Commonwealth countries and would also expand Federal export credits.

Russians Skeptical **********Half-a-dozen Russians at the conference also expressed skepticism that the American public would be won over to generous Government financing. Nevertheless, some argued that a window of opportunity exists: Russia is forming commercial relationships with the West, and the United States should hurry to compete with Germany for the inside track. **********\"You in America should raise taxes to support your foreign involvements, but the economic hardship here has made tax increases politically unacceptable,\" said Andrei V. Kortunov, an official at the Institute of U.S.A and Canada in Moscow. \"Why is it unacceptable? Because your middle class has not for 20 years had a rise in living standards; their incomes have stagnated.\" **********Whatever the obstacles, Corporate America is increasingly calling for a Government-business partnership that would carry the Government far beyond the minimal financing envisioned in the bills before Congress or in President Bush's recent commitment to participate with other industrial nations in a $24 billion aid package to the commonwealth nations.

Neville Isdell, a Coca-Cola Company senior vice president, and Burt Polishook, a consultant who was the International Business Machines Corporation's senior executive in Moscow until December. **********\"I.B.M. has a subsidiary in Russia, but it does not yet manufacture there,\" Mr. Polishook said. \"Government investment guarantees help the manufacturing develop, not only for I.B.M. but for other companies.\" **********By comparison, the German Government insures foreign investments by German companies, using a Government guaranteed fund mostly financed through premiums paid by the companies. Cummins-Komaz Venture **********The Cummins-Komaz joint venture would sell imported Cummins truck engines to Russians for dollars, the sales pitch being that the engines are more fuel efficient and last longer. Given enough sales, the joint venture might eventually make the motors in Russia. But potential Russian customers lack dollars, and so far, Cummins has invested only $500,000 in the risky joint venture and shipped only 10 engines, Mr. Becker said. **********\"The best deal would be for the U.S. Government to pay in dollars for the engines,\" Mr. Becker said, suggesting a form of foreign aid widely used when the Marshall Plan was rebuilding Europe after World War II. **********Similarly, Coca-Cola suffers from Russia's hard-currency shortage. Coke sells the soft-drink concentrate to Russian bottlers for dollars, but with the hard-currency shortage Coke faces the prospect of exporting concentrate without immediate payment -- a risk that certainly postpones any Coke plans to invest in bottling in Russia, Mr. Isdell said. **********As one form of Government support, Mr. Isdell suggested tax credits to help a company absorb losses from a risky Russian investment. \"I don't actually believe in Government support,\" he said. \"But unless the Government can help during this difficult period, we can do only what we have to do to keep a presence. We can't make an investment in Russia.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/10/business/credit-markets-warner-lambert-offers-6.66-yield.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-09-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Warner-Lambert Offers 6.66% Yield", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Warner-Lambert Offers 6.66% Yield", "body_text": " **********Warner-Lambert offered $200 million of 10-year notes yesterday through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********The notes, due in 2002, were given a 6 5/8 percent coupon and priced at 99.75 to yield 6.66 percent, or about 35 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity. **********Noncallable before maturity, the notes are rated Aa-3 by Moody's and AA by Standard & Poor's."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/24/world/french-now-agree-they-lack-a-veto-over-farming-pact.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1992-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1012, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FRENCH NOW AGREE THEY LACK A VETO OVER FARMING PACT", "print_headline": "FRENCH NOW AGREE THEY LACK A VETO OVER FARMING PACT", "body_text": " **********France acknowledged today that it had no legal authority to veto a farm trade agreement between the European Community and the United States, but insisted it did have the right to block community acceptance of a broader global trade agreement. **********The fear of a French veto had hung over the farm agreement reached Friday after Agriculture Minister Jean-Pierre Soisson, and then Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy, called the compromise unacceptable. While neither official referred to a veto, the harsh remarks were interpreted by some trade officials and many journalists as a threat of such action. **********Mr. Beregovoy then said, in a television interview on Sunday, that \"as a very last resort\" France would examine its veto options. Veto Is Limited **********But today Government officials detailed the technicalities of the approval process, acknowledging that Paris could veto only a formal legal instrument presented by the community's executive commission -- and that this was not the case with the farm compromise reached with Washington. **********Rather, France, like all other members of the European Community, would have the authority to block the community's acceptance of the broad trade accord that 108 countries have been trying to negotiate since 1986. **********But political and trade experts here do not believe France would dare stand alone against so many nations, rejecting an accord that is expected to stimulate world trade and economic growth, and along the way helping nonfarming sectors of the French economy. Indeed, the European Community is unlikely to agree to any final pact without France's assurance that it will go along. **********France's bitter opposition to the farm compromise is based on its belief that its farmers are being asked to make sacrifices beyond those the community agreed to in May, when it overhauled its common agricultural policy. Any agreement with the United States, it insists, must be compatible with this reform. **********The community's 17-member executive commission is to meet Wednesday in Brussels to study the agreement, but most experts believe it will reject the French argument by concluding that the deal conforms with last spring's reform of the common agricultural policy. This ruling would in turn permit resumption of the broader talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. **********Until today, the public impression formed by news coverage of the last few days was that France had a veto option in the Council of Ministers, the community's most powerful institution, which comprises the foreign ministers of the 12 member states. **********Each nation has the right to veto on the ground of vital national interest a formal proposal from the European Commission. While it has rarely been exercised, this right of veto became the subject of much discussion among Government officials after the compromise was reached on Friday.  Weekend of Study **********But after a weekend of closer study of the somewhat arcane details of the trade compromise and the community's procedures of governance, government officials in France and other community states agreed today that the veto could not be used against the disputed farm trade agreement, because the deal would not be presented to the Council of Ministers as a formal proposal. **********In their comments today, French officials stressed their commitment to the broad agreement being negotiated under the GATT auspices. French officials have noted that agriculture is only one part of a future pact that would also liberalize trade in services, telecommunications and textiles and establish new rules governing intellectual property. **********After being held up for months by the disagreement over farm subsidies, the GATT talks are officially scheduled to resume on Thursday in Geneva, although informal meetings of trade officials began there today. Negotiators and officials in many Western capitals are optimistic that an agreement might be reached before the end of the year. **********In Washington, a senior American official said it was conceivable that the basic text of a world trade agreement could be reached by the end of December. But he cautioned that detailed timetables would still have to be worked out next year for each country's tariff reductions for thousands of different products. **********But whatever its willingness to work toward a broad trade settlement, France still has the problem of finding a face-saving device that will enable it to accept a GATT accord without further enraging its one million farmers -- all in the run-up to parliamentary elections in March. **********Looking for a strong political mandate for further negotiations at the European Community, the Socialist Government of President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Beregovoy hopes to win endorsement of this position when the National Assembly debates the farm trade agreement on Wednesday. **********With no apparent interest in threatening the GATT talks, Prime Minister Beregovoy has appealed for the \"solidarity\" and \"understanding\" of other community countries, asking them to acknowledge France's \"particular situation\" as Europe's largest food producer and exporter. **********This \"particular situation\" will be all too apparent on Wednesday, when tens of thousands of angry farmers converge on Paris to coincide with the National Assembly debate on the farm trade agreement. Already they have organized anti-American protests outside McDonald's restaurants and a Coca-Cola bottling plant. Could Gain Advantages **********French Government officials said that in order to be able to appease the country's farmers and present the farm trade pact as compatible with the community's common agricultural policy France might have to extract new -- still undefined -- farming concessions from its partners. **********On the other hand, France has until now focused its attention overwhelmingly on the agricultural dispute. The Government should soon be able to point out the advantages that a possible GATT accord will bring to the French economy as a whole. Already, in fact, some officials have reminded the farmers that many French businessmen support an early GATT agreement. **********France is the world's second-largest exporter of services, after the United States, and stands to benefit from a pact that would extend free-trade rules to services for the first time."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/26/business/to-russia-with-fords.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "To Russia With Fords", "print_headline": "To Russia With Fords", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company has opened its first full-service dealership in Russia, the company said today.

The countries then used those bonds to guarantee some of their debt. Model for Argentine Agreement **********Analysts had assumed that those restructurings would serve as a model for the Argentine agreement, but over the last few weeks speculation has risen that Treasury would ask Argentina to purchase zero-coupon securities in the open market. **********The Treasury's announcement did little to end the speculation. **********It said that while Argentina had approached the Treasury regarding a direct issue of 30-year zeroes, and that while the Treasury was prepared \"in principle\" to sell non-marketable securities directly to Argentina, at the same time Treasury is \"encouraging\" the Argentine Government to purchase the securities in the open market. The Treasury concluded that any direct issuance of zero-coupon bonds to Argentina would not take place before the fourth quarter. **********\"The Treasury seems to be sending conflicting signals,\" said Louis v.B. Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm. \"Instead of reducing uncertainty, they are keeping uncertainty alive.\" **********Analysts estimate that Argentina will probably need to buy as much as $20 billion worth of zero-coupon bonds. Purchases of that magnitude would significantly reduce the amount of outstanding bonds and put downward pressure on long-term interest rates. **********Mr. Crandall and other analysts, however, said the debt-management strategy that Treasury chose to employ at next week's refunding appeared to make it difficult, if not impossible, for Argentina to purchase substantial quantities of 30-year zero-coupon bonds in the open market. The 30-year zeros are created when purchasers of the 30-year Treasuries strip them of their coupons for resale. The zero-coupon bonds are sold at deep discount and are then redeemed at face value at maturity. **********In its announcement, the Treasury said it once again intended to expand the supply of the outstanding 8 percent bonds maturing in 2021 by issuing $10 billion more of those securities. It is the first time since 1983 that Treasury has chosen to \"reopen\" an existing bond issue for a second time. An issue is often reopened when market interest rates are at levels that closely approximate the rate at which the outstanding bellwether security was previously sold. **********In addition, the Treasury will sell $15 billion worth of new three-year notes and $11 billion of new 10-year securities. **********\"Reopening this bond makes it more difficult for Argentina because they are going to need securities that mature in 2022,\" Mr. Crandall said. \"In practical terms, that means the only bonds they could buy are the ones that will be sold at the next refunding auctions in August.\" **********Aside from puzzling over Argentina, dealers said that worries about a report expected today on initial unemployment claims prompted some traders to sell securities.

This was denied by the Paris representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Palestinian umbrella group of which Dr. Habash's Popular Front remains a member. **********Although the Israeli charge d'affaires in Paris, Yitzhak Eldan, expressed dismay on Saturday that \"a terrorist as notorious as Mr. Habash\" had been allowed to leave France without facing trial, the Israeli Cabinet signaled today that it would not further criticize France. **********\"The fact that he had to run from his sickbed while he still had life in him proved the French people rejected him and expelled him,\" said the Minister of Religious Affairs, Avner Shaki, after the weekly Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem. \"We have no interest in personal vengeance against him.\" **********In France, though, opposition politicians argued that the incident exposed both disarray in foreign policy and the Government's inability to control the bureaucracy. **********French newspapers savaged the Government for allowing Dr. Habash into the country, with the conservative daily Le Figaro saying that \"the leaders cannot escape this alternative -- either they did not know and abdicated their responsibility or they knew and are lying.\" **********Both President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edith Cresson have said they were not consulted before Interior and Foreign Ministry officials authorized Dr. Habash's entry on humanitarian grounds. Government officials said both were furious when they were informed. **********Political experts said that while Dr.  Habash's trip might have brought protests under any circumstances, it had become a major political crisis because of the current weakness of the Socialist Government. **********In recent months, the popularity ratings of Mr. Mitterrand and Mrs. Cresson have fallen to an all-time low, and within the governing party pressure is increasing on Mr. Mitterrand to replace her.

The report said that exports in the fourth quarter rose by $17 billion, a downward revision from the $19.9 billion reported last month. **********Over the last year, exports have been one of the few bright spots in the nation's economy. \"In the fourth quarter, export growth successfully bridged over the renewed weakness in domestic activity,\" said Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of Manufacturers. **********According to the report, exports rose 13.1 percent in the fourth quarter, while imports rose 2.5 percent. Purchases of durable goods fell 6 percent, while purchasess of nondurable goods fell 3.2 percent. Purchases of services rose 2.9 percent. Loan Delinquencies Down **********In another report today, the American Bankers Association said the delinquency rate for consumer installment loans had edge downward in the fourth quarter, the first such decline in almost two years. The banking association reported that the percentage of consumer loans delinquent more than 30 days fell to 2.58 percent from 2.74 percent in the third quarter. **********\"The good news is that the recovery is trying to get off the ground,\" said John M. Albertine, who runs a Washington-based economics forecasting firm. \"The bad news is that in the near term, it is unlikely to get as high or go as fast as previous postwar recoveries.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/24/business/the-media-business-advertising-can-levi-strauss-extend-its-success-with-dockers.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 686, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Can Levi Strauss Extend Its Success With Dockers?", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Can Levi Strauss Extend Its Success With Dockers?", "body_text": " **********FOR a marketer, changing a successful long-running advertising campaign is always a difficult decision. But Levi Strauss & Company and its agency, Foote, Cone & Belding in San Francisco, felt the time had come. **********Beginning March 3, they will make the first significant changes in their campaign for Dockers apparel since that best-selling line startled consumers in 1987 with unusual television commercials starring casually dressed men engrossed in casually hip conversations. **********\"To keep the Dockers message fresh, we had to adopt a different position,\" Bob Siegel, president of the men's wear division at Levi Strauss, said in a telephone interview from San Francisco. **********\"You can't say the same thing forever,\" he added, \"and we can't afford for people not to pay attention.\" **********As for the timing, said Mike Koelker, executive vice president and corporate director of creative development at Foote, Cone, \"it finally got to the point where if we did another year of this, I don't think anybody would notice.\" **********\"It scares the hell out of you to change an enormously successful campaign,\" he added, particularly one that has grown familiar enough to be featured on an episode of the NBC sitcom \"Seinfeld\" and to have inspired a parody spot by a rival clothier, Bugle Boy. **********\"What if the next one doesn't work as well?\" he asked. **********To prevent that, new television spots, as well as the first Dockers print advertisements, have been carefully conceived to appeal to the men who are already avid buyers of Dockers slacks, shirts, shorts and other items. They are expected to buy $1.5 billion worth in stores this year; total retail sales of Dockers last year, including the newer women's and children's products, exceeded $1.8 billion, out of Levi Strauss's total sales of $4.9 billion. **********\"Our purpose is to let the consumer who buys Dockers know he has an opportunity to expand his purchases,\" Mr. Siegel said. To accomplish that, he added, the new ads communicate a message \"that Dockers come in many different flavors.\" **********For instance, in one spot, as men silently walk along a city street and sail in a boat, an announcer wryly drawls, \"From mocha to khaki, beige to desert sand, tan is a color with a thousand faces, a color that always seems to say, 'Hey, pal, how 'bout me?' \" Each spot ends with the multihued theme \"Nobody does tan like Dockers,\" \"Nobody does blue like Dockers,\" and so on. **********The announcer supplanting the \"guys talking to guys,\" as Mr. Koelker called the most familiar aspect of the campaign, is the most obvious alteration. Also different is how the men look; instead of an everyday-guy image, they seem more like models, better built, better dressed and better coiffed. That is intended to build a perception of Dockers as dressier and more fashionable, Mr. Siegel said. **********Dockers advertising had undergone some previous modifications. The initial spots were notorious for their shaky shots of male posteriors and crotches. Those gave way to fluid full-body shots. And \"Dockers World\" -- a term used by Steve Goldstein, the director of consumer marketing for the Levi Strauss men's wear division, to describe \"the mythical place where our Dockers consumer feels comfortable\" -- evolved from a competitive, aloof place into friendlier, less judgmental territory. **********The new spots will run on cable networks, including CNN and ESPN, as well as on broadcast-network coverage of sports like basketball, football and baseball. The print ads, styled after the spots, will run in magazines like Esquire, Forbes, GQ, Newsweek and Time. **********Ad spending will rise 20 percent from last year, Mr. Siegel said, though he declined to give figures. Estimates of Levi Strauss's annual ad budget for Dockers run from $20 million to $25 million. **********And was it, indeed, time for a change, Mr. Siegel was asked. **********\"There's not a lot of research to make those decisions,\" he replied. \"That's a judgment call you have to make.

And new applications are springing up in other sectors: for instance, service robots that can tirelessly perform tasks like polishing supermarket floors or delivering patients' meals in hospitals. **********Long gone, though, are the fevered visions of the early 1980's, when it was thought that the robotics business would remain a hotbed of innovation and quickly pass $10 billion in sales. Advancing With Baby Steps **********Rather than take great technological leaps, robots have moved forward in measured steps. And worldwide sales last year were a modest $2 billion to $6 billion, depending on how robots are defined and whether the figures include attachments like vision systems. **********Dr. Asimov's fiction, from novels like \"I, Robot\" in 1950, to more recent work like the 1983 book \"The Robots of Dawn,\" vested researchers and entrepreneurs with a burning hope: that it was simply a matter of time before scientists successfully married computer brains to powerful, mobile machinery that would do mankind's bidding. **********Unfortunately, as robots began pouring into the marketplace in the early 1980's, many proved unreliable. Others worked but failed to pay off because they did not smoothly fit in with employees or other equipment. **********Moreover, many users discovered that to take full advantage of the robots they had to redesign both their products and the ways they made them. In some cases, as I.B.M. found at its showcase printer plant in Charlotte, N.C., changes carried out to accommodate the automatons made it possible for employees to perform the jobs faster than the robots. **********But today, the lessons of the 80's, plus improved robotic controls, better sensors and vastly superior machine-vision systems are allowing robots to be used successfully for tasks too mundane, tedious or dangerous for people to perform. **********Robots have also proved indispensable, for example, in nuclear power plants. \"We use them in remote inspection, tank cleaning, looking inside pipes and retrieval of loose parts,\" said Harry Roman, robotics and artificial intelligence manager for the Public Service Electric and Gas Company of New Jersey. \"Our next target is repairs.\" **********Mr. Roman said that by spending $1.6 million on robots at its Salem and Hope Creek nuclear plants, the utility will save $5.3 million in improved efficiency, reduced disposal of radioactive waste and human health benefits. **********And yet robotics has been slower to gain a foothold in other markets long viewed as natural targets, like security-guard operations, fast-food restaurants and other service fields. Typically, because they must interact with humans and handle surprises, such service robots require more subtle capabilities than industrial robots. **********It is one thing to spot-weld a fender, quite another to hold the mayo and lay on extra pickles. Prototype fast-food robotic workers proved poorly adapted to sudden surges in orders at meal times, and restaurant owners found some customers preferred human help, however harried. **********\"Too many people have started with junky hardware and too little money,\" said Joseph Engleberger, chief executive of the Transitions Research Corporation, a start-up company in Danbury, Conn., that focuses on service-sector robots. Bringing Food for Patients **********Transitions Research's Helpmate robot, now in use at Danbury Hospital, can carry patients' food trays from the third-floor dietary department to the 12th-floor nursing unit -- traversing several corridors and operating an elevator without human intervention -- and speak to the receiving nurse or attendant: \"Please unload compartment one. Press the green button.\" **********Dr. Asimov visited Transitions Research's plant in 1989, and according to Mr. Engleberger he was pleased with the company's vision of servants for the aged and infirm. **********Mr. Engleberger's first robotics company, Unimation Inc., is generally credited as the pioneer in industrial robotics in the late 1950's. He sold it a decade ago to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which later became one of several multinationals to give up on the business. Others that washed their hands of robot making included I.B.M. and Bendix. **********The leaders that survived the shakeout in industrial robotics include the GMFanuc Robotics Corporation -- a joint venture of General Motors and Fanuc of Japan -- and ABB Robotics Inc., a unit of the Swedish-Swiss conglomerate Asea Brown Boveri. But a financial bloodbath in the industrial sector, which peaked in 1985 and 1986 as auto companies slashed capital spending, has made it harder for the service-sector robotics companies to attract venture capital, Mr. Engleberger said. **********Even more than in the industrial sector, designers of service-sector robots have been dependent on the rapidly falling price of computer power to push their projects toward commercial acceptance. And despite falling prices, the mobile cleaning robot developed by Transitions Research, for example, still costs about $30,000 by the time it is fully assembled at the Kent Company, an Elkhart, Ind., subsidiary of Sweden's Electrolux A.B. **********Helpmate, the Transitions Research robot that delivers meals to nursing stations and carries records and supplies where needed in hospitals, costs $60,000. Mr. Engleberger has rented them for $5 an hour, however, to hospitals willing to enter long-term contracts. Four Helpmates are currently being used in the field, at Danbury Hospital and elsewhere. **********Computing power is needed to process data from the variety of sensors such robots use to navigate, including ultrasound, radio signals and vision systems. Service robots also seem to have an insatiable need for sophisticated programming to help them deal with the unexpected obstacles they encounter outside the laboratory. The Helpmate began life with 100 rules of behavior built in, and now has 1,200. **********Raj Reddy, director of the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute in Pittsburgh, says such devices will probably need to know and juggle 50,000 rules to be really useful. He says a research goal for the next decade should be to develop robots that can look around and write their own rules from what they see. A Potential Hip Surgeon **********The service sector also lags far behind the industrial sector in separating what tasks robots may be capable of doing from what jobs they will be indispensable in performing. Integrated Surgical Systems Inc. of Sacramento, Calif., is currently seeking clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to begin human clinical trials using a robot to remove hip bones for replacement by titanium implants. **********The robot, which is programmed with the dimensions and exact location intended for the implant, carries out the surgery under the watchful eye of a doctor who can stop the process from a nearby computer monitor. The robot is capable of making cuts so precise that the gaps between the replacement and the remaining bone are 50 microns, about half the width of a human hair and one-twentieth the smallest average gap in surgery performed by humans, according to Dr. Howard Paul, Integrated Surgical's chief executive. **********\"It still has to be proven that the closer fit is an advantage for the patient,\" conceded Dr. Paul, who has used the equipment to perform robotic surgery on dogs. **********Dr. Paul is working with Sankyo Seiki, a Japanese robotics company, after being turned away by the few remaining American manufacturers. Sankyo Seiki and other Japanese companies, including Fanuc, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Yasakawa Electric, emerged as the world leaders in high-volume robotics production in the 1980's, in large part because Japanese auto makers, consumer-electronics companies and other manufacturers were enthusiastic users of the new technology. **********Japan still accounts for about two-thirds of annual robotics sales, according to most industry estimates. Japanese demand is fueled by labor shortages and a track record of successful automation. But the United States continues to be the focus for development of the most sophisticated robotic systems, like those equipped with cameras or other devices to help them see. **********\"The U.S. is way ahead in machine-vision applications,\" said Brian Carlisle, chief executive of Adept Technology Inc. and current president of the Robotic Industries Association, a trade group. **********Robotics makers are also trying to broaden the appeal of their products by making them easier to operate. Simulation systems allow suppliers and users to see on computer screens exactly what robots will have to do to be effective before they are built and installed. **********\"Today's robot controls more things around it,\" said Gary Rutledge, general manager of product development and operations at GMFanuc, which is based in Auburn Hills, Mich. **********The electronic control system for GMFanuc's newest robots, for example, can operate automated tables that shift the position of parts the robot is working on or make it easier to have robots work together. Such advances may lack the drama of Dr. Asimov's visions, but small steps seem to be the only way to get there from here."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/27/business/tips-on-bcci-flowed-freely-for-years.html": {"writer_name": "Dean Baquet", "pub_date": "1992-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1221, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tips on B.C.C.I.

Last year, the Justice Department set up a group to investigate B.C.C.I. But the committee's study shows that between 1979 and 1991 more than 700 tips came in to law enforcement agencies across the country, leads that combined to portray the bank as a center for worldwide corruption. **********Dean St. Dennis, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, which oversees the F.B.I. and the Drug Enforcement Agency, said the department had not yet seen the analysis, but he raised a question about the quality of the material that might have been passed along. \"It must be stressed,\" he said, \"that successful criminal prosecutions are not fashioned by rumor and innuendo.\" **********Claire Buchan, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, which oversees the Customs Service and the I.R.S., said the agency would have no comment because the agency had not see the report. **********The Congressional analysis was based on a review of all mentions of B.C.C.I. in American law-enforcement files. The files, which were provided to the subcommittee by the agencies, do not make indicate whether the tips were reliable, or whether they might have been followed up and discarded. **********Even now, it is unclear whether the leads are currently being investigated. **********Nonetheless, the subcommittee's report is the most detailed public accounting yet of what Federal criminal investigators had heard about B.C.C.I. before its activities made headlines, when regulators around the world last year accused if of the biggest financial fraud in history. **********Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, chairman of the subcommittee, said in an interview that the analysis made clear that \"at the very least, there was nobody putting together all of the pieces.\" He added, \"You could make a credible case that this was lack of coordination, or you could make a credible case that somebody told them not to do anything about B.C.C.I.\" **********Late last week, Mr. Schumer called on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to use its security clearance and its role in supervising American intelligence agencies to do the same kind of records sweep for those agencies. **********The key intelligence agencies in the United States are the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency. **********Mr. Schumer said Congress should determine how much the C.I.A. knew about the bank's corruption, and whether the intelligence agency, which has admitted banking at B.C.C.I., did anything to impede a criminal investigation. He said the House intelligence committee had the authority to determine whether any material withheld by the F.B.I. and other law-enforcement agencies \"relates to activities of U.S. intelligence agencies.\" **********The C.I.A. has acknowledged that it banked at B.C.C.I., but for legitimate purposes, though it has consistently declined to provide details. The agency has also admitted that as early as 1986 it had strong evidence of the bank's involvement in terrorism and money-laundering, and passed some of this to law enforcement agencies. **********B.C.C.I. had other extensive intelligence connections. One of its leading shareholders, Sheik Kamal Adham, is the former chief of Saudi Arabia's intelligence agency. Another, Sheik Abdul Raouf Khalil, is believed to serve currently as a link between American and Saudi intelligence agents. **********Michael Sheehy, chief counsel for the House intelligence committee, said the committee was considering Mr. Schumer's request. **********In many instances only vague details were provided by law enforcement agencies to the subcommittee, with some lines whited out to conceal sources. Some of the tips themselves seem vague. But others seem far more substantive; much detail is provided, and it is clear that the leads came from well-placed witnesses. Terrorist Money Mentioned **********In one case, for instance, the House subcommittee on crime quotes a B.C.C.I. employee by name, Aziz Rehman of the Miami office, as having told an Internal Revenue Service agent that that the bank \"was involved in financing or in moving funds to terrorist organizations in the Mideast.\" **********The report said that in 1986 the agent considered Mr. Rehman reliable, and requested permission to investigate further. But he was turned down because of lack of manpower. **********Some leads, if true, are particularly tantalizing. For example, the report says the F.B.I. in Houston had leads in May 1990 that an important stockholder and principal in B.C.C.I. was trying to use connections in the United States to help resolve legal problems. The same people involved in this effort -- their names are whited out -- were also trying to put together $10 million in financing for an unspecified project, the Houston F.B.I. learned. **********In April 1990, one month before the tip came in, Monzer Hourani, a Houston business associate of Senator Orrin G. Hatch, wrote a letter to B.C.C.I. requesting $10 million in financing. Mr. Hatch has acknowledged that he tried to help Mr. Hourani get a loan. Earlier in 1990, the Senator made a speech on the Senate floor praising B.C.C.I. for resolving money-laundering charges brought by the Government. But there is no indication who provided the tip.  A Loan for Iranian Arms **********The report provides one new detail of B.C.C.I.'s role in the Iran-Contra affair. It shows that some of the money that financed arms shipments to Iran came through a $10 million loan from B.C.C.I. to the Saudi businessman and arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi. The loan has yet to be repaid, the report said. The source of the money that financed the shipment is one of the mysteries of the affair. **********Oddly, the tip about B.C.C.I. spending $5 billion in Pakistan came into the Newark office of the Drug Enforcement Administration in January 1986. No more detail is provided. **********The leads about the bank's involvement in arms shipments came in a variety of ways from criminal cases and informants. Their reliability is not clear. **********In at least once case, the House subcommittee on crime indicates that a lack of initiative seems to have prevented the Government from investigating B.C.C.I. An I.R.S. money-laundering investigation in Oklahoma led investigators to a big international heroin smuggling operation that used the bank's New York and Hong Kong branches to hide money from narcotics trafficking. The Oklahoma agents seized more than $20 million of heroin, and charged several men with heroin trafficking. But, the committee said, the officials made no effort to investigate B.C.C.I."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/19/business/the-executive-life-central-city-colo-charming-his-way-to-a-second-gold-rush.html": {"writer_name": "Mary Billard", "pub_date": "1992-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 942, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Executive Life CENTRAL CITY, Colo.; Charming His Way To a Second Gold Rush", "print_headline": "The Executive Life CENTRAL CITY, Colo.; Charming His Way To a Second Gold Rush", "body_text": " **********Less than an hour's drive from the big city of Denver, this picturesque Victorian hamlet is so folksy that the nearest coffee shop -- a good 10 miles down the interstate -- keeps the mugs of its regulars conveniently hanging on one wall.

Mr. Hemmeter attended the University of Colorado for a year and fondly remembers performing in Central City's Mine Shaft bar in his salad days as part of a singing group. Until a few years ago, he had a house on Aspen Mountain -- with its own elevator in a cliff. (He sold it in the late 80's for a reported $17 million to Ted Field, movie producer and heir of Marshall Field department store, who now has it on the market for $25 million.) **********In Hawaii, Mr. Hemmeter had been Mr. Glitz. But he sold his Hawaiian hotel properties for a handsome profit in the late 80's -- pocketing $188 million here, $320 million there. He had been splitting his time between his Bel Air mansion and his Hawaiian retreat at Diamond Head (onetime asking price: $60 million). But his interest in Hawaii faded in early 1991, after losing a bid to develop a major portion of Honolulu's waterfront. **********Meanwhile, voters in Colorado had approved limited gambling in Central City and two other towns. Seeing gambling as the one growth area in the hotel business, Los Angeles-based Hemmeter Partners soon bought a 10,000-square-foot parking lot in Central City for an unheard of $5 million and leased property from the gas station in neighboring Black Hawk. The plan was to build two $12 million casino-and-restaurant complexes. **********Mr. Hemmeter arrived here last January selling his project and his personality. Known for his common, folksy touch, he is universally called Chris, even by his construction crews. \"Chris? Great family. Good people,\" said Jerry Brown, one of the gas station owners. \"It sounds real syrupy, but we're just real comfortable with him and the deal. Real comfortable.\" **********The area needed Mr. Hemmeter as much as he needed them. Bruce Schmaltz, the former unpaid mayor of Central City, said the once grand town was \"falling down around our ears.\" A change in gold mining economics around World War I had turned Central City from \"the richest square mile on earth\" in 1859 into a virtual ghost town, according to Dick Allen, City Councilman and owner of the Lost Gold Mine. **********Gambling was seen as the salvation -- a way to preserve the town's Victorian heritage, while modernizing its antique water system and roads. The $1,000 licensing fees the city is collecting per gambling device or table annually is expected to push its budget from $230,000 in 1991 to $2.5 million this year, with an $800,000 surplus. Suffice it to say, the new water system has been built. And several 19th-century buildings like the Teller House hotel and the Toll Gate Saloon have been restored by private interests. **********Mr. Schmaltz has stepped down as mayor to run businesses. His holdings? \"A gift-and-rock shop, a T-shirt shop and the Dostal  [ Alley ]  Saloon & Gambling Emporium,\" laughs Mr. Schmaltz. \"We are comfortable, very comfortable.\" **********After months of meetings with the historic commission, Chris Hemmeter seems to have romanced the town. While one-fourth the size of the Westin's reflecting pool, his 30,000-square-foot casino here, for which ground-breaking began last week, will be four times larger than the biggest casino approved to date. \"He came in with a 35-foot building,\" Mr. Granruth said. \"We are very pleased.\" **********The casinos, which are to open by June 1, will be named the Bullwhackers after the pioneers who drove across the Great Plains. \"Bullwhackers. Bullwhackers,\" repeats Mr. Hemmetter, relishing the sound. He certainly seems to have the Western thing down."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/14/world/teheran-journal-helping-women-raise-sights-in-islamic-society.html": {"writer_name": "Katayon Ghazi", "pub_date": "1992-03-14", "snippet": "The phones in the office of Shahla Habibi, special consultant to President Hashemi Rafsanjani on women, ring almost continuously, provoking excited laughter among the staff members.\n\nEven Fatima Hashemi, the President's daughter, is on hand to tak...", "word_count": 981, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Teheran Journal;\nHelping Women Raise Sights in Islamic Society", "print_headline": "Teheran Journal;\nHelping Women Raise Sights in Islamic Society", "body_text": " **********The phones in the office of Shahla Habibi, special consultant to President Hashemi Rafsanjani on women, ring almost continuously, provoking excited laughter among the staff members. **********Even Fatima Hashemi, the President's daughter, is on hand to take calls. Women come to them with difficulties in finding employment, collecting pensions, college loans, even for marital advice. **********Two months in office as the highest-ranking female official in this fiercely patriarchal society, Miss Habibi, who is 32 years old, has already caused a storm by urging senior Iranian leaders to put aside \"narrow-mindedness\" and appoint women to high office. **********A biologist by education, she holds the support of her boss, Mr. Rafsanjani, a vocal advocate of emancipation and greater participation of women in sports, the arts and politics.Mid-Level Response Is Slow **********But the response in the middle echelons of the Islamic Government has been slow and studied. **********\"Iranian officials must show some moral courage,\" Miss Habibi said in a recent interview, \"by allowing women to excel in their fields. Because of the oppression, because proper education and professional opportunities were never provided, women are far behind men in many areas.\" **********Endowed with exuberant energy, Miss Habibi has worked as a coordinator of volunteer women behind a war front with Iraq, and later as an inspector at a Teheran teachers' college overseeing \"the proper balance\" of Islamic and educational teaching. These experiences seem to have prepared her well for a process that many describe as a long-overdue \"demolition\" of traditional perceptions about women. **********She says the biggest task is to persuade Iranian women that \"all doors can open to those who have training, potential and the necessary values.\" 14 Women Are Prominent **********Fourteen women hold prominent political positions in Iran, 10 of whom belong to a council on women's affairs and are related to prominent politicians. **********But one result of the boast about the possibilities has been a growing debate on what can be done for the potential labor force of 12 million women. Here, Miss Habibi is confronted with a flood of criticism from the same people she is trying to help. **********Mina Moalem, an official at one of the ministries who has served as director of one of its departments, said: \"In reality women run into all kinds of sexual discrimination in managerial positions. We are systematically at war with male colleagues who insinuate promiscuity if they sense that women are dedicated and ambitious.\" **********Miss Habibi said she believes that this kind of war is inevitable but added: \"This is the age of dialogue, not confrontation. Each of us needs to ask our superiors and colleagues how far they've gone to meet the Islamic ideal of social justice.\"More Seeking Work **********Increasing numbers of women are seeking work, mainly out of economic necessity. Men and women earn equal pay and benefits, in accordance with Islamic law, while women's financial and professional independence is guaranteed by the Constitution. **********They are further encouraged by the religious authorities to sign prenuptial agreements, which can legally insure them half their husband's earnings after a divorce. **********Legal experts, however, argue that an overhaul of the existing legal system, which keeps women in a subordinate position, must be the primary task for politicians. **********\"Many career options are still closed to women,\" said a legal expert who asked not to be identified. \"In 1974 urban unemployment among women was 12 percent; today it stands at 60 percent. Thousands were forced to leave industries because after the revolution, the state decided to segregate many factories in favor of men. Our society needs to understand that women can and must work.\" **********Yet the fundamental change that many Iranian women seek in addition to financial security is to be treated equally before the law, especially in cases of divorce and adoption. **********\"It is nearly impossible for women to file for divorce in this country,\" the legal expert added. \"Only if her husband is proven insane or has been missing for four years will the courts approve the woman's request. In the case of divorce or the husband's death, only he or his family can legally claim the children. Mothers never qualify as capable guardians.\" **********The head of the Supreme Court, Ayatollah Ali Moghtadai, announced last month that women were not given the right to divorce because they were prone to \"emotional and irrational decision-making.\" **********Shahla Sherkat, editor of Women magazine, said: \"We have many religious authorities whose views on women are more open and more positive. A great deal of work remains to be done in revising religious interpretations within the framework of Islamic laws.\" **********Recent religious decrees concerning women have included legitimizing abortions to control the high birth rate, and raising the minimum age for marriage from 9 to 13 years, according to legal experts.Exhibit of Miniskirts **********At a recent exhibition on the character and place of women in society, organized by Miss Habibi, the biggest attraction was the Western-style clothing from the time of the Shah. High-school girls in long black veils stared in shock at the strapless evening dresses and miniskirts. **********\"Two very different worlds meeting in one place,\" said one of the girls' chaperones. **********Those two worlds met again this week, when a woman visitor dressed in a long coat and scarf pointedly told Miss Habibi: \"I do not accept the Islamic dress. I also don't believe in many of the methods of the Islamic system. But I want to work for the country. What can you do for me?\" **********Miss Habibi said \"people with an open mind\" should not think of Islam as an imposition or a compulsion. **********Later, as Miss Habibi excused herself to perform her afternoon prayer, the visitor excused herself to light a cigarette."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/09/business/media-business-television-broadcasters-take-bite-cable-ratings.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Carter", "pub_date": "1992-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1369, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television; Broadcasters Take a Bite Out of Cable in the Ratings", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television; Broadcasters Take a Bite Out of Cable in the Ratings", "body_text": " **********For the first time since the cable industry began its rapid growth more than a decade ago, the broadcast networks have been able to regain a piece of the audience they lost. **********While it is too soon to declare that broadcasting has finally bottomed out, many network executives are hopeful that the latest ratings are a sign that the networks may not irresistibly lose viewers year after year to cable channels. **********The networks had considerable help in luring viewers back in February. CBS posted a big victory in the ratings because of the surprising popularity of its Winter Olympics coverage. The five-year-old Fox Broadcasting Company posted its best monthly ratings ever. And cable suffered in the year-to-year comparison because of the absence of its most exciting programming yet: a war. The Real Difference **********But even without the Persian Gulf war and Olympics factors, the turnaround was noticeable. Cable industry figures themselves show that cable audiences would have been off by about 6 percent, compared with a decline of 15 percent with the war and Olympics figures included. **********Never before has cable lost audience on a year-to-year basis in the 11 years that the A. C. Nielsen Company has been regularly measuring the cable industry along with the broadcast networks. **********Several network executives pointed to this development as an overt signal of a change in direction for their business; namely, upward instead of downward. **********\"Three years ago, the consistent growth of cable would have offset even the Olympics,\" said David F. Poltrack, the senior vice president of research for CBS. \"But now, cable isn't growing automatically anymore. So it becomes more a question of programming against programming. Whoever has the most exciting programming gains the viewers.\" **********Bob Sieber, vice president of research for Turner Broadcasting System Inc., said the networks were grossly overstating the ratings results from February. \"Last month, because of the Olympics and the fact that CNN wasn't covering the war, is a bit of an unusual situation,\" he said. \"Yes, audiences for cable were down. The networks have gotten smarter about how to approach some of these things. There will be some ebbs and flows from now on, but the overall trend will continue. Cable is the growth area.\" **********The ratings change comes as the broadcast networks and the cable industry are in periods of transition. Each network is mapping out a new strategy to attract viewers and, more important, profits. And one of them, NBC, is raising doubts about whether it still makes financial sense to try to be the top-rated network. **********Meanwhile, the cable industry is finding that its days of automatic growth are over. **********CBS concluded the February ratings period with the biggest margin of victory over its competition that any network has recorded during a sweeps month -- those ratings periods of the television season that set advertising rates for local stations. **********Yet, at the same time, all of CBS's broadcast rivals -- NBC, ABC and Fox -- saw their own ratings increase from last year. It was the first time since 1985 that each of the three big networks individually had seen its ratings go up in a sweeps month. (Fox was not around in 1985.) **********Fox, in fact, recorded ratings gains of 20 percent and more, especially among the younger viewers who are its specific targets -- teen-agers and adults 18 to 34 years old. **********Over all, the three big networks averaged a prime-time rating of 41.9, up from 38.5 a year earlier. When Fox Broadcasting is included, the broadcasting industry picked up an even bigger overall ratings increase -- to 46.1 from 42. **********Cable television, on the other hand, dropped to a 10.2 rating, from a 12 rating in 1991. Each ratings point currently represents 921,000 homes. **********Indeed, the cable industry can no longer expect to increase its ratings just by adding new customers. After growing rapidly throughout the 1980's, cable has now hit a plateau of just over 60 percent of all American households, with about 90 percent of the country served by cable operators. As such, cable television appears close to reaching almost everyone who wants it. **********Moreover, the cable ratings in February lacked the stimulus they received a year earlier from the Cable News Network's saturation coverage of the Persian Gulf war. Last February, CNN recorded a 2.4 rating. This February, with nothing more exciting to offer than a Presidential primary, CNN's rating collapsed to a puny 0.6. **********Mr. Poltrack's contention that the sweeps figures indicate a true transition in the network-cable confrontation was echoed by other network executives. Robert Niles, the senior vice president of research for NBC, said the figures proved that the networks had at last found some stability after years of steady, debilitating erosion. \"The networks are finally putting a floor under their audience levels,\" he said. **********Regardless of whether February's ratings mark a fundamental shift in television viewing or are just a one-month phenomenon, the broadcast networks are each moving aggressively to strengthen their positions. **********The most radical moves are coming from NBC, the ratings king of the 1980's, which is even willing to forsake prime-time leadership in order to pursue greater profits. **********NBC dumbfounded its competitors last week by walking away from two of its more solid shows, \"Matlock\" and \"In the Heat of the Night,\" because it felt it could no longer profit from them. NBC's moves are the tangible proof that it is, as Mr. Niles put it, \"trying to change the wheels on a moving bus.\" **********Warren Littlefield, the president of NBC Entertainment, summed up his network as \"a work in progress.\" **********Some of his competitors would have chosen a different term, either \"regress\" or \"egress.\" And they wasted no time in signing up the shows themselves: CBS took \"In the Heat of the Night,\" while ABC picked up \"Matlock.\" **********But the moves were consistent with what Mr. Littlefield called the \"changed rules\" now governing NBC. Several weeks ago, NBC's president, Robert C. Wright, declared that finishing first in the overall Nielsen ratings was no longer a goal worth pursuing, because it probably meant losing money. **********Mr. Littlefield pointed out that both \"In the Heat of the Night\" and \"Matlock\" appealed to older viewers, who are not avidly sought by most television advertisers. **********ABC has followed a similar strategy virtually since the network began. In recent years, ABC's executives have emphasized even more that they do not care about straight ratings success, only success with those viewers that advertisers want. **********Yet, ABC went out and made a seemingly incongruous deal for \"Matlock.\" **********But ABC has a long-term plan of its own in mind. This year, it installed \"Columbo,\" a show with appeal to older viewers, in order to deliver viewers into its news-magazine show \"Prime Time Live.\" If a news program succeeds now, it becomes highly valuable because of the profits it can make and its apparently inexhaustible longevity. **********But \"Columbo\" was also a financial boon for ABC because the network used only relatively cheap reruns of the detective series this year. Next year, it will pay twice as much, more than $30 million, for new episodes of \"Matlock\" to do the same job for \"Prime Time Live.\" **********Mostly, what the networks' moves of the last week indicate is that each is pursuing a different agenda. Jeff Sagansky, the president of CBS Entertainment, called these agendas \"radically different strategies.\" **********CBS, which still believes there is real value in being the outright leader in ratings, is clearly at odds with NBC in outlook. Mr. Sagansky said ABC differed in its concentration on programs aimed at \"young families,\" as opposed to Fox's more exclusively youthful appeal. **********Mr. Littlefield said the overall message for the networks for the future could be found in their stand against cable in February. \"The networks aren't crumbling,\" he said. \"If we put on something fresh and exciting, instead of the same old stuff, the audience will be there.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/23/world/british-experts-accuse-pretoria-police-of-bungling.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1992-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 554, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Experts Accuse Pretoria Police of Bungling", "print_headline": "British Experts Accuse Pretoria Police of Bungling", "body_text": " **********A team of British experts brought in to investigate South African police conduct in the Boipatong massacre last month said this week that they had found no evidence of police collusion in the killings, but wholesale incompetence in the response to it. **********In a generally scathing report, the chief investigator, Peter A. J. Waddington, director of criminal justice studies at the University of Reading in England, said the South African Police had failed to prepare for the violence, reacted to it in a way that \"allowed this massacre to be perpetrated unhindered,\" and were \"woefully inadequate\" in investigating the crime. **********\"Together they amount to a basic failure to serve the people of Boipatong, but it does not suggest complicity,\" the report concluded. \"Omissions arose, not from deliberation, but incompetence.\" **********The South African Police have from the outset denied allegations by witnesses that the police transported the killers from a nearby hostel housing Zulu workers. **********Although the police \"could have covered their tracks,\" the British team said, \"all the evidence suggests a genuine desire to identify the perpetrators and prosecute them.\" **********But the South African Police will find little solace in the report as a whole, which portrays a force indifferent to relations with the black majority, inept in its duties, and suffering \"a failure of leadership at all levels.\" **********\"Perhaps after decades of enforcing apartheid laws the S.A.P. must learn afresh how to cultivate relationships and adapt their tactics in order to achieve public acceptability,\" the report said. **********Mr. Waddington's report will carry special weight here, because he and the Scotland Yard officers who aided him were the first foreign experts to conduct such an inquiry with the blessing of President F.

If MCI succeeds in Canada, a major United States trading partner, it might well offer similar lucrative services in the larger markets of Europe and Asia. **********Named Stentor after the loud-voiced messenger in Homer's \"Iliad,\" the Canadian group paid MCI $150 million for the license to its software, in addition to fees for using MCI services. MCI agreed to spend up to $200 million in the next three years to improve the software further. **********The customers for the MCI-Stentor alliance would be American companies with Canadian offices and Canadian companies with United States offices. Chrysler, the big auto maker, has already expressed interest in Stentor to link its Canadian plants with its American operations, MCI said. **********The MCI-Stentor services include toll-free \"800\" service, calling cards and the special low-cost long-distance service known as virtual private networks. But the Stentor service package, known in computer jargon as a \"platform,\" could also offer such residential services as Friends and Family, potentially opening up the entire Canadian market for corporate and residential services. **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company contends MCI's service used critical concepts developed by A.T.& T., which MCI denies. \"We do not feel we are infringing patents, period,\" Gary M.

For the first time, the percentage of home offices that use a computer has topped 50 percent. **********\"I see it as a significant milestone,\" said Thomas E. Miller, a vice president at Link Resources. Mr. Miller said that final numbers from his company's 1991 work-at-home survey were being tabulated but that more than 39 million people appeared to have done all or part of their paid work at home last year. **********Put those two calculations together and 20 million people are using personal computers at home to do some or all of their paid work -- running a primary or secondary business, working at home a day or two each month, or simply catching up on correspondence at night or on weekends. **********One subset of home office workers is called \"corporate home workers,\" people on the payroll of a company outside their home, and nearly 60 percent of them use a computer, said Mr. Miller, who is also an example of this. He works from his home in upstate New York and \"commutes\" to the city electronically. **********Because of the recession, the heady growth in the number of home offices appears to have slowed, Mr. Miller said, but the adoption of computers and other information technologies in those offices is increasing. People are relying more on telephones, modems, facsimile machines and scanners as well as computers to help them with their jobs. **********Beyond the mere statistics, the broader message is that the personal computer has become a standard tool in even the smallest businesses in America. The Small Business Administration says these smallest businesses -- all the way down to one-person pet-sitting services, window washers, gardening consultants and moonlight word processors -- collectively generate as much of the country's gross national product as the 500 largest multinational corporations. **********And businesses that do not use computers are officially in the minority for the first time. **********\"It is a milestone, and it was a long time in coming,\" said Paul Edwards, who with his wife, Sarah Edwards, has written several books and lectured widely on the work-at-home phenomenon. \"In the big- and small-business sector it was passed quickly, but it was more slow to develop in the home. It is a recognition that the computer, as an extension of the brain, has become as indispensible to operating a business as the telephone is as an extension of our voices.\" **********\"People who are not computerizing are not able to compete as well,\" said Sarah Edwards. \"They're struggling, or just hanging on.\" **********The Edwardses are authors of \"The Best Home Businesses for the 90's\" and \"Making It On Your Own\" (each $10.95, from Tarcher Books, a division of Putnam Publishing Group of New York) cited the recent example of a woman who ran a bookkeeping service from her home. **********The message for any business, Paul Edwards said, \"is that personal computers are now integral as opposed to supplemental,\" adding: \"Now it's no longer a matter of gaining a competitive edge. It's a matter of keeping up.\" **********In the electronic forums that on-line information services provide, home office and small business workers are asking a lot of questions. Many home office workers rely on these forums for their technical information, because they do not have the technical support staffs that are common in larger businesses. **********\"I need to know how much RAM my system has,\" writes Fran, of Margate, Fla., in the home business forum on Prodigy Information Services. \"Also, where do I find how much MG I have?\" She gets replies from a self-described \"old lady\" named Jane; Mark in Norman, Okla., and others who guess that Fran means megabytes of disk storage space rather than monosodium glutamate or machine guns. They tell Fran to use the DOS CHKDSK and MEM commands. **********\"About 35 percent of our members work at home,\" said Brian Ek, a spokesman for Prodigy Information Services Inc. of White Plains, which is a joint venture of the International Business Machines Corporation and Sears, Roebuck & Company. **********David, in contrast, asks other musicians for more technical advice. \"I have a Roland CM-32L synthesizer with the MPU IMC card. When I try to initialize the Win 3.1 driver for MPU-401 . . .\" **********Frank uses the computer to ask where he can get more information about a balloon-decorating business. Michael asks about the availability of facsimile machines for use in his car and gets replies from across the country. Another Michael uses his computer to inquire about starting a mobile oil-change business for people who don't have time to wait at the 10-minute lube shops. A baseball-card collector in Fort Worth asks about the profitability of opening a sports card shop and receives some rather bleak replies along with a report on the return-on-investment of 1989 Ken Griffey Jr. rookie cards ($2 to $3 then, now $45 each). **********The recession and subsequent layoffs of thousands of mid-level business managers nationwide has changed the dynamics of new home office ventures, Mr. Miller of Link and the Edwardses agreed. Many executives who lost their jobs are starting home-based businesses, using computers and other information technologies to re-create their former office environment. **********Rapidly falling prices, as well as career decisions, are driving computers deeper into the home office. **********\"When I started in this field in 1983, I paid nearly $5,000 for a fully loaded Apple II,\" Mr. Miller said, chuckling at the thought. Today, $5,000 will equip a home office with a computer many times more powerful than the Apple II, along with software, a couple of telephones, an answering machine, a fax machine, a modem and other equipment -- with enough left over for a nice desk and lamp."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/21/world/a-wounded-angolan-town-trying-to-stay-alive.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1992-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 745, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Wounded Angolan Town, Trying to Stay Alive", "print_headline": "A Wounded Angolan Town, Trying to Stay Alive", "body_text": " **********Every week or so, a droop-winged Ilyushin-76 lands at a small airstrip set amid the tall grass and scrub trees of the Angolan savannah and disgorges food and other supplies that keep this town alive. **********The cargo, flown in by Russian pilots on contract for international aid agencies, also includes beer, whisky and cheap consumer goods that are trucked downtown and sold within minutes at the thriving black market. **********\"It's the pilots who do it,\" a resident said, \"and the soldiers who accompany the trucks are from the Government.\" **********Luena, the administrative center of Moxico Province in east-central Angola, is typical of many Angolan towns whose commerce must be resurrected if the nation is to recover from its 16-year civil war. Half a million Angolans died and $30 billion in damage was suffered in the war between the leftist Government in Luanda and the National Union for Total Independence of Angola, a pro-Western guerrilla movement known by its Portuguese acronym, Unita. Site of Last Battle **********The last major battle before a peace accord last May took place at Luena when Unita forces besieged the town for 45 days, trapping inhabitants in their cellars with artillery barrages. **********The war has left Luena as one of the most isolated towns in Angola, despite its strategic location on a major railway line running from the Angolan port of Benguela. The railway and bridges were blown by the insurgents early in the war. Today, the rolling stock sits rusting at the station platforms and rails and ties have been carted away for building material. **********The town's 60,000 or more residents still lack electricity or running water. The pastel stucco buildings have holes blasted through the walls or have been reduced to hulks. Derelict Soviet-made trucks sit with flattened tires on streets pockmarked from shellfire. **********The prevailing poverty has engendered rampant crime. In Luena, policemen carry assault rifles and light machine guns for protection. In February, Government soldiers came to town to demand back pay from their general and ended up sacking his house. Beer as Currency **********Only the market seems to work. On the muddy downtown lot, women spread their meager wares on crude wooden tables or on mats. They sell trousers and shirts, colorful cloth, fly-specked chunks of raw chicken, dried meat, rice by the cupful and peanuts counted into clusters of 10. **********A can of European or South African beer, which has replaced the Angolan kwanza as the currency of choice in many areas, goes for $1.50, and a bottle of cheap whisky about $28. Ragged children hawk single imported cigarettes. Nearby, fresh water gets sold out of storage tanks converted from fuel pods discarded by jet fighters. **********The black market has grown to rely on deliveries from the Russians. A satisfied customer pedaled off a new bicycle that he bought \"from the Soviets,\" he said, for the equivalent of $135. The shipment of bicycles had already sold out, though the Aeroflot aircraft that delivered them still sat on the runway outside town. **********Even some food donated by Western countries appears on the black market, which occasionally sees military rations left over from the Persian Gulf war that the United States sent to feed thousands of Angolan soldiers awaiting demobilization at assembly points like one outside Luena. Russians Stay Behind **********Russian involvement in the market, residents say, began after the Angolan civil war ended nearly a year ago. Soviet military advisers pulled out and the Soviet Union itself unraveled, leaving medical workers and others staying in Angola with an erratic income. **********\"In old days, I don't think they did sell, but they sell now,\" said Vittorio Borges, a Portuguese trader who buys his beer and liquor from the Russians. **********Local businessmen are hard put to compete with a black market supplied efficiently by air. The 500-mile trip by truck from Luanda takes four or five days because of poor roads and there is the danger of ambushes by bandits. **********Mr. Borges, who came from Portugal 32 years ago and married a local woman, recalled a time when Luena was a thriving town. \"All these houses were new,\" he said. \"There were restaurants. There was a lot of life. You had everything.\" **********But 16 years of war have changed that.

That could include military force. **********Negotiations on Friday and Saturday proved inconclusive. But Mr. Scowcroft and Lawrence S.

Bill Clinton, who has criticized Mr. Bush's response on the Balkans, said today that he thought the United States should consider military action not only for the relief effort but also to force the opening of Serbian detention camps, where there have been allegations of torture and killings. **********Mr. Scowcroft and Mr. Eagleburger pressed the argument that there was no easy military solution in the Balkans and that Europe should lead a military response. They said the fighting in the remnants of Yugoslavia was really a civil war, even though Mr. Bush announced last week that he would open full diplomatic relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia. **********But the Administration's efforts, including three Presidential news conferences in four days, seemed to do little to quiet the growing complaints that Washington has acted too slowly and demands that it lead the world's response. **********\"I can't understand why there is any further delay in taking much firmer action,\" Margaret Thatcher, the former Prime Minister of Britain, said on the ABC News program \"This Week.\" **********In remarks that clearly stung the Bush Administration, Mrs. Thatcher brushed aside Washington's finely calibrated analysis of the tactical military situation. \"This is mainly a great moral question,\" she said. \"And if there's one country in the world which came to life on a moral basis, it was America.\" **********A new Security Council resolution would provide backing for the use of force to open a land corridor to take supplies to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia.

Mr. Bush has frequently expressed great reluctance to send United States troops into Bosnia and would prefer to use air power to support a ground operation. **********Today, Mr. Scowcroft told reporters that Washington, London and Paris had \"some differences in perspective,\" but he predicted they would agree on a resolution by Monday. Then, officials said, the three countries must obtain the backing of Russia and China, the two other permanent members of the Council.

The Administration contends that Saudi Arabia needs the planes chiefly to bolster its defenses in light of a threat posed by Iraq. **********Administration officials say opposition in Congress may be weakened this year by countervailing concerns about the recession and unemployment, possibly giving the White House an opportunity to proceed with the sale. Congress can block arms sales, and has done so in the past in some cases involving Saudi Arabia.  3 Years' Work at Plant **********Without the sale, production lines at the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds the aircraft, will begin closing, possibly as soon as this summer, say Pentagon officials who favor the sale. McDonnell Douglas officials said as many as 7,000 workers, most at a plant in St. Louis, could lose their jobs by 1994. By comparison, the Saudi deal, estimated to be worth $5 billion, could keep assembly lines open through 1997, a company official said today. **********Senior State and Defense Department officials are to appear Wednesday before a closed hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to explain this year's classified list of all requests for military equipment from foreign countries. **********Officials familiar with the document, which was sent to Congress last Friday, said it included a renewed request from the Saudi Government for 24 F-15H's, an aerial combat plane, and 48 F-15E's, an advanced ground-attack aircraft.  Sale Would Be a First **********The United States has never sold the F-15E abroad, but in the past three years has sold Riyadh 98 F-15C's and F-15D's, earlier versions of the F-15H and more defensive in design than the F-15E. Air Force and industry officials said that the Administration might consider selling Riyadh a less advanced version of the F-15E. **********The Administration has not indicated whether it will submit the Saudi sale to Congress. Only about 20 percent of the requests on the list are submitted to Congress annually, a Defense Department official said. **********State and Defense Department officials are divided over the timing of the proposed sale. The Air Force and some other Pentagon officials are pushing the sale to reward an ally in the Persian Gulf war. There are also concerns that if the United States refuses to sell F-15's to Riyadh, Britain will eagerly sell comparable Tornado attack aircraft. **********Senior State Department and other Administration officials oppose any imminent sale, fearing it would damage the Middle East peace talks, which resumed in Washington this week. \"On the whole, selling F-15's will not be a helpful thing in terms of peace process,\" said a senior Administration official. **********The Administration is also walking a political tightrope by backing $10 billion in loan guarantees to Israel only if Israel agrees to freeze all construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Supporting the Saudi sale now, officials said, could lead to a backlash in favor of the Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, and thereby undermine the Administration's strategy on the loan guarantees. Congress is currently considering the loan guarantees as part of its foreign-aid legislation. **********Moreover, the Saudi sale would appear to run counter to pledges by the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France since the end of the Persian Gulf war to try to control conventional arms sales to the Middle East. In that time, however, Washington has announced $6 billion in arms sales to the region, according to the Arms Control Association.  Strong Abroad, Strong at Home? **********Senior Administration officials also differ on the degree to which policymakers should consider the long-term health of America's military industry when deciding foreign arms sales. **********\"It is not the United States Government's policy to sell arms in order to maintain our own defense industrial base,\" Richard A. Clarke, the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs, said in a speech last December. **********When asked about the issue at a breakfast meeting last week, Ronald F. Lehman 2d, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said: \"The answer is, it is a factor, it has always been a factor and will probably always be a factor.\" **********Israel's supporters in Congress are already gearing up for a fight. When reports of the sale first surfaced last November, 67 senators signed a letter to Mr. Bush, objecting to the proposal. \"If the Administration proposes this sale, it will face a fierce and heated struggle on the Hill,\" said Representative Mel Levine, a California Democrat. **********McDonnell Douglas and the American aerospace industry, however, are rallying their forces among factory workers and the Missouri congressional delegation, including House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, whose St. Louis district includes the McDonnell Douglas assembly plant. **********\"The job factor may have some bearing to support a sale, but I think there're still going to be considerable questions,\" said Representative Lee H.

Since 1980, four men have tried to placate the company's quarrelsome family owners while keeping the world's last independent sports car maker on track despite a dwindling market and soaring prices. **********Three of the executives were ousted after disputes with the Porsche family. Arno Bohn, the current chairman, has already survived one nasty bout with the owners, winning a new contract two months ago after issuing a \"fire me or extend my contract\" ultimatum. But fulfilling his three-year pact may prove almost as difficult because of his controversial plan for reviving Porsche. **********Mr. Bohn's idea is to build a less expensive sports car, priced at less than $40,000 and aimed at the American market, where Porsche sales have plunged in recent years. While industry experts laud the notion of an \"entry-level\" car, it is considered sheer heresy by some Porsche purists. **********He must also rebuild the company's market in the face of slumping profits and surging competition from Japan and even Detroit, all with a Porsche lineup that now starts at $39,850 for the cheapest version of its newest model, and ends in the stratosphere. **********But Mr. Bohn's toughest task may be coping with constant intervention from the Porsche and Piech clans, the two main branches of the family that founded the company and now owns all of the voting shares and about half of the publicly traded shares. The family is headed by Ferry Porsche, the company's 82-year-old supervisory board chairman and son of Prof. Ferdinand Porsche, the legendary sports car pioneer who also designed the Volkswagen Beetle. **********There are two other Porsche family members and two Pieches on the 12-member board, including Ferdinand Piech, the managing board chairman of Audi A.G., who will become the chairman of Volkswagen A.G., Germany's largest auto maker, at the end of the year. **********An eccentric, contentious bunch, the Porsche heirs have established a reputation as the Ewings of Germany. Their bickering, scheming, extramarital affairs and second-guessing of their company's managers have provided the German tabloid press enough grist to put the family members in a class by themselves. **********But their cars no longer are. And that, experts say, is the root of Porsche's current troubles. **********\"Porsches are not bad cars,\" said Csaba Csere, technical director of Car and Driver magazine. \"They are well engineered and fun to drive. But they are very expensive. A lot of people are building good sports cars now, cars that offer better value for the money.\"Not in a Class by Itself **********Powerful competitors like Nissan's 300ZX and 240SX, which sell for $36,610 and $21,995 respectively, the Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1 ($65,000) and the Chrysler Corporation's new Dodge Viper, which starts at about $55,000, have moved into the niche that Porsche once had almost to itself years ago. **********The increased competition overran Porsche when the dollar's value began sinking against the German mark in the mid-1980's. As Porsche's cars became much more expensive in the United States -- a 944 model that cost from $20,000 to $25,000 in 1985 cost about $40,000 by 1990 -- the company was unsure what to do next. **********Until recently, it even pursued plans for a four-seat, four-door sports sedan that it called the 989, which would have sold for between $90,000 and $120,000, or about the same as a basic Ferrari. **********Porsche sank $60 million into the idea, initially supported by Mr. Bohn, before he halted the project late last year. **********As the value of the dollar dropped, so did Porsche's sales. After peaking at 49,976 cars worldwide in 1986, sales have declined steadily. **********Sales in the United States also peaked in 1986, at 30,471 cars, two-thirds of which were the 944 model that was phased out starting in 1990. Last year, Porsche's American sales amounted to just 4,388 cars, slightly better than those of Peugeot, which pulled out of the United States, but worse than Suzuki, one of Japan's also-rans in the American market.Sale Rumors, and Denials **********One of the few things the Porsche family agrees on is that their company should remain independent. But rumors persist that Porsche is being sold. In the last year, the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan, Daimler-Benz A.G. of Germany, which makes Mercedes-Benz, and Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G., which makes BMW cars, are said to have made offers. All have denied such notions. **********\"If they are ever sold, you can bet it won't be to a non-German company,\" said Gavin Launder, automotive analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London. \"Porsche would immediately get a call from Daimler-Benz matching any offer.\" Porsche builds the Mercedes-Benz 500 here for Daimler- Benz, which would not want to part with either the prestige of Porsche or its production capacity. **********Mr. Bohn says he thinks he can keep Porsche independent and asserts that the company has sufficient financial strength to go it alone. **********\"Our liquid reserves alone are 630 million Deutsche marks,\" or $381.8 million, he told the annual shareholders meeting recently. **********Porsche is pursuing a cost-cutting program that Mr. Bohn said had lowered its break-even point for this fiscal year to 21,000 cars, from 28,000 just two years ago. \"Our costs are sinking month by month,\" he said. **********But so are profits. In the six-month period that ended on Jan. 31, Porsche's pretax earnings plummeted to $1.2 million, from $39.4 million a year earlier. Sales dropped 23 percent, to $686 million from $893 million.Slight Profit Predicted **********\"We expect sales will decline to 2.5 billion Deutsche marks,\" or $1.5 billion, this fiscal year, Mr. Bohn told the stockholders. Porsche's sales totaled 3.1 billion marks, or $1.87 billion, in fiscal 1990. He says he still believes that the company can make a slight profit in the current fiscal year. **********Mr. Bohn attributes the decline to the recession and saturation of the American market. To redress the latter, he said Porsche had cut the number of American dealers to about 220 from 330 two years ago. **********\"I'm not sure we need all of them,\" he said. \"In some areas they are competing with each other. For example, in the Boston area there are 6 dealerships; in Los Angeles there are 17. In the future, we will have about 200 U.S. dealerships.\" **********Last month, Porsche shook up the management of its North American operations, forcing the resignation of Brian Bowler, president of Porsche Cars North America Inc. He was replaced by Frederick J. Schwab, a senior executive vice president. **********Mr. Bohn may be putting a positive spin on a bad situation: many dealers simply went out of business because of the drop in sales. \"A lot of their dealers are selling, on average, about two cars a month,\" Mr. Csere said. \"You can't stay in business very long doing that.\" Hot-Selling New Model Needed **********For longer-term survival, Porsche badly needs a hot-selling new model, industry analysts said. It now offers three basic models: the 968, the 928 and the 911, ranging in price from $39,850 for the lowest-priced 968 to $98,875 for a 911 Turbo. The 911, a rear-engine sports car with the classic hump-backed, goggle-eyed Porsche silhouette -- and a flat, hard ride -- is the biggest seller, particularly the 911 Carrera 2, which is priced at $63,900 in the United States. The original version was designed by Ferdinand Alexander Porsche, the grandson of the company's founder, and went on sale 30 years ago.. **********\"The 911 is a wonderful car and will always have its fans,\" said Mr. Launder. But although it has been updated technically, he said, \"there is only so much you can do.\" **********\"The sports car market has changed,\" Mr. Launder said. \"People want more luxury and comfort today\" -- akin to what the Japanese are offering for less money. **********\"The 911 is enough to keep them going, but they need a new car for the future,\" he concluded. **********Mr. Bohn's new model is expected by 1996, and it could arrive considerably sooner if Porsche was to share components with another manufacturer, something Porsche has not done often. **********Industry experts generally agree that a lower-priced model is needed. **********\"They have to introduce a new car at the bottom end of the range to meet the threat from the Japanese,\" said Karl E. Ludvigsen, president of Ludvigsen & Associates, an automotive consulting group in London. \"Porsche can't afford to keep coming up with stand-alone models like the 968 that very few people buy. There is no margin for error in what they do now.\" **********In the interim, Porsche is pushing out modified versions of its current line. The 928 GTS was introduced on March 25, billed by the company as \"the sovereign way to show strength.\" Priced at $80,920, it features a 350-horsepower, eight-cylinder engine, with a top speed of 165 miles per hour. Gas mileage is estimated at 20 miles to the gallon on the highway and 12.7 in the city. **********Dieter Laxy, Porsche's marketing chief, said the company wanted to sell 1,500 to 2,000 annually, about 800 of them in Germany, where long stretches of the Autobahn superhighway system still have no speed limit. **********Whether the lower-priced new car will get off the drawing boards is an open question. Shortly after Mr. Bohn dropped work on the expensive four-door sedan, some family members began talking to other German auto executives -- most notably Wolfgang Reitzle, BMW's director of research and development -- about taking Mr. Bohn's job. People close to the company said an informal approach was also made to Robert A. Lutz, the president of Chrysler, who was passed over last month for the Chrysler chairmanship. But for Porsche, there were no takers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/17/business/at-work-young-black-male-and-elite.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Noble", "pub_date": "1992-05-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1017, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At Work; Young, Black, Male -- and Elite", "print_headline": "At Work; Young, Black, Male -- and Elite", "body_text": " **********The voice of Imar Hutchins picks up speed when he begins to talk about FreeForm Academy, the educational venture he will immerse himself in full time after he graduates from Morehouse College in Atlanta this afternoon. \"Privatization is coming in public education.

A national system.\" The 21-year old senior laughs a little at his own sincerity but continues: \"I wake up in the middle of the night and think, 'I have a vision. I have to go to work.' \" **********Mr. Hutchins and his classmates at the elite, predominantly black men's college are taking their fervor into the wider world during troubled times. The economy is bestirring itself but the job market for new graduates is the worst in decades, according to several surveys. And, two weeks ago, just as seniors were settling in for their last experience with the ritual torture known as final exams, the anomic images from Los Angeles exploded across their television screens. **********A protest by Atlanta students, including several from Morehouse, against the Rodney King verdict evolved into a confrontation with the police. \"In a way it was a good thing it was finals,\" said Marshall Norwood, 21, another graduating Morehouse senior, \"because people had to calm down and study.\" **********However it looks on television, a few students sharing a few moments of common cause in the streets does not an unruly mob of looters make. The young men of Morehouse, which numbers Martin Luther King Jr. and Spike Lee among its graduates, have little in common except some demography -- race and youth -- with many of the men who figured so prominently in film footage of L.A. and who populate white stereotypes of black behavior. But as they leave campus to start work, seniors say they know that race confuses some whites and that they face expectations their young white counterparts do not. **********\"We do get lumped together,\" Mr. Norwood said. Mr. Hutchins agreed: \"The image that predominates is not a positive one.\" Similarly, the class valedictorian, Terrence Liddell, also 21: \"It is always a factor, being a black male,\" he said. \"We will always encounter people who see us as a threat.\" **********Mr. Hutchins is realistic about the power of race as a leveler. He is a well-established member of the middle class whose great-grandfather was a college graduate. \"If I walk into a department store, they don't know what school I go to,\" he said. \"I face the same suspicion as any other black man.\" **********If that realization is a sobering companion, the students view the imminent changes in their lives with the mix of dread and excitement of any frisky new graduates. \"This will be a testing period,\" said Mr. Liddell. \"I'm not afraid of change, just wary.\" **********ONE thing the students seem unfazed by is the prospect of working in white-dominated environments. \"I love to find out about different types of people,\" said Sean Allen, a 21-year-old economics major. Like other students, Mr. Allen, who in a few weeks will begin work at Cargill, the agricultural products company, credits Morehouse and his parents for providing the solid footing he needed to view achievement as a challenge not a burden. \"Every day I see 3,000 young black men striving to make something of their lives,\" he said of his school. \"Being a Morehouse student, I am constantly looked at and evaluated. It makes me do my best.\" **********But even before Morehouse, his parents prodded him to focus on his goals: \"My mother said, 'Life is short. You don't have time to procrastinate,' \" he said. \"Those who know what they want get what they want.\" **********It is hardly surprising that these students are doing better than many in the class of 1992 nationally: they are at the top of their class. Mr. Liddell is moving to New York to begin Merrill Lynch's two-year training program for financial analysts.

But for Spain, the main threat is posed by a militant Basque separatist group, known by the initials E.T.A., which stand for \"Basque Homeland and Freedom\" in the Basque language. **********Over the past 24 years, E.T.A. has killed more than 700 people, including 17 so far this year. Guerrilla documents intercepted by police last month also made clear the movement planned no let-up in 1992. **********\"We must not modify our methods,\" one letter seized from an E.T.A. commander said. \"Now that we are in 1992, we must not cut down our attacks or unnecessarily risk the lives of our fighters, lives which are worth 100 times more than that of a son of a cop.\" **********In response, the Government has mobilized 9,000 soldiers to protect the 310-mile route of the new high-speed railroad between Madrid and Seville, which will start up when King Carlos travels on it to Seville for the opening of Expo '92 on April 20. **********Marines have been assigned to protect public buildings in Seville, while for months police have been investigating all new renters of apartments or homes. Thousands of special agents will be charged with checking the 15 million to 18 million people expected to visit the fair before it closes on Oct. 12. **********For the 25th Olympic Games, which will take place in Barcelona between July 25 and Aug. 7, some 10,500 police, civil guards and other security officers are undergoing special counterterrorist training. Already, police roadblocks appear often near Olympics installations and plainclothes officers have increased patrols in the city. **********The Basque guerrillas have nonetheless carried out four attacks -- and killed five people -- in Barcelona so far this year. Two of the deaths occurred earlier this month when separate car bombs killed a member of the Civil Guard and a construction worker. **********Because E.T.A. has used the Basque region of southwest France as a haven, Spain plans to station 3,000 extra troops along the border to prevent infiltration.

But they have not taken their seats because they are required to swear allegiance to the Spanish Constitution. In the Basque country, the party holds 13 of the 75 seats in the regional parliament. **********Despite a hard core of sympathizers in their home territory, however, neither Herri Batasuna nor E.T.A. are thought to be growing, and there are signs that some E.T.A. factions now believe that terrorism has become counterproductive. **********But Government officials also know that bombings would give the impression that the group remains strong. **********\"That's the problem with Seville and Barcelona,\" one said. \"A handful of terrorists can carry out a small action that will be heard around the world.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/11/business/market-watch-a-clinton-win-good-for-stocks-bad-for-bonds.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1992-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 498, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Clinton Win: Good for Stocks, Bad for Bonds?", "print_headline": "MARKET WATCH; A Clinton Win: Good for Stocks, Bad for Bonds?", "body_text": " **********The WORD on the Street is that a victory by Gov. Bill Clinton would be good for stocks and bad for bonds. If he wins, as current polls indicate is likely, Mr. Clinton is expected in his first hundred days as President to take a muscular, Franklin Roosevelt-like approach to the slump. Many people bet he would push through a fiscal stimulus program to shake some life back into the economy. By showing he means business about the economy, he might help revive consumer and investor confidence. Mr. Clinton would also no doubt use his Presidential pulpit to tell how his huge public investment program will build a more prosperous America. **********All this would in theory spur growth, which, says Neal Soss, chief economist at First Boston, could cause a stock market rally because \"one would expect that corporate profits would be enhanced.\" A public investment program would mean more spending on highways, railroads, airports and telecommunications and would probably be a boon for construction, electronics and transportation-equipment companies. **********Bonds would probably be a different story.Bond buyers tend to act as if they were allergic to prosperity. They may fret that faster growth will increase inflation, that fiscal stimulus will raise the budget deficit. \"Should there be a major short-term fiscal stimulus package, the bond market would act adversely,\" said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist for CRT Government Securities. \"Such a plan would show fiscal irresponsibility.\" **********Robert M. Solow, a Clinton supporter and a Nobel Prize-winning economist at the Massachussets Institute of Technology, said bond buyers might not be reflexively negative. \"The notion that the day Clinton takes office the bond market wets its pants does not suggest the appropriate degree of maturity\" for bond holders, he said. **********Some experts say stocks and bonds might not react much to a Clinton victory, suggesting that financial markets have already discounted this possibility. **********The Federal Reserve's reaction to a fiscal stimulus program could cushion any downturn in the bond market. If the Fed concludes that pump-priming will push up prices, it could raise short-term rates to fight inflationary pressures, allaying bond buyers' fears. **********The debate over the Fed's response to a Clinton victory has produced another over what the dollar will do. Some economists predict it will fall if Mr. Clinton wins, because investors might conclude his policies will push up inflation and the deficit. Speculators might also quickly attack the dollar to test his will to defend it. **********On the other hand, a Clinton triumph could help the dollar, because faster growth and a rising stock market could attract foreign investment. If the Fed raises rates, that could also prop up the dollar. **********But don't assume a rate increase on Inauguration Day: The Fed might want some signs of robust recovery before it takes that unpopular move.

Leslie, senior vice president of trading at M. R. Beal & Company. \"It had gotten a little bit ahead of itself.\" **********Traders said that prices in the municipal market had moved up further -- and consequently, yields had dropped further -- than in the Treasury market since the current rally started in July. One measure of this is that the yields on municipal bonds had fallen to below 80 percent of those on comparable Treasury securities. When the ratio has fallen below 80 percent in the last four years the municipal market has stalled and fallen. **********At the same time, the buildup of new municipal issues was growing. Traders now estimate that there is a total of $7 billion to $8 billion in new issues scheduled to be issued in 30 days. **********One measure of the decline can be seen in the pricing of two similar issues on Tuesday and yesterday. The five-year portion of a $250 million issue of Illinois general-obligation bonds was priced to yield 4.60 percent on Tuesday. A similar State of Washington issue was priced yesterday to yield 4.65 percent, an increase of 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. **********But, at the same time, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's sale of $538 million in bonds and variable-rate securities went rather well, according to Mr. Leslie of M. R. Beal, in part because the bonds are exempt from Federal, state and local taxes, which make it especially attractive to a lot of state pension funds. The Treasury Market **********In the Treasury market, prices of bonds and notes were little changed or down in the morning but rallied to close up in the afternoon in thin trading. **********Traders said demand from long-term investors was strong for 5- and 10-year notes. This demand also set off a rise in the price of the 30-year bond as speculators who has sold Tuesday or yesterday morning had to cover their positions as the buying of 5- and 10-year notes increased demand for the 30-year bond. **********The 7.25 percent long bond was offered in late trading in the secondary market at 99 1/4, up 5/32 to yield 7.31 percent, reaching once again the five-and-a-half-year low touched a week ago. **********Traders and investors continued to wait to see if developments at the Republican National Convention would upset the bond market. The White House announced that President Bush would outline steps to stimulate the economy in his acceptance speech tonight. If investors decided the President was going too far in pumping up the economy, which would increase the deficit and possibly stir inflationary fears, bond prices could fall. **********The decline in the trade deficit for July, which gave an initial indication of a slightly stronger economy, sent the price of the 30-year bond down early in the day. Trade Data Worry Some **********The decline in the trade deficit seemed to worry some traders because the rise in both exports and imports to record levels may indicate that the American economy is stronger than has been anticipated. The deficit fell 7.7 percent in June to $6.59 billion from a revised $7.14 billion in May. **********But some economists, like Sally Kleinman of Chemical Securities Inc, think that the numbers are not as positive as they appear. She cited several reasons for this interpretation. **********One is that the data are not adjusted for the number of selling days in a month. And there were 22 in June, compared with 20 in May. So there were two more days for imports and exports to be counted. **********In addition, she said that with a rise of six-tenths of 1 percent in trade and manufacturing inventories in June, a lot of the imports have ended up on the shelf. This means that the demand from from the consumer is not as strong as the import rise might imply. **********She also said that more than 40 percent of the increase in American exports was in sales of civilian aircraft, which is a pace that is not likely to continue. **********The Treasury announced it would auction $10.5 billion of five-year notes and $15 billion of two-year notes next week. In the pre-auction, or when-issued, market the five-year note was trading at a yield of 5.44 percent and the two-year note at a yield of 4.07 percent, both higher than the yields on the current notes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/05/business/media-business-advertising-kmart-trying-fashion-new-image-for-its-apparel.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 600, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kmart Is Trying to Fashion New Image for Its Apparel", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Kmart Is Trying to Fashion New Image for Its Apparel", "body_text": " **********THE KMART CORPORATION is undertaking an intensive effort to persuade skeptical women that they can find fashionable clothing amid aisles of appliances, weed killer and toothpaste. **********To help in this arduous task, one of Kmart's agencies, Calet, Hirsch & Ferrell Inc. in New York, is introducing a series of three sophisticated, soft-sell commercials that seem more like clips from television sitcoms than retail advertising. **********The understated tone of the spots, which began running Saturday, is in keeping with Kmart's goal of using the campaign not to promote specific merchandise or sale prices, but to redefine itself as a source of stylish clothing rather than as a palace of polyester. **********\"Kmart wants to restage, if you will, its women's apparel,\" Jane Singer, the agency's executive vice president and director of marketing and strategic planning, said during an interview at Calet, Hirsch's office. **********\"Everybody has the same toasters, the same health and beauty aids,\" she added. \"Fashion is the one area of merchandise that will be the most differentiating.\" **********Kmart, America's second largest retailer after Wal-Mart, and Calet, Hirsch, a creatively focused shop owned by the Ross Roy Group, are so intent on altering attitudes, the commercials are even tagged with a logo adding the word \"fashion\" under the familiar \"K\" symbol. **********In one spot, friends are having lunch when one says she must dash to \"a 2:15 meeting with our biggest client.\" As she leaves, she is asked where she got \"that cute outfit.\" When she responds \"Kmart,\" one doubting Thomasina says, \"They don't have clothes like that!

Altman were indicted on criminal charges stemming from their involvement with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, most of the world's attention was focused on the financial issues. But while B.C.C.I. -- which has been accused here and abroad of money laundering, fraud, bribery and many other banking irregularities -- made billions of dollars for its founders and millions of dollars, it is charged, for Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman, its main mission was not financial. The aim of B.C.C.I., from the outset, was to put forward a radical-Islamic political agenda and to support third world causes. **********From the beginning, B.C.C.I.'s founder, Pakistani businessman Agha Hasan Abedi, a member of the ultra-religious, quasi-secret Sufi sect, made plain the bank's ideological bent. He and other bank officials openly discussed their political and religious mission. In my opinion, it is unlikely that Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman were unaware of B.C.C.I.'s political and ideological activities. **********Mr. Abedi's aim for B.C.C.I. was for it to acquire enough political power to compete with -- and even dominate -- Western financial institutions. As investigators in Britain and the United States have showed, Mr. Abedi wanted to use B.C.C.I.'s money to gain a measure of control over Western political institutions as well. **********One of the ways B.C.C.I. tried to gain political and ideological influence was through the media. To do that, Mr. Abedi bankrolled publications like South Magazine, a now-defunct economic and political magazine aimed at the elite of the third world. British investigators say B.C.C.I. also financed a regular opinion column on the Middle East that was published in Britain's Manchester Guardian newspaper. In the United States, according to disclosures made during last year's Senate subcommittee hearings, chaired by Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, B.C.C.I. indirectly aided in the purchase of several cable television systems and tried to buy more. **********B.C.C.I. accomplished its political as well as financial goals, it is charged, by bribing prominent citizens as well as high government officials so they would act on the bank's behalf as Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman allegedly did. Both were charged in the recent criminal indictments with accepting bribes and lying to the Federal Reserve to conceal B.C.C.I.'s ownership of First American Bankshares Inc., Washington's largest bank. According to investigators, bribing was B.C.C.I.'s modus operandi. **********B.C.C.I. had plenty of cash: millions from drug traffickers and approximately $1 billion of unrecorded banking deposits from Islamic countries, principally Saudi Arabia. According to British investigators, these funds were used under contractual stipulation for commodity investments according to the strictures of Islamic law. **********The massive infusion of unrecorded deposits provided B.C.C.I. with a distinct advantage over its Western counterparts. According to British investigators, B.C.C.I. was the bank for the Islamic fundamentalists as well as terrorist groups like Abu Nidal and Shining Path, the violent Maoist terrorist organization operating in Peru. **********It is also charged that B.C.C.I.'s \"special services\" lured criminals, drug lords and corrupt politicians into its sway. Its services on their behalf included falsification of documents and intricate shell game transactions to siphon off financial resources from central banks.  B.C.C.I. was also a major catalyst in the transfer and sales of strategic weapons including nuclear military technology from the West and ballistic missiles from China to third world countries, especially Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, as documented by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and by the House Republican Research Committee on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. **********Mr. Abedi's major contribution to furthering radical causes, like those of Abu Nidal, was to use an international bank as a political instrument. What he put in place through B.C.C.I. was allowed to continue for 19 years while the world's banking community and governments sat back and -- in some cases -- watched. **********It was this misplaced sense of \"realism\" on the part of governments, including the United States, that allowed B.C.C.I. to grow to such global proportions before being shut down. It is also what gave B.C.C.I. the resources to draw people like Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman into its web."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/06/world/us-says-hussein-is-purging-military.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick Tyler", "pub_date": "1992-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Says Hussein Is Purging Military", "print_headline": "U.S. Says Hussein Is Purging Military", "body_text": " **********A major purge has begun in the Iraqi military in the wake of reports of a coup attempt against President Saddam Hussein last week, Bush Administration officials said today. **********The reports of the purge of Iraq's officer corps have added detail to early, sketchy descriptions of unrest in Baghdad that came last week.

I think it's one more indicator of the fact that his base inside Iraq is shrinking and that he is in big trouble -- that in fact he's been enormously unsuccessful as the leader of Iraq.

The President is thought to want to consolidate his February 1991 combat victory in the Persian Gulf by removing Mr. Hussein from power. Repeated U.S. Efforts **********Since late last year, the Central Intelligence Agency has been authorized to step up efforts to destabilize the Iraqi Government, including making covert contacts with Iraqi citizens and Government officials. **********Administration officials said the purge was set off last week by Mr. Hussein's discovery of a plot that, in a meeting with officers, he attributed to the United States and Jordan. His remarks implied that he might retaliate for the \"collusion\" against him, which if confirmed would represent the largest fracture in Mr. Hussein's power base since the end of the war. **********An intelligence report from a sensitive channel inside Iraq describing Mr. Hussein's meeting with his officers touched off a security alert in Jordan, where the royal palace and the United States Embassy braced for a possible terrorist attack, officials said. **********A United States official said the intelligence report, and separate reports of a coup attempt from Iraqi opposition figures, were related. An opposition figure, Ahmed Chalabi, said he had received reports in London indicating that a mechanized brigade from Iraq's Republican Guard had been \"pounced on\" by other forces as it tried to lead or join a revolt. **********Another American official said that the attempt was to have been coordinated with other units, but that Mr. Hussein broke it up before it could get under way. One official said the United States was involved in the plot but would not provide any details. **********Mr. Hussein reportedly told his officers that a group of conspirators in the upper reaches of the military had been detected, arrested and tortured. He said they had confessed to being part of a Jordanian-American plot to overthrow him. This apparently touched off the purge. One official said many more people had been executed than just the commander of the brigade. **********The official who mentioned the American role said, \"There is a major purge going on.\" He added, \"There was a plot\" and \"we were involved.\" The official said Mr. Hussein had cited a role by Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence. **********\"Saddam is linking the coup attempt to the D.C.I.'s visit to Jordan and he's saying that King Hussein is in collusion with us,\" the official said. Mr. Gates made an unannounced visit to Jordan late last month and tried to persuade King Hussein to let United Nations inspectors take up posts at the port of Aqaba to keep goods from reaching Iraq in violation of the 23-month-old trade embargo. **********Faced with the prospect of being seen as cooperating with Washington and the United Nations against Baghdad, the King was said to have demurred. But he pledged unspecified continuing cooperation to Mr. Gates in the efforts to topple Mr. Hussein, officials said. Among other things, the King has approved a much larger C.I.A. presence in Jordan. **********The timing for Washington's next step remains uncertain, because officials were unable to predict whether they could quickly reach the consensus they are seeking at the United Nations for going ahead with a tougher line on embargo enforcement, and with key allies like Britain, Turkey and Saudi Arabia on military coordination. **********The American official asserted that Mr. Hussein's discovery of a plot, together with the many reports about it, was putting pressure on Washington to move quickly to seek allied support for new pressure against the Iraqi leader. Envoy Tries to See Saudi King **********To that end, the United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Charles W. Freeman Jr., was said to have repeatedly sought last week to present the White House plan to King Fahd, the Saudi leader. **********On Tuesday the White House, frustrated by Mr. Freeman's failure to get an audience with the King, asked Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador in Washington, to fly to Riyadh to make the presentation, an American official said. Prince Bandar left the next day and has not returned. **********Last winter, Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sent a report to the White House laying out the risks of trying to support actions inside Iraq, especially a coup attempt, without a large new deployment of United States forces in the Persian Gulf region.

It would be absurd, officials here say, for them to hand secrets from the world's most sophisticated missile-defense system to a country that is trying to sell long-range missiles of its own to some of Israel's Arab neighbors.  The Inspectors Are Silent **********The inspectors have not said a public word about what, if anything, they have learned either to confirm or to squelch the accusations. But the Israeli press has been filled with reports from unnamed Israeli military officers maintaining that the inspectors had found nothing. **********Far from being mollified, some Israeli officers have told reporters that they feel humiliated by the process, saying Israel had virtually been put on a par with Iraq, which also underwent arms inspections by foreign specialists this week."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/22/business/broker-survey-on-investing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Broker Survey On Investing", "print_headline": "Broker Survey On Investing", "body_text": " **********How you feel about money apparently depends a bit on where you are from and what sex you are. **********The Quick & Reilly Group, the discount brokerage firm, recently released a survey of 500 active customers.

Gaidar, the architect of the reforms, explained to Parliament today, a balanced budget and a tight monetary policy are necessary if Russia is to keep hyperinflation at bay and pull itself toward a market economy. **********But three weeks after the economic reforms began, the Russian economy remains stubbornly frozen and its people increasingly anxious at the prospect of yet another experiment that fails at the expense of their precarious standard of living. The Darkest Days **********So far, no good news has appeared to brighten the horizon and even the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, leading a meeting of the Russian Government on Thursday, said the country's current ordeal could be compared only to the dark days of World War II. Today, a Russian official announced that the number of unemployed was now 60,000, but could reach between seven million and eight million by October. **********Both Mr. Gaidar and First Deputy Prime Minister Gennadi E. Burbulis are also now warning that without Western credits the country will not be able to buy the grain it needs to keep bread on the table this spring. Russian farmers, suspicious of rising prices, have been withholding grain supplies this winter, while the country lacks the hard currency to keep up purchases from the West. **********Other republics that had only reluctantly followed Moscow's lead in using shock therapy to jolt their economies back to life are now beginning to pull back, taking with them the illusion of a \"single economic space\" within the confines of the new Commonwealth of Independent States. **********Ukraine now requires coupons for transactions on its territory, tempting its citizens to roam across the border into Russia to dump rubles on all available goods. Now Belarus and Moldova are planning their own forms of currency, while in several Central Asian republics governments have moved to reimpose controls on prices in the face of popular discontent. **********As economic unity falls apart, other, more political disputes have moved to the fore. The Russian Parliament called on Thursday for a review of the transfer of the Crimean peninsula from Russia to Ukraine by the Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev, in 1954. The loss of the Crimea has been made more painful for Russia recently with Ukraine's claim to much of the Black Sea Fleet, stationed in the Crimean port of Sevastopol. **********The budget approved today in the Russian Parliament calls for an 85 percent cut in Government arms procurement, a move that is certain to cause widespread unemployment in the defense sector. Russia, where the bulk of the Soviet Union defense industry was traditionally based, has about eight million workers in military factories, many of them concentrated in regions and cities that until recently were kept strictly isolated. **********To offset the social impact of such drastic cuts, the Parliament today voted to authorize the central bank to give 10 billion rubles in credits to help military factories move toward conversion. In a recent meeting with foreign journalists, Mr. Gaidar said the Government was prepared to set aside half of the savings made from cuts in arms procurements as social assistance to workers in weapons factories. **********The new 420-billion-ruble budget covers only the first quarter of 1992, since inflation, now running at more than 300 percent annually, makes longer predictions dubious. The anticipated deficit for the quarter is 1 percent of the gross national product. The total deficit for last year, 108 billion rubles, was 17 percent of the G.N.P. **********Spending on the military, which once consumed more than 25 percent of the Soviet economy, has been cut to 4.5 percent of the Russian gross national product, or about 50 billion rubles. After meetings with other members of the new Commonwealth of Independent States, Russia, as the largest republic by far, agreed to carry most of the burden of a single joint army, or 62.3 percent, a military official recently told the press agency Tass. **********Cuts in price subsidies, which amount to the biggest savings or a 15 percent budget cut, have already gone into effect with the release of price controls and subsidies last Jan. 2. Ruble Stabilization a Goal **********One of the main goals of Mr. Gaidar's program is to stabilize the value of the ruble, by forcing a realistic price policy and maintaining a strict control on the money supply. But in the opinion of several leading Western economists, including Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, his policies are being undercut by the Russian Central Bank's more liberal lending policies which, according to some estimates, last year pumped more than 600 billion rubles of loans into the economy. **********But some economists and businessmen here think the struggle to bring down inflation is being waged at the expense of the country's young, and feeble, private sector. To balance the budget, the Russian Government has imposed a new 28 percent value-added tax, which has brought howls of protests from producers who say the taxes are pricing their goods out of the market. **********This week, the Yeltsin Government was considering corrective measures for the reform program, including lower taxes. To the delight of free-market advocates, the Government announced Thursday that it would move to eliminate state trading organizations, monopolies that act as barriers between producers and sellers and which in the last two weeks have helped prevent any kind of flexible response to consumers' outrage over high prices. **********But today, Mr. Gaidar continued to warn against any slackening in the fight against inflation, telling Parliament that a move to lower the value-added taxes would be \"one of the most dangerous parliamentary decisions\" to date. **********Although some once-rare goods have appeared in the stores since prices began to rise on Jan. 2, most of them are still far beyond the average shoppers' reach and in many cases, are sent back to the factory either to be dumped or reprocessed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/29/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-bbdo-to-promote-russian-privatization.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-07-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 80, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BBDO to Promote Russian Privatization", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; BBDO to Promote Russian Privatization", "body_text": " **********The Russian State Committee for Privatization selected BBDO Worldwide in Moscow to handle the advertising and public relations accounts for its efforts to convert formerly state- and municipally owned industrial enterprises into private concerns. **********The account, with billings estimated to exceed $10 million, has prompted BBDO to double the staff of its Moscow office to 30 employees.

They see him as someone who not only complains about conditions in eastern Germany, but also stands ready for action, including attacks on foreigners. **********\"When there is violence, I'm there right away,\" he told a visitor after stepping out of his customized Trabant.  He said he had taken part in several attacks on hostels for asylum-seekers, though he would not say which ones. 'No Jobs and No Hope' **********\"People here have no jobs and no hope, and meanwhile our Government is giving money to foreigners for nothing,\" he fumed. \"It's time to stand up for Germany. We're going to clean up this country. No foreigners, no filth, no drugs, no pornography, and work for everyone. Germany is going to be great again.\" **********For the last year, Germany has been engulfed in a wave of violence against foreigners. The attacks subsided, and then a new surge of them, concentrated in the eastern part of the country, broke out last month. **********According to a new report by Germany's federal police, 1991 was the first year when there were more right-wing extremists in Germany, a total of 40,000, than left-wing extremists. **********Statistics in the report showed that there were 1,483 acts of rightist violence in Germany in 1991, an fivefold increase over the year before. Nine people were killed. More than 97 percent of the perpetrators were under 30, and about half were between 18 and 20. **********Chemnitz has been the scene of several attacks, and both young people and city authorities say a major assault like the one last month in Rostock, 280 miles north of here, is entirely possible. **********Conversations with rightist youths here suggest that while most of them are frustrated, angry and prepared for violence, they are largely without political ideology. Many are unemployed and come from families whose lives have been thrown into upheaval by the jarring changes that have followed German unification. Some Study Nazism **********But a small number of young people here, perhaps only a few dozen, have schooled themselves with neo-Nazi propaganda and emerged as leaders of amorphous gangs that harass and beat foreigners, attack cafes favored by leftists, and hurl rocks and bottles at hostels where asylum-seekers live. **********Police, courts and Government officials have been criticized for their failure to protect foreigners living in Germany and their apparent reluctance to crack down on violent rightists. In recent days, however, they have taken a series of new steps. **********Interior Minister Rudolf Seiters announced recently that he would assign more federal officers to guard hostels, fight rioters and keep watch on rightist groups. In Rostock, 12 youths have been sentenced to jail terms of up to eight months for taking part in last month's riots, and at least 17 others will soon face trial. And in Chemnitz and other nearby towns, police searched more than 100 homes in search of weapons and evidence. **********The immediate source of the conflict is the growing number of foreigners who are streaming into Germany seeking political asylum. The number of applicants for asylum this year is expected to be more than half a million, double what it was last year. All are entitled to live at Government expense until their cases are decided, which usually takes months or even years. **********Politicians in Bonn are nearing agreement to tighten the asylum law, the most permissive in Europe. **********[ Germany signed an agreement with Romania on Sept. 24 that is expected to lead to the deportation of thousands of Romanians from Germany, an action that the Government presented as a step toward ending the violence against foreigners. ] **********No one expects, however, that these steps will put an end to the violence any time soon. Even if every foreigner in Germany were to disappear overnight, youth workers say, some new group of victims would be found. A Well-Defined Path **********\"You have to understand the background of this problem,\" said Tobias Kogge, youth services director here.  \"In the old East Germany, kids had a path clearly laid out for them. They went to school, they were given a career, they were trained and then they went to work. Living conditions weren't great, but everyone had what amounted to full social protection.\" **********\"The unification process has been compressed into too short a time, and these kids suddenly see themselves without anything.\" \"Kids feel disoriented and overwhelmed. They develop feelings of hatred. In moments of social crisis, people look for someone to blame. Foreigners are the most convenient target.\" **********Adding to the alienation these young people feel is the stark, claustrophobic ugliness of their surroundings. Many rightist groups in Chemnitz are based in and around Fritz-Heckert-Gebiet, a dense concentration of towering apartment buildings built in the 1960's and '70s. Grim complexes like this are home to many of the angry rioters in Rostock and other communities, and no one here is surprised that one of the best-known extremist groups in Chemnitz calls itself Heckert SS. **********Though 85,000 people live in the Heckert complex, including about 17,000 young people, there is not a single gym, cinema, theater, library or sports field. Through the efforts of Mr. Kogge and others, six small youth clubs have been kept open. **********Outside of a youth club, a handful of young people gathered on a recent afternoon. Two were recognized neo-Nazi leaders who wore iron cross emblems and patches proclaiming, \"I'm Proud to be German.\" The others were admiring followers. Emphasis on Work **********\"Gassing Jews is not what we're interested in, but Hitler had some good ideas,\" said one of the leaders. Asked which of Hitler's ideas were good, everyone quickly shouted the same answer: work. Under the Nazi regime, they said, there were jobs for all. **********\"There was something else, too,\" said one leader. \"In the Hitler era, Germany was something good, something clean, something big and powerful. Now we're covered with dirt.\" **********Although several members of the group were drinking or already inebriated, they railed against drug use, and one said he was prepared to kill anyone he found smoking hashish. Youth workers said that hashish, like long hair, , is taken here as a symbol of leftist sympathy, while alcohol is considered a manly, proletarian intoxicant. Ready to Fight **********All said they were ready for violence, not only against foreigners but against anyone they perceive as unclean. **********\"We are at the very bottom of the ladder,\" complained one youth. \"We get nothing, and the foreigners get clothes, apartments, money and everything. Something is very wrong in Germany. We're going to fix it.\" **********Years of Communist education, which stressed the values of brotherhood and inter-cultural solidarity, evidently made little or no impression on these young people. Several said they had viewed the entire Communist system as hypocritical, though they had feared the Stasi, the Communist secret police. **********\"Before, anyone who beat up foreigners was grabbed by the Stasi and thrown in jail,\" said one. \"Now it's almost legal. Most of the police are rightists, and they don't do much to stop us.\" **********At a club here where leftists and environmentalists gather, one long-haired musician said rightist thugs were a constant threat. **********\"This is no small group,\" the musician said. \"I'm scared even to walk through the city. The worst thing is that some of the most violent ones are very young, between 10 and 14.\" **********Stefan Schonherr, a Chemnitz youth worker, said he worries that Chemnitz may soon see serious outbreaks of violence against foreigners. **********\"We don't have the situation in hand,\" Mr. Schonherr lamented at the end of a day's work. \"We don't even have a strategy for dealing with it.

He said they gave his trucks full protection. **********\"It's good for the people of Mogadishu to see that the marines are doing a humanitarian job,\" the relief official said. \"And as for the humanitarian agencies, we ask the military for an escort, and we are pushing on an open door. No resistance.\" **********The American-led intervention in Somalia demands something unusual -- the cooperation of a big armed force drilled with precise operational instructions with a couple of dozen philanthropic agencies, many of which have questioned the value of the troops, considering them an intrusion. **********For these soldiers and marines to effectively reach the starving Somalis, they need the veteran civilian field workers as intermediaries. Blending Cultures **********\"The military is here as facilitators and supporters of the relief agencies,\" said Col. Kevin Kennedy, who is the intervention force's chief liaison with the relief agencies. \"We're trying to meld the relief cultures and the military cultures. They are not the same, but it can work.\" **********A respect, one not yet scarred by too much skepticism, appears to have developed between military and relief officials in their week of contacts. **********\"One good thing about the military is that they are clear-minded and operational,\" said Charles Petrie, a United Nations official. **********Every morning for the last week, relief workers, mostly young men and women in rumpled hot-weather clothes, and marines in fatigue uniforms have met around a long table on the open-air second floor of the United Nations office in the southern sector of Mogadishu. **********It is there that the agencies have asked for help: military escorts, forklifts, radio frequencies, and in one case, engineering assistance with pumps. On Sunday, at the request of the United Nations World Food Program, the military is to accompany a convoy of trucks from Mogadishu to the inland center of Baidoa, in the heart of the famine area. **********But these logistics are the easier part of trying to save the lives of more than a million Somalis in need of food. The difficult matter of how to get food to the people who need it most, as opposed to those who are strong enough to steal it, has yet to be resolved, relief workers say. **********\"The American military says, 'We will escort your food to Baidoa,' but that's not the main problem,\" said Geoff Loane, relief director for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Somalia, the biggest provider of food. Mr. Loane attends the meetings, but does not himself work with the military. **********\"How is the food going to be distributed to the outlying villages?\" he asked rhetorically. \"A 19-year-old marine in every village?\" Relief Centers' Drawbacks **********That's hardly Colonel Kennedy's idea. \"We have six or seven tentative sites where the food will go to a metro complex,\" he said, \"then be short-hauled to where the non-government organizations have their feeding programs.\" **********But concentrating food in major centers, like Baidoa, will encourage those in the camps to stay rather than to return to villages, where they might grow crops, relief workers said. **********Moreover, satisfactory methods of distributing the food in the interior have yet to be worked out. In the past, when United Nations food was sent to towns and villages, it was handed over to Somali relief committees who were supposed to divide it fairly among the neediest recipients. **********But many of these local committees are corrupt, clan-based organizations that took the food for themselves, depriving the weakest. United Nations officials have declared the committees a failure, but have not come up with new ideas. **********James Kunder, a senior official in Washington's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, who is Colonel Kennedy's civilian counterpart working with the relief agencies, acknowledged that ways had to be found to bypass those Somalis who are dishonest. **********\"It is critical to get all Somalis involved,\" Mr. Kunder said. \"There is a tremendous reservoir of talent that's had to keep its head down in the past two years.\" **********Many of the agencies say that while a military emphasis on food convoys is a necessary first step, other actions have to be taken almost simultaneously. **********The first good rain in several years fell recently, and for those who were able to plant a few seeds, harvest time will soon approach. But in most places, there are not enough people in the villages who are strong enough to gather the crops, said Rhodri Wynne-Pope, the director here for CARE. Lack Physical Strength **********Some villagers who were living in the camps went home to plant seeds several months ago, but returned to the camps because they did not have enough food to eat while they cultivated their crops. **********\"We need to air-drop to attract people back to their villages,\" said Mr. Wynne-Pope, adding that he hoped the Americans would agree to this. Another way in which the military could be helpful, he said, would be to clear mines from roads around Bardera in the southwest. **********But getting people back to their villages was even more complicated than providing food, Mr. Loane of the International Red Cross said. Rebuilding herds of camels and cattle lost during warfare of the last two years, he said, was critical to Somalia's recovery. **********\"There are thousands of people in Mogadishu who have no livestock, but let's not be too simplistic,\" Mr. Loane cautioned. \"People can't just go home like that because there is no home to go home to.\" **********Potentially, one of the vital agencies working in Somalia is the United Nations Children's Fund, which provides vaccine to immunize children under the age of 5. It is Unicef's usual practice to rely on Health Ministry workers from the country being assisted to give the inoculations. **********But there is no functioning Health Ministry in Somalia now and how the American military might assist Unicef with the inoculations is not clear, a Unicef worker said. **********It would be a step forward, the Unicef aide suggested, if the military brought in civilian reservists to participate in immunization programs, as they did in the Kurdish region of Iraq last year. **********Colonel Kennedy, after a week of meetings with aid workers, said he was open to suggestions.

But many experts said the ruble's decline had further weakened faith in the Russian currency and attributed the decline to the Government's relaxation of efforts to adhere to a strict monetary policy. **********An expansion of credits to ailing state industries is considered one of the main reasons for the surge in the inflation rate, although Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar maintains he has been able to keep the appetites of the so-called \"industrialists\" in check. Lull in July and August **********After a spring of monthly inflation rates of 15 percent or more, the economy cooled down in July and August, with the inflation rate dropping to about 10 percent a month, said Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist who has served as an adviser to the Russian Government. **********The lull in July and August was in part a result of lower food prices in the summertime and of the Russian habit of retreating to the countryside, where this year vacationing families were busier than ever cultivating vegetable plots so they could set aside reserves for the winter. **********But in the same two months, Mr. Aslund said, wages rose between 34 and 38 percent, producing a temporary buildup in unspent money. **********\"This means Russia has a formidable inflation bomb,\" said Mr. Aslund, director of the East Economic Institute in Stockholm. \"Inflation is likely to go up two, three times, or to 20 to 30 percent in September.\" **********Inflationary expectations seem to be driving Russia's topsy-turvy markets, with factories withholding goods in anticipation of further price increases and customers quickly buying up what they can. **********Furniture and household appliances, which had reappeared in the stores after the sudden jump in prices earlier this year, are again hard to find. Rumors of another increase in gasoline and energy prices have produced long lines at gas stations. Bank Chief Defends Policy **********The newly named head of the Russian central bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, has been a key figure in the battles over monetary policy. In interviews this week, he staunchly defended his policies for extending credit and attacked the Government for failing to anticipate the needs of state industry. **********It has been clear for about a month that the Government's top economic ministers are evenly split between those original members of Mr. Gaidar's team who favor a tight anti-inflationary policy, and those appointees who share the industrial lobby's anxieties about falling production and rising unemployment. **********Mr. Gerashchenko, an experienced banker who developed international credentials during the Soviet era, argued that the drop in the value of the ruble was not only a result of anticipated inflation but of the lack of controls on foreign-currency accounts, which has allowed a steady flow of dollars out of the country. **********Earlier this summer Mr. Gerashchenko said that the central bank could no longer afford to intervene in hard-currency auctions to prop up the value of the ruble. Some critics complained that the remark only encouraged traders to dump the Russian currency. **********But the main fight has been over credits to ailing industries. Mr. Gaidar and his allies have been increasingly blunt over the last week about their displeasure with the bank's liberal credit policy, while other members of the Government who make up the so-called \"industrialist\" bloc have been supportive. The result has been a stalemate, complicating negotiations with the International Monetary Fund over the terms of a standby agreement for future credits. Goals on Ruble Set Aside **********Another round of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund is scheduled this month, but Mr. Aslund said that an agreement was unlikely until the end of the year, given the Russian Government's political challenges. And goals to stabilize the ruble and to make it convertible this year have clearly been set aside as the Government focuses on privatization, the next stage in the eight-month-old economic reform program. **********The issue of easy credit promises to linger into October, when the Congress of People's Deputies, Russia's highest legislative authority, is expected to meet and issue a strong challenge to President Boris N. Yeltsin and more particularly, Mr. Gaidar. At a news conference last month, Mr. Yeltsin predicted that October would be his roughest month. **********Some analysts predict that the Gaidar team will be forced out by the hard-line opposition to capitalist change. But others, including Mr. Aslund, expect that popular anger over the coming surge in inflation will focus not on Mr. Gaidar and his team but on the industrial lobby and Mr. Gerashchenko. **********Under Russian law, the head of the central bank is answerable not to the Government but to the Parliament, and one explanation for Mr. Gerashchenko's credits to state industries is that he hopes they will appease the conservative majority in Parliament. **********\"The myth of the state managers' competence will be blown for once and for all,\" Mr. Aslund said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/21/business/credit-markets.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 171, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;", "body_text": " **********A $296 million tax-exempt offering for the Las Vegas-McCarran International Airport is being sold to the public by Clark County, Nev., through underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. **********The tax-exempt revenue bonds for passenger operations include a 1992 series A issue, which is priced to yield a maximum 6.37 percent for a bond due in 2012 and 6.30 percent for one due in 2022.

Rather, they indicate how the once-vast economic differences between the parties have narrowed in 13 years of Tory rule and especially since Britain joined the European Monetary System in 1990. **********In the view of some in the City, the financial heart of London, the world will not necessarily end if the Labor Party is victorious. For stock pickers, this means there are fewer strictly Labor and Tory stocks. **********\"The environment will be largely unchanged under a Labor Government,\" said Mr. Walton. \"If the market were to fall back 10 to 15 percent on a Labor victory, that would be a chance to buy the market when other people are panicking. Our recommendations would be unchanged. We would just be buying them cheaper.\" **********The Conservatives and Labor are neck and neck in the polls for an election that, expected on April 9, must be held no later than July. Few think Labor can win an outright majority. But the party could rule in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives could win outright or fall short of a majority and rule in a coalition with the Ulster Unionists. The Tories are expected to include tax cuts in the new budget on Tuesday to bolster their chances. **********Mr. Walton's relatively benign view, of course, is not universal. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell 1.1 percent last week, to 2,533.1, and some attributed the drop to jitters caused by Labor's strength. The recent weak performance of utility stocks may reflect fear that a Labor Government would tighten regulation. **********A coalition Government in any form adds uncertainty, which Mr. Walton said would hurt the market. And David Roche, international strategist at Morgan Stanley in London, is certain that a Labor-led Government would damage the economy with \"interference in the operation of the market.\" For Mr. Roche, a Labor Government would cause the FT-SE 100 to plunge to 2,100 within a year. **********But many analysts, including Mr. Roche's colleagues at Morgan Stanley, are less worried. The economic forecasts at James Capel, for instance, show no significant differencewhether a Laborite or a Conservative is installed at 10 Downing Street. Forecasts from UBS, Goldman Sachs and other firms put the FT-SE 100 index at about 3,000 at year end with a Conservative Government and 2,700 to 2,800 with a Labor Government, although there could be a sharp decline on the initial news of victory. **********One reason for this view is the discipline of the European Monetary System. Labor has said it supports the system. If Labor's word is good, that means restraint on the movement of interest rates so the pound will remain in its set trading range. More important, it means no devaluation of the pound, a step some fear Labor might take to stimulate manufacturing exports and the economy. **********In picking his stocks, Mr. Brown, who is expecting a Labor-led coalition to take over the Government, looked for shares that may rally with an economic recovery in Britain this year. Then he homed in on companies that may benefit from Labor policies, like revitalizing manufacturing, as in the case of British Steel. In the case of BTR, the company would benefit because it realizes a large share of its earnings overseas, which means Labor domestic policies have less impact on earnings. **********Mr. Walton, who expects a Conservative victory, is picking stocks that should do well no matter which party wins. Regardless of the result, he believes, BTR and British Steel, which have fallen in recent months, are good bets for cyclical recovery. **********Yet, there are some stocks whose fortunes may be highly dependent on the victorious party -- for example, the utilities. If the Conservatives win, the utilities should rally. Goldman Sachs estimates some utility stocks are as much as 24 percent below their potential value with a Tory Government. **********On the Labor side, the stocks of companies that have extensive overseas earnings, like BTR, would benefit if there is a decline in the pound in reaction to a Labor victory because foreign profits will be enhanced when turned back into pounds. Among others named by Mr. Brown are Inchcape, Unilever, GKN and RTZ. **********The negative Labor stocks are leisure companies, like Ladbroke and the Rank Organisation, which depend a lot on domestic business. Retailers like GUS and Next, also would be losers because Labor is likely to raise the minimum wage. **********Conservative timing and Labor timing also differ. Those who expect a Conservative victory should buy now because the market should rally quickly. But those who expect a Labor victory should wait because Mr. Brown thinks the market could fall as much as 10 percent on the \"shock,\" providing a good buying opportunity, and then rally."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/09/business/company-news-american-dental-laser-stock-soars.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERICAN DENTAL LASER STOCK SOARS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; AMERICAN DENTAL LASER STOCK SOARS", "body_text": " **********The stock of American Dental Laser Inc. has increased more than threefold since Friday, when the company said it had received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to market its KCP 2000 cavity preparation device. **********While F.D.A. approval is a step forward for the company, analysts and traders said it did not fully explain the dramatic run in the company's stock.

In 1980, 10 percent of its long-distance market was international, he said. In 1990, it was 20 percent, and this year, it will be 23 percent, or some 1.5 billion minutes. That is the equivalent of more than 2,850 years of lucrative telephone talk, mostly to the United States. \"So we are very interested in improving this market,\" Mr. Carlos said. **********Virtual private networks are the successors to the private networks that beginning in the 1960's became the province of large corporations with the wealth to afford them and enough branch offices to provide sufficient calling volume. Without such critical mass, private networks do not warrant the expense of leasing dedicated telephone circuits from the phone company and devoting management resources to their design and supervision. **********The large volume of calls that makes a private network feasible can lead to cost savings. Among other advantages -- and the one most noticeable to users -- is abbreviated dialing. Instead of dialing 10 numbers on a long-distance call, for example, a user can dial one digit -- say, an \"8\" -- wait for a dial tone, then dial four or five more digits. A high-speed computer, searching through a data base of telephone numbers and their shorter counterparts, might recognize that 8-1234 represents a company's Los Angeles office, whose phone number is actually 213-555-1234. **********Virtual private networks, available in the United States for the last seven years or so, offer many of the same advantages, but at lower cost and with little of the technical and maintenance problems of a private network. (Still, anyone with a phone bill less than $50,000 a month might not find the service economical.) Through high-speed computers and sophisticated data bases, telephone companies can create the illusion of a private network, using their regular public-network equipment. **********The market for such virtual private networks is already huge. The Yankee Group, a market research firm in Boston, estimates that 1992 revenue to carriers like Sprint, A.T.& T. and MCI will total $2.86 billion for virtual network services. Next year's projection: $3.9 billion. **********To date, nearly all of the market is within the United States and the revenue has come from voice communications. But companies like General Electric, Olin, United Technologies and Xerox are using such networks for both voice and data communications, which can send electronic mail and computer-generated blueprints quickly across the country. **********The Gartner Group, a research firm in Stamford, Conn., expects an explosion in foreign business. By 1996, the firm sees a $12.5 billion market for voice and data, with about 30 percent of revenue generated abroad, especially in Mexico and Canada. **********Using the regular public telephone network, a business call from New York to Mexico City goes from the office's phone to a New York Telephone public line to a long-distance carrier like Sprint. Sprint then carries the call across the country and across the Mexican border to a Telmex public line in Mexico City. The telephone companies' central-office switches along the way find available circuits and route the call. **********By contrast, the traditional type of private networks employs dedicated circuits -- sophisticated versions of a string running between two tin cans (but with lots of strings and numerous pairs of cans). The number of strings in a private network increases exponentially, so that 10 offices in a private network require 45 telephone lines; 50 offices need 1,225 lines and 100 offices take 4,950 lines. Disadvantage of a Flat Rate **********Such complexity requires a great deal of equipment and a large telecommunications staff for maintenance and repair. And companies pay the same flat rate for each line -- whether they use it 24 hours a day or only a minute a day. **********As computers became cheaper and more efficient, and the software more supple and nimble, the telephone companies realized they could offer customers the advantages of a private network, including price, without the profit-killing labor costs of caring and feeding such networks. **********They could also charge by volume, albeit at an attractive price, rather than at a flat rate, making more efficient use of the public network that the telephone companies had spent billions of dollars to build.  Cutting Down on Dialing **********In a virtual private network, a company employee can still enjoy abbreviated dialing. But instead of the call going over lines the company has leased purely for its use, the call goes mainly over public lines, guided by sophisticated computers. **********In Mexico, providing virtual private networks will be a little more complicated. For such networks to perform properly, Mexico must improve its creaky telephone system, a task Telmex has pledged to do in a series of huge modernization programs. An $8 billion project that comes to a close next year involves, among other things, installing modern telephone switching computers in some 2,000 central offices serving 10,000 cities and towns."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/30/business/retailers-climb-tiffany-soars.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-12-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Retailers Climb; Tiffany Soars", "print_headline": "Retailers Climb; Tiffany Soars", "body_text": " **********Retailers' sales and stock prices are springing back even as analysts wonder how long the trend will last. **********Johnson Redbook, an industry service, said yesterday that sales had jumped 10.4 percent this month, compared with December of last year. **********Among the bargain seekers are investors who have been snapping up shares of retailers that were scorned until recently.

Polski, director of the F.A.A.'s Aviation Security Research and Development Service in Atlantic City. **********\"Our major concern in making the luggage containers stronger was that we'd increase the weight of the aircraft,\" said Mr. Polski. \"But we're finding out with the use of new materials we can substantially increase the strength of the containers without substantially increasing the weight.\" **********Mr. Polski said the luggage containers now used on airlines -- which sit on runways in all sorts of weather and repeatedly get picked up and dropped by airport forklifts -- wear out in two to four years. \"The newer, stronger containers can last longer,\" said Mr. Polski. Moreover, \"Since these containers are replaced anyway, the F.A.A. could work a plan to accommodate the attrition rate.\" **********The effectiveness of new containers \"is still being determined, which is the major factor in recommending the project to the airlines,\" Mr. Polski added. **********Of course, the best way to eliminate the problem of a terrorist bomb is to keep explosives from getting aboard the plane. Currently, airports' devices can generally detect explosives weighing about three pounds or more. A search of personal belongings is geared to catch anything that weighs less. But as shown in the Pan Am Lockerbie case and several others, this method is not infallible. **********The hardened containers will ultimately be tested with explosives weighing up to three pounds. **********\"If the airports can detect over three pounds of explosives and we can contain under three pounds, we're looking at bombproof skies,\" said Len Filppu, corporate communications spokesman at SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif., a research firm that is developing bomb-resistant luggage containers. **********Officials at the F.A.A. said that for practicality, hardened luggage containers should be lightweight, inexpensive to buy and maintain, and convenient for routine handling. **********Central to the SRI International design is a half-inch-thick blanket made of a composite of high-strength nylon, glass or Kevlar fibers. A luggage container would be built with a lining containing this blanket, which SRI calls a blast mitigation blanket, and foam. It would look very similar to the containers now used. **********\"The main three problems in a bomb explosion are the gases from the explosion, the fragments from the blast and the fire that results from the explosion,\" said Mohsen Sanai, associate director of SRI'S Poulter Laboratory for explosive research. **********According to SRI, the blanket would be strong enough to contain debris and fragments thrown outward by the explosion and prevent them from damaging the aircraft. For example, when hurtled through the air by explosive gases, small items in a suitcase such as an electric shaver or a blow dryer become shrapnel, capable of rupturing a plane's shell and of cutting vital hydraulic or electrical lines. Several holes in the aircraft, and/or the loss of critical control cables, could cause the plane to fall out of the sky. **********An explosion also generates shock waves and high-pressure gases. The blanket would contain the shock waves and be porous to the gases, allowing them to seep out. The pressure inside the luggage compartment would rise, but only slowly, thus preventing failure of the aircraft shell. **********To prevent fire, the hardened luggage container includes features that release fire-extinguishing powder in the container when the pressure exceeds a certain level. **********According to Mr. Sanai, SRI's luggage containers could ultimately last longer than existing aluminum containers and weigh even less. However, the new containers would probably cost about $3,000, he said, compared with roughly $1,500 for today's aluminum containers. **********SRI has been testing the mitigation blankets outside containers at quarter-scale and said it believed it could have its product ready within a year if it were to receive funding from the Government or airlines for full-scale testing. **********Another design, a joint venture of Omega Engineering in Fort Worth and Q-Systems International Inc. in Arlington, Tex., involves a container that would use the force of the rapidly expanding gas from the explosion to cut a hole in the side of the plane, allowing the pressurized gas to be vented outside. **********\"Our term is gas management,\" said W. Craig Willan, president of Omega Engineering, an aerospace-engineering and consulting firm. \"Rather than trying to contain the explosive blast pressures of a bomb, we channel it overboard.\" According to Omega, this process prevents a fire from breaking out after the blast. **********In Omega's plan, the doors on the luggage container are smaller than the walls of the container and would be contoured to fit the fuselage wall. The opening of the container would be next to the outer skin of the plane, and the wall facing outward would be weaker than the rest of the container. **********Metallic cutter edges are installed around the perimeter of the doors. The door latches are mechanical fusesthat break when the difference between the internal and external pressures on the container reaches a specific point. This is a key element of the concept. If the doors open too soon, there may not be enough pressure inside to cut through the aircraft's pressure hull. If the container's door latches open too late, the internal pressure may be so high that it tends to blast the container back from the fuselage, thus providing no hole for venting. **********When the bomb goes off and the latch breaks, the doors open, and as they do, the cutters produce a precise hole in the fuselage. \"Passengers aboard the airplane will know a bomb went off and will be frightened, but at least they will be able to fly to safety,\" said Mr. Willan. **********Mr. Willan said that Omega's containers might cost more than existing containers but that he expected them to last up to three times as long. **********According to Mr. Willan, Federal regulations require that an aircraft's hull be designed to withstand a hole of up to 25.3 square feet. \"Our project will produce a hole significantly less than that size,\" he said. Quarter-scale model testing has been done, and a test using a half-scale model is expected to be completed in three weeks. **********In addition to watching the SRI and Omega ventures, the F.A.A. has contracted with Jaycor, an engineering research and development firm in San Diego to design bombproof luggage containers. \"We have a redesign of the luggage carrier itself that enables us to strengthen the carrier and contain the explosion within the container,\" said James Stuh Miller, a vice president at Jaycor. **********Dr. Miller said the container is made of an advanced composite designed to contain the explosion without greatly increasing the container's weight. Full-scale testing was performed last week at a site in Vicksburg, Miss., and Dr. Miller said it was \"very encouraging.\" **********He added that the F.A.A. and Jaycor are determined to get a new container into the market soon. Officials at the F.A.A. said bomb-resistant luggage containers could be used on wide-body planes within two years. **********Much further out on the horizon, the F.A.A. is examining the idea of hardening an entire aircraft. This approach would entail replacing existing planes and would cost billions of dollars. Airlines and aircraft makers could be expected to resist designs that would add to the weight of a plane.

The industry was sanguine about the funds last year, when they gained an average of 74 percent, and a handful of new health care funds -- Franklin Global Health, Dean Witter Health Sciences, Govett Global Health Care and Merrill Lynch Healthcare (spun off from its old Science and Technology Fund) -- started up in 1992. **********Given the sector's strength over the last three years, is 1992's retrenchment enough?  And what impact will the Clinton Administration have, in light of the President-elect's promises of affordable health care? **********Managers of the funds blame a trio of ills for the group's 1992 performance: a big spike in health care stocks at the end of 1991 as the market surged broadly on lower interest rates; a market preference for cyclical growth companies, which tend to do better than stable growth companies as the economy moves out of recession, and what Cheryl Alexander, who manages the $975 million Putnam Health Sciences Trust, in Boston, calls \"fear of the election\" -- concerns that a new Administration would make changes that would hurt the health care sector. **********Going forward, however, managers find the group more attractive. Valuations for health care companies, they note, are the lowest in 30 years as stock prices have fallen and earnings growth rates risen. So many opportunities abound that the $200 million Oppenheimer Global Bio-Tech Fund reopened to new investors in October. **********As for the election, the managers differ on what changes might be made, but agree change is needed. \"There's too much waste, parallel ways of delivering health care and idiosyncrasies to be corrected,\" said Edward P. Owens, who manages the $600 million Vanguard Specialized Health Care Fund. **********While Mr. Clinton promised to introduce health care legislation in the first 100 days, many managers believe he now thinks change should be slower. Health care spending accounts for roughly 13 percent of gross national product, and \"to do something dramatic to something that accounts for that big a piece of the economy will be difficult, particularly in the middle of a recession,\" said Charles Mangum, who manages the $800 milllion Fidelity Select Health Care Fund. **********John Kaweske, who manages the $812 million Financial Portfolios Strategic Health Sciences Fund, has bet heavily on managed care, a concept much talked about in Washington. Managed care is personified by health maintenance organizations, of which he owns a fistful, including US Healthcare, United Healthcare, Qual-Med, Healthsource and Takecare. These and other companies delivering health care account for 30 percent of his fund. Twenty percent is in generic drug makers -- like Mylen and Zenith Labs -- because of their focus on cost containment. **********As for harnessing inflated drug costs, price increases have already fallen from triple the rise in the consumer price index to 1.5 times the index, says Ms. Alexander, of Putnam.  Even given legislation to fine-tune drug pricing through Medicaid rebates or deductibility of marketing expenses, \"Clinton's timing is providential in that he can make only minor changes and still claim victory,\" she said. **********Roughly one-third of Ms. Alexander's portfolio is invested in drug companies, and she has been adding lately. Her top five holdings are companies with new products plus experience with flat pricing: Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Smithkline Beecham, Abbott Labs and American Home Products. **********Sandra Panem, associate manager of the Oppenheimer fund, which invests solely in biotechnology companies, said \"the package of new incentives that the new Administration is looking at, especially investment tax credits and capital gains relief, would benefit the types of entrepreneurial companies that characterize this sector.\" She sees broad opportunities in biotech and has been buying Amylin and Alteon, two companies developing new approaches to treating diabetes. **********Edward Owens of Vanguard has taken a small new position in the drug store industry because earnings have been stable and because he believes \"the Phar-Mor bankruptcy would benefit the remaining players in a modest way.\" His five largest holdings are Beckman Instruments, Pfizer, Imcera, Bristol-Myers and Ciba-Geigy. **********About half of Fidelity Select Health Care is invested in drug stocks, says Mr. Mangum.

The moves included a statement on Friday by President-elect Bill Clinton saying that he favored action \"to turn up the heat a little\" in Bosnia. Mr. Clinton said that these measures should include action to enforce a United Nations ban on Serbian flights in Bosnia, which has been frequently violated by Serbian aircraft, including military helicopters. **********European Community leaders, meeting in Edinburgh today, strongly condemned the Serbian authorities in Belgrade and Serbian forces in Bosnia, and threatened further sanctions. **********Contingency plans for military intervention were reviewed on Friday at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels that was attended by the United States Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney.

U.N. Commanders Favor Action **********Those favoring Western military action include several of the top United Nations commanders in Bosnia, who previously opposed going beyond a Security Council mandate that empowers the United Nations force to fire only if fired upon while attempting to complete its task of delivering food, clothing and medical supplies. The United Nations' commander in Sarajevo, Brig. Gen. Hussein Ali Abdel Razek of Egypt, said last week that the United Nations operation had \"completely failed\" and that only Western military action could save Bosnians from Serbian attacks. **********At a news conference in Sarajevo today, the overall United Nations commander in Bosnia, Maj. Gen. Philippe Morillon of France, appeared to share the Egyptian general's views. General Morillon, who has been a staunch opponent of any direct military action against the Serbian forces, said that recent Serbian attacks on Sarajevo, which have included some of the heaviest shelling of civilian targets since the siege began eight months ago, had not only impeded United Nations relief efforts but had also added \"lots of mindless additional destruction.\" **********As General Morillon spoke, the windows of his headquarters in Sarajevo were shaken by the impact of Serbian shells.

But such technology, which would enable a user to jot a note to a colleague and send it via radio waves over the telephone network, will depend on network capabilities not expected to be widely available before the mid-90's. Limited Applications **********Other pen-based manufacturers have scaled back their expectations, saying that pen computing will ultimately be significant, but for the next few years it will be used only in specific applications like routine data-entry tasks performed in the field. **********Today, for example, I.B.M.'s personal computing division announced that it had begun wider availability of its Thinkpad 700T pen-based tablet computer, introduced in April. But company executives acknowledged that to date only \"hundreds\" of the machines have been sold. And they said that for the immediate future sales would probably be restricted to customer-specific applications. **********\"We don't see pencentric computing as being a ubiquitous horizontal market at this time,\" said Bruce Claflin, the general manager for the I.B.M.

It subsequently lowered it once more to the current projection of 77,000. Momenta's Downfall **********The market for pen computing was significantly set back in August when Momenta, which had consumed more than $40 million in venture capital, sought bankruptcy protection after its $5,000 product, which could use both pen and keyboard, met with virtually no interest. **********Analysts said that the Momenta machine failed because it was large, bulky and expensive, required one-of-a-kind software and had difficulty recognizing many users' penstrokes. **********Underlying the disappointment surrounding pen computing is the backdrop of meteoric growth in personal computing in the 1980's. **********Currently, in a computer industry's version of a search for the Holy Grail, executives and engineers refer reverently to the \"killer app,\" the application that would compel people to buy a new type of system -- just as the Visicalc spreadsheet, the Compaq portable computer and the Aldus desktop publishing program, each spawned a hot new industry segment in the 1980's. **********The mystery is that nobody is quite sure what the killer app will be and when it will arrive.

With charges and countercharges flying across the Atlantic, the nerves of airline executives are wearing thin. **********Last month, for example, Sir Colin made what he thought was an obvious remark to reporters that his airline's plans to buy a stake in USAir would not be completed if the United States demanded that the highly restricted Heathrow airport in London be opened more to American carriers. **********He said that there was room for compromise on this issue and that there were \"in-between positions, and certainly there is no reason why our respective Governments cannot agree on the achievement of those objectives.\" **********But in the highly polarized atmosphere created by the British Airways proposal to pay $750 million for a 44 percent stake in USAir, sparks flew. **********Within hours of his remark, Sir Colin was denounced by Stephen M.

That is the date the Transportation Department has set for action on the proposal. All sides have already filed their arguments and have until Dec. 11 to file responses to each other. **********To Sir Colin, a medium-sized man with light brown hair and an easy, jocular mannner, the fact that the Federal agency has set a deadline for comment bodes well, since Transportation Secretary Andrew H.

He has also sought what are called beyond rights, or the ability of American carriers to fly beyond major hubs like London. **********All four major United States carriers have said that they will go along with the British Airways investment in USAir if they get reciprocal rights. Sir Colin argues that his airline's deal should not be linked to granting United States carriers more rights in Britain. He said the proposal conformed to American laws and should be decided on its merits. **********Once the deal is made, he argues, Britain is prepared to negotiate a much greater liberalization over the next year, a process that will take time, since Congress and the Clinton Administration would have to approve the new terms.

Muss, a developer based in Forest Hills, Queens, to Liberty in 1986. He has wanted since then to build a vacation-home community on grounds surrounding the fabled hotel, which closed in 1986, and its golf course. **********It has been a struggle, and it still is. But on Monday the struggle got a new lease on life -- a six-month extension on approvals given by the Liberty town planning board to Mr. Muss's Grossinger Development Corporation to build the first 165 units in what could potentially be a development of 1,000 units. **********The corporation has leased about 640 acres of the 907-acre hotel property for the project, which is in Sullivan County, 90 miles northwest of New York City. The approvals for the 165 units were granted in 1987. **********The Muss Development Company has been a major producer of housing in New York City for many years, and it is trying to develop a hotel in downtown Brooklyn. **********In Liberty, the obstacles grow out of a bankruptcy filed in December 1989 by Grossinger's Associates, an investment group that purchased the hotel and land from the Grossinger family in 1985, a few months before the closing. The principals of the group, a New York limited partnership, are Larry Frenkel and Hotels International Inc. **********Major renovations had been planned. Work on a new dining room and lobby and a new convention center began in 1986, but dragged on through 1989. By that time the economy had soured and Lloyds Bank and the Hokkaido Bank, which had lent Grossinger's Associates $30 million, withdrew their financing. **********The Muss group had its own financing, but because it had leased its land from Grossinger's Associates, the bankruptcy action halted the residential development as well. **********The matter is now before the Federal Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, which must determine whether the land-lease contract can be terminated and the property sold free and clear of the lease. Claims by creditors against Grossinger's Associates, a matter not involving the Muss group, exceed $40 million. **********Barbara Balaber-Strauss, the court-appointed trustee, said she was negotiating with a potential buyer for the hotel property, including the portion leased to Muss. She declined to disclose the asking price. Regarding the Muss lease, she would only say, \"We have litigation pending in court that will clear any clouds or liens.\" **********The Muss concept, as originally envisioned, was that homeowners would be able to use all the amenities of the refurbished hotel and its 27-hole golf course. The hotel, in turn, would benefit from hundreds of permanent year-round residents. **********Under the land-lease arrangement, Grossinger's Associates would transfer land ownership to home buyers as each house was sold. The development was to be a mix of town houses and single-family dwellings, starting in price at $150,000. Plans also included apartments. **********When he built 11 model houses in 1988, Mr. Muss said, there were 3,000 names on a waiting list. But problems with public water hookup suspended sales for a year. By the time the matter was resolved, Grossinger's Associates was in bankruptcy. **********Today, the welcome sign is still out at the entrance to Grossinger's, but a guard bars visitors. Only the golf course, leased to a private operator, is open. **********\"While all the guns are thundering, everyone is losing,\" said Richard M. Liebman, a Rockville Centre L.I., lawyer who with his brother, Jerome, represents four contractors holding mechanics' liens totaling approximately $1 million. **********Many lien holders have themselves been forced into bankruptcies because of unpaid bills. Their liens are subordinate to bank liens of approximately $25 million. The Liebmans contend that their clients can attach their liens to the unimproved land leased to Mr. Muss, over which the banks hold no mortgage. That claim is adding additional complications to any settlement. **********The value of Grossinger's, eroded by recession and the passing of time, is also a matter of contention. Its assessed value on the town's newly updated assessment roll is $17.33 million. But Gene L. Barbanti, a former town planning board chairman and a real estate broker and appraiser, said that was much too high. A sale will settle the issue. **********Town residents, who saw 500 jobs vanish with the closing of Grossinger's, still have faith in its rebirth, if for no reason beyond nostalgia. \"Everyone in the world has heard of Grossinger's,\" said the town supervisor, Jack I. Simons. **********Many hope for a renewal of the plan for a hotel tied in with second homes. The vacation-home market will soon rebound, Mr. Muss predicts. \"It is my hope and my sense that this development will still come about,\" he said. \"The property is still beautiful, and the concept is still terrific.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/18/business/your-taxes-irs-is-auditing-sport-federations.html": {"writer_name": "John Cushman", "pub_date": "1992-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 714, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Your Taxes; I.R.S.

According to Sponsorship Opportunities Inc., a marketing group that promotes corporate sponsorships for a variety of events, several sports federations are being audited by the I.R.S., including those for water skiing, soccer, squash and volleyball. So are the sponsors of the Mobil Cotton Bowl and the John Hancock Bowl, two college football games. **********John Hewitt, the controller of the gymnastics federation, says it will earn $67,500 this year from Phar-Mor Inc., a drug retailer, in exchange for the use of the company's name during the championships, which are to be broadcast by ABC. **********But two years ago the I.R.S. declared that much sponsorship income was really a payment for advertising. Last year the agency audited the gymnastics federation and said it might owe taxes on the $1.4 million it earned in 1988 from corporate sponsors. **********A change in the rules, Mr. Hewitt said, \"would have a crippling effect.\" Nearly half the federation's annual budget of $8 million comes from dues, and it has no cash reserve to pay taxes, at the 34 percent corporate rate, of around a million dollars on several years' income. **********The federation, set up under the 1978 Amateur Sports Act as a nonprofit body, selects and trains teams for international competitions including the Olympics, and generally promotes gymnastic activities. **********The I.R.S. holds that some sponsorships remain tax-free, as when a public television station acknowledges the sponsor of its news program, or a performing arts group acknowledges a contributor in the program for a performance. **********But extensive promotion, such as that involving on-camera signs or uniform patches at sports events, may be another matter. So many organizations have already filed comments on the proposed rules that the I.R.S. is considering holding a public hearing.

As the new system expands, airports expect it to provide them up to $1 billion a year. **********But where there's a tax, there seems always to be a potential loophole. The airlines and airports are arguing over whether millions of passengers who fly on free frequent-flier coupons every year should be tithed. **********According to the airlines, the law calls for the tax to be collected from \"paying passengers.\" But the F.A.A. regulations call for the tax to be collected from \"passengers emplaned,\" including those who earned their tickets through the popular incentive programs. **********The airports want the regulations left unchanged. The airlines would hew to the law as written.  Fringe Benefits Eyed **********Full taxation of fringe benefits such as health insurance, pension savings, and the like would both raise substantial tax revenues and go a long way toward improving tax equity, the General Accounting Office has said in a new study. **********But it might also increase pressure on the Government to provide retirement income and health insurance directly. **********Except for pensions, policy on fringe benefits has not changed much in 10 years, said the 112-page report, \"Tax Policy: Effects of Changing the Tax Treatment of Fringe Benefits.\" **********But the amount of tax revenues forgone has increased steadily from $9 billion in 1975 to more than $91 billion this year.

But apart from the United States, none could say how much each was donating, and one accounting suggested that about $4 billion was in the form of only a vague promise to provide the aid \"if it is needed.\" **********The $24 billion figure used by President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany on Wednesday sprang from a hurried exercise in political and financial expediency. It is not clear how much Mr. Bush's involvement was driven by Gov. Bill Clinton's plans to speak on the same subject on Wednesday, although Mr. Bush juggled his schedule to make the announcement in the morning, minutes before the Democratic Presidential candidate spoke in New York. Gain but No Pain **********What is clear is that the aim was to allow Mr. Bush and leaders of the other countries to claim some gain and show that the industrial giants were seizing the moment to spur democracy in Russia -- without asking their taxpayers to spend any more cash in tough political and economic times at home. **********Despite those political calculations, the proposal became ensnared in American politics today. House Democratic leaders indicated that they might link approval for any new money for Russia to White House support for a permanent extension of unemployment benefits and Mr. Bush's Republican rival, Patrick J. Buchanan, broke an informal political cease-fire to denounce the aid package. **********But three former presidents, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon, lent Mr. Bush their backing in a letter to the House Speaker, Thomas S.  Foley, that urged passage of the $12 billion increase that Mr. Bush is seeking in the American contribution to the International Monetary Fund as part of the aid program. **********According to figures issued by the United States Government, many of them contradictory, and interviews with American and European officials, here is where the $24 billion figure came from: **********The Group of Seven nations agreed among themselves to create a $6 billion fund to maintain the value of the ruble while it is being turned into a convertible currency. The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, settled on an estimate that Russia would need $18 billion in aid this year. Deferring Loan Payments **********So the industrial nations needed to produce $24 billion in aid. They agreed that the I.M.F. and other lending institutions would lend Russia $4.5 billion. Those countries that lent money to the Soviet Union before Jan. 1, 1991, which does not include the United States, would defer $2.5 billion in payments. **********That is where the clarity ends. What was left was $11 billion, which none of the countries could politically or economically produce as new outlays of cash. So the Treasury Department added up all existing aid programs from the Group of Seven and projections of further likely assistance, and came up with $11 billion. **********American and European officials stressed that these were real programs that help the Soviet economy, but they could not produce anything like a complete accounting of where it was coming from. Even American Government agencies could not agree among themselves about their contribution, mostly in credits for Russia to buy American products. The Treasury Department said it was $2 billion; the State Department said it was $2.6 billion. Hedging a Commitment **********Germany appears to be listing $3 billion in export credits, Canada some part of $1.5 billion in export credits announced last year and Japan an unspecified part of $2.5 billion in credits announced last year. Britain's share is about $700 million. Contributions from Italy and France were unknown. **********Two European diplomats said that actual totals amounted to $7 billion and that the Group of Seven had agreed in principle to provide the $4 billion more later, if it is needed -- and the group is hopeful that it will not be. **********Although at least one of the countries involved, Japan, seemed irked at the way the aid package was unveiled in Bonn and in Washington on Wednesday, virtually everyone got something. **********Mr. Bush was able to make a grand gesture of executive authority at an important time in his Presidency, when he is struggling to seize control of the 1992 election campaign and to demonstrate that he is still the senior partner in the Western coalition. An Opportunity for Bush **********In return, he ended months of hesitancy over aid to Russia and promised to ask Congress for a major increase in the American donation to the I.M.F., for which Britain and Germany had long been clamoring. **********Prime Minister John Major of Britain, who had been representing Russia before the I.M.F., announced today that he had \"taken the lead\" in putting together the aid program. **********Mr. Kohl was able to present the package as an example of Germany's leadership by using his time-zone advantage to make the announcement before Mr. Bush. And the German Government, which has given far more cash to the former Soviet Union than any other country, did not have to give any more. **********Neither did the other countries. But Mr. Bush did ask Congress to increase the I.M.F. contribution."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/17/business/february-trade-gap-narrowed.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1992-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 661, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "February Trade Gap Narrowed", "print_headline": "February Trade Gap Narrowed", "body_text": " **********The nation's merchandise trade deficit narrowed sharply to $3.38 billion in February, with exports reaching a record and imports falling slightly. **********The deficit, smaller than most economists expected, gladdened Administration officials, who are looking for an election-year bonus in export sales to help lead the nation into recovery. **********Over all, exports rose 6.8 percent in February, to $37.81 billion, from $35.41 billion in January. Imports fell four-tenths of 1 percent, to $41.20 billion from $41.36 billion. **********Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, pointed out that if the rest of the year followed the pattern of January and February together, then this year's trade deficit could total as little as $56 billion, down from $66.26 billion last year. But many private sector economists predict that the trade deficit will actually widen this year, as economic recovery in the United States draws in more imports while recessions in Japan and many European countries dampen growth in American exports. Jump in Aircraft Sales **********They noted that more than one-third of the February jump in exports came from a $909 million increase in shipments of commercial aircraft and parts. \"That may have been a one-shot deal,\" said Brian M. Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., who pointed out that aircraft worth $100 million or more apiece are often delivered in bunches. **********But Mr. Jones and other economists said that even leaving aircraft shipments aside, they were surprised by how much exports increased. **********Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley, said, \"I was looking for a $5 billion deficit, which was a little more optimistic than the consensus but hardly consistent with the sharp narrowing of the deficit.\" **********In another bit of upbeat news, the Government reported that the number of workers filing unemployment claims in early April declined significantly for the second consecutive week.  [ Page D2. ] Some Price Advantages **********February's trade deficit, which followed a gap of $5.95 billion in January, was the smallest since a $2.84 billion deficit in March 1983. Several monthly deficits in the last year have been the lowest since 1983, as the low value of the dollar and small annual cost increases for American manufacturers have erased the $100 billion-plus annual deficits of the late 1980's. **********For the last year, rapid growth in exports to third world has been offsetting stagnation in shipments to industrialized markets.

The nation imported less oil and paid 43 cents less a barrel in February than in January. **********Exports of high-technology products, including not only aircraft but sophisticated medical and telecommunications equipment, jumped to $9.2 billion from $7.9 billion. Imports of these goods edged up to $5.1 billion from $4.9 billion in January. **********Administration trade officials used the report to push their various causes. Barbara H. Franklin, the new Commerce Secretary, who is organizing a Cabinet-level review next week of Government assistance to industries, said in a statement that sustaining strong exports made it necessary \"that we intensify trade promotion efforts in partnership with the private sector.\" **********Mrs. Hills greeted the growth in exports as a sign that the United States was better off trying to open foreign markets than protecting its own market. \"They're very, very strong,\" she said. \"They continue to show how important it is to open markets.\" **********But Clyde V.

After all, the flow of a few million dollars into the hands of politicians does not usually trigger much audible dissent here. **********This time, for reasons that are as murky as the machinations of Japanese politics, the formula seems to have failed. Over the past few days, Japanese television and newspapers have begun a campaign of outrage against the man at the center of the scandal, the country's most powerful politician, Shin Kanemaru. And as public protests have grown, members of the ruling party, apparently sensing that some invisible line has been crossed that suddenly makes it permissible to attack the country's most fearsome political shogun, are starting to call openly for his resignation. **********It is far from clear that Mr. Kanemaru, 78 years old, will be forced out. He admitted more than a month ago that he had taken $4 million in illegal contributions and then negotiated a token fine that was less severe than an overnight parking ticket in parts of Tokyo. **********\"Right now we are in a tug of war,\" said Shokei Arai, one of a group of younger Liberal Democrats in the Parliament who had the temerity on Thursday to publicly call for Mr. Kanemaru's ouster -- not only as head of the largest and richest faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, but from the party itself. \"It could be that we will be the side to be crushed.\" Casting Stones Together **********What has happened here in the past few days is the flip side of Japan's usual political passivity: Once a consensus has mysteriously emerged that a prominent figure has wildly transgressed the unwritten rules, the whole nation seems willing to join in the denunciation. Like jaywalkers who glance to the left and right to make sure everyone else is stepping off the curb too, prominent Japanese are describing Mr. Kanemaru in villainous terms that few would have dared utter in public a week ago. **********It was the deal with Tokyo's prosecutors for the fine that ignited the outrage, along with Mr. Kanemaru's continued refusal to talk about the darkest side of the latest scandal: Evidence that he frequently used the yakuza, Japan's organized crime groups, to get unpleasant jobs done, like silencing opposition to the appointment of Noboru Takeshita as Prime Minister in 1987. **********Mr. Kanemaru's response has been silence: He has traveled from home to office in a heavily guarded convoy each day and spends a considerable amount of time playing mah-jongg with other members of the Takeshita faction, which he heads. **********Even if he resigns as the faction's head, or from his seat in Parliament, many believe Mr. Kanemaru will still pull the strings of prime ministers and politicians dependent on his clout. **********Japan has seen this pattern emerge before, Mr. Arai said. \"We should listen to the public. But scandals have emerged and been forgotten repeatedly in the past, and I cannot expect this public anger to last for a long time.\" No Political Panacea **********Nor does anyone really seem to think that Mr. Kanemaru's ouster would solve the fundamental ills of Japan's political system, in which politicians amass their power by dispensing favors in return for the huge sums of money needed to keep their political machines going. **********But even by Japanese standards, the size and nature of the \"contribution\" to Mr. Kanemaru by a mob-linked company seemed extreme. So in a country that rarely sees political activism, people are gathering under banners at Tokyo's busiest commuter stations to applaud speakers shouting \"Kanemaru yameru!\" or \"Kanemaru quit!\" **********\"I've collected signatures for petitions here for years, but this is the first time I've seen people lining up to sign,\" Fusako Iwase, an organizer of one of the protests, said on Friday. Passers-by have already dropped $10,000 into a donations box. **********\"I'm angry because I work and work and get nowhere, and this powerful politician gets away with a measly fine for a huge illegal donation,\" a young woman in a business suit said as she flipped in a 1,000 yen note -- about $8.30. \"But even if he quits, there will always be corruption in the L.D.P.\" Media Turns Up Volume **********Very little in Japan is spontaneous, though, and the outrage at this latest scandal is is no exception. For the past week Japan's newspapers and leading television networks have been turning up the volume of criticism day by day. Many journalists make no secret of the fact that they see Mr. Kanemaru's ouster as their primary objective. **********\"If we band together, we know that he will finally fall,\" one of Japan's top newscasters said the other day. Even the most conservative of the country's daily newspapers have called for his ouster; the Mainichi Shimbun referred to Mr. Kanemaru as \"the don of all dons\" and said he \"represents the core of our nation's money-tainted politics, which is eroding the very base of parliamentary democracy.\" **********Television has played a particularly vital role: An announcer on one network was urging people to send in more postcards demanding Mr. Kanemaru's resignation. A Member of Parliament who started the postcard campaign says he has already received 170,000, and he has threatened to dump them all on Mr. Kanemaru's doorstep. More importantly, leaders of the business community -- the L.D.P.'s financiers -- have called for \"kejime,\" a vague Japanese term that means \"separating\" and has been widely interpreted as a call for resignation. **********More than 100 local assemblies have passed resolutions in the last week urging Mr. Kanemaru to quit. And on Friday one of the ruling party's elder statesmen, Kenzabura Hara, formerly the speaker of the lower house, asked him to do the same. **********For a while the leading members of Mr. Kanemaru's faction attempted to defend their leader, and some still are. His heir apparent, Ichiro Ozawa, even tendered his resignation for failing to prevent Mr. Kanemaru's indictment. But as public outrage has grown, cracks are developing in the faction's facade. Now, even if they do not dare to join in the calls for his ouster, many prominent faction members are making little effort to protect him. Calls for an Explanation **********In an interview in his office on Friday Japan's former Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is often named as a likely candidate for Prime Minister, said Mr. Kanemaru had ignored his advice to explain himself fully. **********\"Do you think a resignation would end the problems?\" Mr. Hashimoto asked. \"I think Mr. Kanemaru has a responsibility to answer the questions and the doubts. We still don't know how much in the media is true, or if there is anything still hidden.\" **********Mr. Hashimoto said that he thought the \"most serious issue\" was the involvement of the yakuza in the creation of the Takeshita Administration, raising doubts about how the leadership of the country might be beholden to organized crime. His mere mention of it was unusual: Until recently, that event -- and other political connections to the mob -- were a completely taboo topic among politicians here. **********One reason that the faction members are beginning to join in the attack is that a number of the younger leaders -- in Japan, that means anywhere from age 50 to 70 -- are eager for Mr. Kanemaru to get out of the way. But the ensuing power struggle could splinter the Takeshita faction, kicking out the supports holding up the Cabinet of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Premier Chooses His Words **********For that reason, Mr. Miyazawa has kept carefully out of the fray, talking in vague and general terms about the need for political reform, but carefully saying little about Mr. Kanemaru himself. On Friday, speaking at a luncheon of businessmen, Mr. Miyazawa issued his strongest statement yet: He called the whole influence peddling scandal \"an extremely unfortunate matter.\" **********The opposition parties have been curiously muted. Some speculate that is because of a longtime friendship between Mr. Kanemaru and the head of the Socialist opposition, Makato Tanabe. But more likely, many political insiders say, the opposition parties fear that they will also be implicated if Mr. Kanemaru is forced to testify when the Parliament goes back into session at the end of the month. **********One reason so many people seem willing to join in the attack on Mr. Kanemaru, however, may be that they are secure in the knowledge that his ouster would not end the Liberal Democrats' 37-year rule. The opposition parties, in fact, seem less ready to take power than any time in recent memory. \"Criticism is easy because there is no fear of a real change,\" Robert M. Orr, director of the Institute of Pacific Rim Studies and Temple University's Japan campus, said Friday. **********\"The only time the L.D.P. gets into trouble is when it appears arrogant.\" he added. Mr. Kanemaru's problem is that people \"realize that he has been totally unaccountable,\" appointing and dismissing prime ministers to fit the party's own agenda. **********\"Japanese look around the world and they are not stupid,\" Mr. Orr said. \"They realize people power is on the move. It's just not on the move very fast here.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/14/world/despite-un-embargo-baghdad-heals-its-wounds.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1992-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 947, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Despite U.N.

The bombed-out Justice Ministry has been completely repaired. **********A year ago, Iraq was a nation without telephones after allied bombers hit every telephone exchange in the country. Today, Baghdad's telephones are ringing and a limited international service has been restored. **********A brand new building houses the main phone exchange. And on the drive down the first-class highway from Jordan, a visitor can see that the red-and-white communication towers out in the tawny desert -- each one of which was hit -- are being repaired. **********Work on the projects goes on round the clock. As a result, Baghdad by day has returned to being the bustling commercial center it has been for centuries. With gasoline plentiful and costing only a few cents a gallon, streets are perpetually snarled by traffic. **********By night, the city is a blaze of colored lights as it prepares for a national holiday on Tuesday commemorating the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958, which led to military rule and the rise to power of President Hussein and his Baath Party. **********According to the Government-controlled press, 70 percent of the damage the allies inflicted during the gulf war has now been repaired. Of the 134 bridges cut by bombs, 120 are said to be mended and functioning again. **********Even the electrical grid has been largely repaired in some areas, even though the generators were all imported and Iraq is supposed to be suffering an embargo on all imports except food and medicine. **********Just how Iraq managed all this reconstruction under the trade sanctions is unclear. The Government is giving no clues as to how much sanctions-busting was involved, though Iraq's Minister of Industry and Natural Resources, Gen. Amir Hammuda Sadi, announced on Sunday that Iraq could build its own power transformers again. Electric Power Near Normal **********However it may have been achieved, privileged parts of the country like Baghdad are said to have 90 percent of the electricity available before the war, despite direct attacks on the major generating stations. **********What has not changed since a year ago, however, is the combination of feast and famine confronting ordinary Iraqis. Baghdad's shops and markets are full of food, much of it imported from Jordan. But grocery prices are prohibitive for most ordinary people. **********The Government provides every citizen with a subsistence package of basic staples at giveaway prices and has even managed to increase the size of this handout in recent months. **********A year ago, this ration was 12 pounds of flour, 2 pounds each of rice and sugar and small quantities of tea, oil, detergents, soap and cigarettes. Now it has been raised to 16 pounds of flour, 3 pounds of rice and 2 1/2 pounds of sugar, with some meat included when it is available. **********But with no oil revenues coming in and the Government printing dinars to pay its bills, prices soared last year, making it difficult for poorer families to supplement their frugal rations from the market place. **********The United Nations World Food Program, which provides extra food free to more than a million of the poorest Iraqis, reckons that market prices have stabilized in the last three or four months. But milk still costs 31.8 dinars for a pound's worth, compared with 1.2 dinars before the war, while cheese has risen from 1 dinar to 20 dinars a portion, meat from 6 dinars to 29.8 and flour from 0.12 dinars to 3.5. **********And all this in a country where most working people earn 200 to 300 dinars a month and many pensioners receive only 50 dinars a month. U.N. Offer on Oil Sales **********All of this could change quite fast if President Hussein finally accepts the Security Council's offer to let him sell $1.6 billion worth of oil over the next six months to buy food and medicine. **********But there is also a danger that food could get scarcer yet and that Iraq's post-war rebuilding program will be slowed at the same time. This month, King Hussein of Jordan agreed under pressure from the United States to enforce the Security Council's trade embargo against Iraq more effectively. **********With its Persian Gulf ports out of commission, most of Iraq's imports come in by land from Jordan. And a year ago the frontier road was crowded with big trucks plying in both directions. Driving in on Sunday, however, the border Customs post was almost deserted and there was little traffic on the highway to Baghdad. **********Clearly less food was moving in, although food is exempt from sanctions. What remains to be seen, however, is whether Iraq will also now find itself running out of spare parts and materials needed for eradicating the remaining scars of war."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/08/world/wage-contract-ends-strikes-in-germany-s-public-sector.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1992-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 697, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wage Contract Ends Strikes In Germany's Public Sector", "print_headline": "Wage Contract Ends Strikes In Germany's Public Sector", "body_text": " **********One of the most serious labor conflicts in Germany since World War II ended today when a union representing 2.3 million public employees accepted a new Government offer. **********Under the contract, public employees will be given a 5.4 percent pay increase. Additional benefits, including one-time payments of up to $650, will be computed to favor lower-income workers. **********The union leader, Monika Wulf-Mathies, called the settlement \"a political victory\" and said she expected most public services to resume Friday. **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl could claim at least a psychological success. By showing that he was ready to resist pay demands even at the cost of a major strike, he set the tone for wage talks in the private sector. An Unusual Conflict **********Several industrial unions, including IG-Metall, the country's largest, have begun calling members away from work in preparation for possible nationwide strikes. IG-Metall is seeking a 9.5 percent wage increase, which is what the public employees had originally sought. **********In a nation where order is a cardinal virtue and where social conflicts are usually avoided at all costs, the public employees' strike was an unexpected jolt. Hundreds of thousands of union members participated, stalling trains and subways, closing clinics, kindergartens and Government offices and leaving garbage uncollected and mail undelivered. **********To show its strength, the union shut most major airports, even closing the country's principal hub, Frankfurt, for 24 hours, symbolically cutting Germany off from the world. An Important Test for Kohl **********The strike came at an awkward moment. Germany's budget is groaning under the enormous costs of rebuilding the former territory of East Germany and aiding other former Communist countries of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. **********And on the first day of the strike, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a symbol of German stability, quit the job he had held for 18 years. **********With these troubles, Mr. Kohl found his leadership suddenly in question. Some commentators portrayed his coalition Government as near collapse, and this afternoon the leader of the parliamentary opposition, Hans-Ulrich Klose, called for his resignation. **********Speaking to reporters in Berlin today before the strike settlement was announced, Mr. Kohl insisted that his Government was stable. \"The coalition was affected by unnecessary turbulence in the last 14 days,\" he conceded. \"But that is behind us now, and we are facing the work at hand.\" **********Mr. Kohl also said Germans would have to work harder and take fewer vacations if they wanted to maintain their country's strong economy. Coping With Confusion **********Union leaders had decided against calling a general strike, which would have been without precedent in post-war Germany. Instead, they called spot strikes to show their strength. **********But businesses relied on fax machines rather than the postal service, and commuters accustomed to public transportation used automobiles or bicycles. The piles of garbage would hardly have drawn a glance in some United States cities. **********Although individuals coped well with the strike, the German economy suffered. Perhaps the biggest single loser was the railway system, which says it lost $60 million. Retail sales reportedly fell 20 percent to 25 percent. **********Economists agreed that the losses were not great enough to cut seriously into Germany's economy. But some expressed concern that the strike may have effects that cannot be measured, perhaps by damaging Germany's reputation for stability and labor peace. Kohl Takes a Stand **********Because Chancellor Kohl resisted union demands for a time, he may have not only set an example for management negotiators in the private sector, but also strengthened his call for sacrifice. **********During the strike, Mr. Kohl said repeatedly that the cost of unification must be paid by everyone in the western part of the country. Leaders of the opposition Social Democratic Party complained that he was demanding more sacrifices from unions than from businesses or the rich. **********Workers in eastern Germany did not participate in the strikes because their labor unions have not yet merged with their counterparts in the west. But some easterners resented the strikers for demanding wage increases at a time when so much money is needed to rebuild the eastern part of the country."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/09/business/when-97.2-million-dial-m-for-mom.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Ramirez", "pub_date": "1992-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1433, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "When 97.2 Million Dial 'M' for Mom", "print_headline": "When 97.2 Million Dial 'M' for Mom", "body_text": " **********Starting about 7 A.M. on Mother's Day, telephones will begin jingling in a gradual sweep across the country. More Americans are expected to try to make long-distance calls on this one day than on any other holiday, putting stress on many telephone networks, but on A.T.& T.'s most of all. **********Aided by recent improvements in its call-routing computers, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company expects some 97.2 million calls to get through on its network, but many may not. Who gets to say, \"Hi, Mom,\" right away and who gets a recording that says, \"All circuits are busy now, please try your call again later,\" will depend largely on the skill and flair of William C. Leach and his crew at the A.T.& T. Network Operating Center here. **********While its rivals, the MCI Communications Corporation and the Sprint Corporation, have similar operations, A.T.& T.'s is by far the world's largest. There are two regional A.T.& T. centers -- Conyers, Ga., for the Eastern United States, and Denver for the West -- but Bedminster watches the world. **********Much like the human brain, which cannot feel pain because it has no nerve endings, the center, despite its essential role, is strangely subdued as it goes about its work. Voices are quiet, lights are low and people are tranquil. In this superego of telecommunications, even the phones have a muffled ring. **********\"Our job is to complete calls and make sure that no harm comes to the network,\" said Mr. Leach, the amiable but no-nonsense manager of the center. Near his desk, he keeps a framed picture of John Wayne in a cowboy hat. Asked why, he replied, \"Because he's my hero.\" **********A.T.& T. says that barring some disaster, for the first time this Mother's Day will be its busiest holiday of the year. The challenge, though, is not so much the number of calls, said Mr. Leach, who has been with A.T.& T. for 27 years. It is that most people tend to chat with their mothers far longer than the typical three minutes or so for a business call, crowding out callers who try to phone later. And instead of calling from big cities to other big cities, where the high-capacity telephone lines are, more people call from smaller suburbs to other suburbs, where the big phone lines are not. **********Millions of Mother's Day calls, for example, will flood into the west coast of Florida, where many retirees live in the stretch from Tampa-St. Petersburg south to Fort Myers. It is likely to be the busiest area in the country for telephone calls. But the phone computer in the town of Windermere, Fla., was not built to handle such heavy traffic. **********The peak calling period on Mother's Day is 9 A.M. to 2 P.M., and by calling before or after it, people will probably be able to avoid what A.T.& T. calls a no-circuit condition -- when there are no lines available and callers are advised to try later. That goes double for cities like Phoenix that have large numbers of elderly people. **********A new computer call-routing system adopted last year gives nearly every call a higher chance of getting through, A.T.& T. executives say. Real-time network routing, as they call it, creates a \"street smart\" computer that quickly seeks the fastest possible paths for individual calls. Circuitous Routes **********Phone calls can travel from one million to two million miles an hour as they pass through a national labyrinth of computers and telephone lines, so it does not much matter whether a call goes straight from Brattleboro, Vt., to Baton Rouge, La., or takes a detour near Seattle, where the circuits are not busy. **********Such creative zigzagging is needed to prevent even the biggest switching computers from overloading. A single such computer can occupy the equivalent of half a football field and do the hourly work of 1.6 million very efficient switchboard operators. **********At the network center, Mr. Leach's crew looks for phone calls in trouble, known as \"exceptions,\" like a burst of brief calls, indicating callers are being interrupted for some reason. Trouble, or the lack of it, is depicted on a glowing wall of 75 television screens displaying technical readouts, maps of the continental United States and the rest of the world, and Cable News Network. Moscow, Cairo, Bombay and many cities in Africa glow in red, indicating that there are not enough circuits to complete many calls into those cities. Computers Have Their Limits **********On a good day, which is almost all the time, the center can deliver nearly every call attempted. On the busiest business day last year, the Monday after Thanksgiving, A.T.& T. was able to complete 157.8 million calls and failed to complete only 211. **********Of course, computers have their limits. If congestion \"gets bad enough, the computers, in effect, go insane,\" Mr. Leach said. He smiled beatifically and added, \"We try not to let it get that far.\" **********No computer has suffered a seizure because of high traffic, but a software glitch in 1991 disrupted much of the network, and an accidental electrical breakdown that same year tangled half of A.T.& T.'s calls and all of the air traffic in New York. **********Other disasters have hurt the network. When the riots broke out in Los Angeles last week, telephone traffic into the city surged 20 percent. Mr. Leach and his crew halved the number of calls going into Southern California so that more essential traffic, like 911 emergency calls, would not get crowded out. When the earthquake hit San Francisco in 1989, the number of calls doubled, leading to a frenzied smear on the network center's television screens. Unavoidable Congestion **********Such congestion seems unavoidable with the proliferation of telephones. When telephones began to be widely used in the 1890's, there were few enough at first to be linked directly, household to household, and business to business. **********A switchboard operator would place a plug into a jack, ask the calling party whom he wanted to reach, and physically complete the connection by placing a second plug into another jack. Telephone computers are called switches because they took over the functions of switchboards. **********But to establish direct lines among 4 telephones requires 6 lines; 40 phones need 780 lines, and 400 phones take 79,800 lines. To link every household in the continental United States would require each household to have tens of millions of lines. **********By bunching large groups of telephone lines into central offices, calls can be collected and sent out somewhat like planes landing and taking off from hub airports. **********That is one reason the familiar 10-digit telephone number is actually a form of address. The area code denotes a group of central offices, the prefix pinpoints a particular central office and the last four digits specify a particular phone. **********The conveyance of telephone calls has been speeded immensely by extremely fast computers. For most of the 1980's, calls passed through the labyrinth of switches much like passengers flying from New York to San Francisco but having to land and take off at several airports no matter how congested they might be. **********In 1987, a better computer technique conveyed telephone calls through the 14 best routes, based on recent calling patterns. It was faster. But it was much like a plane finding the quickest path to San Francisco, based on the pilot's experience last month, which might not apply today. The Latest Advance **********The latest advance is real-time network routing, introduced last year, which takes advantage of the entire telephone network, rather than just a part of it. **********A call can pass through any of 119 switches to find the fastest possible path around congestion. The system also constantly updates the status of the network, based on which switches are most busy. **********So now phone calls move like very fast planes that quickly change their itineraries to avoid bad weather and congested airports. New information is fed into telephone computers every few seconds. A.T.& T. has a better chance to manage traffic, although blockage is still likely in especially heavy traffic, just as fog can ground planes at a lot of airports. **********For his part, Mr. Leach looks forward to his usual 8 A.M.-to-midnight shift on Mother's Day. He plans to call his mom from the office, while watching all the other people in the country call theirs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/02/business/executive-changes-333292.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********BORDEN INC., New York, named Peter J.

It is a belated response to the widely held view that under democracy, officials have become even greedier than they were under Communism. **********\"Most residents of the Russian Federation believe the problem has become very acute, that corruption has reached unheard-of proportions,\" Gennadi Burbulis, the First Deputy Prime Minister, said last Friday as he called for the creation of a new anti-corruption committee. **********Once a way of greasing the wheels of a gruesome bureaucracy, bribery has now become part of the cost of doing business and, more than ever before, part of everyday life. **********\"I give bribes at every step, and what don't I give!\" said a store director, who called in anonymously on a bribery hot line run recently by the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. \"You can't get anything without bribes,\" he said. \"I get a delivery of cigarettes -- 10 percent goes to the supplier, to the distributor. Looking for space for your store? That'll be 10 grand on top.\" Bribery's Great Leap Forward **********In the old days, store directors and trading organizations were periodically swept up in anti-corruption campaigns, which would uncover caches of goods and money underneath counters or in warehouses. Just like the \"gifts,\" ranging from chocolates to television sets, that were expected by bureaucrats, pharmacists, lawyers or doctors, such corruption was considered an inevitable byproduct of the Soviet economy with its chronic shortages. **********Such bribery continues, and after prices took a great leap forward over the winter, the sums have soared. But Russians are now discovering new and more pernicious forms of corruption, many of them closely linked to the first steps toward a market economy. **********As the old centralized economy breaks up and passes into the hands of an evolving capitalist system, a series of legal and bureaucratic hurdles must be cleared, all of them convenient lookout posts for bribe takers. **********Taking advantage of their positions and their connections, many factory managers and top-ranking bureaucrats are opening their doors, and their pockets, to offers that will assure them a future in the market economy. **********Local and foreign business executives report a wide range of \"down payments\" requested by officials as the price of cooperation, from electric razors to automobiles to two-story country houses with river views. **********The phenomenon, hardly unique to Russia, has taken on a slightly frantic quality since the former anti-Communist liberal opposition, or democrats as they are often called, came to power. Viktor Shchekochikhin, the 39-year-old president of the Union of Russian Entrepreneurs, calls the current crop of bribe-taking officials temporaries, because they sense that their turn in power may soon come to an end. **********\"Before, officials took money in a more or less orderly way, because they knew that people could continue to come back to them,\" Mr. Shchekochikhin said. \"They behaved properly, if one can say that. With the arrival of the democrats came temporaries, who know that in the next elections they will be thrown out. They have to assure their future now.\" **********As buildings, factories and other property are \"privatized\" for sums that seem astronomical, particularly to anyone on a government salary, the temptation to skim is often irresistible. **********\"When you have privatization going on in a situation where the city or the government controls big property, that's where you get large-scale bribery,\" said one Moscow lawyer. **********Real estate, in particular private offices or stores, is a prime target. **********\"Moscow is broken up into six zones, and each zone has its own price,\" wrote a reporter for Komsomolskaya Pravda after an informal survey about bribery. \"And an entrepreneur is free to make a choice: either offer 100,000 on top, or they will befuddle you with coefficients and you will end up paying an extra three or four million.\" A million rubles is about $10,000. **********For Westerners doing business in Moscow, the cost of corruption is often hidden in the fee paid to middlemen or brokers. Business executives say there are two ways to tell if a bribe has changed hands: if the fee is particularly large, and if the permits are approved relatively quickly. **********One Western company involved in a real-estate deal was recently asked for a seven-figure fee, in dollars not rubles, according to a Western familiar with the case. **********Sorting out legal and illegal practices is not always so easy, given the jumble of laws and decrees that have been tumbling out of the Russian Government. Such confusion makes it easier for the corrupt bureaucrats who, as Mr. Shchekochikhin said, have managed to give bribes \"an official character,\" writing them into contracts or extracting them as \"donations.\" 'Democrats' Take the Heat **********Although the \"democrats\" take much of the heat, many people say the problem is just as common among the old Communist Party apparatchiks, who have lingered on in local and national governments. **********Insider trading, Soviet-style, is a common complaint: government officials with access to privileged economic information, for instance, on the availability of goods or property, share it with a select group, sometimes with a quasi-official title. **********\"Privatization by nomenclatura\" is another phenomenon: Well-placed officials and economic managers quietly strip away the best assets from flagging state industries to form their own businesses. This practice has become a target of the anti-corruption campaign, leading to a spate of reports of particularly egregious examples. **********In Stavropol, former President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's home region, the local prosecutor has accused top local officials of using public funds as their \"share\" in creating new private commercial ventures. Corruption Run Amok **********One such official, according to a report by the news agency Tass, contributed 25,000 rubles from the city budget, another provided city-owned office space downtown, another ordered the allocation of 5 billion rubles, drawn partly from state enterprise revenues, to form a construction association. **********In Moscow, while the city still has a share in some profit-making businesses, like hotels and department stores, individual city officials have been recently barred from holding a personal interest in city-related commercial ventures. But despite these and a few other feeble laws, the public perception remains one of corruption run amok. **********Despite the growing public unease about corruption, the police have shown a lack of enthusiasm about prosecuting it. A total of 38 acts of bribery were reported by the Moscow city police this year, compared to 147 cases of \"speculation.\" Viktor Yerin, Russia's Minister of Internal Affairs, said there were 2,500 cases of bribery reported last year in the republic, including 250 within his own ministry. **********\"There is corruption, and the fact that this causes criticism among the population is understandable,\" Mr. Yerin said in a recent television interview, \"but to say that the Russian Government structures have been eaten up by it, that's being emotional.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/07/world/dispute-over-land-becomes-obstacle-to-salvador-peace.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1992-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1616, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DISPUTE OVER LAND BECOMES OBSTACLE TO SALVADOR PEACE", "print_headline": "DISPUTE OVER LAND BECOMES OBSTACLE TO SALVADOR PEACE", "body_text": " **********Seven months into El Salvador's difficult peace, extensive land claims by the former insurgents have become a major impediment to the demobilization of the nearly 8,000 Salvadoran guerrillas. **********Leaders of the former rebels say their people will give up their weapons only if several hundred thousand acres of land is legally turned over to them, their families and sympathizers, either individually or collectively. **********Joaquin Villalobos, one of the five senior leaders of the former rebels and the most effective military commander during the war, said this was the only way to insure that \"the combatants are not demobilizing in exchange for a bad check.\" Pessimism on Deadline **********Mr. Villalobos added that given the complicated issues on the table, \"not even Mandrake the Magician could meet\" the Oct. 31 deadline for complete demobilization. **********No one expects war to resume if the deadline is not met, but the dispute mirrors the fact that one of the primary causes of the decade-long civil war -- access to land and social well-being -- remains largely unresolved. **********So far this year, the differences over the land issue have been largely confined to negotiating tables, although in the first few weeks after the cease-fire took effect on Feb. 1, a number of agrarian groups linked to the insurgents took over, without major violence, some farms they had not occupied during the war. **********Peacekeepers say several dozen people have been killed in recent months in isolated incidents that could have been linked to political differences but that land did not appear to be involved. No exchanges of gunfire have occurred between the two sides that would be considered truce violations. **********The peace accords, negotiated over nearly two years with the help of a senior United Nations official, Alvaro de Soto, brought an end to more than 11 years of war between American-backed Government forces and five revolutionary groups making up the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which had help from Cuba and Nicaragua. **********During last year's peace negotiations, President Alfredo Cristiani agreed in principle to find a way for guerrilla families and sympathizers to remain on land they occupied and farmed throughout the war, but the size of the guerrilla request, and the financial and legal implications, were not known until recently. **********People who took part in the talks say there were intense pressures on both sides, particularly from the Bush Administration, to come up with a peace accord by the end of 1991, and that was part of the reason the land question was dealt with only in general form. **********President Cristiani is willing to satisfy at least some of the demands of the former guerrillas, but is limited by a shortage of money and fears of a violent reaction from his own right flank, from which large-scale death-squad activity has erupted in the past. Land-Disarmament Linkage **********If the rebel front continues to tie disarmament so closely to the land question, United Nations officials overseeing the transition to peace could order compliance with the Oct. 31 deadline, or they could draw up a new demobilization timetable. Neither step would assure a lasting peace, unless the Salvadorans find a way to accommodate each other. **********Officially, the former guerrillas are claiming 600,000 acres for themselves and their followers, or 12 percent of El Salvador, which is the amount of agricultural land they say they occupied after the legal owners fled to areas outside guerrilla control. **********In making this demand, the ex-guerrillas say they are simply backing up one of the key reasons they had in fighting the long war. Further, they say their land claims coincide with the principle established by previous Salvadoran governments, which tried to carry out a land reform program at the outset of the war in hopes of reducing peasant sympathy for the rebels. **********International peacekeepers say that the former rebels, in private talks, have scaled back the size of their request, but the ex-guerrillas themselves confirm only that they have established a \"priority\" list consisting of 180,000 acres, about which negotiations are under way with the Government. **********Although the greatest amount of the land claimed is in the northern departments of Morazan and Chaletenango, subsistence-farming areas where much of the war was fought, the economic jewel of the guerrilla claim is the rich lands surrounding Las Marias here in the department of Usulutan. **********Usulutan produces coffee and other export crops, and most of the land is legally owned by powerful landholding families. This increases the possibility of conflict over the land claims, but it also means that Usulutan could become the source of the wealth the Marti Front needs if it is to become an important civilian political party. **********Switching out of the radical vocabulary they used through most of the war, the ex-guerrillas now speak of using the agricultural wealth of Usulutan to \"capitalize\" them as a political force. 'We Demand What We Won' **********A seasoned former rebel combatant known as Ricardo made it clear that was the intent as he showed a visitor around a museum the front has created in a former coffee mill at Las Marias in honor of the insurgency. **********\"What interests us now is economic power,\" he said. \"We demand what we won.\" **********Of the ex-guerrillas' 600,000-acre claim, 150,000 acres is in Usulutan. It was not possible to learn how much of the smaller, priority package is in Usulutan. **********One of those expecting to enjoy the fruits of this effort by the guerrilla leadership is Jose Antonio Romero Villacorta, who on a recent day sat in the door of his house a short distance down the road from the museum chatting with a insurgent who was still armed. **********Mr. Romero said that he and his cooperative had \"worked politically\" with the guerrillas and were still willing to be guided by them. Two of his sons, he said, had served with the rebels and have recently been admitted to the new civilian police academy. **********During the war, 72 families came together in the cooperative that Mr. Romero leads, controlling nearly 1,000 acres of land. He said they now expect that that land will become theirs. **********In this small, overpopulated land, heavily dependent on agriculture, land conflicts have often been behind the worst violence. The agrarian reform decree of the military-Christian Democratic junta that governed El Salvador in 1980 is generally believed to have set off the wave of killings attributed to right-wing death squads that year. **********Because this was a war that neither side won but neither admitted losing, the negotiations last year went into great detail in committing the Government to policies and programs intended to incorporate the former rebels into national political and economic life. **********But there was not time during the peace negotiations to work out the specific arrangements on land. **********As time has passed, the ex-guerrillas seem, if anything, to have toughened their position on the land issue, and the Government is only slowly coming to grips with how important it is to them. **********The two sides have just begun to work on the logistics of surveying the land, establishing whether, in fact, guerrilla sympathizers are on it, and deciding how to deal with the claims of legal owners, who expect to be reimbursed or provided land elsewhere. **********The Marti Front wants the Government to use its own funds or foreign aid to compensate the legal owners or buy them other land. But with land in short supply and the war over, land values are rising. **********The Government says it doesn't have nearly enough money to meet the guerrillas' land claims and charges that the ex-guerrilla leaders are using the land question as a means to gain political advantage. The guerrilla front says that is exactly what it wants to do. **********\"Of course we are using this to strengthen our position,\" said Antonio Alvarez, a member of the land commission of the former guerrilla front. 'A Power in This Country' **********\"We already are a power in this country,\" he said. \"No government negotiates with a defeated army.\" **********Eleno Hernan Castro, another member of the land commission, also made clear that even if the owners will not sell, it will be difficult to clear their land of former rebels and their followers. **********\"When the war came, the owners couldn't stay and work the land,\" he said, \"so the workers made their own agricultural plots, and then they expanded, adding cows and other things. Now, they all expect to become owners.\" **********He added, \"And if they don't, who is going to be able to remove them?\" **********Mr. Villalobos has also said that complete demobilization depends on the assignment of new civilian police officers around the country to replace the old military-commanded National Police. Although the creation of the new police force, which will include former guerrillas, is behind schedule, the new academy is functioning and is expected to graduate its first class in February. **********Under the accords, the ex-guerrillas were to demobilize at the rate of 20 per cent a month starting last May. So far, only one group of 20 percent has done so, mostly people who were not active combatants, and the number of weapons turned in was fewer than the number of people demobilizing. **********The remaining 80 per cent, like the army, is gathered in what are called concentration zonesunder the observation of United Nations military and police experts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/07/world/israel-to-boycott-2-parts-of-peace-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1992-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 641, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel to Boycott 2 Parts of Peace Talks", "print_headline": "Israel to Boycott 2 Parts of Peace Talks", "body_text": " **********Israel has given formal notice that it will boycott two phases of regional peace talks scheduled to begin next week because Palestinians from outside the occupied territories will be taking part, officials said today. **********The Israeli decision to stay away from separate discussions on Middle East refugee problems and economic development was relayed over the last two days to the hosts for those talks, Canada and the European Community. **********But officials said Israel still planned to take part in three other phases of regionwide negotiations, planned for the next two weeks and focused on arms control, the environment and the sharing of water resources.

Those talks adjourned in Washington last week and are supposed to resume in Rome, although no date has been set.  Action Is Unsurprising **********There was nothing surprising about the partial Israeli boycott of the \"multilaterals.\" **********Israel says the sponsors have changed the negotiated rules in mid-course. It was agreed before the opening peace conference in Madrid last fall that only Palestinians from the occupied territories could be involved, and that arrangement, Israel argues, must be followed. **********More substantively, Israel worries that to accept outside Palestinians, especially in the panels on refugees, would be to imply that it is prepared to discuss their right to return some day to their homes in Israel and the occupied territories. That is not a negotiable issue and never will be, Israeli officials say. **********\"We told the sponsors from the beginning that we will not be party to any negotiations where diaspora Palestinians take part, and our position has not changed,\" one official said.  Questions Raised **********While not unexpected, the decision raised questions about whether the affected talks can ever have full regional participation without one of the main parties taking the unlikely step of swallowing large gulps of pride. **********The strategy of the United States, as chief sponsor of the peace processes, is to have the multilateral negotiations accompany and bolster the bilateral talks by putting once-isolated Israel into direct contact with a wide range of Arab countries and important outsiders like Japan and China on matters affecting the entire Middle East. **********The regional phase got under way with a plenary round in Moscow in January, but then it was the Palestinians who boycotted the sessions because the United States and its cosponsor, Russia, had rejected the participation of so-called \"outside\" Palestinians, people not living in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  U.S. and Russia Agree **********To prevent that from happening again, Washington and Moscow agreed to let outside Palestinians join the working-group talks about to start on refugee issues and economic development, so long as these representatives are not members of the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********The rules for sessions this month on the three other broad regional topics were not altered. They are talks on water resources in Vienna, on arms and security issues in Washington and on environmental concerns in Tokyo. **********The United States has taken the position since the Moscow round that new rules could be applied to these working-level talks. Meeting in Washington last week with Foreign Minister David Levy of Israel, Secretary of States James A. Baker 3d reportedly said that Washington would not force the Israelis to talk with anyone objectionable to them.

The Bundesbank raised its discount rate to 8.75 percent last month, while the Federal Reserve Board cut its discount rate to 3 percent in early July. **********Lower German interest rates would make the mark less attractive and would also stimulate German economic growth, which has slowed substantially in recent months.Stocks and Bonds Suffer **********The falling dollar helped depress stock and bond prices in the United States and elsewhere today. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 25.93 points, to 3,228.17, and stock indexes in London, Paris, Zurich and Hong Kong dropped more than 2 percent. Bond prices fell sharply across the board. [Pages D6 and D13.] **********Although the Bundesbank gave no signs of reversing its high-rate policies -- its front line of defense against inflation stemming from German unification -- officials in Bonn expressed concern about the dollar's woes. **********Horst Kohler, the state secretary in the financial ministry, said today that a weaker dollar was in the interest of neither Germany nor the United States. The recent moves of the dollar and the Deutsche mark do not reflect the fundamental economic data, he added. **********Since the Bundesbank raised its discount rate, there has been widespread fear that it might also raise the short-term Lombard rate and that it could force interest rates to rise throughout Europe. But in what was apparently an effort to quell these fears, Hans Tietmeyer, vice president of the Bundesbank, said last week that a change in German interest rates was not under consideration at the moment. **********But other policy makers at the Bundesbank have sounded less conciliatory. Lothar Muller, president of Bavaria's state central bank and a member of the Bundesbank's policy-setting central bank council, speculated last week about the possibility of raising the Lombard rate, currently at 9.75 percent, above 10 percent. **********Bundesbank officials still maintain that the high rates are necessary to squelch inflationary pressures stemming from the enormous costs of German unification. Although inflation fell to 3.3 percent in July, it is expected to average 4 percent for all of 1992. **********More worrisome to the central bankers is the fact that Germany's money supply is growing nearly twice as fast as planned, driven by heavy bank borrowings. In the first six months of the year bank credits expanded at an annual rate of 11 percent. **********But rapid growth in the money supply and in bank credit are not producing rapid economic growth, and some German economists are beginning to predict a serious slump. Prof. Herbert Hax, a leading independent economic adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government, warned today that the German economy was on the brink of recession. **********Mr. Hax, the chairman of \"the five wise men,\" a five-membe independent council of experts that advises the German Government, said he no longer thought the council's forecast for 2 percent German growth this year was achievable. **********His remarks in Handelsblatt, a daily financial paper, and in a recent radio interview, highlighted a widening rift between the Government's optimistic forecasts and the considerably bleaker scenarios being sketched by private economists. **********Many economists think the central bank is using high interest rates to pursue its own political agenda. Its primary goals are to force Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative Government to enact deep spending cuts and to torpedo the Maastricht treaty that mandates the creation of a single European currency by 1999. **********Asked recently if a single European currency made sense, the Bundesbank president, Helmut Schlesinger would say only, \"I consider a monetary union to be possible.\" Relations between Bonn and the Bundesbank have been strained ever since the rush to German unity began in late 1989. The Bundesbank fought hard against the monetary and economic union of the two German states on July 1, 1990. **********Since monetary union, the Bundesbank has steadily tightened its monetary policy by repeatedly raising interest rates. Economists said that policy had eased inflationary pressure, but had also put a damper on economic growth. **********As the mark rises, so do the prices of German products exported to markets abroad. As a result, exports have been weaker than expected. And domestic demand has declined because of higher taxes and the loss of buying power to inflation. **********\"There is room for the Bundesbank to cut interest rates, and it would help Germany's economy,\" said Dieter Wermuth, managing director of Caisse des Depots et Consignations, a commercial bank in Frankfurt. \"But they are not at all inclined to do so. I doubt they will raise rates. The Bundesbank can well afford to sit back and let the criticism bounce off.\" But the pressure on the Bundesbank is likely to be renewed next month when financial officials of the Group of Seven industrial nations gather in Washington for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. German interest rates are expected to top the agenda. **********\"The Bush Administration could legitimately complain about France and Britain tying their monetary policies so closely to Germany's at a time when their domestic conditions do not warrant that,\" said Brendan Brown, an economist at Mitsubishi Finance International in London. \"The French and British actions are contributing to the dollar's weakness.\" But, he added, \"the German-American relationship always seems to become the focal point for U.S.-European issues.\" **********But while many economists consider the Bundesbank unlikely to ease rates, some also theorized that this stance suits the Bush Administration. Some economists said that James A. Baker 3d, who is now President Bush's chief of staff, wants to keep the dollar low to bolster United States exports during the Presidential election campaign and is willing to blame the Bundesbank's high interest rates for the dollar's woes rather than the Federal Reserve's low ones."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/25/business/bond-yields-fall-short-term-rates-rise.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1992-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 510, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bond Yields Fall; Short-Term Rates Rise", "print_headline": "Bond Yields Fall; Short-Term Rates Rise", "body_text": " **********Interest rates were narrowly mixed in sluggish trading in the credit markets yesterday. **********Treasury bond yields fell for the first time in several sessions, but the huge increases in the money supply reported late on Thursday continued to push up rates on short- to intermediate-term securities. **********Some traders see the big jump in the money numbers as a roadblock that precludes further easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. **********\"Right now, the market seems to have given up on the Fed ever easing again in our lifetime,\" one government securities trader said.

Last month, another sister was killed, hit in the head by a stray bullet as she sat in the garden. **********For the handful of educated Somalis who have remained in a country destroyed by factional fighting and famine, the biggest barrier to survival has not been so much the dearth of food but the heavy weaponry in the hands of untrained, frenzied young men like Mr. Abdulle's brother. **********\"When I told him to stop this nonsense, he said I was a coward,\" said Mr. Abdulle, 34 years old, recalling the argument he had with his brother. His brother, he said, was propelled into action by khat, an amphetamine-like plant leaf popular among Somali men, which the clan army gets for its youthful foot soldiers. \" Many Face Starvation **********As the United States gets ready to airlift food into Somalia, Mr. Abdulle, a university lecturer who now ekes out a living working for the Red Cross here, worries that food alone will not solve the anarchy and famine that have consumed his country. International organizations, he suggests, have to buy up the weapons or offer food in exchange for them. **********The International Committee of the Red Cross estimates that 1.5 million people, about one-third of Somalia's population, face death by starvation unless relief reaches the hungry. **********Mr. Abdulle's story of survival, as he has helped his extended family of 32 people run from house to house and neighborhood to neighborhood, illustrates the intense clan hatred behind the fighting in Somalia. Automatic machine guns, grenade launchers, bazookas and pistols, all left behind by the superpowers that armed Somalia during the cold war, dictate the pattern of daily living, he said. **********The destruction of Mogadishu, a once-graceful city on the Indian Ocean, began last November when two subclans of one of Somalia's biggest clans, the Hawiye, battled for control of the capital. In January 1991, when the Hawiye were united, they ousted the Somali strongman of 21 years, Mohammed Siad Barre, a member of the Darod clan. A Fight Between 'Cousins' **********But in November the two Hawiye subclans fought each other to fill the vacuum left by Siad Barre. It was a fight for power between \"cousins,\" Mr. Abdulle said. There is little obvious difference between his subclan, the Abgal, known as the businessmen of Mogadishu, and the other subclan, the Habar Gidir, many of whom are nomads with large herds of cattle and camels in central Somalia. **********As shells thudded all around them in the first days of the fighting, Mr. Abdulle said, he realized that the house where he and his family were hiding was astride the frontline. **********The family moved the family to the house of his mother-in-law, taking with them a couple of ornate chairs that were faded memories of the Italian colonial days, a bureau, some clothes, two television sets and other household goods thrown onto the back of an ancient truck that had been the backbone of his father's transport business. **********When his mother-in-law's house was destroyed and his sister killed, it was clear that Mogadishu was a divided city, with the Abgals in the north and the Habar Gidir in the south. Mr. Abdulle then realized that he was on the wrong side. **********The head of the Abgal clan, Mohammed Ali Mahdi, was on the north side of the city, and his troops were firing straight at Mr. Abdulle in the south. \"I sent most of the family to the area near the airport in the north and my wife and two sons found this house,\" he said. **********The owner of the abandoned house was a member of a subclan allied to the Habar Gidir and had fled to the southern part of the city, he said. Mr. Abdulle said he paid the armed guard of the house to go away and moved in.  Begging Milk for Children **********As the fighting continued, Mr. Abdulle said, he had to resort to begging milk from a woman who had a cow. \"At first she refused when I asked her if I could borrow some milk for my two young children because she knew there was no way I could repay her,\" he said. \"But in the end she gave me enough for the youngest, then one year old, and I gave the eldest boy, three years old, tea.\" **********With his fluent English, Mr. Abdulle was hired as a field officer by the Red Cross, whose medics he met while taking wounded Abgals to the agency's makeshift hospital. He was paid a stipend in food, allowing him to stay in the city and bring his elderly father, his father's two wives, his 11 brothers and sisters, and his nephews and nieces from their temporary shelter on the city outskirts. **********Mr. Abdulle now receives a salary of $110 a month and $40 for food, enough to keep the family alive. But even at the market family members find themselves taking part in the illicit economy. Almost all the food is stolen -- oil sold by drops from a funnel in the top of a bottle, sacks of grain marked gift of the European Community, even the fresh grapefruit from the interior.\" **********After his brother died, elders of the Abgal clan presented Mr. Abdulle with what they considered an ultimate prize: a Belgian-made automatic rifle. It was intended as a tribute for the family's sacrifice, but also for Mr. Abdulle to continue the fight. **********He kept the rifle for a while then sold it for the equivalent of about $150. \"I sold it to an Abgal man, Mohammed, at the market,\" Mr. Abdulle said. \"If I had brought him to the house to sell it, he would have looted me,\" **********\"The clan can't protect you all the time,\" he said. \"Only guns talk.

Robert Sarini of Annapolis, Md., said, \"I took the annuity and decided to leave.\" But, he added, \"the packages weren't overly easy to evaluate,\" because of uncertainty about how the long years of Reserve service will work out. **********He said his choice, with more than 13 years of service in the Army, was either an $85,000 lump sum, which taxes would have reduced to $58,000, or a $13,000 annuity for 26 years with Reserve service all that time. If he qualifies for a Reserve retirement, he may have to forgo some of the annuity, but that is impossible to forecast today. **********Major Sarini, whose wife has her own business in Annapolis, is now looking for a management job in the area. He said several friends were also leaving the service and generally those whose spouses worked were taking the annuity because \"if you are going to invest it, you'll have more money in the long run.\" **********But most of the single people he knows or those whose spouses do not work are taking the lump sum, he said, because jobs are hard to find and they need the money for living costs or to start a business. **********Why leave the service at all in that case? Because as the Pentagon reduces the armed forces, people in the military fear an almost-certain involuntary discharge. In that case, they would have to take a smaller lump-sum separation payment. **********Commander Kusiak said this was the first large reduction in forces since the nation had gone to an all-volunteer military, and the Pentagon was trying to be \"reasonable, responsible and sensitive\" in letting people know whether they ought to apply for voluntary separation because their skills and length of service make them redundant. Doctors and pilots, for example, who received a re-enlistment bonus because they are in short supply, would not be accepted for voluntary separation. **********Military personnel have no pension vesting, Commander Kusiak noted. Anyone who leaves the service before 20 years gets no retirement pay. Therefore, many of those now separating may want to invest all or part of the money they are receiving for their eventual retirements. **********Joel S. Isaacson, who is in charge of personal financial planning for Clarfeld & Company, a New York certified public accounting firm, warned that the military personnel should be extremely careful in making such investments. **********\"They can be vulnerable to investment scams,\" he said. \"They'll be targeted.\" It may be smart to take the annuity and rely on dollar-cost-averaging to build up a position in a conservative investment over time, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/07/business/company-news-ercros-a-chemical-group-going-bankrupt.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 497, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ercros, a Chemical Group, Going Bankrupt", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Ercros, a Chemical Group, Going Bankrupt", "body_text": " **********In what is likely to be the largest bankruptcy filing in Spanish history, Ercros S.A., Spain's largest chemical group, said today that it would file for receivership on Tuesday after failing to reach an agreement with its creditors. **********The group, indirectly controlled by the Kuwait Investment Office, has debts totaling about $1.5 billion, and its bank creditors include Citibank and Chase Manhattan. **********Ercros's troubled fertilizer company, FESA-Enfersa, with debts totaling $1.1 billion, filed today for receivership, suspending all payments to banks and creditors.

But as the leaders prepared to meet with federal political officials, some of them insisted that the protests would continue until their demands were met. **********Government officials said they were determined not to cede under pressure what they had won at the polls. They emphasized that the opposition parties had yet to prove their claim of fraud, and even some national opposition officials acknowledged that their parties' chances of overturning the votes seemed remote. **********Since a newly elected Governor from the ruling party stepped down last month in the western state of Michoacan after months of protests by the opposition, Government officials have insisted that they will not let the episode continue a pattern.

Based on preliminary results, the PRI claimed the governorship of the central state of Puebla with almost 70 percent of the vote. **********As in Michoacan, the complaints by opposition parties and election-observer groups seemed to focus only in part on such common Mexican political tactics as ballot-box stuffing, repeat voting and bogus voter rolls. Much of what the observer groups, especially, described as fraud had to do with the governing party's overwhelming advantages in campaign financing, access to newspapers and television, and representation on state election boards. **********After months in which Government officials had privately discounted the strength of Mexicans' demands for political change, Mr. Salinas answered them cautiously in his annual state of the nation address on Nov. 1. Without being specific, he proposed a series of changes in the rules of political competition, including campaign spending limits and fairer access to the press and broadcast outlets. **********More recently, Government officials have said that a package of changes to federal election laws will probably be submitted to the PRI-controlled Congress in April, so that they can be in place before the presidential vote in 1994."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/21/business/net-up-9.9-at-raytheon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Net Up 9.9% At Raytheon", "print_headline": "Net Up 9.9% At Raytheon", "body_text": " **********The Raytheon Company today reported a 9.9 percent increase in quarterly earnings, saying its diversity helped shield the company from a weak economy and military cuts. **********Raytheon, a leading Government contractor, reported earnings of $157.8 million, or $2.37 a share, for the last three months of 1991.

Penniman 4th, senior vice president of newspaper operations at Pulitzer, who added that he thought other groups of suburban weeklies could easily share the same fate. Negative to Positive? **********Pulitzer acquired the papers from the Lerner family in 1985, a time when such publications were taking advertising dollars from metropolitan dailies all over the country. Indeed, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Pulitzer's flagship paper, was being battered by suburban weeklies, and the company thought it could turn that bitter experience into gain by doing the same thing to The Chicago Tribune and The Chicago Sun-Times. **********When Pulitzer bought the Lerner group, it included 56 free publications under half a dozen titles to which a community's name was attached, such as The River Grove Times and The Niles Life. Most of their advertising revenue came from help-wanted classifieds, which were plentiful enough to create comfortable profits, though Pulitzer would not disclose numbers. **********But Pulitzer failed with its fundamental strategy of winning real estate and automobile classifieds and retail ads from the major Chicago dailies. Zoned Editions **********Like many metropolitan papers that watched competition in the suburbs mount in recent years, The Tribune invested heavily to create zoned editions that were essentially local papers tucked inside the big daily. The Sun-Times is more focused on the city but has aggressively defended its traditional strength in automotive classifieds. **********When recession hit three years ago, help-wanted classified linage sank.

The employers who once swelled his papers with help-wanted classifieds probably will not rehire -- or advertise -- at anything like previous levels, he said. **********And he said that suburban weeklies were being squeezed not only from above, by mass-market competitors like metro dailies, cable television and direct mail, but also from below, by even more narrowly focused community papers. **********These papers, which through computer technology can spring up virtually overnight, are inexpensive to produce and increasingly are published in Korean, Hindi or other languages that reflect the ethnic cast of many suburban subcommunities. **********Charles J.

Benefits consultants say some executives view the benefits as a \"gratuity\" rather than a permanent obligation, when they are not detailed in an employment contract. But most employers say they are committed to continuing the programs, albeit often with reduced benefits, despite rapid growth in both medical costs and the numbers of retirees. **********Under an accounting rule that takes effect in 1993, corporations with at least 500 employees must calculate future retiree medical obligations and charge off the costs against income -- either all at once, or spread over 20 years. The rule does not require setting aside cash for the future costs. **********Michael J. Gulotta, president of Actuarial Sciences, a consulting unit of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said that employees' concerns about their economic security would push some companies to set up tax-deductible funds dedicated to future retiree costs. Trust funds negotiated with unions qualify for special tax breaks. **********After discussions last year with its unions, A.T.& T. invested $361 million for retiree medical benefits in two voluntary employee benefit accounts. One is for union members, the other for nonunion people. The telephone company said it expected its accumulated liabilities for future retiree health benefits to be $5.5 billion to $7.5 billion, after payment of taxes. **********The retiree accounts are much less attractive for businesses with fewer union employees. A recent survey of 1,200 employers that offer retiree health benefits, by the A. Foster Higgins consulting firm, found that only 8 percent were \"prefunding\" the benefits and 3 percent were setting aside some funds. The vast majority, 89 percent, were spending only for current medical expenses of retirees. **********The Central Telephone Company, a unit of the Centel Corporation in Chicago, has not established a retiree medical account, said Steve Bailor, Central's vice president and controller. It reports the future expenses in its annual reports, he said, but it uses the money \"for general business purposes.\" **********Some utilities are asking state regulators for rate increases based on the expenses, whether or not money is being set aside. Florida granted such a request by Centel's Florida unit. But officials in California and a number of other states said that such increases would have to be based on money set aside by utilities in their states. **********In view of the meager tax advantages in retiree benefit trust accounts for management and other nonunion employees, Mr. Gulotta at Actuarial Sciences said that a number of employers were considering setting up trusts that would buy life insurance for employees. The up-front expense would be considerable but the insurance could grow with tax-free interest, reducing a company's liability under the new accounting rule. **********Companies that have invested in employee benefit funds \"today will have less of a burden in the future than those who have not,\" Mr. Gulotta said. **********But Judith F. Mazo, a senior vice president in Washington with the Segal Company consulting firm, said that many employers were reluctant to invest in the funds because of uncertainty about future changes in the nation's health system that could make the issue moot. **********Some unions have similar qualms, said Meredith Miller, assistant director of employee benefits with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. \"They have been resisting the idea of prefunding,\" she said, \"because they did not want to break apart the retirees from the major plan\" -- risking dividing their members over benefits. \"They are pushing for national health care,\" Ms. Mazo said. **********Patricia Wilson, a principal with A. Foster Higgins, said: \"Many employers still maintain that benefits are gratuities rather than contractual obligations. I think they're right.\" Even so, she added, employers were not canceling promises. **********\"They need to satisfy the needs of retirees, whether they fund through pensions or a medical plan,\" she said. \"If they cut back on retiree benefits, they may be forced to increase wages or contributions to a 401(k)\" employee savings plan. **********FHP Inc., a health maintenance organization based in Fountain Valley, Calif., is taking a different approach with the help of Federal money for the elderly.

Price 3d, FHP's president.  Medicare members got basic coverage and free prescription drugs, he added. **********FHP said companies like Chevron, B. F. Goodrich, Northrop, Rockwell International and TRW were offering the plan to retirees. Dan Heslin, director of employee benefit programs at Rockwell, said his company encouraged retirees to join H.M.O.'s by adding dental and vision services that Medicare would not cover.

The moves were voluntary, and the migrant families were given land and the material to build a new home. **********But today the organizers of one of the world's most ambitious resettlement plans acknowledge that it has been a mixed success, and that it led to cruel mistakes. The Government is reforming the program, which is known as transmigration. Several Criticisms **********The program continues to draw fire from human-rights advocates and environmentalists, who say it has contributed to the destruction of indigenous cultures and virgin lands. **********Early migrants sometimes found themselves on remote islands where the soil was poor, or where there was inadequate water, or where there was malaria, or where there was no place for farmers to sell crops. **********For some in the program, \"it was like they had been banished to a faraway country,\" said Z. A. Maulani, secretary general of the Transmigration Ministry. \"There may have been more concern about getting people out of Java\" than in making sure their new homes were adequate, he said. **********Among the critics has been the World Bank, which cut off most of its funding in the late 1980's after lending hundreds of millions of dollars.  Taking a Step Back **********The Government is scaling back the program but keeping it alive. The population problem has not gone away. **********Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous nation, with 180 million people spread across 17,000 islands. Only China, India and the United States have more people. Indonesia's overcrowding problem is most severe on Java, which represents only 7 percent of the land but is home to 60 percent of the people. **********The changes in the program appear to have had an effect. Government studies, described by diplomats as reliable, show that the vast majority of the migrants believe their lives are better. **********In a report in January, the World Bank noted many of its earlier criticisms but said transmigration had \"made an important contribution to Indonesia's long-term economic and social development.\" 'There Was No Future' **********\"Of course I moved from Java,\" said Onih, a 20-year-old Javanese-born laborer who now lives on Sumatra and who, like many Indonesians, has only one name. \"In Java, there was no future.\" Mrs. Onih and her husband seem pleased with their new home and the plot of land they have been given, the first land they have ever owned. **********Barokah, a 47-year-old farmer, says she has no complaints. Like many of the migrants interviewed in the sprawling transmigration sites here on Sumatra, she says her life is undeniably better. **********\"I put everything I own into a plastic sack and came here in a big boat with my husband,\" said Barokah, who left her native Java last March. **********\"The land on Java was better for crops,\" Mrs. Barokah said as she used her thumb to push dried lentil beans from their pods, one of the first crops that she and her husband have managed to coax out of the dry red soil. \"But on Java I worked on land owned by others. Here, I own the land.\" The Grubstake **********Most homesteaders are Javanese farmers or laborers eager to tend land of their own. Under the program, each family receives about five acres of land, materials for a simple house, seed, pesticides, a supply of food and a set of clothes. They are moved to their new homes at Government expense. **********Transmigration has been around in one form or another since the turn of the century, when the Dutch owners of coffee and rubber plantations forcibly moved thousands of laborers from Java to Sumatra. **********The current, voluntary program dates back to 1969, when the Government decided it had to defuse a population time-bomb on Java. Indonesia was then, and remains today, one of the few nations to undertake a serious, voluntary effort at population control by redistribution. 'The Largest Colonization' **********During the Government's five-year planning cycle that began in 1979, 535,000 families were resettled. From 1984 to 1989, 750,000 families were moved. **********As the numbers grew, so did the criticism. Environmentalists said settlements were being carved out of rain forests. Human rights groups worried about encroachments on tribal lands, especially in Irian Jaya, the Indonesian half of New Guinea, which is home to tribes barely out of the Stone Age. **********Survival International, a human rights organization based in London, has described transmigration as \"the largest colonization program in history\" and said \"tribal peoples have been pushed aside\" for new migration sites. **********Worried by the criticism, in the late 1980's the Government began to emphasize sending fewer families to better locations. Satellite imagery is being used to select sites with fertile soil where environmental damage can be contained. **********The program hopes to move 60,000 families this year, less than half of its annual goal a few years ago. The decision to scale back has been attributed both to the need for change and to a drop in the Government's revenue from oil, a critical export. The cutbacks have quieted some, but not all, of the criticism. **********According to the World Bank report, two-thirds of the migrants report that they have higher incomes as a result of joining the program, and most said they were satisfied with their lives. **********\"Just after I first arrived here in 1986, several families went home to Java because they were uncomfortable here and they found life as migrants too difficult,\" said Nani, a 38-year-old farmer who lives at a migration site in Sumatra. \"Now, nobody talks about leaving. Even though I get homesick for Java and I think sometimes the life there was easier, we will stay.\" **********While the population of Java continues to grow, the worst fears of demographers have not been realized. With industrialization and foreign investment, Indonesia has one of the world's fastest-growing economies, with Java the chief beneficiary. **********Thus, transmigration has taken on a secondary purpose as an useful tool in creating a national identity in Indonesia, a nation that often seems in danger of fragmenting along fault lines of ethnicity, religion and social class. **********Across Indonesia's 17,000 islands, from the Bay of Bengal to the northern tip of Australia, there are more than 300 ethnic groups speaking hundreds of languages. While most Indonesians are Muslims, millions worship Buddha, Christ, Shiva or local tribal gods. Separatist movements exist on a number of the islands, led by men and women who are willing to take up arms rather than allow themselves to be labeled as Indonesian. **********\"Transmigration is good for nation-building,\" said Mr. Maulani of the Transmigration Ministry. **********Boenyamin, a transmigration director in Sumatra, said he wanted migrants \"not to think of themselves as Javanese or Sumatran or whatever, but instead to think of themselves as Indonesians.\" Mr. Boenyamin was born in Java. **********The Javanese dominate the political and social structure of Indonesia, and there has been some apprehension among Sumatrans and among the natives of other provinces that local cultures will be sacrificed with the arrival of so many Javanese. **********Indonesian social scientists refer to the process as \"Javanization,\" or Javanese colonialism. The Javanese have long faced a special suspicion in Sumatra, where the Indonesian Army has been entangled for years in a campaign to put down a separatist movement in Aceh province. **********\"There are differences between the Javanese and us,\" said Yahya, 63, the leader of a small Sumatra village outside one of the resettlement sites. \"There are differences in our customs, in the way we live.\" **********Still, he said, \"We want to live in peace with the settlers. I have heard one or two people say, 'The Javanese are taking our land, Sumatran land,' but these people do not reflect the way the community feels.\" The Good Soil of Sumatra **********The migrants get their choice of islands on which to settle. While they are encouraged to go to remote provinces the Government wants to develop, about half of those in the program this year will settle on Sumatra because of its proximity to Java and because it has better soil than many other islands. **********\"I was willing to wait to come here to Sumatra,\" said Bambang Sudiharjo, 40, an electrician who left Ngawi, in eastern Java, three years ago to travel here with 23 other Ngawi families. \"There is more a future in this land.\" **********The Ngawi families settled together in a 750-family site in Sei Pagar, where they tend to stubby oil palms. Each family gets a plot of trees within a large plantation, along with a separate two-acre plot for growing other crops that can be used or sold by the family. **********While most of the migrants in Sei Pagar make clear that they are better off now, at least one family is discouraged and may soon go back to Java.  'I Miss Jakarta' **********Kartini, 31, left Jakarta three years ago with her husband, a cab driver, and says she often thinks giving up and returning home. \"I miss the sights of Jakarta, and we have had so many troubles here,\" said Mrs. Kartini, who has three daughters. \"We were given palm trees, but they are still not mature palm trees. And sometimes the palm trees are attacked by wild boars that eat the fruit.\" **********In August, Mrs. Kartini and her family received only about 85,000 rupiah, or $42, from the sale of palm oil, and Mrs. Kartini said she has begun traveling outside the camp looking for work. **********To encourage integration and to deal with local jealousy over the land and other benefits for migrants, a share of each settlement is set aside for local families. At Sei Pagar, 10 percent of the land goes to Sumatran farmers who agree to move onto the site. **********\"When I first saw this land, I wept because I was so frightened,\" said Mrs. Barokah, the Javanese farmer who arrived here last spring. \"Now I think to myself that I will stay here forever.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/29/business/at-t-in-video-chip-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 296, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.T.& T. in Video Chip Pact", "print_headline": "A.T.& T. in Video Chip Pact", "body_text": " **********In a bid to develop the still unproved market for consumer videophones, A.T.& T. and Compression Labs Inc. said yesterday that they planned to develop sets of microprocessors for other manufacturers wanting to produce video systems compatible with A.T.& T.'s Videophone 2500. **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the first to the market with a consumer system, will soon get competition from the MCI Communications Corporation, which plans to begin selling a $750 video telephone next year.

But it gets worse. The latest monthly Treasury statement shows that during the first six months of fiscal 1992, which began Oct. 1, the deficit widened to $196.88 billion, from $152.19 billion in the first half of fiscal 1991. **********For all fiscal 1991, the deficit was $268.7 billion; this year the Administration projects it to climb to about $400 billion. That estimate reflects an anticipated on-budget deficit of $449.1 billion, offset by an off-budget surplus of $49.4 billion. **********Much as the savings and loan disaster was minimized and dismissed in the 1988 election campaign, the swelling national debt is being largely ignored in the 1992 campaign. **********But the facts are these: At the end of 1981, the gross Federal debt totaled slightly less than $1 trillion after 205 years of United States history. By the end of fiscal 1992, the Federal debt will have quadrupled to $4.08 trillion, according to Administration estimates. Just the interest on the public debt will reach $293 billion this year. And the gross Federal debt is projected to hit $4.5 trillion by the end of fiscal 1993. **********Does it matter? Some economists, both on the left and the right, insist it matters little. Many monetarists say only money matters, and, if the debt is not monetized, there's nothing to worry about. Anti-government crusaders say big deficits may even be a good thing by forcing politicians to cut spending. **********Some liberals insist conventional definitions of the deficit are wrong -- it's smaller than you think.  Most tempting of all to politicians is the argument that if they just stimulate growth by cutting taxes, raising expenditures or both, the deficit will vanish. This was the original case for the Reagan tax cuts. **********But a wide band of economists, including conservatives and liberals, still see the deficit as a root cause of the nation's economic weakness. A leader of this school is Prof. Benjamin Friedman of Harvard, author of \"Day of Reckoning,\" a prophecy that appears to have come true in this long spell of recession, sluggish growth and personal income stagnation. In an unpublished paper, \"Learning from the Reagan Deficits,\" he lays out the data to show the linkages between the deficits and the nation's eroding economic growth. **********The Reagan cuts in marginal tax rates did not increase but reduced tax revenues, contrary to supply-side theorists. And lower tax revenues did not restrain government spending enough to prevent the soaring of the deficits to unprecedented heights, contrary to the anti-government ideologues. **********The widening public deficits did not result in greater private saving, as some economists had predicted. Contrary to the so-called Ricardian equivalence theorem that public dissaving through the budget deficit would be offset by greater individual saving and higher business profits, private saving moved in the opposite direction, compounding the effect of bigger public deficits. Net national saving, which averaged 7.3 percent of gross national product from 1951 to 1980, shrank to 2.6 percent from 1981 to 1990. **********In consequence, real interest rates -- nominal rates adjusted for expected inflation -- rose. As measured by the commercial paper rate minus the growth of the G.N.P. price deflator, the real rate of interest rose from an average of eight-tenths of 1 percent from 1951 to 1980 to 4.7 percent from 1981 to 1990. **********The bigger budget deficits, drop in national savings and rise in real interest rates caused a sharp decline in investment. Net private domestic investment, which averaged 7 percent from 1951 to 1980, fell to 4.4 percent in 1981-90. The fall would have been even greater had it not been for the net inflow of foreign capital. But even with America's swing from creditor to debtor nation, the fall in its capital formation caused a decline in productivity growth and stagnation of real wages and living standards, and the United States lost competitiveness against foreign producers, in markets both at home and abroad. **********On the issue of what is the correct definition of the budget deficit, Professor Friedman says it is not just the level but the \"trajectory\" of budget deficits that affect the economy's performance.  Whatever the definition used, it must be applied to both the base and the terminal dates, and United States deficits have seriously worsened in the last dozen years. **********The deficit remains the hidden issue of the 1992 campaign because of the political dangers to candidates of proposing solutions, whether by raising taxes or cutting entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. If the deficit issue goes unaddressed, the United States will continue to be frustrated in attacking domestic problems and meeting its international commitments. **********Weak in wallet, the United States cannot play its role as world leader or even effective partner. And, in an interdependent world, the United States cannot retreat to its home base without aggravating its economic problems. **********The day of reckoning has arrived, but not yet in American politics."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/06/business/mutual-funds-buying-a-new-fund-with-no-history.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1992-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1053, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mutual Funds; Buying a New Fund With No History", "print_headline": "Mutual Funds; Buying a New Fund With No History", "body_text": " **********BUYING a newly created mutual fund can be risky because it has no track record, and past performance is an important criterion in investing. A good rule is to buy funds that have outperformed their peers in three of the last five years. **********But a solid history is only one thing that investors give up in buying a new fund. Often \"new funds combine the worst of all worlds: less than top-of-the-line service, high expenses and inexperienced management,\" said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., a fund research group in Chicago. **********Still, the fund industry spares no expense in hyping new offerings. Full-page advertisements trumpet funds' arrivals. A sponsor may even absorb part of a new fund's initial expenses to make it more competitive. **********But investors who look behind the hype can find plenty of reasons to avoid new funds. For one thing, it can take time for sponsors to get the bugs out of a fund's operating system -- to make sure that telephone systems work properly and monthly statements are mailed on time. Also, new funds are often expensive because their fixed costs are spread over a small pool of money. **********The overriding factor, however, is the fund manager's experience or lack of it. Information about the manager's investing philosophy or style may be hard to get, or the manager's experience may not transfer easily to directing a mutual fund. **********That said, there are exceptions to every rule. Sometimes a new fund is not really unpredictable because its manager has a long track record with a similar fund. Or the manager's role may not matter much, as in the case of index funds. And small size can sometimes be an advantage, as with funds that invest in small companies. Finally, a quick decision to invest is the only choice with a fund company that has a reputation for closing out new investors when the funds reach a certain size. **********What is more, the fund industry has evolved so rapidly in the last decade that investors who automatically exclude funds without five-year track records cut themselves off from nearly half of all the funds on the market. So analysts at Morningstar were asked to sift through new entries on the fund scene. Here are some funds, all no-loads, that they say deserve a second look. **********One not-really-new fund is the Chicago-based Yacktman Fund, which was started last summer. Donald A. Yacktman, its manager, formerly ran Selected American Shares, a growth-and-income fund with an enviable record. Selected American Shares gained 18.9 percent a year on average, compared with 15.4 percent for its peers, for the 10 years ended July 31. Mr. Yacktman says his new fund is a continuation of his previous work, and it has a similar sales structure. The only caveat from Morningstar: the ride might be a little bumpy for a while because Mr. Yacktman is now running a business and that is different from running a fund. **********The Oakmark Fund, also in Chicago, came out of the box very strongly when it began late last year. The fund was up 22.2 percent by July 31, taking first place among all growth funds. The fund's managers look for undervalued small companies, and they buy big chunks of stocks they find attractive. **********The first of the half-dozen funds that invest in emerging markets -- countries like Mexico, Chile and India -- celebrated its third birthday last week. One Morningstar recommendation in this group is the Montgomery Emerging Markets Fund in San Francisco. The fund has lost 4.1 percent since its inception in March, compared with a 5.7 percent drop for its peers. And the group has a reputation for closing off its funds to new investors when they are still quite small. **********Of the 24 adjustable-rate mortgage funds on the market, only Franklin's, which charges a 3 percent upfront load, has a three-year record. Until last year, investors who liked the category but would not pay a sale charge had no options. Among the no-loads that have hit the market since then, Morningstar analysts particularly like the Benham Adjustable Rate Government Securities Fund in Mountainview, Calif. Randy Merk, its manager, has demonstrated expertise by running the Benham Ginnie Mae Fund. **********Babson Enterprise 2 in Cambridge, Mass., was set up to catch the overflow from Babson Enterprise, which closed to new investors in January. The new fund buys larger companies than its predecessor -- in the $200 million to $700 million range, compared with less than $200 million -- but its manager, Peter Schliemann, has a solid record in small and medium-size companies. **********But a top-notch manager is not an automatic green light for investing in a new fund. Mario Gabelli, who runs a successful fund group, set up the Gabelli Small-Cap Growth in October 1991. The Denver-based Janus group recently began the Janus Growth-and-Income Fund, managed by Thomas Marsico, who also handles Janus 20 and the three Idex funds, and Janus Worldwide, run by James Craig, who also handles Janus Venture. **********Still, the Morningstar analysts have some reservations. \"I have no questions about those managers' abilities, but I have a lot of questions about whether they really have the time to run the funds themselves,\" Don Phillips said. WHAT'S IN A TRACK RECORD? **********SEASONED fund managers and successful funds usually go hand in hand, a recent study by Morningstar Inc., a mutual fund research group in Chicago, suggests. **********For the study, Morningstar divided its universe of 2,200 funds into five groups, based on the manager's tenure as of June 30. In part, the results simply reflect survival of the fittest. Funds that have had the same manager for at least a decade have assets that are five times larger on average than funds with rookie managers. But this also suggests that investors appreciate a proven manager. **********As measured by the portfolio turnover ratio -- the proportion of total assets that are sold each year -- the level of trading is relatively low among the veteran managers, implying they take a longer-term perspective than less-seasoned managers. **********And expenses decline as tenure increases, partly because funds run by veterans are larger and also because they apparently are run more efficiently."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/31/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-new-michelob-spots-seek-wider-appeal.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Michelob Spots Seek Wider Appeal", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; New Michelob Spots Seek Wider Appeal", "body_text": " **********The night used to belong to Michelob.

The women felt that abortion was sinful and followed the church's urging for a yes vote, as did two-thirds of the country. **********But abortion is again the center of an impassioned national debate and, like an increasing number of Irishwomen of all ages, Mrs. Casey and her friends, now about 50 years old and mothers of four or five children each, are being introspective again. **********Many women of Greystones, a suburban town ideologically between the conservatism of rural areas and the liberalism of Dublin, reject groups calling either for a categorical ban on abortion as murder or for abortion on demand as an inherent female right. **********The new debate among Irishwomen involves a changing attitude toward the traditional Catholic prohibition not only of abortion but also of contraception and divorce. Recent polls show that most Irish now favor some form of legal divorce, limited abortion and freedom to travel abroad for abortions and receive printed abortion information here.  'A Big Change' **********\"There is a big change in Ireland,\" Mrs. Casey said. \"Priests don't have the influence they used to.\" **********\"Particularly in the bedroom,\" said her neighbor, Mary Killeen, in a recent afternoon discussion at the Casey home. **********In Dublin, Frances Fitzgerald, head of the Council for the Status of Women, a middle-of-the-road amalgam of women's organizations, said: \"We've come a long way since 1983. I voted against it, but my mother was for it. Now she sees the need for flexibility.\" **********Abortion rose to haunt the nation again in February when a Supreme Court decision appeared to open new grounds for legal abortion. The court overruled a Government order forbidding travel to Britain for an abortion by a 14-year-old girl who said she had been raped. Opponents of abortion are calling for a new, ironclad constitutional amendment to ban abortion in all situations. **********On the other side of the issue, liberals want at least to make sure that women are free to receive abortion information in this country and the right to travel abroad, which was not guaranteed by the court decision. The liberals note that 4,000 Irishwomen a year go to Britain for abortions. **********The debate has become entangled in the referendum on June 18 on the Treaty on European Union, which has an abortion protocol that could bring changes in Irish law. The Government is gambling that the abortion dispute will not bring about defeat of the treaty, which it strongly favors, and has promised to deal with the question of legal abortions in a referendum and with new legislation in November. Europe's Highest Birth Rate **********The debate is taking place in a country of 3.5 million where, more so than in most of Europe, women stay in the home as childbearers. The birth rate is declining, but is still the highest in Europe. Only 30 percent of married Irishwomen have jobs outside the home, but the number is rising as the economy falters. **********But in recent years, despite Catholic teaching, married couples are using contraceptives. At the same time, out-of-wedlock births have risen from 1 in 60 births about 10 years ago to 1 in 10 today. **********\"We're all pro-life,\" Mrs. Casey said, \"but there have to be exceptions. It's not opening the floodgates like England or America. We have a different culture here. I don't know how you deal with limited abortion, but the life of the mother has to be taken into consideration. Legalize it in some situations, but not so it could be used as a contraceptive.\" **********Mrs. Killeen said: \"It's wrong for me, but why should I legislate for anybody else, who may be desperate? Half of these women wouldn't go if they had proper information and counseling. If they weren't so lonely.\" **********The women, all regular churchgoers, said the priests had not been haranguing them on abortion from the pulpit. \"I definitely think the church has lost it on contraception, on divorce, on abortion,\" Mrs. Casey said. **********Florence Fitzmaurice said of hard-line anti-abortion groups, \"The way they talk they don't love God at all.\" **********Mrs. Casey said of the hard-liners: \"The church is delighted with them.  They're doing all the work and taking all the flak.\" She said the resignation of Bishop Eamonn Casey of Galway, amid charges that he fathered a child, was an indication that church practices and policies needed change, in this case reconsideration of the rule of celibacy for clergy. **********Some critics of the church, including Government officials and priests, say the Casey situation has weakened the church's image as a moral authority. Changing Attitudes **********Mrs. Fitzgerald, 41 years old, who has a degree in social work from the London School of Economics, is considered too liberal by the conservatives and too conservative by the liberals. \"I'm pro-life,\" she said. \"I have three boys.\" **********The Irish families are changing, she said, using contraceptives, which are readily available to adults, but are illegal for sale to people younger than 18. \"Now there is family planning and smaller families are the norm,\" she said. **********She said she was a churchgoing Catholic, and added, \"I don't think the church has changed.\" **********\"But women's attitudes are changing,\" she said. \"We are demanding more from our church.

Its 52-week low is $20.25, posted in February of last year. **********\"We can maneuver through recessionary times,\" said Theodore Deikel, the chairman and chief executive. **********Fingerhut's success is built on selling merchandise on credit to shoppers who cannot get credit anywhere else. A few years ago, an issuer of Visa credit cards mailed applications to a sampling of Fingerhut's 13 million customers; 97 percent of the applicants were rejected as bad credit risks. **********So, Fingerhut sells more than 99 percent of its products on the installment plan. Its catalogues show a department-store range of products from black lingerie ($5.09 a month) to brass crucifixes ($4.69 a month) to air pumps for inflating tires ($7.79 a month). **********Maria L. Fernandez, a 53-year-old resident of Astoria, Queens, is still using the 127-piece flatware set she bought from Fingerhut nearly 20 years ago for $30. \"They make it so easy with the payments,\" she said. Analyzing the Risk **********After 44 years in business, Fingerhut has developed a sophisticated system to filter out bad credit risks. To glean clues, Fingerhut painstakingly analyzes the order form filled out by first-time customers. If a customer uses a pencil rather than a pen to order a color television, a red flag goes up. Failure to include a middle initial is another strike. Deadbeats often print, rather than sign, their names on the signature line, Fingerhut has learned over the years. Not having a home phone is another bad sign. **********The company also uses traditional credit reports in making a final judgment about a customer. **********Another way Fingerhut covers its risk is with monthly installment prices that translate into an effective annual interest rate of 24 percent, estimates Carol M. Clark, an analyst with John G. Kinnard & Company in Minneapolis. **********But analysts say the company does not make money as a financing operation. The high interest rate is needed to cover an equally high number of bad debts. Last year, the company set aside about 13.6 percent of its sales to cover bills it could not collect. In contrast, Mastercard International said 4.86 percent of its charges went bad in the third quarter of 1991; for all of 1990, Mastercard's bad-debt experience was 3.61 percent, a rate typical of the credit card industry. **********Wall Street has been concerned that Fingerhut's customer base makes the company vulnerable to increased bad debts in hard economic times. To allay those fears, Fingerhut deliberately ratcheted down its bad-debt level to 13.6 percent of sales in 1991, compared with 15 percent the year before. The company raised its credit standards and rejected more potential customers. **********\"We manage our bad debt, the economy doesn't,\" said Michael E. Qualen, the chief financial officer. \"We wanted to prove that this year.\" An Uncrowded Market **********Fingerhut does not have a lot of competition in the mailbox. \"The vast majority of catalogue retailers chase the upscale market,\" said Ms. Clark, the analyst. She said the typical Sears, J. C. Penney or Spiegel mail-order customer earns considerably more than a Fingerhut customer. **********\"The higher the income, the greater the propensity to shop by mail or phone,\" said Chester Dalzell, a spokesman for the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group in New York. Mr. Dalzell said time-pressed two-income couples like the convenience of shopping while lounging in bed or watching television. **********Despite its strong perfomance, Fingerhut's shares have a far lower price-earnings ratio than other mail-order retailers. The ratio, the price of a stock divided by its earnings per share, is a good measure of how investors view a stock's growth potential. **********\"This company is calling on a client base that is difficult for a lot of us to identify with,\" Ms. Clark said. **********Mr. Deikel, the company's chairman, said : \"You get the feeling that some people are elitist. Typically, our customer base does not get a lot of respect.\" **********That may begin to change as Fingerhut sets its sights on a slightly more affluent customer base through a joint venture with Montgomery Ward & Company. Last year, the two companies formed Montgomery Ward Direct to mail catalogues to Ward's 10 million credit card customers. Ward's chairman, Bernard F. Brennan, has said he expects the venture to be a $500 million business by 1995. **********Fingerhut is working to improve the quality of its merchandise, some of which has been somewhat shoddy in the past. Fingerhut recently appeared near the bottom of a Consumer Report customer satisfication survey on mail-order companies. Ms. Clark, the analyst, said the towels carried by Fingerhut several years ago let through more light than a window. **********About 72 percent of its merchandise is name-brand products like Sony Walkmans or Kitchen Aid mixers, up from 65 percent name-brand goods two years ago. **********Toasters, blenders and other housewares account for nearly 20 percent of Fingerhut sales. Electronics, including Pioneer car stereos and Yamaha electronic drum pads, make up 17 percent of sales. **********Fingerhut first offered shares, with an initial price of $16.50 each, in 1990, when it was spun off from the Primerica Corporation, a financial-services company. Primerica still owns about 40 percent of Fingerhut, but is gradually reducing its stake."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/06/business/at-work-aids-awareness-goes-to-the-office.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Noble", "pub_date": "1992-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 863, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At Work; AIDS Awareness Goes to the Office", "print_headline": "At Work; AIDS Awareness Goes to the Office", "body_text": " **********The Federal Government last week used the occasion of World AIDS Day to launch \"Business Responds to AIDS,\" a workplace awareness and education program.

A \"Manager's Kit\" available from the C.D.C. includes posters and pamphlets on a variety of topics, including how to devise workplace policies, AIDS and insurance and AIDS and the Americans with Disabilities Act. **********The Federal initiative arrives more than a decade into the AIDS epidemic and long after the workplace implications of AIDS were apparent, some critics say. And if the Government considers its job done by publishing handbooks and posters, it should think again. **********\"Government leadership is important. Their entry is welcome,\" said Carisa Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the AIDS Action Council, a Washington lobbying group for AIDS organizations. \"But if the plan is to put something in the mail and have it on people's desks, it won't have much of an impact.\" **********But if individuals have had some time and reason to assimilate the dimensions of the AIDS crisis, many companies have not. The initiative comes as awareness of protections guaranteed by the A.D.A., which went in effect this year, is growing. People with AIDS and H.I.V. infection are covered by the A.D.A. and are thus part of the group employers must \"reasonably accommodate\" on the job. **********Any company grappling for the first time with AIDS as an issue in the workplace is likely to find some comfort in the material pulled together by the coalition of concerned groups. \"What's new about this,\" says the C.D.C.'s Mr. Roper, \"is the partnership of a host of organizations that haven't seen themselves as active.\" **********One larger effect of \"Business Responds to AIDS,\" Mr. Roper says, may be that companies will become more sensitive to the needs of people with long-term or chronic illness. **********For help in providing workplace education on H.I.V./AIDS or establishing company policies, contact the following organizations: **********The Centers for Disease Control AIDS Hotline (800-342-AIDS; 800-243-7889: TDD service for the hearing impaired) provides confidential information, referrals and publications. **********The B.R.T.A.

Luis Catalino Gonzalez Rojas uncovered a stolen-car ring operating in his border zone last summer and promptly denounced the crime to his Army superiors. **********Those officers smiled indulgently and suggested he forget it. **********But in early September, when Colonel Rojas insisted on pushing his denunciations, the military high command gave him Paraguay's traditional treatment for whistle-blowers: barracks arrest, loss of command and a court-martial on charges of indiscipline, slander and breach of national security. **********After all, officials in this country in the heart of South America have long thrived on the institutionalized corruption surrounding smuggling. The Others Are Now in Jail **********But today, three months later, Colonel Rojas walks the streets a free man, turning down invitations to meals from an admiring populace. **********In contrast, four generals have lost their jobs and are facing trial on corruption charges. Two are already in jail, including Gen. Humberto Garcete, who resigned as Army Commander in October. **********On the legal level, Paraguay's long-sacrosanct military caste is falling afoul of a Constitution adopted in June that allows soldiers to be tried in civilian courts for crimes committed outside the line of duty. **********\"For the armed forces, it's a great defeat to their political power,\" said Bishop Mario M. Medina, who has long been a foe of military impunity. \"People are starting to lose their fear, they are starting to denounce corruption.\" **********In a country where generals have ruled virtually without interruption since independence in 1811, the case is hailed by newspapers as \"the trial of the century.\" Encouraged by street rallies against corruption, judges continued last month to make more assertions of civilian supremacy. Indictments Roll In **********First, a civilian judge indicted on corruption charges a Police general who served as Armed Forces Chief of Staff. Then, another judge indicted an Army colonel, who served as president of the state telephone company, on charges of electronic espionage; the colonel reportedly ran a sophisticated wiretap capable of recording 96 conversations simultaneously. **********\"This is new,\" said Luis Alberto Mauro, editor of ABC Color, which first published Colonel Rojas's denunciations in September. \"Never in Paraguayan history has a soldier gone before civilian justice. It's a rupture of the myth of being part of a privileged caste.\" **********Paraguay is emerging from military rule without an amnesty law for the military. Other countries in the region -- Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay -- adopted such laws to protect soldiers from trials over financial and human-rights abuses committed while in power. **********Although there is little support in Congress or among the people for an amnesty law, many people say the country needs one. **********\"A country that lives anchored in the past is never going to progress, is never going to develop,\" President Andres Rodriguez, an Army general, warned when asked about amnesty. **********But, deferring to growing public pressure for clean government, the President proudly cited his willingness to allow military officers to be tried in civilian courts, adding, \"Let's put corrupt people in the hands of justice so that the courts will really try them.\" Hello, World **********Paraguay's Constitution is part of a sea change in a society that for decades survived as an isolated patch of right-wing machismo. **********The coup in February 1989 that ended the 35-year rule of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner suddenly propelled Paraguay into the late 20th century. In the last year, Paraguay has approved a divorce law and suffered its first national teachers' strike, and now a woman is running for vice president in May's elections. **********Last May, Paraguay established relations with Russia. The conservative generals never recognized the Bolsheviks, and their isolationist predecessors never reached out to the Czars. Two years ago, for the first time, Paraguay's tiny Jewish minority celebrated Hanukkah with a public menorah-lighting ceremony in a main square in the capital. **********Long a pariah even among its neighbors, Paraguay is now part of Latin America's mainstream. In early December, Asuncion played host to the President of Mexico and the Foreign Minister of Colombia -- two countries that snubbed Paraguay during the Stroessner decades. Purging the Old Guard **********In the four years since General Stroessner's overthrow, Paraguay has seen a steady purge of his stalwarts, known as the dinosaurs. In May, four police officers who lead a Stroessner-era torture unit were convicted of homicide and sentenced to 25 years in prison. **********By 1995 the military's traditional economic mainstay -- smuggling luxury goods -- will end as Paraguay becomes a full member of a regional common market and lower taxes on imported goods take the profit out of smuggling. **********The generals who face criminal charges in connection with the smuggling did not surrender their privileges without firing a shot. On Sept. 28, gunmen raked the house of Colonel Rojas's lawyer with automatic-weapons fire. But 10 days later the lawyer, Hermes Rafael Salguier, counterattacked, releasing telephone-conversation transcripts that implicated General Garcete in hiring the gunmen. **********By this time, street protests demanding Colonel Rojas's release were almost daily occurrences. Educated by an unfettered press, virtually every Paraguayan seemed to know the details of the ring, which smuggled an estimated 400 stolen cars to Bolivia each year. Generals, whose official pay amounted to $1,500 a month, earned an additional $1,100 for each car that went through their zones. **********\"There was enough evidence for these generals to lose their jobs,\" said Guillermo Caballero Vargas, an independent who is campaigning for president with Maria Victoria Brusquetti as his running mate. \"That's a great step forward.

Formula for Dividing Property **********According to a formula agreed to by both sides, one-third of all movable property goes to Slovakia and two-thirds to the Czech Republic.

But the chill that pervades 27 Marshal Tito Street is deeper than the physical hardships of the Sarajevo siege. **********As winter sets in, there is a bleakness of mood that pervades the old apartment, something that transcends the need to burn old furniture for heating and the dwindling food reserves that have cut the diet for the family of six to the meanest levels. **********\"There is a new saying in Sarajevo,\" Mr. Dzirlo said the other day: \" 'We have all lived here together. We will all die here together.' \"  An Intolerable Life **********The pressures from the Serbian nationalists who have besieged the city for seven months, reducing much of it to rubble with their artillery and denying supplies of food, electricity and water to the 400,000 residents, have made life for many intolerable. **********Among the Dzirlos -- Sakir, a 44-year-old electrical engineer; Amra, a 42-year-old architect and interior designer, and their four children, two daughters and twin sons -- thoughts have turned to something that was once unthinkable: whether they should try to escape and join more than a million other Bosnian Muslims who have become refugees. **********\"Here is tragical situation, like Spania, when Ferdinand and Isabella say to Muslims, Jewish, 'Go out,' \" said Mr. Dzirlo, who traces his family's roots to the last of the Spanish Moors. He continued in his fractured English: \"But say me, where must we go if we cannot stay here -- to Libya or something? Maybe to Saudi Arabia or Kuwait? Are we complete rubbish people, to wander about for few hundred years, look for another place?\" Preparing for the Impossible **********For the moment, discussion of fleeing is moot, since the Bosnian Army defending Sarajevo has said it will permit no more evacuations, and the Serbian forces are seizing Muslims to exchange for Serbian prisoners. **********The family's worst nightmare is that the city's defenders will crack and Serbs will pour into the city, exacting terrible revenge on the residents who have held out against them for so long. But many families, including the Dzirlos, have concluded that even if the defense holds, it may be impossible to survive the winter, with insufficient food and heat and with no way to seal the gaping holes in their roof and walls that have been made by Serbian shells. **********To prepare for the moment when they can wait no longer, the family car has a jerrycan of gasoline, bought on the black market, and a new battery. Every document that could help the family resettle elsewhere has been pulled from dusty files, including the expired New York State driver's license that Mr. Dzirlo got during a year of graduate engineering studies at New York University.  A Funeral The Adults Mourn, The Young Dream **********The turning point for the Dzirlos (the name is pronounced JEER-low) came two weeks ago, after their next-door neighbor and close family friend, Hamid Pasic, a 79-year-old retired professor of medicine at the University of Sarajevo, was killed by a mortar during an afternoon stroll. **********As if to demonstrate that he, at least, would not be cowed by the shelling, Dr. Pasic had insisted on going out every day for a walk up and down Tito Street, visiting street-corner markets to see if there was any food that his modest pension could buy, consoling survivors. \"Everything will be O.K.,\" he would say, chuckling. **********After the mortar blast, it took two days for Mr. Dzirlo to trace his friend, telephoning police stations and morgues until officials at the old military hospital a mile away said a body fitting a description of the old man had been brought in. **********A funeral was arranged in an old Muslim cemetery at Vrabanusja, up cobblestone alleyways that lead to one of the oldest Muslim quarters. Mr. Dzirlo was one of a handful of mourners, glancing nervously toward Serbian gun positions on the hills. Allah's Will **********Afterwards, as he paced quickly back down the hill, the normally voluble Mr. Dzirlo was silent. The silence continued around the Dzirlos' cramped dining table, save for the studied cheeriness of Amra Dzirlo, who had laid on a late lunch of home-made quince juice and ustipak, the fried batter cakes that are a staple among the Muslims. **********After a while, Mr. Dzirlo gave voice to his thoughts. \"Who knows who will be next?\" he asked. \"You? Me? Amra? The children? Mrs. Pasic? We are alone now, except for Allah. If it is Allah's will, we will survive.\" **********Mr. Dzirlo's remarks set off a brief debate, conducted in English out of courtesy to this reporter, who met the Dzirlos in early June and has spent weeks with the family, following their progress in several dispatches. **********The 14-year-old twins, Mahir and Malik, were all for planning an escape. But Meliha, the 16-year-old daughter, demurred. \"What is the point to talk about things that are impossible?\" she asked. **********Lejla, her 10-year-old sister, asked for a translation. \"I would like to go to New York, maybe Hollywood,\" she said, reeling off names learned from television programs that have been mostly a memory since Serbian forces cut off electricity in July. The Crossroads Revenge Stains The Old Tolerance **********Sarajevo is at the northern fringe of the zone where the worlds of Europe and the Orient meet, and the city's ethnic heterogeneity is a testament to the fact that diversity was tolerated during much of its history. **********Serbian nationalists have now seized much of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a Serbian mini-state that as been \"ethnically cleansed\" of Muslims and Croats. But the Ottoman Turks, the Muslims who ruled Bosnia for four centuries until they were driven out in 1878, tolerated Roman Catholic Croats and Eastern Orthodox Serbs, as well as Jews. **********How completely the cultures blended is apparent after one mounts the darkened stone stairwell to the Dzirlos' second-floor apartment. **********Inside, there is a foyer where shoes are removed in the Muslim tradition, and carpets where the family kneels at 5 A.M. for the first of five daily prayers. Beyond is a living room filled with filigreed screens and tables from Turkey, the home of Amra Dzirlo's ancestors, and delicate oil paintings of wooden vessels with graceful sails moving down the Nile. **********But along with these, there is also a Viennese grand piano dating to the 1880's. On nights of intensive shelling, Meliha, considered one of Sarajevo's most promising young pianists, plays Beethoven sonatas and the twins play classical guitar. **********In such a home there is no need to belabor points that Muslims in Sarajevo are often keen to make: that by standards of education and professional skills and cosmopolitan tastes, they have no reason to feel inferior to the Serbs, and that while they observe traditions of Islam engendered in the Middle East, they consider themselves no less European than, say, Germans or Italians, and in any case no more strangers here than Serbs. **********As a matter of ethnicity the point is irrefutable since, unlike the Dzirlos, most Muslims in Sarajevo are Slavs, like the Serbs. The Slavic Muslims converted to Islam under Ottoman rule, filled many of the civil-service positions under the Ottomans and developed into a class of educated, urban landholders, more and more distinct from the predominantly rural, agricultural and less educated Serbs.  'Genocide' Against the 'Filth' **********But the Serbian nationalists accuse the Muslims of being traitors to the Slavic people, and such denunciations have been used to justify, and perhaps to inspire, the \"ethnic cleansing\" that has driven more half of Bosnia's Muslims from their homes, and killed and wounded tens of thousands. **********The Serbian militiamen who have done much of the killing refer to Muslims as borije, or filth, and say their job will be done when Muslims revert to being Serbs, or are eliminated. **********To Sakir Dzirlo, this amounts to \"genocide,\" requiring Muslims to fight back as long as it takes to avenge what has happened in the war. But Amra Dzirlo takes the lead in citing the Koran's teachings on tolerance. \"Tomorrow, I forget all, if war is stop,\" she said. Interethnic 'Honesty' **********What all the Dzirlos agree on is that Sarajevo should be neither a Muslim nor a Serbian city, but a place where all groups co-exist. **********Within the family, the war is seen as being not so much between between Serbs and Muslims and Croats as between raja, a Bosnian term meaning honest people of any ethnic group, and papak, literally the hoof of a farm animal, a disparaging phrase to refer to people hostile to urban mingling. Few things please Mr. Dzirlo more than meeting a Serbian friend and proclaiming: \"This man is raja.\" **********In contrast, he denounces Radovan Karadzic, the Sarajevo psychiatrist who is leader of the Serbian nationalist party in Bosnia. Mr. Karadzic came to Sarajevo as a boy from a mountain village in Montenegro, the smaller of the two remaining republics of the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav federation, and Mr. Dzirlo delights in mocking him: \"Karadzic is papak, he come from mountains, from sheep, and he want to be king.\"  A Gadfly Beseeching Serbs, Beseeching Bush **********Until the outbreak of the war, Mr. Dzirlo took little interest in politics. As long as Yugoslavia was under Communist rule, Mr. Dzirlo, like many professional people here, concentrated on his work and his family, privately disparaging the Communist system but avoiding open opposition. **********But since the siege began, the apartment on Tito Street has become a sort of unofficial citizen's bureau. Before the Serbian forces cut off telephone links with the outside world, Mr. Dzirlo tried to dial President Bush, President Francois Mitterand and other international figures, seeking their intercession in the war. **********\"My name is Sakir Dzirlo, and I am writing to you in the name of all honest citizens who stayed in ruins in Sarajevo,\" he wrote to Mr. Bush in June. \"This is crime war from robbers of Serbia, Montenegro and Yugoslav Army on citizens of Sarajevo. You could stop this holocaust but you did not, and we don't know why.\" **********In the early weeks of the siege, when the Serbian officers commanding Yugoslav Army units shelling the city were still in nearby barracks, Mr. Dzirlo walked to the barracks, argued his way in and confronted Gen. Milutin Kukanjac, the army commander. **********\"What do you think you are doing?\" he asked, according to a friend from Tito Street who was present. \"Are you mad or something?\" The Children The Cruel Lessons Learned Under Fire **********For the Dzirlo children, the war has meant an end to schooling. But it has not meant an end to learning: their mother takes them to libraries and borrows books from friends on languages and science and literature, reminding the children of the Koran's insistence on the need for study. Anything about the United States is encouraged, particularly books dealing with American liberties. **********\"It is reason why America go straight up, in economy, in politics, because you are watching individual,\" Mr. Dzirlo said. **********Education of a more unusual kind has come from dodging from doorway to doorway under shellfire, and dashing across intersections to avoid Serbian snipers. **********Mahir and Malik have been on the streets almost every day, usually accompanying their father in a daily round of fetching water from the mosques, visiting Mr. Dzirlo's ailing mother, who lives nearby, lining up for bread and scouring the city for increasingly scarce bundles of wood. **********Now, when the neighborhood is hit by a shell, the boys identify it instantly. \"That was PAM,\" Malik said one day, using the Yugoslav military term for 40-millimeter antiaircraft guns.  Making Do for Food **********On other occasions, when sniper bullets have whizzed overhead, the twins have talked like battle veterans, advising on routes that narrow the snipers' field of fire. \"Fast here!\" they will shout, springing across a roadway, or \"Keep down!\" **********Usually, the daughters stay inside, helping their mother, and it is to them, as much as to the men, that the family will owe its survival if it makes it through until spring. For months, they have been preparing stocks of food, discreetly, so as not to stir resentment among neighbors. **********They will not estimate how long they can hold out on their reserves of flour and cooking oil, tea and toilet paper and candles and soap. A hint has come from Meliha, but it has been grim. \"Until January, if we are still alive by then,\" she said, with a grim chuckle. **********It is a tribute to Amra Dzirlo's ingenuity that the family has anything to eat but bread, pasta and rice. She has scoured the city for rose petals and herb grasses and fruits of every kind, apples and quinces and pears, to make jams and preserves, as well as delicacies like kiflice, a sweet cake. Generosity Through Sacrifice **********Visitors are treated to generous snacks and meals, and she waves away compliments as if anything less would be a dereliction of hospitality. **********Often, visitors eat alone. Even at mealtimes, the family's habit is to say that they have already eaten, although the absence of any dirty plates suggests otherwise, as does the fact that Amra Dzirlo has lost more than 30 pounds during the siege. **********But it is part of the protocol of the siege, and of the Dzirlos' family pride, that visitors accept the hospitality without demurral. Sooner than eat herself, Amra Dzirlo will frequently offer a second helping. 25 Funerals, and More **********Little is said about the Dzirlos' economic losses in the war, which include the disappearance of tens of thousands of dollars in savings from the Sarajevo branches of banks with headquarters in Serbia. **********The family has lost count of relatives and friends and neighbors who have been killed, including friends of the children. Mr. Dzirlo has attended at least 25 funerals, and those were only the ones that he could get to when he was not at work. **********His job, as an executive of the Sarajevo electricity utility, Elektroprivreda, has been a source of relentless frustration. Every time transmission towers and transformer stations attacked by the Serbian forces are repaired, they are attacked again, so the city never has more than a fraction of its peacetime electrical power, and often none at all. **********In September, the utility's headquarters was destroyed by fire, along with its records. Now, going to work is largely a formality for Sakir Dzirlo. **********Before the war, Amra Dzirlo also juggled her career with her family; now, like most Sarajevans, she is out of work. **********\"We are sitting and we are watching,\" Mr. Dzirlo said.  'A Little Trick' Goes Awry **********Mostly, his inventiveness goes into schemes to keep the household working. Candles have been made from strips of polyethylene cut from lighting fixtures in abandoned buildings, or from shoelaces floating in cooking oil. To assure getting news after the batteries in their transistor radio ran out, an old car battery has been hooked to a Sony Walkman. One of the children tunes into Radio Sarajevo or the British Broadcasting Corporation, listens through the headphones and relays items to the others. **********Sometimes, Mr. Dzirlo's efforts go awry, as they did when he announced that he had organized \"a little trick\" that would divert a small amount of emergency electricity to the family from a local distribution board. **********The plan was for the power to be fed to the home of a friendly neighbor, from there to Dr. Pasic's apartment, and by a cable through Dr. Pasic's back window to the Dzirlos. Each apartment along the way would get power, so neighbors would not accuse Mr. Dzirlo of abusing his position at the utility. **********But the scheme went wrong when a technician routed the power to an apartment of a family the Dzirlos hardly knew. Mr. Dzirlo, frantic, ended up stringing cables from a balcony overlooking Tito Street, with a crowd of eager onlookers shouting queries about where the power was coming from. **********By the time he had strung cables to every neighbor who needed mollifying, there was only enough left for the Dzirlos to light a single table lamp and the children's fish tank. **********Pretty soon, even that supply failed. Weeks later, the family was still laughing over the incident."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/06/world/jaipur-journal-maharajahs-ask-benefits-saying-they-re-entitled.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-11-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 956, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jaipur Journal; Maharajahs Ask Benefits, Saying They're Entitled", "print_headline": "Jaipur Journal; Maharajahs Ask Benefits, Saying They're Entitled", "body_text": " **********Were it not for the central procession of marble columns, the scattering of Brobdingnagian silver-encrusted wine vats, a Lalique table and a warehouse worth of overstuffed furniture, Bhawani Singh could comfortably play a set of mixed doubles in his living room.

Now, there is some chance he may get them back. **********For centuries, from palaces like this one, a few hundred maharajas reigned over their domains, some a good deal larger than England. When India attained independence from the British in 1947, the Government, in recompense for absorbing these princely states, allowed the maharajas to retain their titles, a place in state protocol rankings and privy purses, which in effect were living subsidies from the state.  'The Cream of Society' **********When Indira Gandhi decided to push the country more firmly toward socialism, she had Parliament abolish by constitutional amendment all princely titles and privileges, and ended state subsidies to hundreds of the country's royals. Now, some of them want it all back and will soon have their chance to try. **********\"The cream of society was completely eliminated,\" said Yuvraj Digvijay Sinh, who claims title as the maharaja of Wankaner, in the western state of Gujarat. \"They followed the socialistic system of society and eliminated the class of people with background and titles and completely brought chaos to the country. Now, most of the politicians are criminals. We are trying to restore these things. The amount is so measly. Four crores only,\" or about $1.5 million. **********India's Supreme Court is scheduled to turn its attention soon to the case of the maharajas and whether Mrs. Gandhi's constitutional changes were in fact constitutional. In a country where average annual incomes barely rise above $300, the plight of the maharajas is scarcely pricking the public conscience. But for Mr. Sinh, the matter is deadly serious. **********\"The moral, ethical, compassionate and judicial values were at that time bypassed in a move of a so-called socialistic reform,\" he said. **********The year Mrs. Gandhi pushed her constitutional amendments through Parliament, two maharajas, the Nawab of Maler Kotla in the Punjab and the Maharaja of Kurundwad in Maharashtra, filed suit against her seeking to overturn the new provisions. For two decades the case meandered through India's courts, known for their lethargy, until it finally settled onto the calendar of the Supreme Court. In that time, the Nawab has died and the Kurundwad Maharaja turned 88. **********Soli Jehangir Sorabjee, a lover of jazz, a former Attorney General and one of New Delhi's most distinguished barristers, is arguing the case on behalf of the maharajas. Mr. Sorabjee is not sanguine about the outcome. **********\"Before the court is the question of the validity of the constitutional amendment itself,\" he said. \"You can't challenge this amendment unless you can assert that it damages or destroys the basic structure of the Constitution. In this day and age, I don't think the Supreme Court will say that privy purses are part of the basic structure of the Constitution.\" **********But other maharajas, like Mr. Singh in Jaipur, have long since abandoned nostalgia for past glories and have accommodated themselves to the modern Indian state. \"We were the first family to turn our palace into a hotel,\" he said, referring to the Rambagh Palace, the old family home, now an expensive tourist hotel. **********Still, Mr. Singh embosses his stationery with his family's gold crest, signing letters the Maharaja of Jaipur, maneuvers about in a car with a flashing red light on the roof and, best of all from his point of view, still lives in the Jaipur Palace, layers of marble-floored chambers, pillared colonnades, ramps and stone staircases, all attended by liveried servants. **********Now many of the palace's 1,500 rooms have been turned over to a museum, or rented out to the Government, and \"only a very small part of it is used by us,\" he confessed. **********A former lieutenant colonel in the Indian Army, Mr. Singh once ran as a candidate for Parliament for the Congress Party in 1989, but was thrashed by his opponent, a member of the hard-line Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party. \"I made a mistake and chose the urban area, and Jaipur has never been a Congress area,\" Mr. Singh said with a sigh. \"Well, I'm still Bubbles.\" Behind the Name Bubbles **********As the thunder of monkeys scampering across a tin sheet roof echoed through the cavernous room, Mr. Singh explained the source of the nickname. **********\"Some time ago, a holy man came to the palace gate\" for alms, he said. \"But he was turned away. So he cursed the family, saying there would be no male heirs for two generations. And do you know, he was right. My grandfather was adopted, and so was my father. I was the first one to be born naturally to my father. He ordered so much champagne to celebrate that the English nurse said the baby should be called Bubbles.

Normalcy, they say, has undergone an evolution. **********Once the harbinger of the Christmas season to follow, when retailers earn the bulk of their profits, the back-to-school season no longer serves as the merchant's crystal ball. Changes in school calendars and shopping patterns, as well as the ability to replenish inventory in three or four days, have diminished the importance of August on the retail calendar, retailers and analysts say. More Sales in the Fall Now **********\"We used to use August as the bellwether of critical fourth-quarter sales, but now August sales are pushed into September and even October,\" said Janet Magnano, a retail analyst at Burnham Securities. \"The business has become more evenly distributed than it used to be.\" **********The sluggish economy is intensifying the shift, as financially strapped consumers are choosing to buy things when they need them instead of on a seasonal basis, said Mike Searles, president of Kids \"R\" Us, the children's clothing division of Toys \"R\" Us. **********Of course, the weeks before school are still critical for stores like Mr. Searles's, which primarily sell children's clothing or stationery. \"This is our Christmas right now,\" he said. **********Retailers also say sales have spread out because students postpone their back-to-school buying until they see what their peers are wearing, pushing sales further into the fall. And as merchants become better able to control their inventory, they buy less, knowing that they can replenish their stocks quickly if the need arises. **********Gary Prushansky, director of marketing for the Bic Corporation, which does a booming business in pens this time of year, said retailers placed their orders later this year and bought only for the back-to-school season. In previous years, retailers bought more Bic pens than they expected to sell during back-to-school to take advantage of special pricing promotions Bic has for the season. **********Despite retailers' caution, Mr. Prushansky said Bic would record strong sales gains. Instead of keeping stock in the warehouse, retailers have been using computerized technology to replace merchandise. **********\"Everybody has a way of doing business now that works on having less inventory,\" Mr. Prushansky said. **********Such strict controls on inventory should help retailers avoid the price cuts that have been used during the recession to stimulate sales at the expense of profit margins, analysts say. The prudent strategy may serve them well, given low levels of consumer confidence and income growth. A Later Labor Day **********This year's late Labor Day weekend, which falls a week after it did last year, will further emphasize the new trend. Most back-to-school buying occurs in the week before and the week after the holiday, and many retailers say sales were drowsier than normal in the first two weeks of August. **********\"More back-to-school spending will fall in September than usual,\" said Orren F. Knauer, vice president of investor relations at the Kmart Corporation. \"But even without the late Labor Day, spending patterns around back-to-school have changed.\" As a result, he said, Kmart's August sales growth is likely to be somewhat less than the increase it posted in July, traditionally a slow sales month, while September sales will probably surge. **********More fundamental changes to the calendar include year-round school in a growing number of school districts, particularly in Florida and California, where several chains have strong presences. And even in school districts that operate on a more traditional calendar, some start before Labor Day while others wait until it has passed. In some school districts in Texas, for example, school started the third week of August, while in Minnesota, schools open after the holiday. **********\"We're doing well, although probably not as well as we had expected up to this point,\" said Gary Vasques, senior vice president for marketing at Caldor, a chain of discount stores in the Northeast. \"But we feel that with the late Labor Day and lots of schools waiting to open till after that, it's going to come in September.\" The Safe Staple **********Denim is de rigueur and school supplies with an environmental conscience are staples in every backpack. Products featuring characters on the hit television show \"Beverly Hills 90201\" are still best sellers, as are spinoffs from movies like \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"Batman Returns.\" **********Sales of denim, Mr. Vasques says, regardless of color or style, were rocketing far beyond the company's plans, a trend echoed by other retailers. **********Blue jeans and denim shirts and anything with Western accents like fringe are best sellers at stores across the country. \"When the economy is unstable or a little rocky, Western becomes a fashion force because it's a safe, staple American look,\" explains Carol Edwards, publicity manager for men's and children's merchandising at J. C. Penney. **********Overall sales have increased over last year, but have still fallen short of expectations. \"From what I understand, so far August hasn't exactly been a barn-burner,\" said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, an industry newletter. \"It's definitely better than last year, but frankly I think most retailers were anticipating even more than that.\" **********In a survey of 600 mothers by Tactical Retail Solutions, a New York-based retail consulting firm, almost 60 percent said they planned to spend the same amount of money on back-to-school clothes and supplies as they did last year. Almost 30 percent said they would spend more, while 13.6 percent said they would spend less. **********\"We expect that to translate into moderately positive sales gains among discounters and category killers like Kids 'R' Us,\" said Isaac Lagnado, principal of the firm. \"But traditional department stores are not likely to get much of a bounce from back-to-school spending.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/01/business/company-news-2100-jobs-to-be-cut-by-alcoa.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1992-07-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 237, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2,100 Jobs To Be Cut By Alcoa", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; 2,100 Jobs To Be Cut By Alcoa", "body_text": " **********The Aluminum Company of America said yesterday that it was eliminating 2,100 jobs to trim operations and increase efficiency at 21 of its worldwide business divisions. **********The nation's largest aluminum producer will take a second-quarter after-tax charge of $40.6 million for severance payments.

It is modeled after Navy antisubmarine warfare probes, which are attached to ships by a pair of copper wires and dangle in the water.

The figure was confirmed by intelligence officials and company executives who asked not to be identified. **********The Bodos, one of the biggest aboriginal tribes of the region, want a separate state. **********The wave of extortion began in the late 1980's by the United Liberation Front of Assam, which seeks an independent state. **********The rebel organization sought and exacted agreements from major companies that they would set up modern hospitals, schools and colleges. **********According to some estimates, nearly $14 million was extorted from different companies in 1989 and 1990. Some officials say that two or three times this amount was secretly paid to the front and to the Bodos. **********Support for the Assam rebels abated after the front was weakened by Indian Army strikes in 1990 and 1991. The group was also weakened by a split over the question of settling its demands within the Indian Constitution. **********The industry is also under pressure from Naga insurgents in the southeastern part of Assam, where tea grows in the Barak Valley, and from the Hmar Peoples Convention, which says it represents the interests of the tiny Hmar population. The convention is the latest rebel group to form in the northeast. **********According to Hemen Barooah, the president of the Indian Tea Association, whose members have more than 200 plantations in Assam, the Tea Security Force would coordinate its work with the local Assam police and military officials. It would be created by recruiting people who have retired from the police and the army, and the force would technically be commanded by the state's top police official. **********The tea companies would finance the force at an estimated cost of $1.3 million a year. State government approval is necessary for the security plan. A senior official said a decision had not yet been made."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/18/world/yeltsin-starting-3-day-china-visit.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1992-12-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 524, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "YELTSIN STARTING 3-DAY CHINA VISIT", "print_headline": "YELTSIN STARTING 3-DAY CHINA VISIT", "body_text": " **********President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia arrived here today for a three-day visit that is intended to cement economic ties with China and reassert a working relationship that was thrown into doubt by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the abandonment of Communism there. **********\"We have to open a new era in relations between Russia and China,\" **********Mr. Yeltsin told reporters after he and his entourage of 100 Russian officials stepped off three private jets at a Beijing airport this morning. **********Mr. Yeltsin will meet with the Communist Party leader, Jiang Zemin, but he comes to China as an economic broker, not a political one, and as a head of state, not as a Communist Party leader. His task is to boost economic relations, beginning with plans to sign about 20 agreements that seal cooperation between Beijing and Moscow in a range of fields, from military matters and nuclear power pacts to cultural and scientific exchanges. **********The last Russian leader to visit was Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who arrived in May 1989 to mark the formal end of the three-decade-long Chinese-Soviet split. Mr. Gorbachev's visit was particularly significant because it came during the Tiananmen Square democracy movement, which welcomed him as a hero. Past Criticism of Yeltsin **********Indeed, Mr. Gorbachev's visit gave a new stimulus to the democracy movement. The Chinese Army crackdown a few weeks later, and the rise of the hard-liners in Beijing, led to the resurgence of mutual suspicion between Moscow and Beijing. Chinese leaders have been especially scathing -- in private -- about Mr. Yeltsin's role in the disintegration of Soviet Communism. **********Today, however, Mr. Yeltsin does not represent a bubbling democracy for young Chinese intellectuals and students, as Mr. Gorbachev did. While some Chinese admire him, others regard him as a symbol of the dangers of overthrowing a Communist system. When they look at Russia today, they see not so much freedom and democracy as chaos and economic decline. **********For now, China is much more economically robust than Russia, and Mr. Yeltsin is likely to press Chinese officials for greater financial assistance, more weapons purchases and ample supplies of meat, shoes, warm coats and other consumer goods. **********The nominal centerpiece of the visit is the signing of a joint declaration that will lay down the principles of the new friendship. No longer will the relationship be based on Communist brotherhood, but rather on a more pragmatic interaction between two governments. **********China is expected to extend a small loan of tens of millions of dollars during the trip. Russian officials have also said their Government plans to continue selling weapons and other military equipment to China. The Chinese have already paid $1 billion for two dozen SU-27 jet fighters and are reportedly interested in MIG-31 jets, Kilo-class submarines and bombers. **********Among the most visible signs of the growing economic relationship is the increase in trade, which totaled $3.9 billion for 1991. In Beijing, for instance, Russian entrepreneurs crowd the free markets jams as they stroll along the streets with their giant bags stuffed with clothing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/16/business/the-new-faces-of-wall-street-92.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Faison", "pub_date": "1992-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The New Faces of Wall Street '92", "print_headline": "The New Faces of Wall Street '92", "body_text": " **********A fresh crop of recruits has arrived on Wall Street, one of the few areas in the New York region that is hiring after years of retrenchment. The new faces are older and more experienced than those hired in the past, and, if David Nelson is any example, they bring a more lucrative list of potential clients with them. **********Mr. Nelson, 43 years old, was once lead guitarist for the Turtles, one of the mop-top rock groups that characterized the rebellious flavor of the late 1960's. Last year, he became a broker at Merrill Lynch & Company, and by tapping his acquaintances in the music business, he is likely to develop a fuller book of clients than most first-year brokers. Opportunity Knocking Again **********\"I've already been able to make inroads with record companies that need business and financial advice,\" said Mr. Nelson, who talks about cash-flow, pension and insurance issues with the assurance of a knowledgeable insider. \"I don't want to limit myself to the music business, but that is obviously my area of expertise. **********\"I wanted to make this move back in 1987,\" added Mr. Nelson, who worked most recently as a record producer. \"But the opportunity wasn't there,\" he said, after the stock market crashed in October of that year. **********It is now. Several brokerage firms are hiring more entry-level brokers than they did a year ago. While limited, this expansion is one of the few economic bright spots in the New York region, where 40,000 jobs are expected to evaporate in the next few years. **********If a silver lining to a recession is that the quality and size of job-applicant pools swell, Wall Street firms are in the enviable position of being able to take advantage of the talent fleeing hard times in other businesses. It is not so much that the rash of new applicants are unemployed, recruiting executives say, but rather that many are finding their careers stalled in depressed areas like banking and financial consulting. **********Richard A. Ferdinand also joined Merrill recently, 12 years after he left the securities industry. Mr. Ferdinand enjoyed the independence of working alone at the investment banking firm he set up in New Jersey, he said, but found that the recession and growing service requirements eventually limited what he could do. **********\"As the business cycle changes, here I am back on the Street,\" Mr. Ferdinand, 48, said. **********Working as a broker at a larger firm, he explained, allows him the resources to provide financial planning for a wider scope of companies, while his experience running his own business gives him a quick rapport with clients, whose concerns he can readily understand. **********\"I have enough breadth to go to someone and say, 'Here's what I would do,' \" he said. A Growing Pool **********Paradoxically, Wall Street's recent success -- reflected in record profits at brokerage houses and in new stock market highs -- is drawing so many job seekers that despite the hiring, some firms are turning away many more applicants than they did a year ago. For Wall Street's big firms, the result is a richer choice of applicants for each available position. **********\"We've seen a dramatic change in the people coming in,\" said Robert J. Dwyer, who oversees recruitment at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. In 1991, Mr. Dwyer said, the average broker recruited by Dean Witter was 36 years old, with six years of related experience. Only a year earlier, Dean Witter's average new broker was 26 years old, with a year of experience. **********Dean Witter expects to hire 1,000 account executives this year, compared with 600 in 1991. Shearson Lehman Brothers expects to hire between 600 and 1,000 brokers, compared with 400 last year. Prudential Securities' training program has accepted more than 400 brokers this year, compared with just 97 last year. Concentrated in Retail Area **********This expansion, while limited mostly to the retail side of the business, is giving the securities industry its first boost in employment in three years. According to the Securities Industry Association, employment in the industry totaled about 214,000 at the end of 1991, compared with 210,000 a year before. Figures for early 1992 are not yet available. **********From its peak just before the stock market crash in 1987, employment on Wall Street is still down by 50,000, and in the narrow streets of lower Manhattan, lunchtime crowds are still palpably smaller than they were a few years ago. **********Part of the focus at firms in this slimmer, sleeker environment is to accumulate assets under management from individuals as a financial ballast to the unpredictable, volatile nature of trading securities. **********Several brokerage firms are both expanding the training of their own retail brokers and stressing the value of building a long-term relationship with each client instead of relying on quick trading commissions. **********\"It's no longer 'get a hunch and sell a bunch,' \" said Linda Marcelli, branch manager of Merrill Lynch's main New York office. She supervises more than 160 financial advisers, including Mr. Nelson. \"It's long-term planning that we're looking for.\" **********Prudential Securities recently hired a new executive vice president, A. Laurence Norton, to oversee recruitment, training and retention of the firm's financial advisers. **********One of the advantages of the older, more seasoned crop of new brokers coming into Prudential, Mr. Norton said, is that they generally are people with some financial experience, people who have some understanding of the securities business. **********\"These are the kind of people who can make an impact a little quicker,\" Mr. Norton said. Some customers are more comfortable entrusting their investments to an older broker, he added, although more sophisticated customers tend to judge a financial consultant by rate of success and not by age. **********For brokerage houses, another bonus of the higher caliber of fresh recruits is that instead of starting from scratch, new brokers often come to their jobs with a list of potential clients from their previous work. **********With the ability of Mr. Nelson to tap his contacts in the music and film businesses, which are traditionally not known for their sophisticated money management, he can parlay them into a promising list of clients. **********\"The amounts of money coming in were astonishing,\" said Mr. Nelson of what he saw in his years in the music industry. \"And there was no money management at all.\" **********Sam Masucci, a colleague of Mr. Nelson, arrived at Merrill after three years at Metropolitan Life, where he sold insurance but felt constricted by his limited ability there to provide clients with comprehensive financial planning. **********On his first day at Merrill, he said, he landed 18 clients that he had known from Metropolitan Life. **********\"Not bad for a first day,\" joked Ms. Marcelli, his boss at Merrill. **********\"Let's see if he can keep it up.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/07/business/company-news-continental-air-bidders-get-deadline.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1992-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 392, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Continental Air Bidders Get Deadline", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Continental Air Bidders Get Deadline", "body_text": " **********A Federal bankruptcy judge yesterday set a deadline of Nov. 9 for all bidders for Continental Airlines to submit their proposals in an effort to move along the airline's attempt to emerge from the protection of the court. **********Robert Ferguson, the chief executive of Continental, also said that the deadline was intended \"to provide an absolutely level playing field for each of the indentified interested parties.\" **********Interest in the airline continued to heat up yesterday as Air Canada and a group of Texas investors sweetened their bid of $400 million, to $425 million. **********Also Aeromexico, one of the major airlines in Mexico, joined in the bid that is being led by Charles Hurwitz, a Houston-based investor who has built a large empire through takeovers by his holding company, Maxxam Inc. **********Three other groups have also entered the bidding; an investor group led by Alfredo Brener, a Houston-based businessman and Scandinavian Airlines System; a partnership led by Lufthansa Airlines and Marvin Davis, the West Coast investor, and a group led by former Continental Executives teamed with Benefit Concepts of New York. **********Under the plan approved by Judge Helen Balick of the United States Bankruptcy Court in Houston, the bids have to be submitted to the Continental board by Nov. 2 and the board is supposed to select the best bid by Nov. 6.

Private Talks Under Way **********Back-channel discussions are already under way between the congress's secretary general, Cyril Ramaphosa, and Roelf Meyer, the Cabinet minister in charge of constitutional affairs, aimed at removing obstacles to full-scale negotiations. **********The Government also confirmed today that African National Congress has been meeting informally with senior military officers, including the chief of military intelligence, Lieut. Gen. C. P. van der Westhuizen. **********A report today in a Johannesburg newspaper, The Star, cited unnamed sources as saying one topic at these meetings was the danger posed by present and former military officers bent on sabotaging the transition to black rule. **********The threat of such a secret network -- commonly referred to as a \"third force\" -- on the fringes of the military has long worried both black and white leaders. **********Lately it has been the focus of new attention because of sensational charges by a former military intelligence officer, Col. Gert Hugo, who turned on the military after being court-martialed for theft. **********Colonel Hugo is the most senior of several defectors in recent years who have charged that a network of rogue military officers is conducting assassinations and fomenting violence among blacks to undermine the transition to majority rule. **********His description of the \"third force\" was reported earlier this week in the Christian Science Monitor and the London newspaper, The Independent, and received wide attention here. **********Although more than half of the 114,000-member South African Police force is black, there are fewer than 100 blacks among the 5,000 commissioned officers. Until today, they have been barred from the rank of general. **********The force, already widely mistrusted in black townships, has suffered a series of humiliations in recent weeks. Report by British Experts **********Last month a team of British experts headed by Peter A. J. Waddington, director of criminal justice studies at the University of Reading in England, issued a scathing report on police ineptitude in handling the massacre of more than 40 blacks in Boipatong township. **********A few days later the country's most prominent independent pathologist, Dr. Jonathan Gluckman, opened his files on more than 200 cases of prisoners who died in police custody. Most, he said, had been murdered by policemen. **********In the last two months South African judges have dismissed charges in two mass murder cases, complaining that the police forced confessions and mishandled evidence. **********Most critics agree that the police force has never entirely recovered from its design as a white-run institution intended to enforce apartheid. **********Mr. Kriel said that several black officers would begin a special month-long training course next month and be promoted to major generals if they passed. He said the Government was automatically raising the seniority of black officers who have been systematically denied promotions because of their race. **********Independent experts said the promotion of blacks would have an important symbolic impact on blacks who now see the force as defending only white interests. Appearance of Impartiality **********\"The new South African police force is going to have to be impartial not only in practice but in appearance,\" said Mr. Nathan. **********He cautioned, however, that blacks who are eligible for high police rank are themselves products of the system. **********\"These men may be imbued with the attitudes of the institution,\" Mr. Nathan said. \"The fact that they are black doesn't necessarily mean they are more enlightened.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/16/business/dow-up-12.30-as-records-keep-tumbling.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1992-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 642, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Up 12.30 as Records Keep Tumbling", "print_headline": "Dow Up 12.30 as Records Keep Tumbling", "body_text": " **********Records kept coming yesterday in the stock market in a rush of trading that made the session one of Wall Street's busiest ever.

Palates and passions are stoked with anticipation, not unlike the cigar lover's or the oenophile's. **********Kalidasa, the greatest of Sanskrit poets, who wrote in the first century before Christ, often interrupted his paeans to love and the beauty of women to dwell on the mango. In his Rtusamharam, The Gathering of the Seasons, he lamented: Seeing the mango trees in full bloom, the traveler desolate, parted from his beloved wife, closes his eyes, grieves, sheds tears covers his nose with one hand and cries aloud. A Passion Beyond Belief **********Khushwant Singh, the country's most prolific and eclectic writer, has written, \"Indians love mangoes with a passion that surpasses belief.\" And Indians wrangle over their favorites, dissecting the merits of Avvallas, Tota-paris, Chaperoos or Langras with the connoisseur's disdain for the dilettante. **********Such gustatory discrimination has molded the life of Mr. Malik, one of Rataul's largest mango growers, and, for the most part, that of his fellow villagers. \"Ninety percent of the people of this village produce mangoes,\" he said. \"We have developed hundreds of kinds of mangoes.\" **********India produces 60 percent of the world's 15.7 million tons of mangoes. **********Rataul, buried among the wheat and sugar cane fields of northern Uttar Pradesh, about 45 miles northeast of New Delhi, is home to about 15,000 people. Everywhere, in courtyards, along pathways, filling fields, are mango trees, their branches dripping with the heavy green pendants of ripening fruit. Here and there, old men with small hammers fashion wooden crates that will hold Rataul's harvest, the famous Rataul mango, prized by mango aficionados throughout the country. **********A bony, somber man, Mr. Malik was born to mangoes. \"My father grew mangoes,\" he said. \"And his father, and his father.\" **********He went on to marry Naheed ul-Haq, the daughter of the king of mangoes. **********\"In 1958,\" Mr. Malik said, \"Jawaharlal Nehru\" -- India's first Prime Minister -- \"named him king of the mangoes. He founded many kinds of mangoes and collected 550 different mangoes altogether. I was lucky to marry his daughter.\" **********The mango king, Anwar ul-Haq, brought Rataul its fame by developing the Rataul mango, a teardrop of succulent yellow-orange fruit that came, local wisdom has it, from that first mango tree. **********\"He devoted his whole life to mangoes,\" said Junaid Faridi, his grandson, an administrator at a college in New Delhi who was back home for the annual mango festival. **********As Mr. Malik strolled down the main street of his village, a hump-backed dirt trail, the tangy-sweet, overpowering fragrance of mango fruits perfumed his way. \"We are having many mangoes,\" he said, \"but we are having many problems too.\" **********\"We want the Government to declare this the mango belt,\" he explained. \"We want this place to be free from pollution. The Government should ban brick making.\"  Disease Is Linked to Kilns **********India's mango crop is increasingly plagued by a disease called black tip, which causes the ends of the mango to rot, turning from brown to black. In northern India, the disease is linked to the coal-fired brick kilns scattered throughout the countryside, which spew clouds of sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide into the air. **********Just outside the village, across a field of ripening wheat, two thin smokestacks at a brick kiln belched black smoke into the sky. **********\"We are also fighting the middlemen,\" Mr. Faridi said. \"We export mangoes to many countries, but we have to sell our mangoes to Delhi. We want to get export licenses.\" **********The village leaders fume because the mangoes they sell to Delhi traders at 10 rupees a kilogram -- 35 cents -- are resold by the wholesalers for export for 40 rupees. **********Rataul, exceptional because of its devotion to a single fruit, brims with the grievances felt by many of India's farmers. Wheat and rice farmers complain about the prices offered by Government purchasing agents, prices far below world prices and far below what the Government recently paid Canada for wheat. Sugar cane producers argue that sugar mills pay far too little for their cane crops. **********As India struggles to reorient its distorted market systems as part of its larger attempt to restructure the national economy, complaints like those in Rataul will persist. But whether the mango growers will ever exercise greater control over their produce is, the village leaders concede, questionable. **********\"After all,\" Mr. Malik said, \"the majority of mango producers are illiterate.\" **********He stooped over a crate of Rataul mangoes and delicately lifted a pale green globe in his long fingers. **********\"Have some mango,\" he said. \"This is the most delicious mango there is.

New Opportunities **********Further cuts could provide producers of syndicated programs with new opportunities to take away more time periods on some network affiliates. **********CBS set a precedent at its affiliate convention late last month by announcing that it would restructure its compensation agreements to include fees that the stations would have pay to the networks. In the past, the payments always went one way -- from networks to stations. **********The CBS station managers reacted predictably: they were angry. The move is being widely interpreted as the latest indication of strain in the network-affiliate relationship, a strain stirred up by a business climate that has reduced and at times completely wiped out network profits. **********\"The world has changed dramatically,\" said Anthony C. Malara, president of affiliate relations at CBS. Status at NBC and ABC **********Both NBC and ABC have also cut station compensation in recent years, but neither made additional cuts at their affiliate meetings this year. Still, further changes are on the way. **********NBC and its affiliates are currently working on a new format for compensation. And George H. Newi, executive vice president of affiliate relations for ABC, said he was not pessimistic about the future of the network-affiliate alliance. But he conceded, \"In the long run, compensation is going to go down.\" **********The cutbacks by all three networks may keep down or eliminate affiliate defections from CBS out of anger over its new compensation plan. Most stations are unlikely to defect to the Fox network because, despite its recent growth, it is nowhere near a full-service network yet. **********The main concern for the networks is getting their affiliates to carry the entire network schedule. **********At the ABC affiliate convention last week, network executives were quite concerned about their award-winning news program \"Nightline.\" Indeed, the ABC executives made a special appeal for the program, telling affiliates that if they continued to favor syndicated shows over \"Nightline\" after the late local newscasts, it could soon go off the air. **********Late-night syndicated competition could pose a problem for NBC as well. If Jay Leno shows any vulnerability in replacing Johnny Carson as host of the \"Tonight\" show, some NBC stations could seek more profits by putting on a syndicated show after their late newscasts, pushing \"Tonight\" back a half hour. Syndicated Success **********Syndicators are already maneuvering to take advantage of the disgruntlement among CBS stations. One company, Paramount Pictures, has two new hourlong dramas that were developed partly in the expectation of such a conflict between networks and affiliates. The shows, \"Star Trek: Deep Space 9\" and \"The Untouchables,\" aim to duplicate the enormous syndicated success that Paramount has had with \"Star Trek: The Next Generations.\" **********Paramount clearly hopes the two new series, set to begin in January, will gain time periods in prime time where the networks are programming ineffectively. **********There is considerable economic incentive for a station to abandon a failing network program for a strong syndicated show. A station generally gets about half the commercials in a syndicated show to sell, as opposed to only about 10 percent of the commercials in a network program. **********A senior executive for a syndication company, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \"Compensation has been the heart and soul of network-affiliate relations. When you take away compensation, you create, in essence, a level playing field.\" **********The networks believe that stations can damage only themselves in the long run by damaging the network. Some affiliates accept that view, but more and more stations are also feeling increasing pressure on their profit margins. **********In addition, Mr. Malara said, affiliates' loyalty to the networks has declined because so few stations are now owned and operated by individuals. Almost all affiliated stations are now owned by large broadcasting groups, which are likely to have stations affiliated with more than one network. Many of these stations carry heavy debt loads as a result of their acquisition. **********Ownership changes at the networks have affected the relationship as well. Each network changed hands in the 1980's. The new owners have all acted to reduce the amount of compensation they pay stations. **********Syndicators believe that the emerging tensions between the networks and the stations play into their hands. \"What we have here is a signpost of the future,\" said Tim Duncan, the executive director of the Advertiser Syndicated Television Association. That future, he said, is going to be marked by more programs from studios like Paramount. **********The networks do not see the threat as nearly so severe. Mr. Newi said ABC felt no hostility from its affiliates and added, \"We'll keep adjusting as we go.\" **********Peter Desnoes, whose company, Burnham Broadcasting, owns ABC affiliates in New Orleans and Bakersfield, Calif., said, \"The relationship is under stress, but it has reason for being and will survive.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/24/business/durable-goods-orders-rose-1.6-in-march.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 653, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Durable-Goods Orders Rose 1.6% in March", "print_headline": "Durable-Goods Orders Rose 1.6% in March", "body_text": " **********Evidence of solid, though subdued, recovery mounted today as the Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods climbed 1.6 percent in March and that a small February downturn had been revised away **********The March increase, which was somewhat larger than expected, was heavily influenced by a jump for both commercial and military aircraft but analysts also noted that gains were still fairly widespread. **********\"I think they're a real good sign\" of sustained business recovery, commented Maury N. Harris, chief economist for Paine Webber Inc. To be sure, he noted, the aircraft sector, where order-bunching causes monthly gyrations, accounted for most of the rise, but this does not mean aircraft should be disregarded. **********\"It's an important industry,\" Mr. Harris said, one that buys all manner of supplies, hires workers and exports much of its output. **********Excluding the military category, orders for durable goods -- items from stereos to tanks intended to last at least three years -- rose 1.3 percent for the second straight month. **********In another encouraging economic report, the Labor Department reported that new claims for state unemployment benefits fell for the third straight time, to 404,000 for the week ended April 11, the lowest level since mid-October. **********The two reports combined to push bond prices down sharply, raising interest rates, on fears that a faster recovery risks higher inflation. Subsequently, however, the market regained most of its losses, in part, traders suggested, because of disappointing 10-day auto sales numbers.  Auto makers said that sales were a meager 5.5 million units during the mid-April period. **********Orders for durable goods, a forward-looking indicator, rose $2 billion last month to a total of $122.6 billion, a level 9 percent higher than in March 1991 but still below the level of last November. **********The 1.6 percent March gain followed no change for February and a 2.4 percent surge in January. February's orders had initially been reported as declining three-tenths of 1 percent. **********Transportation equipment soared 6.3 percent, mainly because of aircraft orders that a department official said were more commercial than military.

Military orders plunged 20 percent in January and an additional 18.6 percent in February. **********The limited but widely watched category of civilian goods with aircraft excluded rose 1.2 percent in March, recovering about half of February's decline. **********Today's report also showed that shipments of durable goods rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month, well under February's 3 percent gain, but the 11th increase in the last 12 months. **********Unfilled orders, meanwhile, declined six-tenths of 1 percent, the seventh straight decline and, at $480.6 billion, the lowest level since August 1989. **********The shrinking backlog, said Ed Yardeni of C. J. Lawrence, suggests that factories will be slow in coming months to add new workers. **********But Gilbert Benz, an economist for the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, said he was not much concerned about the drop in unfilled orders, a component of the Government's principal economic-forecasting index. Since inventories are relatively low, he said, stepped-up demand for durables will lead fairly quickly to higher output. \"They're going to have to produce it,\" Mr. Benz said. **********Still other data in today's report showed that orders rose one-tenth of 1 percent when all transportation equipment was excluded. **********Without seasonal adjustment, total orders rose 9.6 percent in March, to $131.8 billion, after falling modestly in February."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/21/world/turmoil-europe-finance-officials-see-french-vote-calming-nervous-world-markets.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1992-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1574, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Finance Officials See French Vote Calming Nervous World Markets", "print_headline": "TURMOIL IN EUROPE; Finance Officials See French Vote Calming Nervous World Markets", "body_text": " **********European finance ministers turned into cheerleaders today, proclaiming that the close vote in France in favor of European unity should calm the world's jittery financial markets. And their efforts at reassurance got a boost from President Bush. **********A day after the Group of Seven industrial nations met here and pledged to help stabilize markets, officials from the 12 members of the European Community gathered for talks, then insisted that the vote should have a calming effect. **********Several European officials said privately that central banks were ready to intervene if the French franc or another currency came under attack. A Hope for Calm in the Markets **********\"We believe this will lead to a calming down of the turbulence in the markets,\" said Henning Christopherson, the European Community's Commissioner for Economic Affairs. The European officials also vowed that there would be no more devaluations within the European monetary system. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, said, \"There is no realignment.\" **********Mr. Lamont, who was scheduled to stay in Washington until Thursday, decided to cut short his visit and return to Britain on Monday. Last week's currency crisis forced devaluation of the British pound as well as the Italian lira and the Spanish peseta, and the British Parliament begins an emergency debate on the economy on Thursday. **********President Bush joined the chorus of optimism in a short statement he read to finance ministers from two dozen countries as he welcomed them to a White House reception. He called for strengthening the world's monetary system and urged the major industrial nations to step up their economic cooperation. **********In his comments today, Mr. Bush seemed determined to demonstrate both an interest in the global economy and his familiarity with foreign leaders and their problems, taking advantage of their visit during the midst of his re-election campaign. **********He said Washington was closely following the European crisis and would help to calm things down, if called upon. **********\"I want to assure you of the United States' commitment to be strongly engaged in a positive, steady fashion to help build global prosperity,\" he said. \"I am working to strengthen America to compete with you, not retreat from you.\" **********The President also made a highly technical suggestion to link world currency rates to a basket of commodities, including gold, to help Governments discern inflation and adjust their policies accordingly. This proposal was pushed by James A. Baker 3d when he was Treasury Secretary in 1987, and reflects the heavy influence of Mr. Baker, who is now the White House chief of staff and director of Mr. Bush's re-election campaign. **********The President said the basket of commodities could be used along with other measures of performance, like growth and trade imbalances, to help coordinate economic policies. He also urged the industrial nations to compare their different economic perspectives and work harder to agree on policies. **********A senior Treasury official said the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, a former governor of the Bank of France, had called today for developing new methods to stabilize the world's monetary system. The Treasury official said the Bush proposal was the American response. The last time Washington made a similar proposal was in 1987, as the French Government was pushing hard for fixed exchange rates among all the major industrial countries. **********Mr. Bush also took the occasion to urge nations to cooperate in completing international trade talks that aim to spur growth by removing trade barriers. The talks have been deadlocked for months over a European-American dispute about how fast to cut subsidies to farmers. The Bush Administration has been seeking sharper reductions in subsidies than the Europeans have been willing to make, because their farmers are a potent political force. **********Before the French vote, foreign exchange traders had warned that a rejection of the Maastricht treaty, which calls for a single European currency and central bank, would cause the franc and other European currencies to come under heavy fire -- a replay of last week's turmoil. A convincing \"yes\" vote might be enough to restore confidence, some analysts said. **********But the narrow vote in favor of the treaty may not carry the day in the financial markets, where some investors may stand ready to test Europe's commitment to forming a single currency. **********The European Community's finance minsters and central bankers are in Washington for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and after a two-hour meeting they spoke as if in one voice, a soothing one. The French vote, they declared, however narrow, should soothe the nervous markets. 'It's Good for Europe' **********\"It's good for Europe, and it's good for the markets,\" said Theo Waigel, Germany's Finance Minister. **********And Maurice Doyle, president of Ireland's central bank, said, \"I don't see any reason for further chaos.\" **********In the hours after the results of the French vote were announced, currency trading was calm, and the franc and the lira strengthened a bit against the German mark. Some economists wondered aloud if the European central banks were already secretly intervening, buying vulnerable currencies, to show the world that the \"yes\" vote was good for currency stability. **********In a brief communique, the ministers \"expressed their view that the result\" of the French vote \"will ease tension in the foreign exchange markets.\" **********They also stated their commitment to the European monetary system, the 11-nation arrangement of linked exchange rates that exploded last week when investors savaged the lira, pound and peseta, forcing all of them to be devalued against the German mark. Italy and Britain temporarily withdrew from the system, which was established in 1979 to create a zone of exchange rate stability that aimed to spur trade, investment in growth. **********Late today, it was clear that the Europeans were locked in a tense debate about how the pieces of the tattered monetary system could be put back together. **********Some officials said that just the half-dozen countries with the lowest inflation rates should be allowed to continue in the system. This would relieve tensions because countries with high inflation, like Italy, have to jack up their rates to keep their currencies from plunging against the German mark. The Stakes for Europe **********The stakes were clear well before the results of today's vote in France. **********Mr. Lamont of Britain took pains in a news briefing this morning to affirm his country's commitment to the currency and trade mechanisms of the European Community, though he was carefully unspecific on the important question of whether the links would be formal or informal. **********Britain suspended its participation in the European monetary system last week, when despite a German interest rate cut, the first in five years, the pound was unable to its maintain its value against the mark, as the system requires. **********Speculators attacked the pound partly because they were convinced that Britain, mired in recession for two years now, could not indefinitely keep its interest rates at a stratospheric level to keep the pound from sliding against the German mark. **********The United States, Britain and France have repeatedly criticized Germany for its high interest rates, which have strengthened the mark and forced other European countries to raise their rates in tandem. This has slowed growth and investment in Europe and the rest of the world. Emphasis on Growth **********On Saturday, the Group of Seven's finance ministers and central bankers tilted in favor of lower interest rates, praising some recent rate cuts and saying, \"These meaures will strengthen the global economic recovery and foster greater stability of exchange markets.\" **********At the meetings here, the United States and Britain continued to press Germany to reduce its interest rates still further to spur European -- and world -- economic growth. **********\"Recent developments in world currency markets highlight the importance of strengthening growth,\" Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told other finance ministers today at the monetary fund. \"Policy measures for a stronger world economy are consistent with and will complement efforts to promote greater stability of exchange markets.\" **********In a sign of the repercussions the currency crisis could have far beyond Europe, Yasushi Mieno, governor of Japan's central bank, said: \"It's true that the disruption and turmoil in the European foreign exchange markets occur within the European monetary system. However, it is not a matter concerning just Europe. This volatility may affect world foreign exchange markets and the world economy. It's a matter for the world to be concerned about.\" **********Washington was awash today with finance ministers -- they came and met and parted and met again in what sometimes seemed like a round-robin rugby competition. There were meetings of the 12 European Community finance ministers, of the finance ministers and central bankers of 10 major industrial nations and of the finance ministers of the 22 countries who hold seats on the monetary fund's executive board. **********The punchiest debating match inside today's meetings, officials said, was between Britain and Germany. Mr. Lamont criticized Germany, saying the large budget deficit it had incurred in financing German unification had forced Germany's central bank to raise rates, which slowed growth in Europe. But Mr. Waigel, the German Finance Minister, argued that German reunification had spurred growth throughout the continent because it had fueled growth in Germany and caused Germany to import more from other European nations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/11/world/teheran-hangs-4-for-rioting-in-may.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 358, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TEHERAN HANGS 4 FOR RIOTING IN MAY", "print_headline": "TEHERAN HANGS 4 FOR RIOTING IN MAY", "body_text": " **********Four people charged with arson and \"pillage of state property\" were executed in Mashad today after being arrested for taking part in the largest anti-Government demonstration since the 1979 revolution, the Iranian radio reported. **********Squatters protesting forced evictions by city authorities in Mashad, 580 miles east of Teheran, set fire to Government buildings and burned copies of the Koran in a night of riots on May 29 that reportedly left two dead, hundreds wounded and 300 arrested. **********The four people executed today were identified as Javad Ganjkhanlou, Ali Sadeghi, Gholam-hussein Pourshirzad and Hamid Javid.

Yeltsin of Russia in his speech at the United Nations on Jan. 31.

More Still in Gulag, They Say **********All five denied Mr. Yeltsin's assertion that they were the last political prisoners left from the Soviet era: they cite reports of inmates arrested for political activities but convicted of regular crimes, or inmates serving in republics other than Russia, or young men convicted of draft evasion. **********What is significant is that the Gulag is disgorging not only \"prisoners of conscience\" -- people thrown in labor camps only for their convictions -- but also people charged with directly betraying the old order. The treason they were accused of is still on the books; in fact, the hard-line Communist plotters of the unsuccessful coup last August were charged with the same crime. **********Packed in a tight room in the offices of a Moscow journal, the men seemed still a bit disoriented. Conditions at Perm 35 improved after the August coup, they said, and \"for the last two months we just lived there,\" said Aleksandr Dolzhikov, a deserter from the Strategic Missile Forces.

A former researcher with the Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada who had served 5 1/2 years of a 13-year term, he said it was necessary to acknowledge how much the country had changed. **********He views Mr. Yeltsin somewhere between Lenin and Napoleon: \"Napoleon created a democracy using an empire. Lenin did the opposite, creating an empire from behind the cover of democracy. Now Yeltsin is allowing the empire to fall apart in the name of people's power.\" **********As they debated the present, tidbits of their past spilled out, intriguing shards of broken lives that had once been harnessed to the needs of a state obsessed with security and secrecy. In California, a Loss of Faith **********Mr. Yuzhin, a handsome and soft-spoken man, described how the K.G.B. had sent him to California in 1975 under cover as a Tass correspondent to disseminate disinformation about Americans whom the K.G.B. wanted to discredit. Instead, he lost his faith in his system and its ideology. **********It happened during a lecture at a university where students grilled him about Andrei D. Sakharov, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and other dissidents of the 1970's. He realized he knew little, and he began to research their lives. \"The more I read, the more I realized I lived in a big lie,\" he said. **********Acting on his new convictions, asking no compensation, he began giving information about his activities to the F.B.I. He continued informing during a second stint in California from 1978 to 1982, but he was never approached by the C.I.A. in Moscow, he said. **********He was arrested in 1986 in Moscow, he said. He suspected a \"mole\" in the American services, but he declined to give a name or further details. He barely escaped being executed, Mr. Yuzhin said, but for five years he was kept in complete isolation, not even knowing where he was being held. **********He said he hoped now to make a serious career of what had been his cover, journalism. A Hijacking Gone Awry **********Mr. Fedotkin had been drafted at 18 and unwillingly assigned to serve as a camp guard in the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Large and calm, his hair cropped close, he described in matter-of-fact tones how he and six friends had decided to hijack a plane and flee abroad, planning to blow themselves up if things went wrong. In the end two plotters failed to show, one was shot dead and Mr. Fedotkin ended up in camp. **********Mr. Makarov, sitting alongside, was as agitated as Mr. Fedotkin was calm. He seemed electrified with rage as he talked of his work breaking codes for the K.G.B., noting in passing that all codes save the British had been cracked. **********\"I'm proud of what I did,\" he declared, though he declined to say what treason he committed, and would not acknowledge whether the charge of giving information to foreign embassies was accurate. \"The time will come when the K.G.B. is revealed for the criminal organization it is. I will fight to have it prosecuted along the lines of the Nurenberg trials.\" What to Do Next? **********Mr. Potashov, quiet and scholarly, had been charged with leaking to the Americans an analysis of the Soviet attitude to President Reagan's \"zero option,\" the proposal to eliminate all medium-range nuclear missiles. **********\"We did not want to betray our motherland,\" he said. \"We wanted to change it to what it now is.

Yet, the avid buyers of Treasury bills, notes and bonds on Friday appeared to be giving Mr. Clinton every benefit of the doubt. Shift in Investor Mood **********\"The shift in mood in the last six to eight weeks is phenomenal,\" said Maureen Allyn, chief economist at Scudder, Stevens & Clark. \"They thought the economy was going down the drain and he was evil incarnate. Now they think the economy is growing at a 4 percent rate and that Clinton is smart, practical and will do the right thing.\" **********Mr. Clinton's reported choice of Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, as Secretary of the Treasury, may be unsettling to the bond market, and trading today may reflect that. Many bond traders and analysts preferred Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who had an unchallenged anti-inflation reputation. **********But if Mr. Clinton is gaining the confidence of Wall Street already, Mr. Bentsen's choice will not be judged in isolation; it will be read in an overall context that will also include other appointments and the President-elect's commitment to cutting the Federal budget deficit. Stronger Economic Signs **********The employment report for November was solid across the board. Nonfarm payrolls were up 105,000. The September decline of 72,000 jobs was revised to an increase of 12,000. The average workweek and hourly earnings rose, two factors that had forecasters like Ed Yardeni of C. J. Lawrence and Joseph Liro of S. G. Warburg & Company preparing to increase their growth forecasts for the fourth quarter. **********Normally, these kind of data would be bad for the bond market, especially coupled with Mr. Clinton's promise to stimulate the economy with new spending on road and environmental projects and tax incentives to encourage business investment. **********For shorter maturities, a stronger economy raises the possibility that the Federal Reserve could soon increase short-term interest rates. For longer maturities it makes investors wonder if the stronger growth will push inflation higher. **********In fact, it was worry over a stronger-than-expected economy and Mr. Clinton's fiscal stimulus package that caused much of the recent selloff in Treasury bills and notes. **********But instead of declining on Friday, bond and note prices rose and the discount rates on Treasury bills declined. The price of the 30-year bond was up 25/32 to yield 7.48 percent, down from 7.55 percent on Thursday and the first time the yield has been below 7.50 percent since Oct. 14. **********And the apparent faith in Mr. Clinton is one of the reasons why. Fine-Tuning Fiscal Stimulus **********Bond traders, fund managers and economists indicated in numerous interviews that they assumed Mr. Clinton would scale back the stimulus program he promised during the campaign if the economy grew stronger and strengthen it if the economy was weaker. Mr. Clinton and his transition aides have indicated that this is the case. But no one knows yet whether a reduced Clinton program would be close to what the bond market would consider scaled back. **********Mr. Yardeni of C. J. Lawrence said in his commentary on the employment report, \"Job report reduces likelihood of Clinton short-term stimulus program.\" **********The rally also seemed to reveal two other factors at play in the market. One is that investors appear more scared of a yet-to-be-detailed fiscal stimulus program than of an economy that is growing faster then anticipated just two months ago. **********The second factor is that skeptical investors, traders and analysts, who have been burned in the past, are showing growing comfort with the thought that inflation will remain low for some time to come. This is one reason the long bond has outperformed other Treasury securities in recent trading. Economic Drag **********The General Motors Corporation's announcement last week of its plans to shut nine plants within the next three and a half years is a vivid reminder of the painful corporate restructurings that have kept the economy sluggish, at best, for the last four years. **********Economists and executives hope that the paring of debt and the cutting of costs will lay the groundwork for future robust economic growth. Only Moderate Growth Predicted **********But in a report on the economic outlook next year here and abroad, Salomon Brothers warns that debt restructuring for both companies and individuals is not yet over. And that is one reason the firm projects only moderate growth in the economy next year. **********Combined with a continued low rate of inflation, the moderate growth will open the way to a decline in the yield on the 30-year bond to the vicinity of 7 percent. The firm does not think, however, that a break of 7 percent, if possible, can happen before 1994. **********On the consumer side, the report notes that while debt service burdens have fallen from their peak, they are still high enough to limit the burst in spending needed for a conventional recovery. The analysis also contends that consumer behavior may be becoming more conservative, meaning less willingness to take on new debt and a stronger tendency to save. **********One reason for this view is the pattern of mortgage refinancings, which show a marked move to 15-year mortgages, from 30 years. This means that consumers still make about the same monthly payments. That makes for a slower-spending consumer as individuals build up equity in their homes much faster. Rise in 15-Year Mortgages **********Overall mortgage data show that the share of 15-year mortgages has risen to about 30 percent in 1992 from 10 percent in recent years. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation data show that refinancings to 15-year mortgages jumped to 43 percent in the first three quarters of 1992, from 17 percent in 1990. **********On the corporate side, the change has also just begun.\"The recuperation owes more to the absolute decline in interest rates and a strong stock market rally than to corporate balance sheet restructuring or robust income growth,\" according to the report written under the direction of John Lipsky, Salomon's chief economist. **********Among other conclusions: The Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates until the second half of 1993; when it does, the increase will be modest. **********Mr. Clinton's economic stimulus plan and the need to create jobs will mean that \"deficit reduction plays a subordinate role,\" a fact that may eventually shake the bond market, the Salomon report says. As for the actual fiscal stimulus, much of the spending on road, environmental, communications and other projects may be delayed by \"significant legal and regulatory obstacles.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/10/business/first-union-net-up-sharply.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-10-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "First Union Net Up Sharply", "print_headline": "First Union Net Up Sharply", "body_text": " **********The First Union Corporation, the nation's 11th-largest bank holding company, has reported that third-quarter net income rose sharply to $140 million, or $1.06 a share, from $68 million, or 61 cents, a year earlier. **********Zacks Investment Research reports a consensus earnings per share estimate of 94 cents for the quarter.

He banned fathers from school functions involving girls, including their own daughters, Jordanians say, and ordered that veils be drawn on women portrayed in children's textbooks. And although some of those edicts have lapsed, dozens of Mr. Akayra's appointees are still managing curriculums, textbooks and other administrative sectors. **********Jordanians say that though Mr. Akayra's tenure was brief, the effects of his stewardship are likely to reverberate through the nation's education system for a considerable time, showing how Jordan's fundamentalists are changing the face of the nation from the schools right up to the office of King Hussein, the Jordanian leader. **********And, Mr. Akayra's decisions illustrate another point: While many Egyptian and Algerian Muslim fundamentalists are engaged in a daily all-out armed confrontation with their Governments, Jordan's Muslim strategists have taken a different tack, building abroad economic, educational, political and social edifice they hope will \"ripen\" until the nation falls into their lap as peacefully as a fruit off a tree. **********Leading that effort is the Muslim Brotherhood, known by its Arabic name, Al Ikhwan Al Muslimin. The group was founded in Egypt in the early 1930's and has grown to be the largest pan-Arab fundamentalist group, an organization active in Egypt, the Sudan, Algeria, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, as well as in the United States and Western Europe. **********By far the group's biggest success to date with the politics of accommodation rather than confrontation appears to be in Jordan. Without firing a shot, Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood, a large umbrella group, has won control of 34 of the 80 seats in Jordan's Parliament, to become the biggest bloc in the legislature. **********When Jordan's voters decided to express such support for fundamentalist candidates in the election in November 1989, they reflected two trends common in other Arab countries: first, a loss of faith in those who have ruled over the last three decades, and second, the hope that men of the Muslim Brotherhood, who present themselves as men of religion, may prove more committed to social justice and the more equitable distribution of wealth, ending official corruption that has reached epidemic proportions in many Arab countries, rich or poor. Groundwork Laid Long Ago **********The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, as elsewhere in the Islamic world, has always portrayed itself as the mainstream, reasonable branch of Islamic fundamentalism, as opposed to a wide range of newer Islamic groupings, many of them with younger members, who took hostages in Beirut or legitimized killing Christians in Egypt. **********The fundamentalist movement in Jordan has two main strains: the Brotherhood, which has always advocated establishing Islamic governments that would rule according to Islamic law, and Hamas, which works with the brotherhood but is primarily concerned with the Israeli role in the occupied territories and draws its strength from Jordan's large Palestinian population. **********The electoral gains are only part of the brotherhood's accomplishment. Throughout this country of 4 million, the Brotherhood is running some 20 Islamic clinics, one of Amman's largest hospitals, well over 40 Islamic schools, some 150 Koranic studies centers and other elements of what anti- fundamentalists call \"the infrastructure of an Islamic republic.\" **********The brotherhood has worked hard to keep those institutions independent of the Government or of outside aid. For example, the hospital severely restricts the amount of charitable service it gives, insisting on full payment from patients who are able to pay, in the interests of preserving its solvency and profits. **********Fundamentalist schools, likewise, draw on the strength of the middle class rather than reaching out for the poor, making them, like other Islamic institutions in Jordan, able to withstand even crises like the withdrawal of support from rich fundamentalist Arabs in the wake of Jordan's decision to side with Iraq during the Persian Gulf war. **********While the first strong display of the group's power came in the elections in 1989, the groundwork had been laid long ago. **********\"It is not a secret that the Muslim Brotherhood started charitable works in Jordan as far back as 1965 with medical, educational and social services,\" says Ziyad Abughneima, a spokesman for the Brotherhood. Ibrahim Ghosha, from Hamas, estimates that hard-core Muslim fundamentalist group members range from 15,000 to 20,000, making fundamentalists the best-organized group in the country, with their considerable political support shown by the voting. **********Further, over the years, the Brotherhood has succeeded in placing many of its people in the ministries of education, social development and public services. And although the King replaced the Cabinet that included Mr. Akayra and several other fundamentalist ministers after a few short months, largely because of the growing outcry about fundamentalist influence, those officials' legacies live on. **********\"Jordan to us is the center of many hopes in the future,\" said Hamza Mansour, a member of the Islamic bloc of 34 deputies in Jordan's Parliament. **********Not too far from where Mrs. Melhes sits in the Ministry of Education office, Dr. Ali Hawamdeh, director of the Islamic Hospital of Amman, a man with the look of a harassed executive, manages a smile when he ticks off statistics: 200,000 admissions in 1991, compared with 2,000 in 1982, when it opened; 53,000 births in 1991, compared with fewer than 300 in 1982, and more than half a million patients treated last year, compared with a few more than 1,000 when the hospital got started. **********Dr. Hawamdeh, who is a senior official of the Muslim Brotherhood and a member of Parliament, said: \"My hospital is full. My schools are many. But still every day we must win more friends, more clients and more acquaintances.\" Tricky Situation For Jordan's King **********While Jordan's other political parties have been banned since the late 50's, the Brotherhood, registered as a charitable organization, has been free to organize its followers with nearly unrestricted access to mosques that serve it as political pulpits. **********Muslim brothers say they agreed to play by democratic rules, but they do not hesitate to say that theirs is the rule of God and cannot be confused with the rule of man. **********Mr. Abughneima, who is a senior administrative official of the Islamic hospital, said: \"We believe Islam represents the true order of things and anything else is a sin. At the moment, we approve of multi-partyism because we don't want anyone to say 'we didn't have room to work and only the Brotherhood could work.' \" **********One factor in the apparent success of the fundamentalist enterprise here is the role of King Hussein. **********\"The King sees Islamic democracy as the future,\" a senior Western diplomat said. \"He no longer believes secularist governments have much future in the Arab world. So, the future lies in modernizing Islam.\" **********While the King has voiced support for some Islamic role in Government, especially since the Persian Gulf war, it remains to be seen whether his embrace of some aspects of a fundamentalist role in politics have been motivated by genuine convictions or by self-preservation. **********\"If you repress, you cause paralysis in the society, which is what is happening in Algeria,\" said Mohammed Nazzal, a senior member of Hamas. \"So the King knows that hitting fundamentalists will not lead to stopping them but may aggravate the crisis.\" **********The social structure of Jordan also plays a role. In a small country where most people know each other or know about each other, the movement's leadership here is made up of aristocrats and rich businessmen, differing sharply from fundamentalist leaders in Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia, who tend to come more from the working classes. **********That is so partly because Jordan has a higher standard of living than those other countries. Further, fundamentalism satisfies the deep frustration of many Palestinians and others who have felt impotence over Israel's role in the occupied territories. **********The leaders' relatively high social status has many effects. One Western diplomat here noted that reactions by security forces to fundamentalists are not predictable under those circumstances. **********\"It is harder to shoot someone who went to school with you,\" the diplomat said. Ripple Effect Of Muslim Moves **********Among foreign diplomats here, those of the older generation generally take the attitude that fundamentalism is a cancer that the King is moving too slowly to tackle. Younger diplomats argue that perhaps the West can co-exist with Islamic fundamentalists. **********\"They come in many stripes, you know, and quite a few are reasonable folks,\" said a first secretary at a Western embassy who insisted on not being identified. **********Such talk sends shock waves through secularist middle classes, particularly among Jordan's 300,000 Christians. Some of them wonder if tolerance for them is running out and, as a result, are beginning to immigrate. **********There is little doubt among many of the elite that Islamic fundamentalists will threaten the nation's relations with Israel and other nations who are also nervous about fundamentalism, as well as worsening Jordan's economic problems by expounding xenophobic, anti-Western attitudes that are expected to reduce the foreign aid on which the nation's economy depends. **********But to turn the tide of fundamentalism means suspending the limited democracy practiced in Jordan, adopting a martial-law rule and arresting arbitrarily the entire leadership of the fundamentalist movement, steps that the King appears most reluctant to even consider. **********And so, Mrs. Melhes, a Muslim woman who shuns the veil, still sits at her desk in the Education Ministry, lighting cigarette after cigarette. While her door stands partly open, hardly anyone consults her about anything, and her solace is to pour out her bitterness about fundamentalists. She has been given back her salary and an office, as well as the title of consultant to the minister, but she does not have much of a job. **********\"There is a multiplier effect to these changes,\" said Mrs. Melhes, explaining that the ripple effect of the ouster of her and her subordinates brought fundamentalists or their sympathizers about 15 jobs on down the line from hers. \"The Ministry of Education is the first line of defense in any country because it graduates people who go on to be army officers, security officials and other leaders of society.

The funds mentioned are all sold with sales charges. I have received a mail solicitation for an investment newsletter that, as a bonus for subscribing, promises to tell me the name of a no-load fund that follows the same strategy. Could you tell me which fund this is? **********Answer: Sorry, no luck. Analysts at Morningstar Inc., a mutual-funds research group in Chicago, screened 1,080 stock funds for funds holding 12 or fewer stocks. Of the 29 that came up, \"none fit the bill,\" said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds. The data base excludes funds less than six months old, very small funds with less than $25,000 in assets and fewer than 1,000 shareholders and funds from which Morningstar could not obtain information, a rarity. **********While it is not a perfect match, Mr. Rekenthaler suggests the T. Rowe Price Equity-Income Fund, a no-load fund that buys large high-yielding stocks, mostly in the industrial sector. **********Q: I am puzzled by your recent discussion of Individual Retirement Account rollovers. Dreyfus prepared an example showing that an account worth $245,285 would yield monthly annuity checks of $529, or a 2.59 percent \"dividend\" rate on the value of the account, whereas an account worth $334,348 would yield monthly annuity checks of $2,075, a 7.44 percent \"dividend\" rate. Why the huge difference? And since good stock mutual funds earn 10 percent or more annually, why not simply reinvest I.R.A. money in a fund instead of taking annuity payments? **********A: Trying to calculate a \"dividend\" rate is a natural urge but difficult to accomplish. The computer model used by Dreyfus includes many variables, including an inflation factor. As a result, future I.R.A. distributions are stated in terms of today's dollars. In the Dreyfus example, the $2,075 payment was figured for a 55-year-old worker scheduled to begin receiving payments in seven years, so inflation played a much smaller role than it did with the second worker, a 35-year-old whose payments would not begin for 25 years. The second person's payments might be thousands of dollars a month in 2017, but worth only $529 in 1991 dollars. **********As for your second question, you are correct in stating that stock funds return about 10 percent annually. But this is true only over the long term; funds may lose money in some periods. Retirees who rely on investment income to cover living expenses cannot afford to keep the bulk of their portfolios in stocks. Furthermore, many stock funds do not provide regular income because their goal is capital appreciation. **********Q: A recent column discussing fees omitted the commission expenses incurred when fund managers buy and sell stocks. The higher a fund's turnover, the higher its expenses. Why aren't commission costs, which can be significant, disclosed in a fund's prospectus? **********A: Although commission costs are not disclosed in a fund's prospectus, they are covered in its Statement of Additional Information, or S.A.I. This report was developed to let funds pare the information required in prospectuses, which were becoming unwieldy. Starting in 1983, the Securities and Exchange Commission let funds disclose some information in S.A.I.'s. These data include detailed investment policies and restrictions, portfolio transaction costs (including commissions) and information about trustees and management contracts. Unlike prospectuses, S.A.I.'s are not sent routinely to investors, but they are available upon request. One last point: Commission costs are subtracted in figuring a fund's total return. **********Q: In a column about figuring a fund's return, you said the price of the Fidelity Magellan Fund was $44.29 on Dec. 31, 1985, and $53.93 on Dec. 31, 1990, and then concluded that the five-year return equaled 99 percent. But I get 121.7 percent when I divide the beginning and ending share prices. Please explain. **********A: For starters, you calculated the rate of increase incorrectly. To get a fund's return on principal, you should divide the difference between the beginning and ending share prices by the beginning price. Here, the principal-only return is 21.7 percent (your result minus 100 percent, the initial investment), substantially lower than the fund's 99 percent \"total return.\" As the chart shows, total return can be much higher than principal-only return because it includes dividends and capital distributions paid by the fund in addition to the changes in principal value. **********Note: Many readers have asked how to contact three funds mentioned on Jan. 5. Harbor International can be reached at (419) 247-2477; Financial Strategic Health Sciences, (800) 525-8085, and Pimit Total Return, (800) 443-6915.

Knock on wood, probably not. **********Last year Congress ordered Federal deposit insurers to take over ailing banks before the institutions managed to throw good taxpayer money after their own bad debts. And under rules that go into effect next year, banks that are inclined to take chances will be obliged to buffer the risk with more capital. **********But safety is only half the deposit insurance story; the other half is efficiency. While the United States Treasury is now better armored against assaults from future Charles Keatings, deposit insurance remains a crude regulatory tool that only a bureaucrat could love. **********Federal regulators must still make subjective calls about when to padlock the doors on friendly neighborhood banks. Moreover, insurance premiums still do not mirror the risks of individual bank portfolios, a failure that implicitly subsidizes the high rollers. It is no surprise, then, that many economists see deposit insurance as a necessary evil, the inevitable price of securing the national money supply. **********Many, but not all. Bert Ely, who runs Ely & Company, a consulting firm in Alexandria, Va., thinks he knows a better way: private deposit insurance. And he has found a patron in Thomas Petri, a Republican Congressman from Wisconsin with a soft spot for smart schemes to buy better government for less money. **********The banking industry already insures itself. Premiums go into a pool, with the proceeds dedicated to making good on individual banks' promises to depositors. But civil servants, not the contributors, are in charge of setting premiums and keeping banks on the straight and narrow. And without a market to discipline the process, regulators are unlikely to make economically rational decisions. **********That is where the Ely-Petri plan fits in. It would eliminate the middleman, converting deposit insurance into a true industrywide self-insurance plan. Banks would be required to obtain insurance from syndicates of other banks and perhaps other financial institutions with deep pockets. The syndicates, in turn, would be required to reinsure with other syndicates against losses of a magnitude that could tap them out. And to cope with the incredibly unlikely event of the whole system running through its capital, the Government would reinsure the reinsurers. **********Syndicates, managed by professional agents, would set premiums at any level they wished and negotiate their own criteria for withdrawing coverage -- much the way a fire insurer deals with corporate policyholders. Competition between syndicates would prevent rate gouging, as well as creating pressures to price policies according to the perceived risk in banks' investment strategies. **********Markets, not bureaucrats, would decide when banks closed: A bank that could not obtain insurance, or could not make a profit at the level of premiums demanded, would be forced to merge or liquidate. **********Would it work? Robert Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution, thinks the plan is \"conceptually quite elegant.\" The big imponderable, he suggests, is whether a deep, competitive market in deposit insurance would emerge. After all, the existence of opportunities for profit do not always attract investors or expertise -- especially in games that require big bucks to play. **********One specific worry is whether syndicates would favor large banks over small because the costs of supervising smaller institutions would be high, per dollar insured. Another is that the syndicates would be excessively conservative, effectively forcing even well-managed, well-capitalized banks to shed higher-risk loans. **********But it is not entirely clear that these are drawbacks. If small banks are more expensive to regulate than large ones, why should they not pay more? And if banks are driven to hold lower-risk portfolios, there is still reason to believe that less-than-blue-chip borrowers would have access to capital. **********Finance companies and investment banks that specialize in commercial paper would probably pick up part of the slack. And the trend toward securitization, in which banks package everything from home mortgages to credit card debts in multimillion-dollar bundles and sell them to institutional investors, would no doubt accelerate. **********Whether or not the Ely-Petri approach would do the job is irrelevant, of course, if it cannot attract serious support in Washington. One strategy for making it relevant, Mr. Litan suggests, would be to start with only large banks. **********That would cheer up smaller banks, which resent the current Federal inclination to discriminate in favor of institutions that are \"too big to fail.\" And it might pick up some support from the healthiest mega-banks, which now chafe at paying high insurance premiums to carry their deadbeat competitors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/08/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-agency-search-by-bausch-lomb.html": {"writer_name": "Adam Bryant", "pub_date": "1992-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Agency Search By Bausch & Lomb", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Agency Search By Bausch & Lomb", "body_text": " **********Bausch & Lomb 's personal products division in Rochester said yesterday that it had placed Clear Choice, a new nonalcoholic mouthwash, in review.

DAMADIAN, the man generally credited with inventing the revolutionary medical diagnostic technology known as magnetic resonance imaging, this week began a second attempt to obtain patent royalties from an industry that has overshadowed him. **********It has been 15 years since the white-haired, pugnacious physician-turned-entrepreneur tested the first M.R.I. machine, a development that paved the way for doctors to get vivid color images of the interior of a person's body. Since then, M.R.I. has become a $2 billion industry, with most large cities having imaging centers where the million-dollar machines are used. But while Dr. Damadian has been honored repeatedly for his invention, and his original machine is enshrined at the Smithsonian Institution, he has not succeeded in efforts to get others in the M.R.I. industry to pay him royalties. **********His first patent case resulted in a defeat five years ago, when a Federal judge in Boston overruled a jury verdict in his favor against a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. Magnet Design Included **********Now, however, Dr. Damadian says things have changed. This week, he and his company, the Fonar Corporation of Melville, L.I., filed a suit against the General Electric Company and Hitachi Ltd. The suit accused the companies of infringing not only the basic patent on the use of magnetic resonance to detect cancer but also three more recent patents covering the design of his iron-core magnets. **********He is being represented by the Minneapolis law firm of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi, which represented Honeywell Inc. in its successful suit against the Minolta Camera Company over patents on auto-focus cameras. **********In the last year, that case has yielded more than $200 million in back royalties to Honeywell from Minolta and other companies. It has also prompted Dr. Damadian to shake off his pessimism about patent suits. **********\"The Minolta case had a big impact on us,\" he said. \"It showed us that the courts are now aware that there is a hidden asset in America, which is the patent.\" **********Magnetic resonance imaging is based on analyzing the minute radio-frequency signals given off by hydrogen atoms in the body. An M.R.I. system employs a huge magnet, which surrounds a patient with a magnetic field in one direction. The machine then applies a burst of radio frequency energy at right angles, which causes the nuclei to line up in the opposite orientation to the magnetic field. After the radio pulse, the nuclei \"flip\" back and give off distinctive signals that can be plotted by a high-speed computer to form an image. The First Case **********Dr. Damadian's problem in the first lawsuit was that his original patent claim did not quite describe the way the systems actually evolved. The trial judge and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concluded that the patent envisioned a machine able to spot cancer cells by identifying \"standard\" signals for such cells. What M.R.I. systems actually do is plot the various signals to make a picture of the body that physicians then interpret, similar to what they do with an X-ray. **********Prospects for the new lawsuit are difficult to gauge. General Electric has obtained nearly 250 patents in the field of M.R.I. technology, and will almost certainly put up a tough fight.  But Dr. Damadian said that his lawyers had conducted a six-month review before deciding to take his case and that at least part of their fees would be contingent on winning. **********Officials at both G.E. and Hitachi refused to comment, saying they had not yet seen the suit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/22/world/bosnian-strife-cuts-old-bridges-of-trust.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1992-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2052, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bosnian Strife Cuts Old Bridges of Trust", "print_headline": "Bosnian Strife Cuts Old Bridges of Trust", "body_text": " **********When Serbian gunmen go door to door, pulling Muslim Slavs from their homes at gunpoint and herding them aboard cattle trucks, they call it \"ethnic purification.\" **********But another name for what the Serbs are doing in this deserted, bullet- and shell-scarred town in the Alpine hills of eastern Bosnia, and in communities elsewhere in this disintegrating republic, is the revision of history. **********For more than 500 years, since Turkish conquerors swept up the Drina River valley and overthrew the medieval Serbian potentate whose ruined fortress looks down from Zvornik's wooded heights, this has been a place where Serbs, Muslim Slavs and Croats have lived side by side.

Reports of Mass Burials **********Little of what they said could be independently verified, not even the accounts of the bulldozed mounds in a gravel pit by the Drina where hundreds of victims of the bombardment and executions were said by the Muslims to have been buried in the days after April 9. When militiamen spotted two Western reporters talking to local Serbs near the police headquarters, the reporters were escorted back across the Drina into Serbia and told not to come back. **********Despite the lack of corroboration, there was much that suggested that the Muslims were not exaggerating. For one thing, while the Muslims seemed deeply frightened, their stories of actions against them by Serb militias were told with a striking absence of animosity against Serbs in general. Indeed many insisted on recounting the kindnesses shown toward them by individual Serb neighbors. **********Moreover, dozens of Western relief workers and reporters who have visited refugee centers farther west in Bosnia, and who have spoken to Muslim refugees from towns and villages along the Drina Valley, have been told similar tales of summary executions, of homes looted and burned, of cattle trucks carrying men, women and children away. **********While forced deportations have also been carried out by Muslim Slav and Croatian militias, adding thousands of Serbs to the refugee tide, the process appears to have been carried out more systematically, and on a wider scale, by the Serbs. International Condemnation **********Their actions, and Serbia's support for them, have been condemned by the United States, the United Nations Security Council, the European Community, and with increasing anger by Muslim nations around the world, whose leaders, like President Turgut Ozal of Turkey, have argued for international military intervention of the kind that the United Nations authorized after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. **********But so far, little has been done, apart from the decision last week by the United States and the 12-nation European Community to withdraw their ambassadors from Yugoslavia, now composed only of Serbia and Montenegro. **********The status of the Bosnian Muslims, who account for 44 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina's 4.4 million people, took a turn for the worse on March 1, when Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian President, followed the lead of Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia in declaring Bosnia's secession from Yugoslavia. **********While Serbian leaders in the republic continued to go through the motions of negotiating with other groups for the creation of an independent Bosnia composed of ethnic \"cantons,\" Serbia, the Yugoslav Army and Serbian militias in Bosnia began putting a plan into effect to carve up Bosnia on ethnic lines, with about two-thirds of the republic's territory to be seized for the Serbs. Offensive by Serbian Forces **********The Serbs worked from an ethnic map. With arms and ammunition supplied by the army, and in many cases with the army fighting alongside them, Serbian militias seized a wide corridor of eastern Bosnia adjacent to Serbia, including towns with large Muslim populations like Bijeljina, Zvornik, Bratunac, Vlasenica, Visegrad, Gorazde, and Foca. **********To this, they planned to add a northern corridor of Bosnia that would connect Serbia to Serb-held areas of Croatia, and to Serbian strongholds in northwestern parts of the republic around Bihac. In the southern Herzegovina region, they fought for Muslim towns like Mostar, apparently hoping to create another corridor connecting to southern Serbia and Montenegro. **********In late March, Zvornik seemed like a quiet, untroubled town. At a flea market beside the rushing, blue-green waters of the Drina, Muslim vendors in filigreed skullcaps set up rickety tables side by side with the town's Serbian and Croatian entrepreneurs, selling the bric-a-brac of eastern Europe, from Czechoslovak-made bicycle pumps to Polish combs. For travelers driving to Sarajevo, Zvornik seemed like a symbol of what Bosnia could be if ethnic militants could be pushed to the sidelines and the fledgling nation's future built around the goodwill that seemed evident on that sunny, late winter's day.  Old Ideas of Harmony **********The notion of harmony on the Drina has deep roots in the psyche of Yugoslavia, whose most celebrated 20th-century writer, Ivo Andric, wrote a novel, \"Bridge on the Drina,\" that helped him win the Nobel Prize for literature in 1961. **********The book is centered on Visegrad, and the 16th-century stone bridge across the river is a metaphor for the interwoven cultures, Serbian, Croatian and Turkish, Orthodox Christian, Roman Catholic and Muslim, that have made the town. In the Serbian offensive, Visegrad was one of the first towns to be seized, and its Muslims, like Zvornik's, are now mostly in refugee camps.  Killings of Civilians **********The Muslims in Zvornik built barricades, but their situation was strategically hopeless. Since Roman times, when the narrow gorge between what is now Serbia and Bosnia was first spanned by a bridge, Zvornik has been a prime target for invading armies. **********The Romans, the Turks, the Austro-Hungarian forces in World War I, and the Germans in World War II, all seized the town. The Serbs completed the job in barely 12 hours. But their objective, more than occupation, was expulsion of the town's Muslim majority. **********First, there was terror. One man in his 60's described how he watched the town's veterinarian, a Muslim, being machine-gunned along with other Muslims in front of the veterinarian's wife and daughter. **********The man said that he had counted at least 50 bodies of Muslims in the gardens of homes back from Zvornik's main street, where four-story homes with steep Alpine roofs crowd against the towering escarpment of Vratolomac, the \"neck-breaking hill\" that overlooks the town. **********The man said that one of the dead was a 17-year-old Serb girl whose throat had been cut. \"She was slaughtered just because she asked them not to do anything to the Muslims,\" he said. **********The man said he had been led to his home by a young militiaman of about 25. But once inside, the militiaman spared him. \"He said, 'O.K., I have orders to shoot you, but I'm not going to do it, I'm going to shoot out of the window,' \" the man said.  Sympathy From Serbs **********Other Muslims said that Serbian friends had been sympathetic, but were forbidden to help them overtly. \"If they talk to us, they take them to the police station and question them,\" one Muslim woman said. But to many Serbs, what happened seems to be considered a triumph. As one militia jeep passed down the main street, a group of children held three fingers aloft, an Orthodox symbol that has become the equivalent of a 'V' for victory salute among the Bosnian Serbs. **********Immediately after the town was seized, most Muslims were dismissed from their jobs in the town's hospital, at a timber mill, and at the aluminum fabricating plant that is the principal employer, the Muslims said. One man in his 40's produced a neatly folded sheet of white paper, entitled \"Decision on the Abrogation of Work Contract\", informing him that he had been sacked from his his job of 20 years for failing to turn up on April 9, when the killing was continuing. **********\"Anybody who approached the industrial zone that day, they started to shoot,\" the man said. \"Those who couldn't go to work were fired.\" Rampage of Looting **********The Muslims who remain say they are trapped. Most have had their cars stolen, part of a rampage that saw militiamen going house to house, taking television sets, video recorders, skis, anything portable. **********One man showed a pink identity card, issued by the militiamen and bearing the stamp of the self-proclaimed Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which he said forbade him, and other Muslims, to travel more than 10 miles from Zvornik. \"They want a few of us here as hostages, in case the Muslims attack,\" he said. A neighbor said she had returned from Belgrade in the hope of persuading a \"commission\" established by the Serbs to re-distribute homes to Serbs not to confiscate hers. **********Eventually, the Serbs apparently intend to re-populate Zvornik with Serbian refugees from elsewhere in Bosnia, but for now it is a ghost town. Along the main street, once lively with cafes and grocery stores, all is now silent, with storefront after storefront shattered by bullets and shelves emptied by looters. **********At a hairdresser's, one of the few businesses still operating, a Serb named Zdrako Stefanovic traced what he said was a history of persecution of Zvornik's Serbs, from the Turkish conquest in 1460 A.D. to the arrest, deportation and execution of his father by Croatian fascists in World War II. From these experiences, he said, Serbs had learned never again to expose themselves to domination by another ethnic group. **********Another Serb, Drago Djukanovic, agreed. \"Let the Muslims go to their own areas of Bosnia,\" he said. \"They can live peacefully there. But we are not going to live with them here.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/26/business/loss-widens-at-ann-taylor.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Loss Widens At Ann Taylor", "print_headline": "Loss Widens At Ann Taylor", "body_text": " **********The Ann Taylor Stores Corporation yesterday reported a $5.4 million loss for the fourth quarter, which ended Feb. 1, compared with a loss of $723,000 in the comparable period a year earlier. **********Geri Savidge, a spokeswoman for Ann Taylor, said earnings suffered from heavy markdowns to clear inventory and from contract buyouts and severance benefits associated with the departure of about 20 top executives, including the chairman and chief executive, Joseph E.

Warnings by Lawyers **********Lawyers for the Matrix Churchill executives had been threatening to force further disclosures about a secret British program that permitted Mr. Hussein to buy the tools and technology that built his army. The lawyers also made it clear that they would have continued to ask embarrassing questions of witnesses, including whether the United States Government knew of or took part in the program. **********There was no indication that British and United States officials met or held any discussions before the prosecution decided to drop the case. **********\"They dropped the case because it contained enormous potential for embarrassment,\" said Kevin Robinson, a lawyer for Paul Henderson, one of the defendants and former managing director of Matrix Churchill. \"We had saved our most explosive stuff to the end.\" **********The defense team has obtained hundreds of pages of British intelligence documents, offering a rare look at the operations of M.I.6, the foreign intelligence agency. The lawyers said those documents contained circumstantial evidence, but no direct proof, of American complicity in illegal sales to Iraq. **********Matrix Churchill, situated in Coventry, was secretly taken over by the Iraqi Government in the late 1980's. The company, which has a subsidiary in Solon, Ohio, made computer parts and other tools, then shipped them to Iraq, where they were used in plants that made conventional weapons. **********The sales were illegal, the British Government charged, because the company lied when it told export agencies the equipment would be used for civilian purposes. Separate From Atlanta Case **********The case against Matrix Churchill is roughly parallel but entirely separate from an investigation by prosecutors in Atlanta, who have been examining the company's role in a multi-billion-dollar bank fraud involving the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. The branch extended $5 billion in loans and credits to Iraq and other countries and companies in violation of bank rules, providing crucial financing for Mr. Hussein's arms buildup. **********In the Atlanta case as well, defense lawyers have argued that any business with Iraq was approved by the United States Government. **********During the trial in London, British intelligence documents revealed that the British Government let these shipments go through because two Matrix Churchill executives, including Mr. Henderson, were M.I.6 informants. The Government feared that by shutting down Matrix Churchill it would lose valuable intelligence on Iraq's arms buildup. **********In a press release, Mr. Robinson said his client \"has no doubt that the information which he and his colleague were providing was shared with the C.I.A. and was available to the White House in the formulation of Western policy towards Saddam.\" **********By Mr. Robinson's account, the circumstantial evidence of American complicity includes documents showing that in January 1988 a top British official told Mr. Henderson that continued sales of equipment to Iraq \"was dependent on American policy towards Iraq.\" Additionally, an M.I.6 agent testified that he believed that some information was passed on to the United States, which has an extremely close intelligence-sharing relationship with Britain. **********In a recent interview, Mr. Henderson said he could not prove that the United States was given information he acquired. He said the British agent who was his contact made frequent trips to the United States, but the agent said this was because he was about to marry an American woman. **********Since the disclosure of Matrix Churchill's involvement with British intelligence, United States law enforcement agents have been trying to figure out if some American agencies were following the British lead and trying to protect the company's Ohio subsidiary. **********The American law enforcement agents, who asked not to be identified, said this would explain why the company was able to operate so openly in the United States.

'Much, Much Closer' **********\"I'm of the view that we're much, much closer to a conclusion than we were five weeks ago,\" Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said this afternoon, adding that he thought the leaders would probably agree on Wednesday to stronger language than at the last two of this group's annual gatherings. In each of the past two years, they said an agreement was essential to the health of the world economy and pledged every effort to achieve it by the end of the year. **********Before Mr. Yeltsin's arrival, the leaders welcomed the \"new partnership\" that the collapse of Communism and the Soviet Union had made possible between East and West. **********\"Partnership will flourish as common values take root, based on the principles of political and economic freedom, human rights, democracy, justice and the rule of law,\" they said in the political declaration issued today. \"Good governance and respect for human rights are important criteria in providing economic assistance.\" Strife in the East **********But they were clearly preoccupied with the darker side of change, not only in the western Balkans but also in Nagorno-Karabakh, Moldova, and Ossetia, former Soviet territories where nationalities have clashed violently over conflicting territorial claims. **********There was concern over their failure so far to prevent war in what was Yugoslavia, and talk in the corridors and by members of national delegations of using air and sea forces to blockade it and send in ground forces if necessary to break the Serbian siege of Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********Mr. Baker repeated today that he did not believe that American troops should go into Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Access for Relief Effort **********\"The airlift to Sarajevo can only be the beginning of a larger humanitarian effort,\" the summit leaders said. \"Safe access by road to Sarajevo as well as to other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina in need must be guaranteed.\" **********But if United Nations aid is blocked by the belligerents, the summit leaders said, \"we believe the Security Council will have to consider other measures, not excluding military means, to achieve its humanitarian objectives.\" **********Serbia and Croatia, they said, should respect the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbian leaders should respect minority rights in full and negotiate with representatives of the mainly Albanian province of Kosovo on granting autonomous status for the territory. **********The leaders also called for the suspension of Serbia and Montenegro, the only remaining members of what was a six-member Yugoslav federation, from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in Helsinki, where the six European and North American national leaders in Munich will be joining 46 others on Thursday for the most comprehensive East-West summit gathering of the post-Soviet era. Use of NATO Forces **********Officials in Helsinki said today that all C.S.C.E. members except Russia had already agreed to suspend Yugoslavia, and that agreement had been reached on a way to allow the security conference to approach the NATO alliance as well as individual C.S.C.E. members for forces to use in peacekeeping missions if the 52-nation group decided on it. **********The security conference plans to agree on a 12-section charter emphasizing cooperation among former adversaries in building a new European security order. **********Hours before Mr. Yeltsin's arrival at dinner tonight, half a day earlier than originally scheduled, Mr. Baker was asked about a suggestion -- resisted by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Prime Minister John Major of Britain -- that the Russians should be included in the annual economic summit meetings. **********\"If Russia stays on a democratic and free-market course, it might be very likely that the next summit would see the President of Russia in attendance,\" Mr. Baker said. **********But the Japanese remain skeptical about providing money to help him.

More than 70 veterans of the unit joined local townspeople today in this rural section of Norfolk, to place a stone marker where runways long ago crossed the open farm fields, launching B-17's toward targets across the English Channel. **********But for others, like Walter Comer and Richard Byrd, Army veterans who were among the first American troops to arrive in England, their journey back has involved a more personal, and more difficult, search: they spent more than a week in London and Liverpool recently, trying to track down children they have never met nor even seen. 'Sent Me Her Baby Picture' **********\"Her mother sent me her baby picture, but that's all I really knew of her,\" said Mr. Comer, a 76-year-old retired carpenter from Philadelphia.

They are now men and women approaching 50, many with children and even grandchildren of their own. **********But she said it is rare to have the veterans turn up, as Mr. Comer and Mr. Byrd did last week at her house, looking for help in tracking down children. \"But so much time has passed, and all these men are getting older,\" Mrs. Winfield said. \"Perhaps they think, it's now or never.\" **********By 1944, there were about 1.5 million American military personnel stationed in Britain, from crews flying bombing missions over occupied Europe and nurses in military hospitals, to infantry troops training for the invasion of Normandy. **********Among Britons, there was always some ambivalance about the Americans, who on the one hand were cheered for their help in fighting the Nazis, but were also resented by others who described their sometimes overly exuberant presence with a popular wartime phrase: \"They're overpaid, oversexed and over here.\" **********In Norfolk, like much of East Anglia, the main staging area for Allied air raids over Nazi-occupied Europe, there are especially strong ties between the small towns where wartime airfields were built, and the American pilots and crew members who once served on them. **********At the brief outdoor ceremony in Deopham (pronounced DEE-fum) Green, a choir of schoolchildren sang the wartime ballad, \"Comin' In on a Wing and a Prayer,\" and vicars remembered the 300 men of the 452d who were shot down over Europe, never to return home. Violet Jeffery, whose family owned a farm beside the Deopham Green airfield, also stood at the podium to recall her memories of the war. **********\"Our days were punctuated by the drone of planes leaving in the morning,\" Mrs. Jeffery said. \"And it was noticeable that not so many returned in the evening.\" **********Through the coming summer, villages and churches have scheduled dozens of reunions and ceremonies, parades and air shows, across England to celebrate returning American airmen. In turn, some of the Americans are coming back with memorials of their own. **********In Northamptonshire, for example, a former American air crew member recently donated 94 bicycles to children in four villages, as repayment of sorts for what he described as a wartime debt. In 1944, he confessed he had \"borrowed\" and then never returned a villager's bike, so he wouldn't be late for a mission briefing. **********Mr. Comer and Mr. Byrd also sorted through their memories recently, remembering how they had met their English girlfriends at service dances.  \"I often think how hard it must have been for the child, especially with me being black and her mother white and all,\" said Mr. Comer, who was stationed at the time in Cornwall as a member of an all-black United States Army engineering battalion.  He said the child's mother was married when they met, her husband away at the war. **********Mr. Byrd, who is 74 and lives near Wilmington, Del., says he even set aside money in case he ever finds the boy he was told he had fathered, nearly 50 years ago. **********\"It takes a lot of courage to do this, after all these years,\" said Mrs. Winfield, who recently wrote a book, \"Bye Bye Baby,\" recounting the stories of British men and women searching for their American fathers.  \"There are lot of ghosts to be exorcised.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/06/business/battered-industries-picking-up-pieces-six-struggling-business-sectors.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1992-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 392, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BATTERED INDUSTRIES Picking Up the Pieces in Six Struggling Business Sectors; Automobiles: What Detroit Car Makers Can Do While Waiting for the Recovery", "print_headline": "BATTERED INDUSTRIES Picking Up the Pieces in Six Struggling Business Sectors; Automobiles: What Detroit Car Makers Can Do While Waiting for the Recovery", "body_text": " **********The huge cutbacks announced by the General Motors Corporation just before Christmas capped what had already been a grim year for the American auto makers, and 1992 does not look much brighter. **********After layoffs, plant closings and other cost-cutting steps, most industry executives say they can do little now but wait for a stronger economy.

However, that is far short of the goal the industrial and natural resources conglomerate outlined to American analysts and portfolio managers during the company's recent investment roadshows. **********The company wants to be \"a core investment holding here as we are in Britain,\" according to Lord White, head of its American operations. Hanson's track record certainly warrants attention. The company has reported increased profits every year since it was founded in 1964 when Lord White and Lord Hanson merged their fertilizer, commercial vehicle distribution and printing businesses and built the conglomerate with a string of successful takeovers. **********By now almost no company in Britain or the United States is too large to be considered a potential Hanson acquisition, a point driven home by the furor that erupted in London last summer when Hanson began buying shares in Imperial Chemical Industries P.L.C. for investment purposes. And some analysts say the stock, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange where one American depository receipt represents five British shares, is currently undervalued. It closed yesterday at $20.50, down 37.5 cents. **********\"It's extremely cheap right now,\" said Geoffrey Allum, leader of the analysts who follow Hanson for County NatWest Wood Mackenzie in London. \"It doesn't need to acquire any more assets to benefit hugely from any economic pickup.\" **********In recent years, over half Hanson's business has come from American operations, where its natural resource holdings include Peabody Coal, the nation's largest coal company; Cavenham Forest Industries, and Gold Fields Mining. Other businesses include Jacuzzi health spas, Endicott Johnson shoes, Faberware cookware, Kaiser cement, Ames tools and Grove Worldwide, the world's largest producer of construction cranes. The American businesses together would form a company with revenues that would rank among the top 60 in the nation. Hanson, which formerly owned the Smith Corona Corporation, took it public in 1989 but retains a 48 percent interest. **********Hanson's holdings in Britain, where it is the fifth-largest company, include Imperial Tobacco, Britain's Ever Ready battery company and a huge stake in the construction industry, which was recently enlarged by the acquisition of Beazer P.L.C. **********Most analysts are less impressed than Mr. Allum by the prospects for Hanson's stock. The company has become so large that they see scant hope that it can continue achieving 28 percent annual returns. Bruce Davidson, who follows Hanson for Smith New Court in London, describes it as \"mature but cyclical\" with over a third of its revenues coming from economically sensitive businesses. **********Operating income fell in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30 for the first time, and net income is likely to be down this year for the first time unless a fairly sizable business is sold at a hefty profit. Net income in the quarter ended last Dec. 31 fell 21.2 percent, to $349 million, on revenues of $3.93 billion, from $443 million in the last quarter of 1990, which was bolstered by $92 million in one-time profits from the sale of businesses. **********The earnings slowdown comes as Hanson is trying to shed its image as a deal-driven company dependent on its founders. Another stumbling block for investors has been the company's accounting practices, a result of operating an array of companies under differing American and British accounting standards. **********The argument for Hanson is that companies that have been retained under its umbrella have typically recorded huge productivity gains and improved their strategic position. That record was tarnished, company executives admit, by the decline in Smith Corona's fortunes after the public offering. **********During the recent roadshow, Hanson executives said that similar partial disposals were unlikely in the near future and that they remained open to selling companies or acquiring new ones. In the United States, the most likely targets are extensions of existing businesses. Hanson is also interested in expanding into Europe through friendly takeovers but is leery of European Community and local laws that might prevent it from pursuing productivity-enhancing employment cutbacks and factory consolidations. **********The company's high dividend -- $1.17 an A.D.R. for a yield of 5.59 percent -- is especially appealing to American investors, but analysts say the real payoff depends on economic recovery. The stock currently trades at a discount of almost 30 percent to the market in Britain, compared with a 100 premium in 1984, according to David Ireland, an analyst with Hoare Govett in London. It will take renewed earnings growth to narrow the discount. **********\"To invest in Hanson, you have to expect that the economy is going to get better,\" agreed Sidney J.

The very idea evokes images from old newsreels, with grave statesmen in top hats emerging from limousines to urge calm in gravelly voices. But suddenly Europe is up to its eyebrows in one. And while the immediate impact on most people's daily lives will be slight, it could derail the drive to European unity that only a few months ago seemed as inevitable as tomorrow's sunrise. **********How could something so important have happened with so little warning? And why are elected officials who have staked their careers on the currency arrangement known as the European Monetary System seemingly powerless to prevent its meltdown? The answers lie in the basic economics of international finance -- and the even more basic conflicts between domestic and regional political priorities. Trading Francs for Pounds **********Francs are the coin of the realm in France. But when a French company wants to import machinery from a producer in Manchester, England, it must pay the bills in British pounds. And to obtain the pounds, the company must find someone willing to exchange British currency for francs. **********The exchange rate is thus the price of pounds in francs, or francs in pounds. And it must roughly reflect the relative purchasing power of the two currencies in their home markets. If, for example, a drill press costs 1,000 francs in Paris and $:200 in London, the exchange rate had better be more or less 5 francs to the pound. Otherwise, both the British and the French will buy all their drills presses on one side of the Channel. **********But like life, economics rarely works out so neatly. In the short run, currency exchange rates are influenced by many factors, including the behavior of governments. And since the rates have enormous impact on where goods that can be traded are made and how much they cost, exchange rates are a matter of great interest to the people in charge of national economies. **********Most countries (including the United States) allow their currencies to \"float\" against others. Voluntary transactions between private buyers and sellers determine a currency's value. That suits many politicians, since setting a fixed exchange rate would force them to balance the interests of domestic producers against those of consumers buying goods from abroad. **********But European leaders are immensely taken by the idea of maintaining very stable exchange rates within the greater European economy, and for two reasons. First the system eliminates uncertainty, greasing the wheels of commerce within Europe. A German truck maker can set a price for its trucks in Italian lira, for delivery in six months, because it knows what the exchange rate between marks and lira will be. **********More important, a fixed exchange system imposes a collective discipline on all the national economies linked to the system. If, for example, Italy allows inflation at home to drive up production costs at its factories, a fixed exchange rate with the mark (and pound and franc) will make Italian products from those factories too expensive to sell abroad. **********Indeed, from this perspective, the only other thing better than maintaining fixed exchange rates among European currencies is the adoption of a single currency for the whole European economy. And that is just what European Community leaders proposed to do in the Maastricht agreement on European political and economic union, which they signed last December. **********The signatories at Maastricht, visionaries who generally speak of the agreement in political terms, appeared to comprehend that a successful currency union -- or for that matter, a stable fixed exchange rate system -- demanded coordination of virtually all aspects of national economic policy. But they were unable to accomplish that before the currency crisis erupted. Price of Unification **********Two years ago, West Germany took on the burden of paying for German unification. But the price of bringing eastern Germany up to snuff and subsidizing the easterners' living standards in the meantime has been far higher than anyone guessed. And the Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl has balked at raising taxes sufficiently to keep Germany's budget in balance. **********Germany's inflation-wary (and very independent) central bank reacted by jacking up interest rates. Foreigners responded by purchasing tens of billions of dollars' worth of German marks and investing the proceeds in German bank deposits paying as much as 9 percent interest -- a far higher interest rate than they could get by depositing their money in New York. **********Not surprisingly, the price of the mark soared with respect to the dollar as traders found it evermore difficult to find people to sell them the German currency. What should not have surprised anyone, but somehow did, was the reaction in currency markets in the rest of Europe. **********Since, by government agreement, all the leading European currencies were tied to the mark, they, too, rose sharply in value relative to the dollar. But in the last month, the banks and corporations that control much of the worlds' currency in private hands wondered whether these agreements would stick. And with good reason. Last Thing They Wanted **********To maintain fixed exchange rates with Germany, other European countries were forced to raise their interest rates to make it as attractive for investors to hold these nations' currencies as it was to hold German marks. But with Britain deep in recession and other European economies heading there, the last thing that European leaders wanted to do was to discourage domestic spending by raising interest rates. **********Check that: the very last thing they wanted to do was to allow their currencies to remain high against the dollar for very long. Much of their trade, after all, is with the United States. And a strong pound or franc or lira makes their goods more expensive and harder to sell in the country that pays its bills in greenbacks. **********The more traders thought about it, the less they wanted to take the chance of being caught holding currencies other than German marks on the day that European governments were unable to defend fixed exchange rates. Britain tried to bluff, effectively arguing that it would do anything to hold the line. But in the end, the traders' prophecy proved to be self-fulfilling. **********The economic damage is likely to be modest. Indeed, the currency realignment forced by the German policy of tight money and high interest rates could do a lot of good in the short run. **********The longer-term impact is harder to assess. In the best of worlds, it will teach Europeans a relatively painless lesson about the importance of coordinating their economic policies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/09/world/conflict-in-the-balkins-bush-and-the-un-fail-to-fix-accord-on-balkans-crisis.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Rosenthal", "pub_date": "1992-08-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1228, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSH AND THE U.N.

FAIL TO FIX ACCORD ON BALKANS CRISIS", "body_text": " **********Despite intensive negotiations, President Bush and leaders of other Security Council nations failed to reach agreement today on further measures to take in response to the Balkan crisis because no country wants to commit itself to sending ground troops to a war zone, officials said. **********In their discussions on how to get relief to the war-besieged peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the members of the Security Council also could not agree on the specific wording of a resolution that would authorize the use of force to help relief deliveries -- both in terms of the scope and type of force that it would authorize and whether the resolution would also go a step further and commit the Security Council to action. **********Expectations that an agreement had been reached on a new resolution arose after Mr. Bush summoned reporters to his family compound at Walker's Point for an afternoon news conference. Situation Seems Little Changed **********But Mr. Bush's remarks suggested that the diplomatic situation was little changed. His appearance seemed intended primarily to demonstrate that he is hard at work on the the Balkan crisis and to ease the steadily mounting pressure to take further action both to supply aid to the Bosnians and to shut Serbian detention camps, where there have been reports of torture and mass killings. **********The White House also said that Mr. Bush had offered to give Gov. Bill Clinton an intelligence briefing on the Yugoslavian situation, which the White House hopes might persuade the Democratic nominee to moderate his criticism of the President's policies on Yugoslavia, and that Mr. Clinton had accepted in principle. **********In the Balkans today, the airport at Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, was reopened for relief flights. And in Belgrade, capital of Yugoslavia, representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross said they had been granted access to Serbian-run detention camps in Bosnia. But visitors said there was evidence that prisoners were being moved from the most notorious sites.  [ Page 12. ] 'Wide Array of Options' **********Mr. Bush spoke of \"the critical importance of acting early to avoid the deterioration of the situation\" in the former Yugoslavia and said he was pleased with the progress of negotiations at the United Nations. But the President said that nothing had been decided and that the members of the Security Council were talking about \"a wide array of options.\" **********After Mr. Bush spoke, American officials said there were several important areas that had yet to be resolved before the United Nations authorizes further action to open a land route into Bosnia to bring in food and medicine to supplement relief supplies being flown into Sarajevo now. Most important, officials said the Security Council members were in agreement that it would be impossible to do that without deploying thousands of ground combat troops along the supply route, but no nation was offering its own forces for the purpose. **********Mr. Bush has repeatedly made clear that he is strongly opposed to sending American ground troops into Bosnia and would prefer to use American air and naval power to back up European ground forces. He repeated his concerns today. **********\"Before one soldier or whatever it is -- Marine -- is committed to battle, I'm going to know how that person gets out of there,\" Mr. Bush said. \"And we are not going to get down in -- bogged down in some guerrilla warfare.\" **********But a senior official said that while \"no country has a for-certain scenario of how they might end this thing, under any scenario, using force means committing ground troops.\" **********Beyond the problem of what country would send in ground troops, officials said there was also no agreement on the language of the resolution -- whether it would authorize the use of any force in an open-ended way, as the Security Council did in the Persian Gulf, or would specify the type of force that may be used. The officials said there was also no agreement on whether the resolution would commit the Security Council members to take action, or simply authorize them do so at a time of their choosing. **********Mr. Bush, who has been under intense political pressure to take action on Yugoslavia, especially since concerns about the detention camps have grown, made his comments at his third news conference in three days on the situation in Bosnia. During his trip here this weekend, the President's advisers have taken care to avoid having the President photographed in any of his usual Kennebunkport activities -- golfing, boating and fishing. **********Although Mr. Bush had nothing concrete to announce, he repeated his oft-stated insistence that his responses to the Balkan conflict was not driven by electoral politics. But when asked if he had summoned reporters to Walker's Point so they could report that he was hard at work on Balkan policy, Mr. Bush replied, \"I hope you will because it's the truth.\" **********A senior official said that Mr. Bush wanted to use news conferences to reduce the pressure to take quick action, by demonstrating that he is working on a response and to make the case that the situation in the former Yugoslavia is too complicated and volatile for quick solutions. **********\"The President had this press conference today and is going to keep having them to get people to focus on the fact that this is not Kuwait,\" a senior official said. **********Mr. Bush said he was not sure that military force of any kind would be effective. \"I'm not certain that air strikes themselves would solve the problem,\" he said. \"Nor am I certain that putting ground forces into this situation, as it stands now, would solve the problem.\" **********As the diplomacy proceeded at the United Nations and by telephone, the President summoned Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Deputy Secretary of State Lawurence S. Eagleburger and Alexander Watson, the Deputy United States Ambassador to the United Nations, for an urgent meeting at Walker's Point. Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, also attended. **********Mr. Bush said that he and his advisers had reviewed the status of the negotiations on the situation in the former Yugoslavia and that he had spoken by telephone with the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali. The President also conferred with Prime Minister John Major of Britain on Friday, officials said. **********An Administration official said Mr. Scowcroft, Mr. Eagleburger, Mr. Cheney and Mr. Watson had been conducting intensive discussions with their counterparts from the other countries on the Security Council. **********Despite the failure to work out differences over the resolution, Mr. Bush said he was \"confident they will be resolved.\" **********But there was some concern among the Security Council countries that a strong resolution threatening the use of force might be taken by the Serbians as an act of war. **********Mr. Boutros-Ghali was said to believe that if the United Nations were to make any further threat of force, it would leave the peacekeepers now stationed in Yugoslavia open to serious attacks from the Serbs. Even with an agreement among the United States, Britain and France, Washington faces more delicate diplomacy before it can actually get the resolution through the Security Council."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/25/world/ex-official-cites-doubt-on-pow-s.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1992-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 824, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EX-OFFICIAL CITES DOUBT ON P.O.W.'S", "print_headline": "EX-OFFICIAL CITES DOUBT ON P.O.W.'S", "body_text": " **********Elliot L. Richardson, Secretary of Defense when American troops were withdrawn from Vietnam in 1973, said today that the Pentagon believed that some prisoners of war might have remained in neighboring Laos, contrary to a statement by President Nixon that all the prisoners were on their way home. **********Mr. Richardson, who was Defense Secretary for four months between the signing of the Paris peace agreement on Jan. 27, 1973, and his appointment as Attorney General in May, told the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs that he could only speculate why Mr. Nixon told Americans on March 29, 1973, that \"all our American P.O.W.'s are on their way home.\" **********Mr. Richardson conjectured that politics may have been a consideration in the President's decision to say all the prisoners were returning when the Pentagon was producing tallies of possible prisoners. Or the White House may have tried to avoid raising false hopes among relatives. **********\"Whatever made the considerations, somebody could rationalize the distinction between the basis of this number and the basis for his statement,\" Mr. Richardson said when shown the Pentagon tallies. \"But how it actually came about, for all I know he deliberately chose to lie. But I try to give him the benefit of the doubt.\" **********Earlier in the week, two other former Defense Secretaries, Melvin R. Laird and James R. Schlesinger, both indicated that they believed there was a possibility that some Americans were left behind. But former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said that while it was possible that some of those unaccounted for at the end of the war might have been prisoners, there was no hard evidence to support that, and that if any officials believed there were prisoners, they never said that to him. Memo Called for Diplomacy **********Mr. Richardson said today, \"The Defense Department was doing everything, in effect, that was in our power to track down additional P.O.W.'s.\" A Pentagon memorandum to the White House recommending a diplomatic offensive on the issue was apparently ignored, several officials said today. **********Mr. Richardson was dismissed as Attorney General by Mr. Nixon in the \"Saturday night massacre\" of October 1973, after refusing to dismiss the Watergate prosecutor, Archibald Cox. **********As classified documents from the White House, Pentagon and State Department have been released over the last few months at the request of the committee, attention has gradually centered on Laos, a poor nation dominated by Vietnam since the end of French rule in Indochina in 1954. For more than a decade, the Central Intelligence Agency ran a \"secret war\" in Laos, arming anti-Communist tribal people and Thai irregulars. **********In 1973, the Defense Intelligence Agency listed more than 350 Americans as missing or prisoners of war in Laos. By the end of March, 591 prisoners had been returned by Hanoi. Only nine of them were captured in Laos. **********On the day before President Nixon told a national television audience that all the prisoners were coming home from Indochina, Mr. Richardson had sent a memorandum to Mr. Kissinger, then national security adviser, saying he was \"concerned over the situation in Laos regarding our men who are still being held prisoner or missing.\" Military Threat Urged **********In the memo, Mr. Richardson recommended that Hanoi and the Laotians be threatened with renewed military action to demonstrate that \"the U.S. will no longer play games with the P.O.W. issue in Laos.\" **********Testifying today with Mr. Richardson was Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, who helped write a position paper on the Laos prisoner issue addressed to the Defense Secretary as well as the memo to Mr. Kissinger. **********Mr. Secord said that based on the number of American planes shot down over Laos and the number of crewmen known to have survived crashes, it would have been \"absurd\" not to expect 20 to 40 more Americans to have come home from Laos. **********He said there was enough evidence, including photographs of prisoners, to know with \"a high degree of certitude\" that Americans were in captivity. **********The United States, which did not have a separate peace treaty with Laos, held Hanoi responsible for the return of prisoners captured by the Communist Pathet Lao.  'Not Absolutely Certain' **********When Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the committee, asked Mr. Richardson whether he would concur that a statement saying all prisoners were coming home was incorrect, the former Attorney General replied, \"Yes.\" **********\"We had reason to believe there were additional prisoners of war in the hands of the Laotians,\" Mr. Richardson said. Then, echoing the earlier testimony of Mr. Laird and Mr. Schlesinger, he added: \"We were not absolutely certain. We did not have definitive information as to the numbers.\" **********Several panels of witnesses from the Nixon Administration told the Senate committtee that the antiwar mood of the United States made any military action unlikely, however."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/14/business/technology-helping-polluters-clean-up-their-act.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1992-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Technology; Helping Polluters Clean Up Their Act", "print_headline": "Technology; Helping Polluters Clean Up Their Act", "body_text": " **********There are thousands of processes and devices that claim to clean up contaminated property, improve air quality or reduce the pollution in lakes, streams and groundwater, with more being invented daily. Which ones work? Who guides inventors to the market? Who helps venture capitalists figure out which to back? Who helps polluters sort through cleanup options? Who knows the way through the thicket of regulations, lawsuits and inertia preventing progress? **********No one does it all. What this country needs is Super Technologist, who, alas, is nowhere to be found. There is, however, the National Environmental Technology Applications Corporation, a four-year-old consulting company housed at the University of Pittsburgh's Applied Research Center here. Netac, as the nonprofit concern is known, is a stepchild of the Environmental Protection Agency set up to face these challenges. Its limited progress underscores how daunting they are. **********The prelude to Netac's birth was the creation here of the Center for Hazardous Materials Research through the efforts of Edgar Berkey, a former Westinghouse research executive, and Samuel A. Schulhof, a fellow Pittsburgher who was an E.P.A. associate administrator. Both men felt an independent research organization was needed to counter the adversarial atmosphere that had developed in the environmental field between industry and Government. **********Mr. Berkey and Mr. Schulhof found a willing host in the University of Pittsburgh Trust, which had been given the former research complex of the Gulf Oil Company in this Pittsburgh suburb and was looking for a way to expand its public service programs. **********By 1988, Mr. Berkey and Mr. Schulhof had convinced the E.P.A. that a separate organization was needed to concentrate on technology commercialization, and Netac was born. A five-year cooperative agreement with E.P.A. provided most of Netac's initial cash and a leg up in marketing itself in the crowded environmental consulting field. Netac claims that it blends an intimate understanding of the goals and needs of regulators with the confidentiality, technical skills and profit orientation demanded by the private sector. **********Netac's services include helping inventors to analyze potential markets, critiquing their financial and strategic plans, testing and evaluating products, and offering regulatory advice. Netac also has a growing data base that includes published profiles of more than 100 environmental technologies, short references to 1,400 others, surveys of the available technology for particular problems like cleaning up hazardous chemicals used in treating wood products and case studies of pilot tests of a handful of cleanup technologies. And it has conducted numerous environmental technology seminars at home and overseas for executives and public officials. **********\"We are attempting to commercialize technology in other ways too,\" said Michael Mastracci, the E.P.A. program administrator monitoring Netac, citing a 1986 law that encourages Federal research laboratories to set up joint ventures with private partners. **********For all the good intentions, what the E.P.A. had to offer Netac's founders was closer to a pat on the back than a comfortable endowment. Netac started so small that even though it has grown rapidly and now relies on the E.P.A. for just one-third of its revenues, it is still a pipsqueak. **********Netac now has 50 employees, up from eight, and projected revenues of $3.4 million for 1992, compared with $413,000 in its first year. Numerous private consulting companies offer services that cover parts of Netac's mandate more thoroughly than Netac can. It has done relatively little work on air pollution technology, for example, and has limited experience in the West and South. **********\"We are trying to do a lot with limited resources,\" said Robb Lenhart, Netac's director of business development. **********Netac's founders and E.P.A. officials originally thought small businesses and entrepreneurs would be Netac's main clientele. But much of the focus has shifted to larger companies. \"In many cases, the people with the larger problems are the larger corporations,\" said Mr. Lenhart. **********Netac has also had its agenda reshaped by events no one foresaw. After the Valdez oil spill off the coast of Alaska, the E.P.A. wanted to use the polluted area as a test bed for microbes and other biological products that might help clean up such disasters. It asked Netac to develop criteria for choosing which bioremediation products should be tested and provide advice on how to conduct the tests. That led Netac to establish a group for testing and evaluating such products. **********In addition, Netac has shifted some of its original goals to the back burner because the prospects for success were so slim. Mr. Schulhof, who left in 1990 to become head of General Electric's environmental research center, hopes to do a better job of finding seed money. Many entrepreneurs are not far enough along with their inventions for Netac to link them with investors. **********But Netac does have some fans among the small players it originally targeted. \"They fit right into our needs,\" said Howard Miller, a venture capitalist in Scarsdale, N.Y., who is backing development of a technology that uses sulfur vapor to break hazardous organic molecules into harmless solids that can be recycled. Netac helped with plans for moving the process from the laboratory to commercial-size facilities, providing cost estimates, pilot-scale tests and finally proposals that the Army use the process for destroying nerve gas. \"They have a tremendous amount of technical and Government information that we in venture capital have little access to,\" Mr. Miller said. **********And Robert Hoch, a Hendersonville, N.Y., consultant who is vice president in charge of technology for STDX Technologies Inc., said Netac provided valuable research and expertise about what markets required of technologies like STDX's for cleaning up PCB-contaminated soils. But STDX's experience also demonstrates how entrepreneurs face problems that Netac or any other consultant is powerless to address. **********\"Our problem is that there are not enough people motivated to clean up hazardous waste sites,\" said Mr. Hoch. \"When that happens, we'll get our share, but Netac can't create demand.\" **********One of Netac's least enjoyable tasks is to tell entrepreneurs why the world is not beating paths to their doors. Many founders of start-up businesses vastly overestimate the market potential, said Mr. Berkey, who is Netac's chief executive. \"They are astounded that what they thought was a product for a $1 billion market has its most favorable application in a $25 million slice.\" **********Mr. Berkey assesses Netac's progress to date as \"small steps.\" The Netac of the future, he said, could have as many as 1,000 employees, annual revenues of $100 million and offices in several locations. **********The looming short-term question is what its relationship will be with E.P.A. after 1993.  \"Officially, they are getting booted out of the nest at the end of the cooperative agreement,\" Mr. Mastracci said. \"However, they've proved themselves. I would like to see a small, continuing partnership in some form.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/20/business/company-news-washington-state-layoffs-at-boeing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Washington State Layoffs at Boeing", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Washington State Layoffs at Boeing", "body_text": " **********The Boeing Company said its employment level in Washington state would be reduced by about 6,500 employees this year.

But in the next three months, yields on the long bonds rose above 8 percent, and rates on short-term securities also moved higher, though not nearly as much. **********While acknowledging that rates could temporarily move higher after last week's strong rally, traders and analysts argue that conditions are different than they were six months ago. Rush of New Issues **********The Fed's move last year set off a record volume of new issues in the corporate and municipal bond markets. The surge, coupled with Government estimates that the Federal budget deficit would reach $400 billion in the current fiscal year, helped push rates higher. Statistics showing the economy was improving in January and February advanced the upward momentum. **********The drop in rates engineered by the Fed on Thursday -- a half-point cut in the discount rate, to 3 percent, and a similar cut in the target for the Federal funds rate, to 3.25 percent -- will almost certainly keep investment bankers active this week. Some $10 billion to $15 billion worth of new corporate debt issues could be priced this week, bankers said, and the tax-exempt calendar is heavy. **********But specialists in corporate and municipal finance said the pace of new issues, at least through the summer, would almost certainly slow from the torrid clip of the first six months of the year. **********In the first half, corporations issued $132.8 billion worth of nonconvertible debt securities, according to the Securities Data Company, up more than 38 percent from the comparable period a year ago. **********In addition, figures from The Bond Buyer, a publication that tracks developments in municipal finance, show that $109 billion worth of new municipal bonds were sold in the first half, a 46 percent increase from the similar 1991 period. **********Analysts are convinced that such a pace cannot be sustained because a disproportionate amount of the volume in both markets were securities issued to refinance debt issued in the mid- to late 1980's. Net new credit demand, however, was quite weak and is likely to remain so. 'Not Stimulative for Borrowing' **********\"The interest rates move by the Fed is not enough to stimulate large borrowing above and beyond refinancings,\" said Thomas J. Sowanick, senior fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company. **********\"We have learned,\" he added, \"that lower interest rates are not stimulative for borrowing because the level of debt outstanding owed by corporations and individuals is still extraordinarily high.\" **********George Friedlander, a managing director at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said that unless rates continued to plunge, the volume of new issues in the tax-exempt market should be down substantially from the first half. **********Of the $109 billion in new municipal issues priced in the first half, more than 42 percent were refunding issues, he said, a 143 percent increase from the first six months of 1991. **********\"Refunding capability gets used up,\" he said, \"and there are very few new-money financings that are that rate-sensitive.\" **********Moreover, while the need to finance new projects is manifest, \"the number of states that can afford to do them is much less great,\" Mr. Friedlander added. **********In addition, while the supply of new Treasury securities to be sold in the third quarter will be enormous, the Government's financing needs are well below the estimates bandied about at the beginning of the year. **********Borrowing by the Treasury in the current quarter will amount to less than $70 billion, according to analysts at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm, about half as large as the most dire forecasts presented in January. **********Louis v. B. Crandall, Wrightson's chief economist, said yields on short-term Treasury securities were now at much more realistic levels than in the winter. **********\"Part of the rise in yields during the first quarter was due to the fact that they had fallen too far,\" he said. **********In January, for example, two-year Treasury notes were yielding 4.60 percent when the Fed's target for the funds rate was 4 percent. **********At the close of trading on Thursday, by contrast, two-year notes were yielding 4.55 percent. But through two easing moves the Fed had dropped its funds rate target by three-quarters of a percent, to 3.25 percent.  More Sputtering **********Aside from easing supply pressures, Mr. Crandall and other analysts say there is little chance that economic data will show the marked improvement this summer that was seen in the first two months of the year. And inflationary pressures remain in check. **********For most analysts, the June employment report was a sobering reminder of how wobbly the underpinnings of the current recovery really are, and it virtually insures that most of the important economic statistics to be released this month will be weak. **********\"I had thought the recovery would be slow, sluggish and sustainable,\" said Donald J.

A handful of them watched quietly today as villagers poked through the rubble of their homes, cradling automatic rifles and staring at the ground to avoid hostile glares. **********The arrival of convoys like the one that brought villagers to Kosutarica today must be negotiated in advance with local Serbian commanders. Some commanders are receptive, but others are reluctant to admit the convoys. **********Since the United Nations \"visitation program\" began last month, refugees have returned to view their homes in more than 40 villages. Most are Croatian villages in Serb-controlled areas, but some are Serbian villages in the two-thirds of Croatia that is under Croatian Government control. **********The process has not always gone smoothly. In one Serbian village, Grubisno Polje, Croatian militants blew up five homes rather than leave them standing and thereby encourage owners to hope that they might someday return.  Militants' Opposition **********A return of refugees to villages like Kosutarica would mean a reversal of the process of \"ethnic cleansing\" by which Serbian and Croatian militias have forced members of other ethnic groups to leave territory they claim as their own. **********\"This is a pilot project, and we have had resistance from extremist groups,\" said Shannon Boyd, spokeswoman for the United Nations peacekeeping force here. \"Like all of our projects here, we are operating on a razor's edge.\" **********Militants on both sides oppose the presence of United Nations peacekeepers in Serb-controlled areas of Croatia, which the Serbs have proclaimed as the Serbian Republic of Krajina.

During the 1980's, several of the countries defaulted on their debt payments. **********Banks said the agreement would bring Argentina's re-entry into the community of creditworthy nations and reduce its borrowing costs by as much as two percentage points. **********Mexico was the first country to reach such a debt agreement in 1989, followed by Venezuela, Chile, Bolivia and Uruguay. Colombia never defaulted on its payments. **********Bankers said agreements remained to be completed with Brazil, Peru and Ecuador. Earlier this year, Brazil signed an agreement in principle on its $44 billion of commercial bank debt, but further progress has been bogged down by impeachment proceedings against President Fernando Collor de Mello, who has been suspended from office. **********Despite the seizure of near-dictatorial powers by President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru, that country has made important progress toward rejoining the international financial community, and bankers said Peru was likely to sign an agreement in principle early next year on restructuring its $10 billion in debt. **********\"The signing today will allow Argentina to put the issue of debt behind it after 10 years of preoccupation, and allow the country to focus on growth and investment,\" said William R. Rhodes, vice chairman of Citibank and head of the 13-member Bank Advisory Committee that negotiated with Argentina. **********In large part, the agreement reflects changes in the country's economy brought about by the Menem Government during the last 21 months. Inflation, which once reached 6,000 percent a year, has been brought down to less than 20 percent. The Government is selling all of its state industries, which were losing $5 billion a year. It has balanced its budget, sharply reduced Government employment and opened its once-closed economy to international competition. Questions About Stability **********But serious questions remain about the future stability of a country undergoing such changes, as was seen from the bloody coup attempt in Venezuela nine days ago against the Government of President Carlos Andres Perez. Also, though these agreements are reducing the debt owed to commercial banks, the International Monetary Fund has estimated that the overall level of Latin American debt will continue to increase through next year. **********This means governments will have to continue policies that stimulate economic growth to insure their ability to meet the interest payments. **********Such concern was crucial in the final negotiations with commercial banks over the Argentine debt load, which totaled $23 billion in principal and $8 billion in unpaid interest payments. **********Banks had essentially two options. One was to replace existing debt with so-called discount bonds, which would equal 30 percent of the value of the existing Argentine bonds but maintain the debt at a floating interest rate equivalent to the London interbank offered rate plus thirteen-sixteenths of a percentage point. Banks holding 35 percent of Argentine debt opted for this approach. **********A second option was to receive so-called par bonds, in which the prinicipal value would remain the same for the next 30 years, but the interest paid would rise from 4 to 6 percent during the first six years and remained at 6 percent for the remaining life of the bonds. Banks holding 65 percent of Argentine debt took this arrangement. **********This is the equivalent of Argentina's locking in a low-interest 30-year mortgage. **********Bankers said the agreement would open the Argentine economy to much more foreign and domestic long-term investment. **********\"Money that goes into plant and equipment needs to feel comfortable that a country is stable and creditworthy,\" said one banker, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. \"This agreement gives that signal.\"                    --------------------       Venezuela Loans Halted **********CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 6 (AP) -- Foreign banks have put $600 million in loans to Venezuela's state oil company on hold in the wake of a recent coup attempt. **********Petroleos de Venezuela, the world's third-largest refining company and the second-largest oil exporter to the United States, is strapped for cash and investment capital because of slumping worldwide oil prices and a heavy local tax burden.

But he said that \"as a Christian, I can't close my eyes in a prayer with a Muslim or a Hindu because I'd put my God on the same level as theirs.\" **********Philippus Hennop, a contractor, expressed scant sympathy for his fellow Afrikaners who objected to seeing apartheid disappear. \"Basically, the fear boils down to, they've got to start working,\" Mr. Hennop said. \"They sat for three centuries while somebody else did all the work.\" **********\"The National Party has got to take some of the blame, because they had us in the trenches for years with black fear and we've got to get out of it.\" Mr. Hennop said. He said he voted for the National Party but never felt comfortable doing it until President de Klerk took over. **********Mr. Hennop's wife, Annetjie, said that after she criticized the Afrikaner Resistance Movement her automobile was scratched and the telephone started ringing with hate calls. \"You just swear far harder than they can; that's how I stopped them,\" she said. \"I said, 'You call this home one more time and I'm going to come into town and hit you.' \" **********Barrie Barnard, a lawyer who heads the National Party's branch in Potgietersrus, said Afrikaners were never the monolithic tribe that outsiders supposed. They quarreled over their pioneer trek into the African interior, over South Africa's support of Britain in two world wars and now over Mr. de Klerk's political changes. 'What Went Wrong With Him?' **********Still, some townspeople accuse Mr. de Klerk of betraying his \"volk,\" an Afrikaans word for nation or people, but with emotional overtones. **********\"He came from a solid Afrikaner background,\" said Neil van Onselen, a lawyer who supports the Conservatives. \"What went wrong with him? You adjust your circumstances to your principle, not your principle to your circumstances.\" **********Mr. van Onselen thought the tensions generated in Potgietersrus by the referendum were only temporary. \"We live with these people,\" he said. \"We won't exorcise them or anything like that.\" **********But some right-wingers refuse to concede that while they dominate Potgietersrus, they may not prevail in South Africa. **********\"We have no place to go,\" said Mr. Yeates, who predicted war if Mr. de Klerk shared power with blacks. \"We believe this land was given by God to us.

But here it was a cause for hope, for it was by far the lowest number of daily deaths in Baidoa since statistics started to be kept in August. **********With a civil war still raging in parts of Somalia and relief efforts in many areas blocked by bands of teen-age gunmen, no one here is predicting the end of the famine. But there are glimmers of improvement in Baidoa. **********An informal soccer game, the first all year, was played today on a dusty field here; before, there were no children with enough energy to kick a ball. **********There was a plucky boy on a bike. **********In the market, homemade candy was for sale, and fruit -- bananas, tomatoes and melons from the south -- was sold from wooden barrows. The tailors were back in business, sewing on machines in the open air. **********And, perhaps the best news of all, patchy carpets of thin green have begun to sprout in the countryside. **********Hearing about the distribution of seeds by aid agencies, about 10,000 bereft farmers who came to Baidoa to scrounge for food have returned to their villages to plant. Heavy rains have fallen, softening the dark, fertile earth that used to be Somalia's breadbasket. In Manas, 20 miles south of here, sorghum sown a week ago is already pushing through the soil. **********But the reduction in daily deaths in Baidoa, from a high of 360 last month, was greeted soberly by Somali and Western aid officials. Some suggested that the decline was because the most vulnerable -- the young, the old, the sick -- had already died. Now, they suggested, the famine was taking its toll among the heartiest. **********\"The children have died before,\" said Hussein Dahir Ahmed, the local director of the Somali Red Crescent Society, whose workers have been picking up bodies every morning since July and taking them to four vast graveyards. \"They were the weakest. In all, I think about 25 percent of the population has died.\" **********This morning, 48 of the 65 dead were adults, Mr. Ahmed said, many died from malnutrition-related diseases. **********According to calculations by the International Committee of the Red Cross, more than 20,000 people have died in this town since July. About 100,000 Somalis are estimated to have died of hunger since early this year. **********And while an international airlift, led by the United States, has continued to deliver food to Baidoa, other vital supply lines remain blocked by fighting.  The Guns Still Sound **********The port in the capital, Mogadishu, which is the key to large-scale food deliveries, has been operating intermittently. The capital's airport was closed this week because of fighting. Airlifts to two large towns, Belet Uen and Bardera, have been stopped during the past 10 days due to clan warfare. **********United Nations troops, sent to Mogadishu last month to protect food convoys from being looted, remain at their base, wrangling with local warlords about how they should be deployed. The Red Cross says that by staying in their barracks, the 500 troops lost \"the psychological impact of their presence.\" **********Hanging over Baidoa is the fear of renewed clan fighting, which tore this town and the surrounding countryside to shreds earlier this year. **********Half of the 60 foreign aid workers were evacuated last week when it seemed that fighting in Bardera, 160 miles southwest, might spread here. In Bardera, Mohammed Siad Barre Morgan, the son-in-law of the deposed President, Mohammed Siad Barre, last week defeated the troops of one of the main warlords, Mohammed Farah Aidid. The fighting halted United Nations relief flights and sent thousands of fearful, hungry people back to the bush. **********A United Nations team that visited Bardera today said 11,000 women and children in a displaced-persons camp there were \"crying for food.\" The Specter of Siad Barre **********Much of the destruction in Baidoa was done by the troops of President Siad Barre as they fled Mogadishu in January 1991. Many of the local people said they feared a reprise if General Morgan, who is considered by many to be a surrogate of the President, advanced on Baidoa. **********\"If Siad Barre's people come to Baidoa just now, I'm ready to go,\" said Amina Sheik Mohammed, a nurse at a feeding center run by Irish Concern; her husband was killed last year by President Siad Barre's troops. **********In Mogadishu, fighting between General Aidid and the Hawadle clan, which controls the airport, has raged on and off for several weeks. It reached a peak this week, closing the airport and diverting relief flights to an airstrip 40 miles out of town. **********To Mr. Ahmed, of the Red Crescent Society, the lack of movement by the United Nations toward a political and military solution is the greatest impediment to the relief effort. **********\"We are grateful to the international community in its help to bring down the deaths,\" he said, \"but what we want them to find is a political solution to this turmoil so we can better fulfil our duties without these gunmen.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/19/business/futures-options-natural-gas-prices-up-sharply.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1992-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 451, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Natural Gas Prices Up Sharply", "print_headline": "FUTURES/OPTIONS; Natural Gas Prices Up Sharply", "body_text": " **********Natural gas prices surged to a new high for the year yesterday after volatile trading in the futures market.

A cool spring, rising demand and some voluntary drilling cutbacks earlier in the year helped reduce bulging gas inventories before Hurricane Andrew temporarily knocked out some production in the Gulf of Mexico last month. Delay in Restoring Supplies **********After the close of trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, the Federal Government said that about half of the output lost last month because of the hurricane would not be fully restored until December. Production of an estimated 2.5 billion cubic feet a day was temporarily suspended because of damage by Hurricane Andrew. **********The Minerals Management Service, a Government agency in Washington, had previously estimated that the suspended output would be restored by November. The long-term impact on gas flows from hurricane damage appeared to be insignificant, the agency said. **********More than a billion cubic feet of halted production in the gulf has been restored, said Scott Sewell, the agency's director. The number of platforms damaged by the hurricane was raised to 241, from 200 a week ago, he said. **********Paul R. Leibman, an analyst at Petrie, Parkman & Company, a Denver brokerage firm, said actual prices for contracts between producers and buyers of gas were probably lower than the surging prices in the futures market. Demand From Speculators **********A portion of the heavy demand for the October gas contract came from speculators who were covering previous bets that the contract price would tumble, said Thomas M. Jozef, a trader at the Citicorp Commodities Corporation. The October contract expires on Wednesday. **********The average price of a group of 12 monthly gas contracts exceeded $2 for the first time this year. **********The November contract rose 9.3 cents, to $2.397; the December contract gained 5.8 cents, to $2.444, and the January contract added 3.3 cents, to $2.436. **********John E.

Last Major Hurdle **********However, the question of the demobilization of the People's Revolutionary Army appeared to be the most difficult roadblock to overcome. **********More than 35 field commanders from the , group, one of five represented in the guerrilla front, held an unannounced meeting in the capital on Friday with Peter Romero, the charge d'affaires of the United States Embassy, to discuss their fears and frustrations. **********Mr. Romero said today that the field commanders had returned to their rural zones to discuss possible next steps with their followers. The group is led by Joaquin Villalobos, the master guerrilla tactician who fought the army to a draw. **********Mr. Romero said none of the participants in the meeting gave any indication that they intended to return to war, but he said they expressed \"a lot of apprehensions\" about some of the Government promises. Worry Over Committments **********Mr. Romero said the commanders were worried that, once the formal peace is declared, promises to reduce the size of the army and continue a land distribution program might be broken. They also said they feared the army might be sent into former conflict zones after the peace is made formal. **********\"I found that they were not very well informed about what has been happening during these months,\" Mr. Romero said. \"I can't say that there has been bad faith on either side, but they seemed to have little understanding of the details. **********\"They were concerned about whether the United States would be here to guarantee implementation,\" he added, \"and seemed surprised when I told them that our aid is linked to compliance with the peace accords by both sides.\" **********\"I told them that we realize we are the major aid giver and that we are here to provide guarantees,\" he said, adding that he had told the commanders the incoming Clinton Administration would continue to give El Salvador \"high priority.\" Transition Period **********The Government and the rebels in the Salvadoran civil war signed a United Nations-mediated peace agreement on Jan. 16, and on Feb. 1 began a cease-fire, or period of \"armed peace,\" during which they committed themselves to carry out a series of steps leading to formal peace, originally scheduled for Oct. 31. **********Delays in fulfilling the agreement led to a renegotiation of the timetable and establishment of the new date of Dec. 15 for the ceremony. Vice President Dan Quayle, United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and other foreign leaders are scheduled to attend. **********Under the agreement, the members of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front were to demobilize and disarm so the front could be reorganized as a political party. Also stipulated was a reduction of the army and a purge of officers accountable for the most serious crimes against civilians. The agreement also called for the adoption of legislation dealing with electoral and judicial reform, and the provision of land and other benefits for former combatants on both sides and to guerrilla followers. Demobilization in Phases **********The entire guerrilla front has been carrying out a phased demobilization of its 8,000 combatants since the end of June, with 20 per cent disarming in each step, handing in their weapons to United Nations peacekeepers. The fourth phase of the demobilization occurred at the beginning of this month, which was supposed to leave just the final 20 per cent to disarm immediately before Tuesday's ceremony. **********However, diplomats and peacekeepers made known in recent days that the People's Revolutionary Army did not take part in the fourth phase and wanted to delay full demobilization for a couple of months. **********Since most of those demobilized in the earlier stages were support personnel and part-time fighters, the heart of the group's fighting force remains intact at various points around the country. **********The group's leaders said that since the cease-fire began, their rank and file members had not had contact with aid officials from the United States and the Salvadoran Government, and that this had contributed to the unrest, Mr. Romero said. **********By contrast, he said, other guerrilla factions had allowed aid workers easy access to discuss benefits available to fighters for demobilizing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/10/business/microsoft-nails-some-pirates.html": {"writer_name": "Harriet King", "pub_date": "1992-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1280, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Microsoft Nails Some Pirates", "print_headline": "Microsoft Nails Some Pirates", "body_text": " **********When the Microsoft Corporation unveiled its updated MS-DOS 5 software operating system last June, it was confident that it had devised a way to thwart the loss of $1 billion a year from software piracy. Its packaging contains two one-of-a-kind holograms, one a circular image on the package box and the other a rectangular image pasted inside on the product manual, viewable through a window on the box. The multidimensional images bear the company's name or the MS-DOS logo and tell consumers that the product is the real McCoy. **********Microsoft pamphlets said the holograms are \"virtually impossible\" to reproduce and \"raise the counterfeiting barrier to a level previously unattempted in the software industry.\" Yet within two weeks of the introduction, a Taiwanese counterfeiter commissioned a holographer in China to copy and produce the holograms. Over the next half-dozen months, Microsoft's counterattack took it to Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong and Melbourne. The idea was to track down the counterfeiters, mostly without the aid of foreign governments. Ultimately, the company helped bust a major Asian couterfeiting ring that may have produced up to $150 million worth of the company's hottest products. **********But whether Microsoft can halt future clandestine activity there depends on talks this week with officials of the People's Republic of China. Beijing has not yet kept its promise to give the company valuable molds seized in the March raids that produce nearly exact fakes. **********Alison Gilligan, one of Microsoft's antipiracy specialists, notes, \"We're scared the molds will disappear out the back door and be sold to the highest bidder.\" **********In the meantime, the company is trying to get the fakes off the market, an endeavor made difficult \"because we still don't know the extent of what is out there,\" said David Curtis, head of international law and corporate affairs at Microsoft. So far, goods have been seized in the United States, Germany, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and enroute to Venezuela. The company is attempting to get a search warrant to seize goods in Melbourne shipped from Taiwan. **********The software industry loses up to $14 billion a year to piracy, including illegal copying by dealers, corporations and individual users. Fakes are so common in Taiwan that Microsoft estimates that only 20 percent of the software used there is legally obtained. About 90 percent of all counterfeiting worldwide comes from Taiwan. **********Illegal competition for DOS projects is keen because nearly 80 percent of all personal computers worldwide are DOS based. Ms. Gilligan said Microsoft commands \"a big chunk\" of this market. **********In this case, Microsoft caught wind of the operation last October when a salesman calling on a software store client in Taipai, Taiwan, saw an MS-DOS package that didn't look right.  The salesman purchased a copy and sent it to Alix Parlour, the company's piracy attorney based in Hong Kong, who in turn forwarded it to Microsoft's headquarters here. Said Ms. Gilligan, \"we were in shock. No one could believe it happened.\" **********Ms. Parlour set up a corporate espionage team, using private eyes from the countries involved.. She wanted to control the investigation, instead of turning it over to a foreign government that might not consider piracy a serious crime. Microsoft also wanted to compile a list of suspects -- job shops, distributors, importers, exporters and buyers. It then would have evidence to pursue in civil suits in each country if local authorites refused to prosecute. **********Investigators started checking out Taipei printers and binderies, asking if they had big orders or knew who did, hoping clues would lead to a \"kingpin.\" Work would likely be done through 15 to 25 shops. **********A break came when trash found behind a bindery contained clipped-off edges of Microsoft manuals. An investigator watching the shop noticed Microsoft materials visible on the seat of a white van parked nearby. He followed the van as it visited several other contractors and discovered that it was registered to the brother of another suspect. **********The assembly plant was identified because all the contractors were delivering goods there. An investigator concealed himself outside the plant and by watching which visitors were treated with the greatest respect, soon identified the ringleaders. **********By January, Ms. Parlour had enough information to ask government trademark police to raid five locations. A prosecutor issued search warrants for three sites and the raids yielded 5,000 packages of products, thousands of holograms, 20,000 manuals and 13,000 diskettes, all fakes.  Documents gave the names of players and indicated 75,000 to 100,000 products, including MS-DOS 5 and the Windows operating system, had been shipped monthly since October. **********The fakes were produced in five languages -- English, French, German, Italian and Swedish. Microsoft had thought the copies were limited to English. **********One of the storage sites was the home of the 80-year-old mother of a suspect. Investigators said she was was unaware that the boxes stacked ceiling-high in her house contained illegal goods. **********But the prosecutor refused a warrant for the residence of the ringleader, saying he saw no grounds. Ms. Parlour said that after the raids, \"our surveillance team watched helplessly outside the leader's home as he removed records and cartons containing an estimated 10,000 to 12,000 products worth $750,000.\" **********The man remains outside of Microsoft's grasp although the company has sued Fong Shu Gwong, who they say is the No. 2 man. Said Ms. Gilligan, \"we believe he may serve as the fall guy and in return, his family will be well taken care of during his possible incarceration.\" **********To Ms. Parlour's frustration, the raids did not uncover the source of the holograms. For a while, the team was sidetracked to Japan but the path eventually led to a broker in Hong Kong. When Hong Kong investigators posed as businessmen attempting to buy Microsoft holograms, the broker said, \"I think I know someone who can help you,\" and introduced them to the Shenzhen Reflective Materials Institute in China's most capitalistic, free-market province, Guangdong. **********The institute, just 10 miles from the Hong Kong border, legitimately produces holograms for Chinese documents. It is affiliated with the Government-owned Shenzhen University. **********In March, simultaneous raids at the Shenzhen Institute and the broker's office resulted in the seizure of the hologram molds, 10,000 holograms and documents showing filled orders for 450,000 fake holograms. An additional contract showed a standing order for 3 million more, a loss of $150 million to Microsoft if all have been produced and placed on illicit packages that may have been distributed worldwide. **********Mr. Curtis of Microsoft said the company is pleased \"that we were able to conduct a raid in the P.R.C. with the cooperation of local authorities, with the grounds based on trademark violations.\" As he pointed out, \"We've been talking about this for a long time.\" **********In her May 18 meeting with officials from the People's Republic, the Shenzhen Institute and the Shenzhen Administration of Industry, Ms. Parlour will attempt to negotiate release of the hologram molds or their destruction. She'll have representatives from the Commerce Department with her. **********This spring, China agreed to strengthen its copyright laws rather than face United States trade sanctions. In late April, Carla Hill, the United States Trade Representative, identified Taiwan, India and Thailand under the special 301 provisions of the Trade Act of 1974. **********The 301 provisions call for identifying trading partners that deny adequate and effective protection for intellectual property. The Government can take action if disputes are not resolved. China is one of 22 countries that have been placed on a special \"priority watch\" list. **********Ms. Parlour will be trying to bring those provisions to bear."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/30/business/company-news-floppy-disk-domesticity-betty-crocker-in-megabytes.html": {"writer_name": "Adam Bryant", "pub_date": "1992-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 368, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS: Floppy-Disk Domesticity; Betty Crocker In Megabytes", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS: Floppy-Disk Domesticity; Betty Crocker In Megabytes", "body_text": " **********Cooks take note.

Strong Attack on A.N.C. **********Even before the negotiations deadlocked in May, he charged, the militants had planned to \"sabotage\" the talks and \"to follow their own agenda toward the seizure of power.\" **********\"Instead of bringing about the new South Africa through talks and agreement, they want to force their views on the rest of our society through confrontation and mass mobilization,\" Mr. de Klerk said. **********\"The ultimate goal of the A.N.C.'s mass mobilization campaign, to overthrow the Government by coercion, will not be countenanced.\" **********Mr. de Klerk said the mounting toll of township deaths should be blamed in large part on the congress for having failed to curb the fratricidal wars that have cost thousands of black lives.  A Lack of Specifics **********Much of the angry language appeared to be directed toward the international audience whose favor both sides have fought to win. In effect, Mr. de Klerk was serving notice that if Mr. Mandela did not accept his invitation to resume negotiations, the Government would seek to brand him a tool of radicals. **********Mr. de Klerk did not propose specific concessions to Mr. Mandela's other conditions for resumption of talks, which include new controls on the police, abolishing the hostels where the Inkatha flourishes and more aggressive prosecution of those accused of violence. All of those, the President said, were open to discussion. **********But the overriding issue for both sides is how, and how quickly, to move toward a constitution enfranchising the country's non-whites. **********The Government's earlier insistence that the constitution be ratified by 75 percent of the vote was a result of careful calculations. Whites make up about 18 percent of the voting-age population. With support from Asian and mixed-race voters wary of the black majority, the Government reckoned, it could muster 25 percent to block provisions threatening minority interests. It was not so sure about 30 percent. **********Another concession buried in Mr. de Klerk's letter suggests that if the elected assembly is stymied over a new constitution for three years, the impasse should be thrown to voters. Before, the Government was unwilling to agree to any such deadline; Mr. Mandela said that was a recipe for permanent obstruction by the white minority."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/06/world/economic-watch-how-welcome-mat-aids-israel.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Passell", "pub_date": "1992-02-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1525, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Watch; How Welcome Mat Aids Israel", "print_headline": "Economic Watch; How Welcome Mat Aids Israel", "body_text": " **********Can Israel afford to welcome the million Soviet immigrants expected over five years? Many Israeli economists and business leaders think the questioners have it backwards. Weighed in purely economic terms, they insist, Israel cannot afford to let them go elsewhere. **********The immigrants, they argue, are an asset as well as a liability -- a remarkable pool of talent whose arrival is neatly timed to turbocharge Israel's drive to join the world's technological elite. And even the liability could prove an advantage if the imperative to absorb workers rapidly and to raise capital abroad forces an end to the paternalist economic policies that have impeded rapid growth. **********\"Immigration,\" said Michael Bruno, a former governor of the Bank of Israel, \"is why economic reforms must speed up -- and why they will speed up.\" A Heavy Influx **********It is hardly surprising that the arrival of some 380,000 immigrants in the last two years and the expected arrival of 600,000 in the next three is viewed with alarm by many Israelis. **********Unemployment is already above 11 percent in a nation that has been ideologically committed to providing work for every willing Jewish hand. And it is expected to crest at 13 percent before it recedes in the mid-1990's. **********Some of the increase is apparently inevitable, as unparalleled numbers are shoehorned into the work force. But some of it is the consequence of a system that gives the Government and organized labor enormous authority to influence who is employed and on what terms. **********For example, sets the minimum wage at 45 percent of the national average -- high enough, some economists believe, to price some immigrants out of service jobs. \"Labor markets are becoming more flexible,\" concludes Mr. Bruno, \"but very slowly.\" **********To finance the absorption without sharply reducing military spending or living standards, both the Government and business must raise capital abroad. The Bank of Israel projects that the gap between exports and civilian imports, a bit less than $4 billion in 1990, will exceed $9 billion in 1994. As a result, the net debt to foreigners, now about $18 billion, will rise to $40 billion before leveling off in 1995. **********By tests applied to developing countries, these are not worrisome figures. Even with relatively conservative economic growth, the foreign debt would never exceed 140 percent of Israel's hard-currency export earnings -- less than the debt burden of Venezuela or Turkey today. And by the Bank of Israel's calculation, this burden should lighten to the current 90 percent level by the year 2000. **********But as critical as the financing issues have become, many Israeli experts still see the mass immigration as an opportunity to lift the heavy hand of Government regulation and transform the Israeli economy into a pocket-sized high-tech powerhouse. **********\"There are really two Israeli economies,\" argues Pinchas Landau, an analyst for the Israel Business Report. On the one hand, there are dozens of nimble export-oriented businesses that succeed by clever marketing and rapid innovation -- companies like Scitex, a leader in computerized optical-recognition equipment, and Iscar, a precision tool maker. **********On the other, there is a traditional economy with strong ties to Israel's Zionist heritage -- an economy born and nurtured at the hands of utopian farm cooperatives and a labor movement that remained true to the principles of 19th-century European social democracy. **********This economy has long depended for survival on subsidies, cartel arrangements, protection from imports and government-guaranteed access to capital. And it reaches deep into everyday life in Israel. Until this month, for example, it was illegal to open a pharmacy within 500 meters of a competitor. **********This traditional Zionist economy has been on the defensive since the early 1980's, when the enfeebled economy bent under the accumulated weight of special-interest demands and the Government allowed inflation to reach 300 percent. **********In 1985, a carefully planned program built around temporary price controls, budget discipline and an extra shot of American aid succeeded in bringing the inflation rate back to 20 percent. But Howard Rosen, a Middle East specialist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, notes that \"it has been easier to stabilize the economy than reform it.\" **********By almost everyone's reckoning, the current Government deserves credit for trying. Commercial bank loans are no longer passed out according to Government dictate. Food subsidies for consumers have been eliminated. Financially embarrassed kibbutzes and union-owned businesses have been denied new loans to pay off their old ones. Inefficient farmers have been hit with the one-two punch of more realistically priced water and an end to Government-sanctioned cartels. **********Free-trade agreements with America and the European Community have opened many local markets to international competition. Fixed import quotas, special labeling requirements and other \"nonmarket barriers\" to imports from the Asian industrial giants have been converted to tariffs, which will gradually be eliminated over five to seven years. **********Regulations against raising capital or investing abroad have been liberalized. A clever new exchange rate policy balances the objectives of keeping Israeli exports competitive in world markets and of trying to hold the line on inflation driven by rising import costs. And a budget has been drawn up to cover three years rather than one, demonstrating the current Government's determination to eliminate the budget deficit after the Soviet immigrants have been absorbed.  Thinking for the Long Term **********The Government, says Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the Bank of Israel, is irrevocably committed to lightening the burden on private enterprise. And this consistent policy, he argues, will give businesses what they need most: a chance to \"lengthen their planning horizons.\" **********Some $5 billion worth of Government-owned enterprises have been put up for sale. Bankruptcy, even for the venerable political patronage machines run by Histadrut, the labor federation, is now a real threat. The clear message to ailing companies, says Amos Rubin, is \"you'll have to survive on your own, full stop.\" **********But thus far, there has not been much payoff for a skeptical public. The big cuts in import protection will come gradually -- and only if the Government has the stomach to follow its timetable. Privatization plans are lagging; only $500 million worth of public companies have been sold. And while the average tax burden is no higher than in many European countries, taxes still take half of the last shekel earned by middle-income Israelis. **********Unemployment among non-immigrants hovers around 9 percent. And the spurt in growth to 7 percent in 1991 was almost entirely driven by Government investment in housing -- an ominous example for an economy trying to kick the big-government habit. **********Alvin Rabushka, an economist at the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies in Jerusalem, doubts that the promised pace of change can be sustained. With average incomes about two-thirds the level of those in northern Europe, he concludes \"there isn't a basis for an economic revolution.\" **********But others think the Soviet immigrants and the need to raise foreign capital could create that basis. Before the collapse of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's nationalist coalition, the Bush Administration was quietly talking about tying loan guarantees to continuing progress on budget discipline and free-market reforms. Even if the West Bank issue is resolved to Washington's satisfaction, the Israeli Government is likely to use the widely felt Israeli wish to reduce dependence on American largess as a lever for restraining public spending. **********High unemployment is also expected to weaken union resistance to the revamping of money-losing businesses. Indeed, the Government's economic forecast assumes that wages will fall for two more years, putting downward pressure on inflation and allowing private owners to keep the full fruit of productivity gains. But most important, suggests Leora Meridor, a research economist at the Bank of Israel, the skills of the immigrants could transform the Israeli economy in ways that would make it a far more effective global competitor. A Pool of Talent **********Judging by surveys of 1990 arrivals, the immigrants will greatly enrich Israel's stock of \"human capital.\" While there are obviously some mismatches -- there is no way to use the talents of 30,000 more physicians in a country of six million people -- most immigrants have marketable skills. Almost a quarter are scientists and engineers, and another 15 percent are technicians. **********Israel cannot compete on wages with Singapore or Turkey, notes Bernard Avishai, a visiting professor at Adelphi University on Long Island. But it does have brain power, along with a flexible, informal culture that excels in small-group cooperation and seems uniquely suited to transforming science into practical technology. **********That has already made Israel ripe for growth in areas where manufacturing costs are an afterthought to design -- a description, by no coincidence, that fits the handful of foreign high-technology companies, including Motorola and Intel, that are manufacturing in Israel for world markets. And the Soviet immigrants could turn this edge into a compelling advantage. **********\"We will finally have something the world is looking for,\" said Amos Rubin, the former economic adviser to the Prime Minister."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/14/world/lebanese-leader-names-new-prime-minister.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1992-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 428, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lebanese Leader Names New Prime Minister", "print_headline": "Lebanese Leader Names New Prime Minister", "body_text": " **********President Elias Hrawi announced the appointment of a new Prime Minister today, one week after riots forced the previous Government to resign. **********Mr. Hrawi named Rashid Solh, a 66-year-old lawyer and Member of Parliament who was Prime Minister at the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war 17 years ago, to form a new Government after consultations with lawmakers over the last two days. **********A few hours before the announcement, Israeli Air Force jets attacked targets in southern Lebanon, razing a schoolhouse that Israel said was a command post for the Party of God, a Muslim fundamentalist group.

Both subs are capable of carrying nuclear weapons, but neither side would say whether any were aboard at the time, even though indications were that the American sub, at least, was not nuclear-armed. **********The Pentagon dismissed complaints from Moscow that the American submarine, the Baton Rouge, had been in restricted waters. The Navy said that the accident took place more than 12 miles from shore, and hence in international waters, and that the United States did not recognize restrictions beyond the 12-mile mark. Undisclosed Collisions **********Similar collisions between submarines have occurred in the past, the Pentagon said, but they have not been discussed openly. Despite the hair-raising dangers of operating submarines in close quarters and in stealth, for decades those have been the classic tactics of both navies, especially when one is operating near the other's shores. **********Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, discussed the incident on Monday in Moscow, and it is unlikely to disturb relations between the United States and Russia, which today announced plans for military cooperation to warn of ballistic missile attacks. **********But despite improved relations, the affair shows that there is still an undercurrent of tension between the United States and the military of the former Soviet Union, at least when it comes to the cat-and-mouse games of undersea naval and intelligence-gathering operations. Proximity to Russian Shore **********The Navy refused to say what the American submarine, a Los Angeles-class torpedo vessel, was doing so close to the Kola Peninsula on Feb. 11, when the collision occurred. **********There is little if any tactical reason these days for American submarines to operate so close to Russian shores, but there could be intelligence objectives in such a mission. For example, the United States might be seeking to improve its knowledge of operations of the former Soviet navy, whose chain of command and possible division is still being negotiated among the former Soviet republics making up the new Commonwealth of Independent States. **********Another possibility is that the American submarine, which the Navy said was sitting at \"periscope depth,\" may have been using secret interception equipment to monitor communications at nearby military bases. **********In peacetime, gathering intelligence has been an important job of the attack submarines, which in wartime would be used to hem in and destroy enemy ships and submarines. Few Details on Collision **********The Navy said that the American submarine was struck from below by the surfacing Russian submarine, which then headed back to port. The Navy would not provide further details of the collision, such as whether it was a sideswipe or a head-on, or even whether either submarine's crew knew of the other's location. Without such details, it is impossible to say whose fault the accident was. **********The American vessel, which reported no damage, is now on its way back to home port in Norfolk, Va. It has a crew of 142. **********When the Russian news agency Itar-Tass first reported a submarine's \"collision with an unknown underwater object\" last Thursday, it said the fleet reported slight damage to the conning tower, which protrudes upward from the deck of the boat. **********\"The nuclear power plant and other equipment of the submarine are in good repair,\" Itar-Tass said. **********American officials said that the boat that collided with the American sub was a Sierra-class attack submarine of a type built since the 1980's. Comparable to the Los Angeles class in weapons and mission, but noisier and easier to detect, it can carry nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. But it is not known how it was armed at the time of the collision. **********Washington and Moscow agreed several months ago to remove nuclear-tipped cruise missiles from their naval vessels, and the United States Navy has been taking them off its ships while they are in port. The Baton Rouge was in port at Norfolk in January, and thus it most likely was not carrying nuclear weapons at the time of the accident. The Navy continues for the time being to neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons on its ships. **********Neither side seemed inclined to make a cause celebre of the accident. **********The main point in dispute is whether the American submarine was operating in forbidden waters. **********The Navy would say only that the incident occurred more than 12 miles from shore, and hence in international waters; statements carried by Russian news agencies suggested that although the spot was 14 miles at sea, it was in waters that the Soviet Union considers restricted. **********Interfax, a Moscow news agency, reported today that officials of the former Soviet navy would protest to Washington about the American submarine's presence."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/16/business/the-executive-life-the-firststocksale-dog-and-pony-show.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Lyne", "pub_date": "1992-08-16", "snippet": "For some, it's exhilarating; for others, only grueling and tedious.

No matter how articulate the C.E.O. or how attractive the company, an ornery market can poleax the whole thing. **********\"You do the best you can, but outside forces really do control your destiny,\" says Aileen Gorman, vice president of public affairs for Bradlees Inc., the department store company that just raised $143 million in its initial public offering.

It was a huge emotional letdown,\" he recalls. \"And the same thing had happened to us in 1986.\" This winter, he said, \"I actually had a friend call and say 'Now that you're starting your road show, I'm selling all my stock.' You begin to wonder if you're a jinx. This time, thank God, the market was pretty stable.\" **********Donald L.

So these people we were supposed to see folded up and went home.\" No riots materialized in New York, and the company raised $219.8 million. **********Timing is everything. Samuel D.

The market held, but it was a horrible moment.\" **********The market is basically the only uncontrollable factor in a show scripted better than some of the finest Hollywood films. If the C.E.O.'s are the performers, the investment banker underwriters are the producer/directors. They write the speeches, set up the shows, decide on the sets (not too large a room or it won't look crowded) and produce the audience. **********\"There is very little ad libbing,\" said Stephen Chazen, managing director of Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith Inc. and a road-show veteran. \"Before the trip actually begins we have them come before our institutional sales force, a pretty hardened group who will ask them all the embarrassing questions they might hear: how come they're paid so much, why are they selling the stock. Some C.E.O.'s hate it because they've gotten used to being treated like C.E.O.'s.\" **********For the most part, Mr. Chazen says, he tries to strike a balance with a 30-minute presentation that is more \"modern\" than glitzy. If it tips too far into glitz, \"investors start thinking the company is wasting all its money on A.V.,\" he said. The real objective, he tells C.E.O.'s, is to appear approachable. **********That kind of pressure makes itself felt. Dr.  Waksal, of Imclone, says he felt completely comfortable speaking extemporaneously about his company, despite suggestions that he prepare a set speech. **********\"I had been speaking in front of medical schools with no script for years and felt comfortable winging it,\" he said. \"I never get nervous. But guess what? I became panic stricken. It was suddenly, 'My God, this is really important, I'm raising $35 milllion. Maybe they're right.' \" **********When he finally made his first presentation before a group from Smith Barney, Harris Upham, his lead underwriter, he began with a joke he thought perfect: \"I hope it's not too glib to say we make our products the old-fashioned way -- we clone them.\" No one, he said, laughed. \"I couldn't believe it. I thought, 'My God, I'm bombing out at Smith Barney. What's going to happen in Europe?' \" **********It wasn't until he got to Paris that he regained his confidence on a suggestion from his brother Harlan, Imclone's chief operating officer. \"It was like that scene in 'Blazing Saddles' when Gene Wilder is trying to shoot and keeps missing. Finally, he asks if he can move and he hits everything. Harlan finally said to me, 'You can't talk standing still, get out from behind the podium.' From then on it was great.\" **********But did they ever laugh at his Smith Barney joke? Persistence paid off in New York, where it may have helped that his final audience was filled not only with investors but also friends and relatives. \"I tried it again,\" he said. \"They finally got it.

They had lifted a fingerprint from a stolen truck abandoned after the slaying but found no duplicate in a central fingerprint-matching computer. The partial print went into an unsolved-crimes data base. **********A month later in Lynwood, 10 miles south of downtown, sheriff's officers arrested a man attempting to \"hot wire\" a truck. In booking the suspect, the jailer used a pilot electronic fingerprinting system called live-scan instead of the old ink-and-roll method. **********After sending the prints over telephone lines and into their fingerprint data base, deputy sheriffs had a match within minutes with the latent print taken in Pico Rivera. **********The live-scan units being tested in Los Angeles County are seen as the future for fingerprinting. Ultimately, the system promises to speed up the process of booking suspects and checking records and even to give police officers a nearly foolproof way to check aliases from the street. \"It's a tremendous crime-solving tool,\" said Lieut. Bernie Kammer, who manages Los Angeles County's identification system. **********In fact, Los Angeles law enforcers, who arrest 40,000 suspects a month, intend to buy about 100 units, enough for every booking site in the county. The estimated $15 million contract, to be awarded in January, will create the industry's largest network. **********Automated fingerprint technology has been in development for years. But an industry began to emerge only when the Federal Bureau of Investigation committed itself in 1990 to convert its 40 million fingerprint cards and 24 million crime history records into paperless computer files by the end of the decade. To do so means police must be able to submit inquiries electronically. **********\"We think there will be a revolution in fingerprinting,\" said David F. Nemecek, a top deputy for the F.B.I.'s information services division. In the forefront of the revolution are three companies that make live-scan machines. Last year, the F.B.I. tested all three technologies and ultimately approved them. Since then, about 100 local police agencies have installed live-scan machines; the biggest systems are Chicago's, with 34, and Philadelphia's 11. **********There are two principal pieces of technology for automating fingerprints: an electronic reader or live-scan machine, costing up to $60,000 each, and a \"matching\" computer, which compares new fingerprints with prints on file. Matching computers, which can cost up to $30 million each, are already installed in 36 states and process fingerprint cards that are scanned into the system. When live-scan machines are in use, this process will be greatly speeded up. **********But being able to scan fingerprints into a computer is only part of the process of matching prints. Human technicians classify each print by subgroups based on the century-old Henry system of whorls, arches and loops. Then the computer digitizes an image by creating a map of the unique ridge patterns, which are called minutiae points. **********The computer translates 90 or more minutiae points per finger into a binary code. Then, the computer attempts to make a match of minutiae points by following a set of instructions called a searching algorithm. **********The computer is not actually comparing fingerprint images; it is trying to find a group of prints with similar binary minutiae codes. A technician makes the final match from a candidate list. It is possible to make a match with as few as eight minutiae points. **********In live-scan electronic fingerprinting, a suspect's finger is placed on a glass plate and its image captured with a video scanner at a precise oblique angle. Light that is completely absorbed is seen as black, and light that is completely refracted is seen as white. To the video scanner, finger ridges turn black and valleys white. **********As the finger is rolled across the plate, the computer builds an image over time, and the image is digitized by its light value into binary code and entered into the memory. **********The emerging business of producing live-scan machines could explode to $750 million in sales in five years from present sales of under $20 million, said Carol M. Clark, research director for John G. Kinnard & Company in Minneapolis. Besides the nation's 16,000 law enforcement agencies, potential buyers include companies that fingerprint their employees as well as the military and the Internal Revenue Service. **********Digital Biometrics Inc., based in Minnetonka, Minn., and Identix Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., use similar video optics devices to capture the fingerprint image. Fingermatrix Inc. of White Plains, N.Y., uses a different optical device and a U-shaped platen. Its sensor moves around the platen. **********There are other slight differences in the competitors' machines. Digital Biometrics's system has live video feedback so the booking officer can see the finger on a monitor as it is rolled. Identix and Fingermatrix machines replay the captured image a second later, although Identix ultimately expects to provide real-time displays. **********As a booking officer takes prints, they are captured into a single computer file, which also includes biographical information, and are then stored on the computer's hard disk. The file can then be reproduced on an F.B.I. \"tenprint\" card or sent electronically by a high-speed modem to a printer at a state or Federal crime computer. **********\"Ultimately, police want to never print it out but keep it in digital form,\" said Daniel F. Maase, Identix's engineering vice president. So far that is not possible because no one has created a computer that can automatically classify prints into Henry subgroups. The Orincon Corporation in San Diego is working on that puzzle with neural networks. **********Depending on the live-scan equipment used, a single fingerprint file can amount to 1.5 million to 2.5 million bits of information. Live-scan machines can send files six times faster than the standard electronic transmission speed, but even so, transmission can take up to 14 minutes per card. Prospective live-scan vendors to Los Angeles County will have to evaluate and propose the best transmission scheme for their systems. **********Live-scan prints should markedly improve law enforcement's weakest link. The F.B.I. rejects 18 percent of the ink-and-roll cards sent by local agencies. More than half of the eight million fingerprints in California's matching computer are of poor quality. It is easy to see why. Suspects get impatient as jailers collect three sets of originals for local, state and Federal files. Typically, the F.B.I. gets the worst of the three. **********The next step for live-scan manufacturers is making a single-finger mobile scanner for use in patrol cars. Officers could then identify a fugitive by transmitting a suspect's print to the F.B.I.'s computers from the street. **********Prototypes have already been shown. \"It's not a dream,\" Mr. Nemecek said. \"We found the technology was available, and we obtained the kind of accuracy we wanted.\" **********Bids are under review, he said. An award is to be made in December, and mobile scanners, along with small printers, are to be installed in some F.B.I. cars next year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/05/world/cairo-dish-best-eaten-on-street-is-a-big-hit.html": {"writer_name": "Chris Hedges", "pub_date": "1992-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 737, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cairo Dish (Best Eaten on Street) Is a Big Hit", "print_headline": "Cairo Dish (Best Eaten on Street) Is a Big Hit", "body_text": " **********Perched behind a green wooden donkey cart, Hanafi Mohammed al-Gahsh nightly transforms a tiny patch of Cairo into a kingdom. **********With his imagination, sidewalks become rolling shorelines and the gritty pot-holed street the sea. With his hands he dishes out bowls of ful, a traditional bean dish. And with his presence he fills his dozen tables, cascading out into the street, with the rich and the poor. **********For three decades the vendor has cooked and sold his beans in the working-class neighborhood of Sayada Zenab. He began by roaming the back streets all night with a donkey cart, which he still keeps in front of his tiny restaurant, to keep bus and truck drivers fed. He has had a series of marriages -- he is now on No. 6 -- has fathered eight children and has spent what little money he made. **********\"I once tried to take Fridays off,\" he said, \"but I live on the money I earn the night before and have no savings, so I had to go back to working every day.\" **********The illiterate vendor has become something of a folk hero to artists and young Egyptians, evoking a way of life rapidly being shunted aside by modernity and raising the lowly ful (pronounced fool) to culinary heights. **********When the theaters close in Cairo, well after midnight, actors and musicians jostle for a place at the tables with laborers, students and the occasional well-heeled couple who have momentarily escaped the city's nightly social circuit. And when the tables are full, waiters move further afield and set the dishes on the hoods of cars parked in the street. **********\"It is a fad now to go to a poor neighborhood and eat traditional food,\" Lobna Sabry, a reporter, said. \"A few years ago middle-class kids would save money to go to a chic restaurant and imitate the upper class. Now it's the other way around. Everyone, and especially the rich, find sitting out on the street and eating ful exotic.\" **********Ful is made from a common flat bean similar to kidney beans. The beans, a staple of the Egyptian diet, are usually boiled all night and eaten for breakfast with oil, lemon, red pepper, onions, tomatoes, garlic and butter. It makes an appearance on the lunch or supper tables only of the very poor. **********\"The rich eat ful for breakfast,\" goes an Egyptian proverb, \"the poor eat ful for lunch, and animals eat ful for dinner.\" **********But it is only dinner that Mr. Gahsh serves, opening his tiny shop in the afternoon and closing at dawn. He sleeps during the day in a small cramped apartment two blocks from his restaurant. **********His recipe, which is secret, calls for a generous mix of lentils, cumin and nutmeg, considered an aphrodisiac in folk tradition here. \"I used to throw it in by the handful,\" he said, \"but a holy man said I must measure it out.\" **********Mr. Gahsh boils three kinds of beans for seven hours in a traditional long-stemmed \"idra\" pot before mixing in his spices. He charges about 50 cents a plate, expensive by the standards of Egyptian poor. **********At dusk one evening he stood behind his cart on the corner of Marasina and Adri Streets. His aluminum pots were spread out in a row in front of him. The idra pot, filled with ful, simmered over a low flame at his left. **********Mr. Gahsh, who says he is 53 years old but who neighbors say is at least a decade older, deftly dipped and stirred the soft brown beans, spices and oils into white-enameled tin bowls. **********Four of his sons, who work as waiters and cooks, covered tables with sheets of newspaper and handed out large soup spoons, along with bread, pickled vegetables and eggplant. **********When not dishing out ful, Mr. Gahsh chats and jokes with customers, many of whom he has known for several years, and guides them to tables. There are a few tables inside his small establishment, which has a neon sign with the head of a donkey on it.

Forty minutes after Mr. Bush fainted because of what the White House described as a stomach flu, NHK beamed footage around the world of an ashen-faced Mr. Bush being lifted to his feet and then walking out of the dinner. **********The video was taken by an unmanned camera belonging to NHK that was supposed to tape the speeches and the toasts -- but nothing else -- and share them on a pool basis. According to accounts provided by NHK, a technician turned on a video recorder when, from a monitor in a different room, he saw the chaos that ensued after the President slumped over. **********The Japanese were deeply embarrassed by the distribution of the tape, especially since it was recorded by NHK, a public-broadcasting giant. A number of Government officials have asserted that the tape was an invasion of privacy that should not have been allowed. Punishment Expected **********\"It was a violation of an agreement,\" said Taizo Watanabe, the chief spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry. **********Mr. Watanabe said that the Government was \"making representations\" against NHK to the \"press club\" within the Prime Minister's residence. Under the Japanese journalistic system, virtually all domestic coverage of the Prime Minister is conducted through the club, whose members include reporters from all of the major Japanese newspapers and television networks. **********Implicit in the request is an understanding that if no action is taken against NHK, the Prime Minister's staff might limit the club's coverage of future dinners like the one attended by Mr. Bush. **********This morning The Washington Post reported that it had seen a videotape of the dinner that included a vital segment never broadcast in Japan or elsewhere: Mr. Bush slumping over at his seat, apparently losing consciousness, and vomiting into the lap of Mr. Miyazawa. The tape was broadcast in the United States by ABC on Saturday evening. ABC has a close relationship with NHK, and the two frequently share footage. **********On Saturday NHK vociferously denied that it had recorded the President falling ill, or that it edited out the most graphic footage. **********\"What we have recorded was only after he collapsed,\" said Yoshikuni Ono, director general for public relations for NHK. \"We aired the first scene that our videotape recorded. There was no editing at all.\" But this morning, an NHK spokesman amended that version of events, saying that the Japanese had just been notified by ABC that it had possession of the full tape. **********\"There is a possibility that NHK's line was open to ABC Tokyo\" on the night of the dinner, the spokesman said. It was not clear why the full tape had not been broadcast earlier. The full tape has not yet been broadcast in Japan. **********Although Mr. Bush collapsed about 8:20 P.M. in Tokyo, or 6:20 on Wednesday morning in New York, the original recording was not released until 40 minutes later, at the time that an \"embargo\" on film of the speeches was scheduled to be lifted. The tape was sent out by satellite, and it was seen simulatenously in the United States and elsewhere in the world. **********NHK has said that though it broke the rules by sending out the original footage, the \"very high news value of the emergency\" justified the violation of the rules. **********But if recent history is any guide, the Government is likely to extract some punishment. In 1989, Japan's Imperial Household Agency, which directs the lives of the royal family, dismissed an official photographer who took a candid shot of the Emperor's son, Prince Akishino, and his wife on their wedding day. **********In the picture Princess Kiko is shown brushing the prince's hair with her fingers before the taking of a formal portrait. It was one of the few informal moments of the day, but the Household Agency said that it, and it alone, determines what official images of Japan's royalty are made public. Trip to Disputed Islands **********Earlier this year Japan's Foreign Ministry took action against Tokyo Broadcasting System, one of Japan's private networks, for sending reporters to the \"northern territories,\" the islands seized by the Soviet Union from Japan in the closing days of World War II. **********Japan has been pressing for the islands' return, and it has prohibited its citizens from obtaining visas to visit the islands because that would acknowledge that they were under another nation's control. TBS ignored the ban and got the visas.

While this was presented as a major objective, it was also clear that the goods being acquired were extremely valuable and were being offered at bargain prices. **********Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d yesterday delivered to the President his proposal for an omnibus bill that would put together all of the Administration's ideas for supporting free-market reforms in the Commonwealth of Independent States.  Bush Weighing Proposal **********Mr. Bush is now considering the proposal, and Mr. Baker is consulting with Congressional leaders on how best to get it approved at a time when foreign aid is unpopular. **********The high-technology action comes after rising criticism of East-West trade barriers and charges of Administration foot dragging on aid to Russia, including pointed statements by such prominent cold warriors as Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. **********The announcement today represented the cheapest and least politically painful part of the overall aid package. It left the Administration still facing the most difficult decisions, from the standpoint of both policy and politics, including how much to contribute to a proposed fund to stablize the ruble. Purchases for Study **********Under the action announced today, the Pentagon will purchase a Russian Topaz 2 nuclear reactor for space power and four Hall thrusters for moving objects in space. Both devices are to be studied on the ground. The reactor comes without nuclear fuel. Hall thrusters use electricity rather than chemical fuels for generating thrust. **********In addition, the Energy Department will buy plutonium-238 to build nuclear batteries for a new generation of deep-space probes. **********The Topaz 2 is about 12 feet long and generates about 6,000 watts of electricity, or slightly less than the amount used by a half-dozen kitchen toasters. That power is enough, however, to energize many types of spacecraft. **********Hall thrusters are tiny but powerful engines, the smallest ones being able to fit into the palm of a human hand. They have been used by the Russians to adjust the orbits of satellites already in space, and are too weak to be of any use in lofting spacecraft into orbit from the earth's surface. **********Such purchases were unthinkable a few years ago, and Western intelligence agencies at one time would have probably paid billions of dollars to get their hands on a Topaz 2, which is similar to ones used to power Soviet spy satellites. **********\"These transactions clearly signal our desire to normalize trade with the new states,\" Mr. Fitzwater said. **********On high-tech trade, private experts and some Federal officials have argued that the American acquisition of Moscow's best technologies could save Washington and industry many billions of dollars in development costs, ease Russia's economic woes, aid a fledgling democracy and discourage Russian scientists, engineers and technologists from taking jobs with third-world tyrants. Worry About Military Might **********Previously, the Administration had worried that high-technology sales could also help keep Moscow's military-industrial complex alive. As a result, it quietly blocked the American purchase of rocket engines, space reactors and other aerospace goods from the former Soviet Union in order to cripple the complex and reduce future threats to the United States. **********Today, White House officials said the move to buy a limited number of high technologies from Russia was meant to show political boldness during an election year, although opponents noted the modest action came only after considerable prodding by a chorus of prominent critics. **********It was not clear from today's announcement whether the end of the prohibition on purchases applied to all high-tech Russian goods or just select ones. However, Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman, said at a White House briefing that the United States was \"moving to eliminate restrictions that prevented normal trade during the cold war.\" 'Significantly Lower Cost' **********He said the purchase of the Topaz 2 reactor, for some $8 million, \"will give us access to new technology at a significantly lower cost than if we were to try to develop it ourselves.\" Private experts have estimated that such a program would cost several hundred million dollars. **********In recent months and years, virtually the entire Russian arsenal and space program has gone on the auction block, often at fire-sale prices. **********American experts have been particularly tantalized by high-technology items relating to rocketry and space, in which the Soviets often excelled. Many of these Russian items are not even made in the West. **********Mr. Fitzwater downplayed the idea of a fire-sale bonanza, instead characterizing the purchases as the opening of a new era in East-West relations. **********Steven Aftergood, a senior analyst with the Federation of American Scientists, a private group based in Washington, said the White House action was more important for what it symbolized than it did. **********\"It's the first opening in the exchange of high technology and hopefully a beginning of the normalization of relations,\" he said, adding that the Administration had apparently taken some two years to make up its mind about buying the Topaz 2. **********\"It's disturbing that it's taken this long for what should have been a simple transaction,\" he said. **********Like the Topaz, the American purchase of Soviet plutonium-238 had been under consideration for years, mainly by mid-level Federal officials. Discussions began in 1989 and were all but completed in 1991 when the deal came to an abrupt halt. For nearly a year, it has languished in bureaucratic limbo as the Administration considered a relaxation of cold war policies. **********Plutonium-238 is a man-made radioactive isotope that gives off heat that can be used to generate electricity. It is very different from its cousin, plutonium-239, which is used to make nuclear bombs. **********The Energy Department will use the plutonium-238 to make nuclear batteries for American deep-space probes, which travel to distant parts of the solar system where sunlight is too dim to excite solar-power panels. **********On the overall aid package, senior Administration officials said the proposal Mr. Baker delivered to Mr. Bush is based on the idea of getting one ominibus bill through Congress that would give the Administration authorization for all the programs it believes are necessary -- and affordable -- to assist Russia and other republics. **********The proposed bill includes $12 billion for replenishing the International Monetary Fund so it can put together a package that will cover the $17 billion gap between imports and exports in Russia this year. The $12 billion would not cost the Treasury anything since it is largely a bookkeeping arrangement with the I.M.F."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/20/business/briefs-125292.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 137, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt * Merrill Lynch & Co. priced $150 million in senior notes, due 1999, at 99.290 with a 7 3/4 percent coupon to yield 7.884 percent.

Although the number of volunteers is small, their commitment reflects a much larger public outpouring of support for the Bosnian Muslims that is placing increased pressure on Arab rulers to respond to the crisis. **********\"The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina has become the emotional equivalent of the fight against fascism in the Spanish Civil War,\" said Khaled al-Maeena, a newspaper editor. \"Those who died there are regarded as martyrs who tried to save their fellow Muslims.\" **********In Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Algeria, gruesome videocassettes depict the fighting and what its producers say are examples of Serbian atrocities. **********The videos, in addition to showing rows of mutilated corpses and wounded fighters and civilians, often include footage from World War II concentration camps to draw parallels between the past slaughter of Jews and the current slaughter of Muslims by European Christians. **********Arab newspapers and television stations increasingly focus on the conflict, and private Islamic charity groups have collected tens of millions of dollars for the Bosnians, as they once did for the Palestinians. **********Arab government officials, under pressure from the groundswell of support for the Bosnians, are trying to wrest the popular cause from the fundamentalists. **********The 47-member Islamic Conference Organization ended a two-day meeting in Jidda on Wednesday with a call for the lifting of a United Nations arms embargo so the Bosnian Muslims they can defend themselves. The embargo now applies to all sides of the conflict, though arms smuggling is said to be widespread. **********But months after the first reports of Serbs sweeping across Bosnia, wiping out villages and killing Muslim families, many Arabs are beginning to wonder why their governments delayed acting for so long. The militant clerics who accuse the region's rulers of indifference are starting to sting. **********\"The militant religious movement has set out to challenge the legitimacy of the Saudi ruling family and the other Arab governments,\" a prominent journalist said, \"and one of the best ways to do this is by pointing out how ineffectual they have been in helping the Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\" 400 Saudis in Fight **********There are an estimated 400 Saudi volunteers, many veterans of Afghanistan, along with Arabs from Egypt, Pakistan, the Sudan and Algeria fighting with the Muslim forces. They see in the fight a pure, good battle against the forces of darkness. **********\"I am ready to die if God wills it,\" said Riaz Qayyum, a Pakistani laborer who has worked in Saudi Arabia for 20 years and is scheduled to leave for Bosnia on Monday. \"When a Muslim sees these photos and reads about the slaughter of women, children and old people, how else can he react?\" **********Many of these volunteers come from comfortable middle- and upper-class homes. They fight for one or two months and then return to Saudi Arabia. **********More than two dozen Saudis have been killed in Bosnia. For those who die, the militant clerics have promised shahada, the direct ascent to heaven granted to anyone who falls defending the faith. **********In the last few weeks the pictures of young Saudi men killed by Serbian forces have appeared in local newspapers, although the names below the bearded fighters are usually their noms de guerre. In videos that circulate throughout the country, parents who lost sons often thank God for the sacrifice. **********The volunteers are sponsored by a variety of militant religious organizations and often have their expenses and plane fare covered. But it appears that few of the men get anything beyond what they need to survive. **********The Islamic institutions, especially those in Saudi Arabia, are well financed. Saudi officials say that the Government has donated $100 million to the Islamic institutions for Bosnia relief efforts and that private donations, which according to a new law must be funneled through the Government, have added $50 million. **********Despite formal denials from the relief organizations, Saudi officials say an increasing amount of the charity on behalf of the Bosnians is now used to provide arms and logistical support for Arab volunteers. **********\"Since August most of the money raised for relief has been turned over to the Bosnians for weapons,\" a Saudi official said. \"And most contributors probably support this.\" Firepower Is Improved **********Reports from the Balkans suggest that the Arab assistance has significantly improved the firepower of the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government forces, providing assault rifles, mortars, rockets and other weapons to troops who had been equipped largely with hunting rifles and shotguns at the beginning of the war. **********The Saudi-based Islamic Relief Organization, one of the largest charity organizations, funnels money, relief workers and supplies to Bosnia, although its officials strenuously deny that they provide any backing for the military effort. **********\"If a relief worker decides that he wants to join the fighting forces, we would not stop him,\" said Adel A. Batterjee, the chairman of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth. \"But he can no longer officially represent our organization.\" **********The authorities forbid any public acknowledgement that any Saudi citizens are involved directly in the Balkan conflict. But Government officials say men who volunteer for the relief work often end up as soldiers. **********The World Assembly of Muslim Youth, which organized relief operations in Afghanistan and is now deeply involved in the conflict in the Balkans, flies back wounded Saudi fighters and provides free medical care in the Saudi German hospital. **********On the second floor of the modern medical complex in a Jidda suburb several rooms hold wounded Saudi fighters, but bearded companions in the hallway and officials at the Islamic Organization, while confirming that the wounded combatants were in the hospital, refused to let an American reporter speak with them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/01/business/colgate-sells-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-09-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Colgate Sells Unit", "print_headline": "Colgate Sells Unit", "body_text": " **********The Colgate-Palmolive Company said yesterday that its Mennen Company subsidiary had sold its paper products business to a unit of the James River Corporation for an undisclosed amount.

But he denied he benefited the secret police, arguing the contacts were required as part of his role in representing the church and East Germans under its wing. Taking the Offensive **********The two cases are the latest in a series of startling assaults on members of the fledgling democratic leadership that emerged in eastern Germany after the collapse of communism for their alleged links with the old secret police. **********In many cases, resignations have come after the disclosure of confidential material by western news organizations, fueling resentment among eastern Germans that the home-grown political leadership is being intentionally compromised by materials obtained from dispersed Stasi files and purposely leaked in the west. **********Mr. Stolpe decided to take the offensive after it became clear that west German television stations were about to disclose information intended to damage him. Bavarian state television, which is closely allied with the governing Bavarian Christian Social Union, made public documents purportedly pointing to a collaboration between the 55-year old lawyer, who is a Social Democrat, and the Stasi. **********Many of the Stasi documents relating to prominent post-communist leaders like Mr. Stolpe disappeared from Stasi files in the waning last days of communism. In some cases, like Mr. Stolpe's, files were thinned in such a way as to render a defense more difficult. Colonization Asserted **********East German dissidents who were expelled from their country in 1988 after a wave of anti-Government protests found that all references in their files to Mr. Stolpe's role as church-authorized negotiator with the communists are gone. **********The gradual decimation of the post-communist leadership is reinforcing accusations among east Germans of a kind of colonialization by western Germany. The assertions gained force last week after the western German leadership overrode strenuous local objections and appointed Bernhard Vogel, a political crony of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and a westerner, to succeed Mr. Duchac in Thuringia. **********Unlike the case of Mr. Duchac, the accusations against Mr. Stolpe have brought forth firm defenders of his innocence, some appealing to historical precedents for justifying dealings with criminal regimes. **********Klaus von Dohnanyi, the former Social Democratic Mayor of Hamburg and the son of Hans von Dohnanyi, a former Nazi intelligence agent who was executed in 1945 for resistance to Hitler, compared Mr. Stolpe's behavior with that of Dietrich Bonhoffer, the younger Mr. Dohnanyi's uncle and a prominent theologian who used contacts with Nazi intelligence during the Third Reich to further efforts to eliminate Hitler. A Double Standard **********Such references to recent history help fuel the argument of those in east and west who increasingly accuse western Germans of applying a double standard in dealing with the east's communist past. They argue that the same West Germany that was soft on former Nazis after the war is now unswervingly pursuing communist collaborators for far less grievous offenses. **********That argument was raised last month, when a Berlin court convicted two former East German border guards of killing their own countrymen at the Berlin wall. The court argued that the guards had the duty to disobey the communist Government's orders when they shot and killed a man who was the last of about 200 East Germans killed trying to flee the country."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/25/business/executives-appointed-to-ibm-apple-venture.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 477, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executives Appointed To I.B.M.-Apple Venture", "print_headline": "Executives Appointed To I.B.M.-Apple Venture", "body_text": " **********The software joint venture between Apple Computer and I.B.M., outlined its senior management team and board members at a news conference here today. **********As expected, Joseph M.

No one thought about what they would eat or how they would live.\" **********The destruction of the shantytowns has left whole patches of Khartoum flattened. It has also eradicated much of the relief aid that outside agencies provided to the slum dwellers, like the $1 million spent last year by Unicef to install 500 water pumps. Most international relief agencies are banned from the three relocation sites and have been forbidden to help the half-million slum dwellers who remain in the capital. **********Government officials, who contend that criticism by Western embassies and relief agencies is motivated by hostility to Islam, assert that people moved to the three sites are better off in the open air. They contend that the four Islamic charities that work in the camps meet the people's basic needs. **********But the charities frequently exact a price for minimal relief aid.

But imposing the full panoply of American environmental requirements on the Mexicans is not the solution. In addition to raising questions of sovereignty, the \"shock therapy\" it would involve could threaten Mexico's economic development and may even violate international trade rules. There are better ways to address the environmental agenda in trade talks: *********** Address only the environmental concerns that pertain to manufacturing. Many environmental laws can affect the cost of doing business, but in trade talks, only those that directly cause higher manufacturing costs should be considered. In Mexico, weaker manufacturing controls or lax enforcement of those standards enable Mexican producers to save compliance costs. This may be considered an indirect government subsidy and an unfair trade advantage. To address this, a trade pact could phase out tariffs as Mexico enhances environmental standards that affect manufacturing and steps up enforcement of these laws. Such provisions could be limited to categories of goods for which there is a pattern of trade between the United States and Mexico. *********** Make maquiladora facilities subject to American environmental law. These border factories, exempt from certain tariffs, are not subject to American environmental rules. Because they receive special treatment from Washington, imposing these rules would not appear as a sovereignty issue and could direct attention to the acknowledged pollution of the border region. *********** Encourage voluntary efforts by industry. United States negotiators could require companies to establish their own guidelines for good manufacturing and production practices and make them the standard to which the industry is legally accountable. To that end, the President wants to apply the Environmental Protection Agency's \"33/50 program\" to the border region. This is a volutary pollution reduction plan under which companies agree to reduce the discharge of 17 high-priority toxic chemicals by 33 percent by 1992 and 50 percent by 1995. Alternatively, for every dollar that companies spend on future pollution reduction, Mexico could provide matching funds aimed at cleaning up existing hazards. Over time, government expenditures would be offset by reducing environmental and public health threats. *********** Require Mexico to adopt the \"Polluter Pays Principle.\" This rule, adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, discourages government subsidization of environmental compliance costs, compelling companies to pay these costs or incur sanctions. Mexico's adoption of this strategy would bring it into conformity with O.E.C.D. countries, insuring more predictability in its trade relations with the industrialized world. It would also link environmental compliance to some notion of culpability, making the imposition of compliance costs more equitable. *********** Include a re-opener provision. The trade agreement should establish a group to monitor industry flight from America to Mexico as well as environmental compliance. It should also include a provision for reopening the agreement to address concerns raised in follow-up studies. **********Both sides must recognize that free-trade goals have undesirable environmental costs. The pact with Mexico gives the United States a chance to reaffirm its commitment to free trade while taking environmental concerns into account. It might even become a model for how countries could balance trade and the environment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/18/business/new-philip-morris-cigarette-emphasizes-less-nicotine.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Ramirez", "pub_date": "1992-01-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 769, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Philip Morris Cigarette Emphasizes Less Nicotine", "print_headline": "New Philip Morris Cigarette Emphasizes Less Nicotine", "body_text": " **********In the tobacco industry's latest marketing wrinkle, the Philip Morris Companies, the world's largest cigarette company, introduced a major cigarette brand yesterday with 90 percent less nicotine than standard brands. **********Philip Morris's low-nicotine cigarette is an attempt to appeal to smokers who want a seemingly healthier cigarette, but with more taste than other brands making similar claims. The industry's first such innovation, low-tar cigarettes, has now won a majority of sales. **********Less nicotine would mean less satisfaction of the nicotine craving. The company discounted the possibility that some smokers might simply buy more cigarettes. **********The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's Now brand and the American Tobacco Company's Carlton cigarettes have similarly low levels of nicotine, but emphasize low tar levels. They have rarely, if ever, made reduced nicotine a marketing theme. **********Philip Morris plans to market its low-nicotine cigarette to Now and Carlton smokers. **********Tar is made up of the particles in smoke that result from tobacco combustion. Nicotine is a nitrogen-based substance found in tobacco that some researchers say is strongly addictive. Unlike nicotine, which is largely flavorless, tar provides much of the distinctive taste of tobacco. **********Philip Morris calls its new offering Merit Ultima, an offshoot of its troubled Merit brand. Like other full-price cigarettes, which in some regions of the country sell for $2.50 or more a pack, Merit has been selling poorly compared with discount brands, which sometimes cost as little as half the price. **********Some of the most fervent of smokers are blue-collar workers, who have been hit hard by layoffs during the recession. **********Merit had a 3.1 percent market share in the nine months ended last Sept. 30, a decline from 3.5 percent during the comparable period the year before, according to figures compiled by John C. Maxwell, Jr., an analyst at Wheat, First Securities Inc. Merit shipments for the period declined to 11.5 billion cigarettes, or more than half a billion packs, compared with 13.3 billion cigarettes, or close to three-quarters of a billion packs, during the 1990 months. **********Merit Ultima \"kings\" contain one-tenth of a milligram of nicotine, compared with 1 milligram in Marlboros, which the industry dubs a \"full flavor\" brand. Ultima also contains a milligram of tar, compared with 16 milligrams in Marlboro, or 94 percent less. Merit Ultima 100's, a longer version, have twice the tar and nicotine levels of the \"kings\" brand. **********Philip Morris's Marlboros are the world's best-selling cigarette. Changing Focus **********David E. R. Dangoor, the senior vice president-marketing for Philip Morris U.S.A., said yesterday that the company had experimented with a cigarette having an even lower level of nicotine, four-one hundredths of a milligram, called Next De-Nic. The cigarette was designed to compete against discount brands, but Philip Morris decided instead to market with a full-price brand with low nicotine. **********\"We think we can get smokers who haven't switched to low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes because they haven't found anything smokable,\" Mr. Dangoor said. **********Carlton and Now use low-nicotine tobacco blends and heavy filtration systems to reduce tar and nicotine. Merit uses what Philip Morris calls a \"dual concentric filter,\" designed to make it easier to inhale the smoke while reducing nicotine. A National Introduction **********Philip Morris, based in New York, is showing extraordinary confidence in the new product by introducing it nationally, rather than regionally. The new cigarette will be available on Feb. 18, backed by advertising devised by Leo Burnett, the advertising agency responsible for Marlboros and previous Merit versions. **********The advertising slogans will be: \"Introducing flavor at the lowest levels of tar and nicotine\" and \"Discover a new way to smoke at the lowest levels of tar and nicotine.\" **********Philip Morris appears to be aiming Merit Ultima at men, judging from its advertising emphasis on flavor. At the end of the cigarette, it is using the brownish tipping -- a \"cork\" in industry parlance -- that is preferred by full-flavor cigarette smokers, usually males. 'Will It Work?' **********Analysts were undecided about the low-nicotine innovation yesterday. \"Does it make sense? Will it work?\" asked Mr. Maxwell of Wheat, First. \"I guess we'll find out. Nobody really follows nicotine levels.\" **********Low-tar cigarettes have been a growing portion of cigarette sales since Carlton was introduced in 1964, and now make up the majority of cigarettes sold. About 61.2 percent of cigarettes shipped last year had reduced levels of tar. **********Such cigarettes are popular with smokers trying to quit, and, as such, have been a lucrative addition to tobacco companies' product lines."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/21/business/business-scene-ousting-strikers-a-costly-tactic.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1992-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 783, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business Scene; Ousting Strikers A Costly Tactic", "print_headline": "Business Scene; Ousting Strikers A Costly Tactic", "body_text": " **********THE threat by Caterpillar Inc. to replace strikers with newly hired workers has raised an issue that neither the economics profession nor corporate executives have publicly addressed: Is it less costly to settle with strikers, or to hire new people at lower wages and fewer benefits, but bear the expense of training them and also the cost of lost production and profits until the new hires are as capable as the old staff had been? **********Presumably Caterpillar's officials tried to weigh the relative costs before they threatened to replace 12,000 strikers -- a threat that was sufficient to bring the strikers back to work. Undoubtedly, their efforts at cost analysis were partly successful and partly guesswork, because some of the costs of replacing strikers simply cannot be quantified, experts say. But increasingly the demands of many modern workplaces appear to be making the replacement worker too costly a weapon. **********\"You can estimate the costs of recruiting and training new people, taking into account that many of the recruits won't make the grade,\" said Audrey Freedman, a labor economist and consultant. \"But the expenses of acclimatizing those that do to a company's culture and the requirements of a modern factory are incalculable.\" **********Nevertheless, if costs are hard to pin down, the time needed to bring replacement workers up to speed is not. In interviews, a dozen economists, corporate managers and union officials agreed that in five to eight years, new hires at almost any company could become as skilled and productive as the employees they replaced. \"You can do it; there's no question about that,\" said Gerald Lazarowitz, research director at the United Automobile Workers union. **********The problem is, could a company like Caterpillar survive the five to eight years without losing too much market share. Here past experience is inconclusive. **********Phelps Dodge, the copper company, and Louisiana Pacific's lumber operation replaced strikers in the early 1980's, and are thriving again, at lower labor costs. Eastern Airlines went out of business, partly because it tried to replace highly skilled mechanics, and Greyhound Lines, which replaced striking drivers in 1990, is barely profitable today. **********President Reagan's decision to replace air traffic controllers in 1981 fuzzed over the cost issue. To make traffic control easier, airlines cut back on flights and lost revenue for months. And the cutback might have lasted longer if hundreds of skilled air traffic controllers had not been shifted from military to civilian operations while new hires were trained. **********\"That was really a very different cost situation; you were using Government-trained and -employed people as strike breakers,\" said John T. Dunlop, the Harvard labor economist. **********A 1938 Supreme Court decision gave corporate managers the right to replace workers. But only in the 1980's did three developments popularize the strategy -- and simultaneously increase the cost of using it. The first was wage stagnation, which created a huge pool of Americans who earned far less than the $12 to $20 an hour enjoyed by unionized workers at companies like Phelps Dodge, Eastern Airlines and Greyhound. **********Companies found willing recruits in this pool, and the union movement's charge that they were scabs fell into disuse. \"The term 'replacement worker' has a certain acceptable connotation,\" said Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California, San Diego. **********But if replacing strikers is acceptable today, it is clearly more expensive. More than 200 cases recorded by the Government before the watershed 1981 air traffic controllers' strike drew relatively little attention, in part because work then required less skill than today. Particularly on factory assembly lines, tasks were repetitive, and new hires could be brought up to speed quickly. **********A tour of Caterpillar's main plant in Peoria, Ill., last October, just before the U.A.W. struck the company, showed that while a number of workers were engaged in fairly repetitive operations in the assembly of earthmovers, many employees had been organized into teams in which each member had mastered several jobs, including the operation of complex, computerized machines. **********Before the strike, Caterpillar officials had pushed for quality through continuous training and team operations. But it is precisely this team approach, increasingly popular in corporate America, that is the hardest and most costly to re-create in replacement workers. **********Teamwork requires loyalty to the company, Mrs. Freedman said, and replacement workers come to the job knowing that they, too, can be replaced -- a knowledge that saps energy and morale. Mr. Dunlop suggested another big cost. \"When you mix replacement workers with strikers who are hired back, then teamwork can be impaired for years,\" he said, \"until the old-timers stop treating the newcomers as scabs.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/31/world/bloemfontein-journal-path-of-the-trekboers-skirts-africa-s-realities.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1992-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1170, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bloemfontein Journal; Path of the 'Trekboers' Skirts Africa's Realities", "print_headline": "Bloemfontein Journal; Path of the 'Trekboers' Skirts Africa's Realities", "body_text": " **********Piet van Niekerk lashed his life to the back of a second-hand truck today, and, in the manner of his Afrikaner forebears, trekked north, toward a dream located deeper in the heart of Africa. **********A red dust storm raged across the parched plain as Mr. van Niekerk loaded the microwave oven into a flimsy camper and, with his wife and reluctant 13-year-old daughter, bid good riddance to South Africa. **********\"It's a lovely day,\" Mr. van Niekerk announced as he watched the local topsoil swirl away in the general direction of Lesotho.

Your local people, the villagers, they come to greet you and they stand on their knees. They've got a lot of respect for white people.\" **********At least 200 farmers from this withering plain have already visited Zambia to see the land and assess the incentives offered by a new Zambian Government that is solicitous of foreign capital and expertise. Attracting White Farmers **********Most were simply curious and are too rooted here to take flight, but they have come back talking so ecstatically about the new frontier that Zambia is now the buzz in Bloemfontein and the surrounding farm towns. **********\"They say the rains are so regular you make your appointments by it -- 'Meet you tomorrow, after the rain,' \" said Johannes van Aswegen, who works as a superintendent of repairmen for the provincial administration here in the Orange Free State. **********Mr. van Aswegen, who is 39, said he planned to emigrate to Zambia next year with his wife, who is a radiologist, and their two children, as soon as he can sell his property and cash in his pension. **********Like Mr. van Neikerk, he plans to settle near Mkushi, where the southern tip of Zaire stabs into Zambia. The area has already attracted a small community of white farmers from Zimbabwe, the former Rhodesia, where the Government of Robert Mugabe has threatened to expropriate large land holdings. Zambians Hungry for Work **********Tossing snapshots from his recent visit across his desk for inspection, he talked about the Zambian rivers, such a riveting sight to farmers in a country gripped by drought for 10 years. He talked about the corn yields, four times those of the desiccated South African midlands, and the T-bone steak that sells for 75 cents a pound. **********Above all, he talked about the Zambian blacks, so different (he imagines) from the insolent hordes to whom the South African Government (he believes) is selling out. **********\"In Zambia there's no racial hate and tension, none whatsoever,\" he said. \"In South Africa, you run into a lot of blacks, you feel the hate. There, they'll rob you blind, but they'll do it with a smile.\" **********Desperate from oppressive unemployment, he said, the Zambians will hire on to clear the fields and work the farm for $10 a month. **********\"Farmers tell us if you need 10, hire 20,\" Mr. van Aswegen said. \"As soon as he gets enough for food, he's gone. You have to be flexible.\" **********Mr. van Aswegen said that politically, he is as \"as far right as I can be,\" beyond the fringe and into the realm where disillusionment is the guiding ideology, where all politicians are damned as liars and the churches, to be frank, are no better. **********The rumor mill has been so high on Zambia, and the anxiety about black rule is so pervasive, that days after the local farmers' union announced it was organizing another Zambia trip in November, 50 farmers had signed up. **********\"I'm sick and tired of Zambia now,\" said Pieter Moller, who has become the agricultural union's Zambia man by virtue of having visited once in July. Other farmers have looked at Botswana, Angola and Mozambique, and in January the union is organizing a trip to Paraguay, but no place has attracted the interest of Zambia. **********Mr. Moller predicted that in the end, few will actually emigrate to Zambia. The exceptions, he said, would be bankrupt farmers like Mr. van Niekerk, who lost the family farm last year, and perhaps young farmers who cannot afford the high cost of breaking into agriculture here. **********Some established farmers, he said, may buy Zambian farms as insurance policies against the danger that a black Government will try to confiscate their property. **********Willem Pretorius, a prosperous 45-year-old farmer from nearby Debrug who visited Zambia in July to have a look, said he might consider going if he were 20, but saw little to tempt him now. **********\"I think the farmers going there are in for a nasty surprise,\" he said, chatting in his office on the wheat and livestock farm handed down from his great-great-grandfather. **********Zambia, he noted, lacks veterinarians, agricultural experts, tractor parts, and all the other amenities of a commercial farming network, as well as schools, hospitals and churches. **********President Frederick Chiluba, whose election victory in October ended the 30-year rule of Kenneth D. Kaunda, is a professed free-market man, Mr. Pretorius said, but he is also the former leader of Zambia's labor federation. **********\"They feel they are getting away from insolent blacks,\" Mr. Pretorius said of the new trekkers. \"But Zambia has fairly strong labor laws. They won't be able to fire workers at will.\" **********In exchange for inexpensive, 99-year land leases, Zambia demands that newcomers make investments of at least $30,000 over three years, either in cash or farming equipment. Where a failed farmer like Mr. van Niekerk will get that money is a subject he declines to discuss. **********Such obstacles, the emigrants respond, would not have fazed the original \"trekboers\" who colonized the Orange Free State, a semi-desert that many believe should never have been touched by the plow. **********\"I think everybody in his heart wants to move away and take a new opportunity, \" Mr. van Aswegen said. \"But only a few have the guts to go upstream.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/22/business/taiwan-slowdown-seen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Taiwan Slowdown Seen", "print_headline": "Taiwan Slowdown Seen", "body_text": " **********Statistics released over the weekend suggested that Taiwan's economic boom was slowing.

As of nightfall, however, neither the I.R.A. nor any other organization had taken responsibility for the bombing. **********Comdr. George Churchill-Coleman, the head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad, said the bomb was clearly \"designed to kill,\" because it was detonated less than 10 minutes after an anonymous telephone warning that did not even specify in which of London's 15 rail stations the bomb had been hidden. **********The police said the telephone warning was made just after 8:20 A.M. by a man with an Irish accent in a call to the London office of a Belfast television station. The caller, who used an I.R.A. code word to indicate the warning was not a hoax, said only that a bomb had been hidden in a London rail station.

Normal service was not resumed until early afternoon. **********The bomb, which the police said contained two pounds of high explosives, was hidden inside a men's restroom at the London Bridge station, a refurbished, 19th-century rail terminal on the south side of the Thames, connecting London to suburban and coastal communities to the south.

Yeltsin before his crucial encounter with the Russian Parliament this week accounted for the hasty announcement. **********There is still considerable confusion among the allies about what the final package will contain, who will pay for what and precisely how much of the money goes beyond pledges previously made. For instance, many Group of Seven officials, saying they are uncertain how the $24 billion figure announced by the White House will be reached, are still counting on other nations, especially those in Scandinavia, to contribute. 'We Are in Midair' **********British officials say the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations will provide $6 billion of the package, German officials say those organizations will provide $5.5 billion, and American officials say they will contribute about $4.5 billion. Some allies, particularly the Japanese, are still chafing that the package was announced before there was final agreement on all the details. **********\"All the figures that the United States has provided are hypothetical,\" said an official in Japan's Finance Ministry. **********A British Treasury official said, \"If you take a snapshot, at the moment we are in midair, about three-quarters through our double spin.\" **********When Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d went to Brussels on March 11 for arms-control discussions, Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev of Russia informed him that at a Congress of People's Deputies scheduled for this week there would be a real campaign by \"old thinkers\" to attack Mr. Yeltsin's reforms. Mr. Kozyrev said if there was ever a time for the West to give Mr. Yeltsin a strong signal of support, it was before that Congress. **********While that conversation was taking place in Brussels, former President Richard M. Nixon was circulating a memo describing the Administration's aid efforts as pathetic. **********For weeks President Bush had shied away from foreign-aid inititives as Patrick J. Buchanan, the Republican Presidential candidate, attacked him for paying too much attention to foreign affairs. But after Mr. Nixon's memo received wide attention, Mr. Bush for the first time acknowledged publicly that he was ready to consider a large-scale aid package. In many ways, the package seemed to be intended to shore up two Presidents: President Bush and President Yeltsin. **********\"Nixon did not hurt,\" said an Administration official. \"But we wanted to get it out before Yeltsin's meeting so that the impact would sink in and give him several days to take advantage of it. He needed some time to work the crowd over there.\" **********Officials say President Bush also rushed to announce a package before the leading Democratic Presidential contender, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, criticized him for foot-dragging on Russian aid. Mr. Bush announced the package at a White House news conference last Wednesday, moments before Mr. Clinton delivered his foreign-policy address in New York. **********\"Of course one sees the electoral logic of the day he chose,\" said a German official about the timing of President Bush's announcement. **********Indeed, some of the lingering confusion over the aid package and where the money will come from may stem, at least in Washington, from the Administration's reluctance in an election year to be clear about exactly what taxpayers will have to contribute. **********The Bush Administration had been considering various aid programs for Russia since September, but it vastly sped up its efforts in recent weeks to meet Mr. Yeltsin's deadline. New U.S. Attitude After Failed Coup **********While acknowledging that many of the numbers in the aid package are rough, Administration officials underline that the Group of Seven -- the world's seven leading industrial nations -- has made a commitment to meet the $24 billion in financing that Russia is estimated to need this year. They also say that while little of the $24 billion requires new authorizations by Group of Seven governments, much of the money will be new aid as far as Russia is concerned. **********By some estimates, about $10 billion of the $11 billion pledged in bilateral aid has already been announced by Group of 7 nations, while other estimates put that figure at $6 billion. According to the Treasury Department, the aid includes a $6 billion fund to stabilize the ruble, $2.5 billion in debt rescheduling, about $4.5 billion from international organization and the remainder in bilateral aid. **********The Administration's attitude toward Russian aid has come a long way since July's economic summit meeting in London, when Washington opposed aid to Moscow, arguing that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was not committed to serious reforms. **********But the Administration warmed up to the idea after the August coup in Moscow, when the United States and other Group of 7 countries began looking for a way to bolster Mr. Gorbachev's shaky rule by discussing a plan to reschedule the huge Soviet debt. **********In the fall, Secretary Baker, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, visited Moscow and discovered that the country was rapidly running out of hard currency to pay its debts and finance crucial imports. **********At the Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, in October, Mr. Brady threw his weight behind efforts to help Russia with its debt burden, but he remained frustrated that the Russians were not providing enough data to determine how much aid they needed. Large-Scale Aid And I.M.F. Role **********After Mr. Yeltsin effectively took power in December, discussions about aid became more serious. During Mr. Baker's visit to Moscow in late December, Mr. Yeltsin appealed to the Secretary of State for any advice he could give on how to garner more Western aid. **********Mr. Yeltsin informed Mr. Baker that he was developing a serious economic plan and intended to remove state price controls. American officials were inclined to help but were still dubious, having heard such promises before. **********Still, on Jan. 3, Treasury Secretary Brady announced that the Administration had changed its mind and now supported Russia's becoming a full member of the International Monetary Fund, which includes virtually all the industrialized democracies. In late January, the Group of Seven finance ministers seconded that call, believing that the global fund should spearhead the Russian aid effort because of its expertise on economic reform. **********They agreed that large-scale aid would flow once Russia joined the fund and once the fund gave its seal of approval to Moscow's reforms. Their hope was that Russia could become a member when the fund held its spring meeting in Washington in late April. **********On Feb. 2, President Bush and Mr. Yeltsin met at Camp David in early February, and Mr. Bush and the Treasury Department became more convinced of Mr. Yeltsin's seriousness about economic reform. Secretary Brady also came away impressed with how eager Mr. Yeltsin's chief economic adviser, Yegor T. Gaidar, was to press ahead with reform. A Financing Scheme With a 60's Fund **********Mr. Yeltsin was clearly disappointed that President Bush was not ready to give any firm promises on aid after the meeting. When Mr. Yeltsin went to Canada that evening, he grumbled about unspecified countries that \"talk and talk\" but \"for the past five months we have been asking for help, and it hasn't happened.\" **********\"Camp David was a pivotal time,\" said a senior Treasury official. \"It was clear that Yeltsin was putting a real program into place.\" **********It was about that time that American officials started thinking that aid should be not just debt rescheduling, but also aid to help finance crucial imports like medicine, machinery and spare parts. **********A few days later Secretary Baker, while heading for Frankfurt for a Western airlift of food and medicine for Russia and other republics, tentatively broached the idea with reporters that the State Department was exploring support of a fund to stabilize Russia's economy. Administration officials say Mr. Baker, who had been the most forward-leaning on helping the Russians, floated the idea to prod the the White House and the Treasury. But Treasury officials say they were already working hard on Russian aid and needed no prodding. **********On Feb. 27, the Group of 7 deputy finance ministers held a crucial meeting in Germany, where they began sketching details of an aid package that Russia would receive after joining the global lender. At the meeting, the Americans proposed a novel way of financing the $6 billion ruble stabilization fund the Russians had asked for. **********In the 1960's, 10 major industrial countries set up a fund now having $23 billion -- known as the general arrangements to borrow -- that they could draw from to help stabilize their currencies, and the Americans proposed that $6 billion from that fund be used to stabilize Russia's ruble. Tokyo Criticizes 'Rough Numbers' **********The Group of Seven embraced that plan because Washington, Bonn and Tokyo were not hungering to appropriate $6 billion in new funds to underwrite the risky currency. **********The momentum for a package picked up in March. In addition to the Nixon memo and Secretary Baker's meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister, the American Ambassador to Moscow, Robert Strauss, returned to Washington to lobby Congress and Mr. Bush to provide large-scale aid. And several key Senators pressed Mr. Bush to move aggressively on such aid. **********All those factors seemed to finally spur the Administration into action. Mr. Baker had the State Department begin drafting a legislative package that would combine all of the American contributions, those already committed and some new ones. **********Behind the scenes, the Group of Seven finance ministries were working feverishly to put together an aid package before Mr. Yeltsin confronted Parliament. They finally got the monetary fund and Russia to provide some data on how much for balance-of-payments support Russia needed to finance its debt service and crucial imports like medicine and spare parts. The monetary fund said Russia needed a minimum of $12 billion in aid, and perhaps as much as $18 billion. **********On March 27, the Group of Seven's deputy finance ministers met in Paris, where they spent a whole day discussing a Russian aid package. They discussed terms for Russia's joining the monetary fund and they approved the $6 billion fund to stabilize the ruble. They also tallied up how much direct aid each of the seven nations would contribute **********According to figures provided by Group of Seven officials, Bonn is to provide $3 billion of the $11 billion in bilateral aid, Washington and Tokyo will provide $2 billion each, Italy $1.2 billion, Canada $1.1 billion and Britain $400 million. That comes to $9.7 billion before including France's contribution, which has not been disclosed. Japan's Reluctance And Island Dispute **********Group of Seven officials say that at the meeting, the Germans and Americans said that they would announce aid packages a few days later to give Mr. Yeltsin some support before the Russian Parliament met. Bonn and Washington said the aid package should also be timed to the monetary fund's endorsement of Russia's reform plan, which the fund announced on March 31. **********Nonetheless, once President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany made the packages public, Japanese officials said that the announcement was premature because, in their view, not all the details were hammered out. **********American, German and British officials suggest that Japan does not want to appear as if it is being pushed into backing Russia. Tokyo has been reluctant to grant huge aid until Russia agrees to return the Kurile Islands that the Soviet Union seized toward the end of World War II. **********\"To a certain extent, everyone is addressing their domestic political audience,\" said a British official. \"They are addressing the gallery.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/22/business/tech-notes-early-zap-for-auto-pollution.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1992-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 356, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tech Notes; Early Zap for Auto Pollution", "print_headline": "Tech Notes; Early Zap for Auto Pollution", "body_text": " **********When an auto engine starts, it spews out unchecked pollutants for the first few minutes because the catalytic converter that neutralizes them has not warmed to its job.

R. Grace and Precision Combustion, have experimented with adding electric preheaters to catalytic converters to warm that first blast of gas quickly.

Countries that had barricaded their economies against the outside world have found the same new answers: Trade barriers are falling like dominoes, and state enterprises are everywhere up for sale. **********Some peace has come to Nicaragua and El Salvador, some prosperity to Bolivia. A nationalist rivalry between Argentina and Brazil has evaporated, ending the regional arms race and its nuclear threat. Of Cuba's fiery promise of revolution, only embers remain. An Uncertain Triumph **********Yet as so many countries struggle to reinvent themselves, they have begun to find the triumph of democracy and free enterprise far less decisive than the defeat of despotism and the command economy. What is the glory of fair voting, Brazilians and Peruvians and Paraguayans have asked, if corruption remains endemic, justice systems are still unjust, and presidents do as they please? **********Though one government after another has brought down inflation and restored growth, relatively little of the wealth has trickled down. And with the fortune of a few growing more apparent, many of the indigent are asking more sharply how long the pain of economic \"adjustments\" will last. **********\"For the people who have good jobs, things are getting better, of course,\" said Victoria Ramos, an unwed 25-year-old mother of three who helps her father farm and bake bread in the Mexican village of Reyes Etla. \"But they are living off the peasants, the humble people. For the poor, it is something very different. What do the poor get from the Government?\" **********The hemisphere's authoritarian structures and statist economics began to crumble long before the Berlin wall, and did so overwhelmingly for their own reasons. But to many people, the outlook is more hopeful than it has been in years merely for having been purged of superpower interest and sterile ideological conflict. **********\"It is as though the cold war had been a mask that blinded us to the reality of the world,\" the Mexican poet Octavio Paz said. And in a different conversation, a frequent political adversary of Mr. Paz seemed to complete his thought. **********\"The fact that we can see the problems in their proper perspective rather than through a mask of anti-Communism or pro-Communism,\" the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes said, \"is the beginning of the resolution of those problems on their real terms.\" **********The clearer view has made it hard not to see that over the last two generations, Latin American government institutions have withered while social, economic and environmental challenges have grown. The violence and corruption of drug traffickers continue to tear through much of the region. The wildfire spread of cholera has revealed infrastructure and health-care systems in advanced decay. **********According to United Nations estimates, poverty defines the lives of more than 40 percent of all Latin Americans. Although the region's foreign debt problem is seldom described as a crisis anymore, billions of dollars that might be used for social programs still go to banks overseas. **********The common direction of policy in many countries has also obscured the sharp debates over what sort of capitalism they should have. A central question of the past -- who should bear the sacrifices of economic development -- is growing more insistent. **********\"There is no real consensus,\" said Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a leader of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party. \"There is a feeling everywhere that if the economy recovers, social problems will be solved. But we don't know how to reconcile the markets with policies that will ameliorate poverty, misery and injustice.\" Looking for Help Financial Aid Is Hard to Find **********Stripped of the geopolitical import that defined their place in the postwar world, Latin Americans are uncertain to whom they might turn for help. **********Japanese investors have become something like U.F.O.'s: Many people expect them to land one day, but almost no one can convincingly describe what one does. International lending agencies are swamped with new demands, and many private creditors see higher returns in Eastern Europe. **********Across much of the region, relations with the United States have become almost cozy after a century of mistrust. But from 1990 to 1991, United States aid to Latin America dropped by 27 percent. And as isolationist themes have surfaced in the 1992 Presidential campaign, the hemisphere's ancient fears of American interference have given way to new worries that it might be ignored. **********\"The United States?\" Tomas Borge, the former Sandinista guerrilla leader and Nicaraguan Interior Minister, repeated the words in a recent interview as though he had not heard them in a while. \"With their rear guard safe,\" he said, \"they don't worry about our countries much anymore.\" **********So long as rebels like Mr. Borge could turn to Fidel Castro for help and threaten Marxist takeovers of their own, much of Latin America was able to count on United States economic aid, loan support and trade. Duality of U.S. Policy **********Beginning with John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress in 1961, the benefits were meant to dissuade Latin Americans from socialism and revolution. But along with Washington's help came support for anti-Communist military dictators, an often heavy-handed United States presence in the region and a claimed American right to intervene where the enticements failed. **********The duality reflected a 30-year split among American policy makers over the cause of instability in the hemisphere. To the right, and usually dominant, were officials who saw Communist adventurism. To the left were those who blamed poverty and injustice. **********After 1962, when the Cuban missile crisis brought the world closer than ever to nuclear war, the United States generally made stability a more immediate goal than democracy. The Soviet Union, in the meantime, lowered its profile in the region, secretly financing Latin Communist parties and opening diplomatic and trade relations with as many countries as it could. **********More important for the region's polarization, the Soviets sponsored Mr. Castro as he transformed Cuba at least temporarily into an example of social reform, a patron of Marxist guerrilla groups and a symbol of nationalistic defiance that obsessed the United States. **********\"Cuba gave us the illusion that we could be taken seriously,\" Mario Rasi, a Brazilian playwright, said as he prepared recently for a trip to show his solidarity with the Castro Government. \"The cruel reality is that we don't count for anything in this phase of world history.\" Conflicting Ideals **********American diplomats and Latin politicians often described the conflict as one of parallel ideals: democracy versus dictatorship, capitalism and free markets versus socialism and state control. **********Yet the prevailing Latin American economic model of the postwar age -- state ownership and intervention to sustain unproductive industries; monopolies and trade protection, and endless public works to buy political support -- crossed ideological lines. It was applied by leftist civilian governments and anti-Communist military regimes, and it failed them all. **********Although Latin American economies grew at an average rate of 5.5 percent in the 30 years before 1980, they also grew heavy with inefficiencies, addicted to deficit spending and dependent on imports of capital goods. **********By the 1970's, the result was often inflation that shot out of control. Then, beginning with Mexico in 1982, countries found that they could no longer pay their huge debts, and creditors began demanding austerity and orthodox reform as the price of sustenance. **********The fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 not only discredited statist policies in Latin America but also provided a further incentive for change: By putting Eastern Europe on many investors' maps, it intensified the fight for capital in the developing world. **********It is in this light that many economists say most of capitalism's brave new Latin American soldiers had no alternative -- a historical subtlety, perhaps, but one that raises questions about the permanence of the reforms. **********\"The fact that politicians in Latin America have called in technocrats who believe in the formulas of the World Bank and the I.M.F. doesn't mean that there will be no return to the old populist policies,\" said the Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto, a strong advocate of the reforms. \"Everybody is on their best behavior today because there's no money around, and the only way you can get any is to do what the I.M.F. says.\" New Allies Old Ideologies And Enmities Fade **********In Central America, where superpower tensions fueled violent conflicts almost until the Soviet Union's collapse, the cold war's end has had more visceral effects. **********The wooded hills above Ocotal, Nicaragua, for instance, are seeded with the hatreds of killing that began in the late 1920's and then proceeded almost without interruption from the Sandinista rebellion in the late 1970's though the contra war to oust the Sandinistas. **********But earlier this year, former contra rebels and former Sandinista soldiers came down from the hills together, pointing rifles in the same direction and demanding the same things: land, housing and farm loans. **********So fully have war memories been overwhelmed by immediate concerns that the authorities to whom they turn are old enemies, too. **********President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the Sandinistas' bitter critic for a decade, is under siege by former supporters because of her alliance with leaders of the old regime. And such was the Sandinista uproar when Mrs. Chamorro's Sandinista Defense Minister, Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra, decorated a departing United States military attache not long ago that Mr. Borge felt it necessary to remind the enraged militants that General Ortega, the strategist of their victory 13 years earlier, was still a revolutionary. **********The general's brother, former President Daniel Ortega Saavedra, said recently that Nicaraguans had managed to \"depolarize\" their society, only to find that a half-measure. Leftist Salvadoran guerrillas and their right-wing Government saw the problem long before they made peace: Without foreign aid at levels like those that sustained their fighting, they could never treat the country's problems with the urgency that war had conferred on them. **********It seemed to follow a circular logic like that of Nicaragua's former and current combatants that a new guerrilla group appeared in Bolivia last year and an old one, the Cinchoneros, reappeared this month in Honduras. But familiar ideological impulses have also taken new shape. **********As the United States debates whether to militarize the war on cocaine in the Andes, Colombian and Peruvian guerrillas have found a new source of funds in taxing the traffickers. In Bolivia, Marxist miners who lost their jobs when the Government sold its tin business have streamed into the jungle, organizing coca farmers with the zeal they brought to their socialistic revolution in 1952. **********While guerrillas in Colombia and Guatemala fight on under Marxist-Leninist flags, the region's most potent insurgency is its most independent. The ideology of Peru's Shining Path, while often called Maoist, is such a singular mix of revolutionary ideas that a more accurate label is the one used by the guerrillas themselves. They call it \"Gonzalo Thought,\" after their self-proclaimed \"President Gonzalo,\" a former philosophy professor named Abimael Guzman. **********But in Peru and throughout Latin America, more traditional leftist parties are linked primarily by their disarray. Whether or not they were agents of the old statism, most of them have been tarred by its failures. With their adversaries championing change to voters impatient for it, the left has often been forced to choose between endorsing Government policies or braving political jeers to advocate a more active social role for the state. **********Sergio Bitar, a former minister in the Chilean socialist Government of Salvador Allende Gossens, said the quandary \"has forced us to look much more at concrete proposals rather than theoretical ideas, to understand that we need to be more competitive and productive, and to put democracy at the center of all progressive thinking.\" **********While Mr. Bitar's Party for Democracy was energetically revisionist before Communism ended in Europe, its success is rare. The leftist coalition that almost lifted Cuauhtemoc Cardenas to the Mexican presidency in 1988 faltered badly in elections last year. Colombia's former M-19 rebels, no longer a novelty at the polls, have had trouble building a real party. **********Moribund as much of the traditional left is, some political analysts argue that support for \"neo-liberals\" may not be so strong as it seems, either. **********They note that many of the reformers -- Presidents Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina, Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil, Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela and Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru -- all campaigned as populists, pledging little that was concrete, and sometimes the opposite of the economic changes they have made. **********In Argentina, Mr. Menem has taken advantage of the economic chaos that preceded him -- annual inflation of more than 20,000 percent and supermarkets under siege by hungry mobs -- to win wide support for painful measures to stabilize and reorient the economy. **********But only in Ecuador's May 17 election, which put two conservative candidates into a runoff, have presidential candidates running on vocally free-market platforms won clear backing at the polls. **********What Road to Take Economic Reform And/or Democracy **********That Chile and Mexico have emerged as examples of economic reform has led many Latin Americans to question how well democracy and free markets really go together. **********In Chile, Gen. Augusto Pinochet was able to quiet critics with tear gas, water cannon and mass arrests as he imposed structural economic changes that during the military regime's first decade led to a 40 percent drop in real wages and some of the highest urban unemployment in Latin America. **********Persuasion has been far more important to economic restructuring in Mexico, but the overwhelming political advantages and administrative control of a party that has been in power for six decades have often been essential. **********Labor unions dependent on the Government have kept workers in line as their real wages have plummeted. Powerful union leaders who might have opposed the privatization of state companies or other policies have been toppled or even jailed. **********In an interview after his party's strong recovery at the left's expense in congressional and state elections last summer, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari argued that the fall of the Berlin wall and changes in the Soviet Union had \"significantly affected the vote of the left in Mexico.\" **********His counterparts in Latin America have paid more attention to the fact that amid all the talk of efficiency and enterprise, Mr. Salinas's political strategy has remained populist. While his $3-billion-a-year antipoverty program stresses community involvement in public works, it also stamps each new sewer and school with a seal of Government munificence. **********The money from the sale of state companies used to pay for such programs has been far less plentiful in other countries than it has been in Mexico. For an emerging underclass of Latin economies, big international bond issues, packs of foreign investors and trade agreements with the United States are also still part of a dream. **********In the absence of such advantages, politicians say, the failings of leaders and governments are often seen as shortcomings of democracy itself. **********Until recently, falling inflation, memories of violent military rule and weak opposition parties muffled the discontent. But even in Mexico, Chile and Argentina, Government officials still worry endlessly about the effects of prosperity unevenly spread. **********To many officials, the peril was crystallized in February in Venezuela, when military rebels tried to overthrow Mr. Perez. After a year in which the economy grew 9.2 percent, the President's critics had complained that social services were breaking down, that only the rich were getting richer and that corrupt officials were growing richest of all. **********The insurgent officers appealed almost unthinkably to students at whom soldiers had shot while crushing riots three years before. They capitalized on the widespread perception that Mr. Perez had worked harder at being a prominent statesman than on the problems of the poor. He protested that soldiers had tried to kill him; some Venezuelans applauded. **********Many Peruvians also hailed Mr. Fujimori for suspending the Peruvian Constitution and shutting the Congress on April 5. Even some thoughtful analysts of the country's crisis believe that Shining Path's blunt appeal to destroy the existing system must be fought with draconian measures. **********Others, like Mr. de Soto, the economist, argue that the actions are a vivid reminder of checks, balances and accountability dangerously missing from the region's young democracies. **********\"It reminds you of the guy with the seismograph in one of those old American films,\" he said. \"You know that Los Angeles is going to crumble in two hours, and no one will listen.\" The U.S. Role Widening Debate And No Consensus **********United States officials insist that they are listening, and that if there is a lesson about Latin America in the world's changes, they have learned it. **********\"I will not deny that my own country bears its share of responsibility for having tended to view our hemispheric relationships through the sometimes distorting prism of the cold war,\" the Deputy Secretary of State, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, told the Organization of American States last June. **********Mr. Eagleburger went on to warn, \"Anyone plotting against an elected government should know in advance: This hemisphere will not stand idly by if democracy is assaulted, neither before nor after a crisis emerges.\" **********What meaning that dictum might hold for two countries where the Administration sees democracy egregiously nonexistent is unclear. **********His sponsors gone from the planet and his economy almost bankrupt, Mr. Castro has still thumbed his nose at American officials who tell him to hold elections he might lose. **********Yet even with the urgency of a Presidential election in which Cuban-American votes may play an important role, the United States has been able only to persuade its Latin American partners not to help sustain the Cuban economy. **********At another O.A.S. assembly last week, despite an agreement on stronger economic sanctions against Haiti, the United States also found itself unable to muster any broader consensus on how to come to democracy's defense. Venezuelans wanted a multinational force. Mexicans wanted nothing of the sort. And Americans watched almost helplessly as failures of democracy and economic development translated into a stream of boat people heading north. **********Increasingly, Administration officials have turned to democracy-building programs long favored by Congressional liberals. They are financing judicial-system improvements in Colombia and new civilian police forces in Panama and El Salvador. A Shift in Washington **********Almost at the same time, though, Congress has appeared to lose much of its interest in such efforts. This year, it declined to finance debt-relief and economic development programs proposed by the Administration, and some members have opposed free-trade agreements for Mexico and Chile. **********\"No one in Washington wants to spend much time talking about Latin America these days, except the people who are obliged to,\" said Lars Schoultz, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina who has long studied United States policy on the region. \"The silence from Congress is deafening. Just no one cares.\" **********The Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Bernard W. Aronson, said that is not so. He said Latin America's economic relevance to the United States was growing quickly, with its imports of American products up 29 percent over the last two years, and a $100 billion market for American goods expected by the century's end. But Mr. Aronson acknowledged that some new thinking was needed. **********\"We tend to be very impatient and arrogant about what it takes to build institutions,\" he said. \"This isn't going to be a quick fix.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/24/business/business-people-phillips-officer-gives-up-post.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-03-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 101, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Phillips Officer Gives Up Post", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Phillips Officer Gives Up Post", "body_text": " **********Bill M.

The person is Elizabeth Mason, who joined the agency as president in February, after five years at Levine, Huntley, Vick & Beaver in New York. **********At Levine, Huntley, a respected midsized shop that closed last fall, Ms. Mason had most recently been senior vice president and director of business development. **********Yet her abilities in that realm were not the sole reason for hiring her, Steve Friedman, Friedman Benjamin's chief executive and co-creative director, said in a recent interview at the agency's new office in Manhattan. **********\"We had really been searching for the right person to take over, not just the new-business efforts, but the direction and strategy of the agency,\" he explained. **********Tony Benjamin, executive vice president and co-creative director, who joined the interview as a somewhat muffled voice on a speakerphone, said, \"Not only had she had the experience of working with a very strong creative group, she had a handle on how the business was shifting, on how your ability to deliver on business issues as a whole was becoming much more critical.\" **********Ms. Mason, who seemed embarrassed at the fulsome praise of her colleagues, said that once Levine, Huntley shut its doors, she began \"talking to different kinds of agencies, some very large, some very small, some not even started yet.\" **********She said she ruled out the large ones because, exhausted from coping with the death throes of Levine, Huntley, \"I didn't have the energy to fight a bureaucracy.\" She ruled out the start-ups because \"in this marketplace I think, in all honesty, we have all the agencies we need.\" **********The arrival at Friedman Benjamin of Ms. Mason, 31 years old, typifies a common strategy among agencies that one skeptic of the practice describes as importing messiahs -- bringing in outsiders, particularly those who have established reputations as specialists in disciplines like account management, copywriting or acquiring new business, to put their skills to work. **********Sometimes, that strategy can work wonders, as it did in July for two giant agencies. After importing a president -- Andy Berlin, who is to landing new business what the Herring Maven was to fish -- DDB Needham New York was awarded the James River Corporation's consumer paper products account. And after importing a chairwoman -- Charlotte Beers, who is to the care and feeding of clients what Mr. Whipple was to fondling bathroom tissue -- Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide was named to handle Jaguar's American account. **********Other times, though, the strategy misfires and the import is soon exported. Perhaps the messiah arrived amid exceedingly high expectations and produced what were deemed insufficiently few miracles. Or perhaps he or she just never managed to adapt to a new environment. Among recent examples were Jane Cavalier, who served nine months as president of Frankfurt Gips Balkind Advertising, and Andy Dijak, who served a year as a senior creative executive on the BMW account at Ammirati & Puris. **********As for Friedman Benjamin, importing Ms. Mason appears -- so far, anyway -- to be paying off. The agency has won two new accounts, the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center and the Pratt Institute, and was also named to handle additional business from an existing client, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association. **********Ms. Mason \"is very responsive to clients' needs,\" said Derryl Reed, assistant vice president of insurance services at Teachers Insurance in New York. Most important, he added, she \"understands the strategic issues and can see the big picture.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/11/world/squalid-slums-grow-as-people-flood-latin-america-s-cities.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1992-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Squalid Slums Grow as People Flood Latin America's Cities", "print_headline": "Squalid Slums Grow as People Flood Latin America's Cities", "body_text": " **********In March, 600 families invaded land that had once been a garbage dump on the southern outskirts of Lima, making a settlement by building straw huts overnight. The police moved in repeatedly, evicting the families and leveling the huts, but the settlers came back each time. **********The invasion, like others throughout Latin America, had a predictable result: six months later, the 400-acre tract is a teeming shantytown with 10,000 residents who are lobbying the city to give each family title to its own piece of dusty ground 20 feet wide by 40 feet long. **********Despite the grinding poverty, Peruvians seeking a better life have been fleeing the countryside for Lima at the rate of more than a thousand a day and building settlements like this one, a seemingly endless expanse of small straw huts brushed constantly by a gritty wind next to a noisy highway.  Terrorist Threat Remains **********And even though the Peruvian Government is celebrating the blow dealt the Shining Path guerrilla movement by the capture of its founder, Abimael Guzman Reynoso, experts warn that it will be hard to wipe out the terrorist group if the country cannot address the overcrowding, poverty, lack of health care and other symptoms of the deep gap between rich and poor that are so visible in this settlement, problems that caused the message of the Shining Path to fall on relatively fertile ground. **********\"The demand in Lima for a piece of land is so great it can't be stopped,\" said Pedro Ublitas, general secretary of the settlement. \"The authorities call us terrorists and criminals. They bring the police in and threaten us. But they don't realize we need space for our families.\" **********Forty years after Latin Americans started a great migration to their cities, this shantytown full of barefoot children and idle men illustrates what is perhaps the most serious problem facing the continent: excessive urbanization and the bitter fruit it is bearing. **********Latin America is the most urbanized part of the underdeveloped world. In 1950, only 42 percent of Latin Americans were city dwellers; today almost 73 percent live in cities, according to the United Nations. This compares with 34 percent in Africa and 33 percent in Asia. **********The trend has created megacities throughout the continent: Buenos Aires, with 12 million out of 32 million Argentines; Santiago, with 5 million out of 13 million Chileans; Lima, with 7 million out of 22 million Peruvians, and Mexico City, the world's biggest city, with more than 20 million of the country's 90 million people. **********In many countries the equation is similar: the major city attracts one-quarter to one-third of the country's population, with many living in squalid slums or shantytowns encircling the affluent inner city. While the percentage of city dwellers is close to that in the United States, where 75 percent of the population lives in cities, the Latin American example has produced a host of economic and social ills.  Expert Sums Up: Lima a Time Bomb **********In such concentrations of humanity, the migrants from the countryside have found crushingly disappointing economic opportunities, alarming levels of pollution, uncontrollable crime, and the nearly free movement of terrorists and other violent groups. The political unrest these problems produce becomes at times a potent weapon for demagogues. **********\"It was really ironic for those of us who went to the Rio summit,\" said Alfredo Gastal, director of the United Nations Office of Environment and Human Settlement in Santiago, referring to the world environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro in June. \"Everyone there was worrying about trees and rain forests, and they were in the city that best exemplifies the worst problem in Latin America, and nothing was said about it.\" **********This Lima shantytown, called Susana Higushi after the wife of President Alberto K. Fujimori, embodies all the woes of Latin American over-urbanization. \"The city has grown like a wild animal without any kind of planning,\" said Eduardo Ballon, an urbanization specialist. \"Lima is a time bomb.\" **********In the six months since the land grab, the shantytown has organized itself for self-defense and to lobby for land titles, but its municipal services are almost nonexistent. Water is brought in in barrels. Electricity comes from the few car batteries that residents manage to pick up. City authorities do not collect trash and garbage, because to do so would be to acknowledge the legitimacy of the settlement. So residents dump it by the side of the road. **********Barefoot children shout and play in the streets while the men, having no work, congregate around makeshift bars where they play cards or quietly chat. In the tiny market, where vendors sell squash, bananas, fish, salt, rice and beans, the talk was that there was no money and that no one was buying. **********\"We're just sitting here day after day, waiting for things to change,\" said Flor, who who came here from Ayacucho. She would not give her last name. The Summer Is Due, And With It Disease **********While residents say they live in fear that Shining Path will infiltrate the settlement, their biggest concern now is the coming of the Southern Hemisphere's summer. With no electricity, running water or sewage system, they see summer as a time of disease and death. **********The settlement has just one tiny medical post, and it has only small stocks of medicines. Over the last two years, Peruvians have been shocked by a cholera epidemic that has infected more than 500,000 people and killed 3,500. The disease hit hardest in the cities, where it was almost solely a plague of the poor. But there are other sicknesses -- tuberculosis, measles and hepatitis -- that many fear just as much. **********Latin American urbanization experts like Mr. Gastal say they are concerned by two trends. Though the rate of growth of the cities has slowed, they say, rural dwellers will continue flocking to them well into the next century, when they could hold 85 to 90 percent of the people. The countryside then will be all but empty. **********Just as alarming, population experts are finding that middle-sized cities are also growing quickly, putting a heavy burden on local governments less able to cope with the misery of overcrowding. And the urban sprawl is linking giant cities. Experts say that by the year 2010, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo will be one continuous megalopolis 350 miles long with almost 40 million people. **********The current urban growth rate, experts say, means that every year 8 million to 10 million people are either going to cities or being born in cities in the nations south of the United States, most into conditions not unlike those at the Lima shantytown. **********\"They all should have light, heat, water, medical attention, education, transportation,\" said Jorge E. Hardoy, director of the Latin American chapter of the International Institute of Environment and Development. \"But that is simply impossible. This is why you start with the problems we are seeing.\"  The Rich Live Behind Bars **********The institute estimates that Lima has to absorb 400,000 new people every year; Sao Paulo 450,000, and Buenos Aires 100,000. The strains are evident in every major city. **********In Santiago, there is no water treatment plant for industrial or home waste, and no government regulations prohibit the dumping of toxic chemicals by industries. **********In Rio de Janeiro, the affluent live behind iron fences and barred windows to protect themselves from rampant street crime. In Caracas, Venezuela, the masses of poor have rallied behind a leader of failed coup attempts against the Government, reflecting their desperation over tough economic policies. **********In Mexico City, one of the world's most polluted cities, residents are choked by smog from overcrowding and excessive industrialization. It is estimated that only 40 percent of the 20 million residents have running water and that only 30 percent have sewers. **********If the problems can be addressed through government policies and private enterprise, the trend is not necessarily all bad. Many of the nations are experiencing a fundamental change from agricultural economies to economies based more on industry and service, and the recent renewed trend toward stable economies could bring about a decade of job growth. Also, health care and education tend to be better even in the poorest areas of the cities than in the countryside. But problems seem certain to mount. **********\"We are seeing an incredible social apartheid here,\" said Herbert de Souza, executive director of the Brazil Institute for Social and Economic Analysis in Rio de Janeiro. \"More and more the middle class and the rich have to live isolated from the vast masses of poor, who face violence, sickness and hopelessness.\" Many are warning that it will not take much to mobilize these masses into a potent and perhaps violent political force. Shining Path Feeds Rush to the Cities **********At the Susana Higushi shantytown, the specter of the Shining Path looms large, though few residents would discuss it. The settlement sits below another shantytown, settled years ago, that has a strong Shining Path presence. Many here think it is only a matter of time before the guerrillas come. **********\"Everyone thinks everyone is a terrorist,\" Mr. Ublitas said. \"I've been accused of being a terrorist because I am trying to organize here. You just have to go on with your life. They will eventually come and try to do something here. But I think the people will resist.\" **********As in other nations, people flocked to this capital from the countryside in the 1950's and 1960's in search of better jobs, education and health care. **********At first, jobs were plentiful. But in the 1980's Peru's Government, like other Latin American governments caught in the debt crisis and rising inflationary spiral, cut off almost all industrial growth. Investment plunged,and poverty began to rise again. **********Peru had an added problem: the growing Shining Path violence in the Andean region. The peasants there were caught in the middle, with many killed by either the guerrillas or the army. This created a wave of refugees. **********\"They were coming to Lima just to survive, not to better their lives,\" said Mr. Ballon, the urbanization specialist. **********Lima had other problems, in particular a lack of city planning and a weak municipal government. Services collapsed from lack of investment and guerrilla sabotage. In the city, 58 percent of the water produced by the state water company is lost, and 20 percent of those who have water obtain it illegally. When water and electricity are rationed, usually as a result of Shining Path sabotage, they are unevenly distributed, with the rich sections getting more than the poor ones. **********Now Peru, like other countries, finds that its secondary cities are exploding too. Arequipa, Ilo and Cusco are all expanding at 5 to 8 percent a year. **********\"The big cities do not offer the same attractions they offered 10 years ago,\" said Francisco Leon, a United Nations economist. \"They are saturated, so people are turning to intermediate cities, but that creates new problems. Where do you get money to provide basic services? You have many of these places that are essentially going from being small villages to complete cities in a matter of years.\"  Forest Is Falling To the Settlers **********And there are potentially long-lasting environmental consequences. One casualty of the Susana Higushi settlement is one of Lima's few natural forests: a stately stand of eucalyptus trees in the desert that surrounds the city. On many nights, one or two of the trees are mysteriously cut down, expanding the borders of the shantytown and at the same time slowly destroying one of the few remaining barriers in Lima to total desertification. **********The settlement continues to grow with the arrival of people like Fernando Ortiz, who stood outside his straw hut one day pulling nails out of boards that he planned to use to shore up the structure. He and his wife, Maleni, fled Ayacucho, the cradle of the Shining Path, arriving about a month ago. They had given up a good school for their daughter, a clean hospital and a home with electricity and running water for a patch of dust and a hope that they could avoid guerrilla violence. **********Mrs. Ortiz said she was so troubled by the violence that she did not mind losing those amenities. The only thing she really laments, she said, is that her daughter is not speaking her native Quechua, and will inevitably lose much of the cultural heritage of the Indians of the Peruvian Andes. **********\"In the sierras the people are very strong and alive, and you can feel it in the language,\" she said. \"Here in the city, a lot of that disappears.\" **********But as her husband pointed out, that was a small price to pay. \"Many of us don't have a choice,\" he said. \"This is the best we can do right now.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/28/business/credit-markets-treasuries-steady-in-a-light-day.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1992-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 883, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasuries Steady in a Light Day", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Treasuries Steady in a Light Day", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in slow trading yesterday, as credit market participants marked time before a number of important events are played out over the next week to 10 days. **********Specifically, traders pointed to this evening's State of the Union Message, the confirmation hearings for the Federal Reserve chairnan, Alan Greenspan, on Wednesday -- a day when preliminary estimates of fourth-quarter economic growth are also expected -- and next week's announcement from the Treasury about the size and confirguation of its quarterly refunding auctions. **********\"All of these topics are prompting lots of speculation,\" said a government securities trader, who insisted on anonymity. \"But it is not the kind of speculation people are willing to act on.

In general, such so-called broadcast fax publications rarely generate enough subscribers to make a profit. The Chicago Tribune abandoned such a product after four months, and other papers have had similar experiences. **********Second, what does work: making available an array of information via fax, but sending it for a fee only in response to specific requests -- a concept called fax-on-demand. **********For instance, in April The Detroit Free Press teamed with World Data Delivery Systems Inc., a data-base concern, and offered tax forms via fax. The Free Press and about 25 other papers told readers that they could receive a free menu via fax of roughly 100 tax forms by dialing a toll-free \"800\" number. Then, customers could call a \"900\" number, for $2.95, and order any two forms sent to them via fax. The charge was for the call; the forms were free. **********Jonathan D. Ahlbrand, president of Detroit-based World Data, said that about 7,000 people placed calls to the \"900\" number, \"and we think we way underpriced it.\" In 1993, he said, he plans to offer 1,500 tax forms, including those of every state. **********\"It's for the I-want-it-now guy,\" said Mr. Ahlbrand, who thinks fax-on-demand projects could become a staple for newspapers. **********One particular appeal of fax-on-demand is that it enables newspapers to extract income from the elaborate information-via-telephone systems that many are setting up as a first step in electronic publishing. **********In such audiotex systems, callers using touch-tone phones can get the weather, sports scores, stock quotations, movie listings and other information. But usually there is no charge for such calls, and advertisers have been unwilling to pay very much for an accompanying voice ad. **********Newspapers have also been seeking ways to repackage and sell the volumes of information, like sports statistics from The Associated Press, that never appear in the papers. **********With the fax-on-demand concept, a caller could request specific sports scores, a tailored news summary or other information at specific times, and it could be sent via fax, for a fee. **********For instance, in March, The Fresno Bee introduced FAX+Plus, offering a particular box score from spring-training baseball on a one-time basis for 99 cents or unlimited scores until the end of spring training for $10. **********The core insight in fax-on-demand is that such services serve a very narrow niche, but that there are an almost infinite number of niches. **********Indeed, broadcast fax publications that send the same material to many subscribers can also work, provided there is a suitable niche. **********The Wall Street Journal, for example, is marketing an array of money-related fax services. **********Similarly, The New York Times is marketing a daily fax newspaper called TimesFax, a roughly eight-page summary of the daily paper. **********In 1990, TimesFax was offered to business executives in Japan, but it evolved from a business-oriented publication to one including features and analysis, which was also aimed at tourists. Patricia Ecke, publisher of TimesFax, said it was now circulated to hotels in Hong Kong, Brazil, Argentina, the Caribbean and elsewhere, and was read by nearly 40,000 cruise-ship passengers each day. **********TimesFax is sent to the cruise ships via satellite rather than fax, and then photocopied and distributed. **********Similar alternative methods of delivery are being used to distribute other fax-like products. **********For instance, travelers on the USAir shuttle between New York and Washington or Boston from 4 to 9 P.M. on business days receive a copy of The Latest News. The publication, a 12-page booklet, calls itself \"the nation's first hourly newspaper,\" and its content changes for each of six hourly editions. **********Each issue of The Latest News, which is also handed out on the American Airlines shuttle between New York and Chicago, includes about 50 brief articles, interspersed with black-and-white ads and a few full-color ad pages. The color ads cost about $9,000 a month. **********The Latest News is owned by States News Service, a news organization that covers Washington issues for local newspapers. **********Leland Schwartz, owner of States News Service and publisher of The Latest News, said 400 copies of The Latest News could normally be ready for distribution in just over an hour after its news deadline. **********Pages are sent by satellite to printing sites near National Airport in Washington and La Guardia Airport in New York. Copies of The Latest News are then taken by truck to the airport. **********Mr. Schwartz said that shuttles were mostly used by business travelers, and that advertisers were beginning to respond to a publication put directly into their hands."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/27/world/as-ukraine-loses-jews-the-jews-lose-a-tradition.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Erlanger", "pub_date": "1992-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1245, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "As Ukraine Loses Jews, the Jews Lose a Tradition", "print_headline": "As Ukraine Loses Jews, the Jews Lose a Tradition", "body_text": " **********Even as official and public attitudes toward Jews are improving in Ukraine, a long and sometimes poignant Jewish cultural history is beginning to disappear, Jewish leaders say. **********The culprit is not discrimination so much as freedom: the right of Jews to emigrate, which is leaving behind an older, assimilated community. **********Assimilation into majority populations has vexed Jews in many other nations, including in the United States, bringing intermarriage and a loss of interest in Jewish prayer and scholarship. But it is a particularly pressing matter in countries like Ukraine, where a resurgent nationalism now and again encounters new symptoms of an old anti-Semitism. **********\"The Jews who live here, the non-assimilated, are simply dying away,\" said Aleksandr Z. Burakovsky, a writer and chairman of the Kiev Sholom Aleichem Society and editor of a new magazine called Ukraine-Israel. \"Twenty more years, and the Jews will be gone. And the most painful part is that the 1,000-year history of Jews here will also be gone.\" **********Mr. Burakovsky described the Jewish archives here, with material dating back as long as 300 years stored in decaying suitcases and boxes in damp cellars. Some material has not been touched for 70 years, he said, and as more Jews leave Ukraine, they deposit more books and papers that go unexamined and unpreserved. 'No One Cares' **********\"Today it's all dying, and no one cares, neither American Jews nor Israelis,\" said Mr. Burakovsky, an intense man. \"And Jews here can do nothing. They're paralyzed. The most they can do is be glad that people have stopped beating them. No one is beating them, but no one is helping them.\" **********Still, he said, \"it's easier to be a Jew in an independent Ukraine,\" where President Leonid M. Kravchuk has emphasized reconciliation with Jews, after years when he was the chief ideologue of a Ukrainian Communist Party that emphasized atheism. **********Aleksandr A. Shlayen, a film maker and director of the Babi Yar Center, was instrumental in the construction of a memorial at Babi Yar, on the outskirts of Kiev, where more than 200,000 people, most of them Jews, were killed in 1941 by Nazis. Official Soviet ideology forbade any reference to Babi Yar as predominantly involving Jews. Now, though, the memorial incorporates a menorah. **********Last October, in a speech on the 50th anniversary of the massacre, Mr. Kravchuk apologized to Ukraine's Jews and said that other Ukrainians must accept \"part of the blame.\"  'He Repented' **********Mr. Shlayen, who said he and Mr. Kravchuk have hated one another in the past, was surprised and appreciative. \"He repented,\" Mr. Shlayen said. \"He came to me personally and apologized. I was at a loss, frankly speaking. We aren't used to apologies.\" Mr. Kravchuk made \"a great speech at Babi Yar,\" Mr. Shlayen said, and now is an honorary member of the Babi Yar Center. **********\"The good things outweigh the bad things,\" he continued. Official attitudes toward Jews are good today, he said, but \"in reality there are many difficulties,\" including a surge of small, virulent \"fascist and anti-Semitic groups,\" some with tiny militias. These groups are not encouraged from the top, he said, and they have few adherents among Ukrainians, \"but these groups are not being curbed yet, either.\" **********Mr. Burakovsky is more optimistic. Such groups exist, he said, especially in western Ukraine. \"But I think it's just the extreme right wing,\" he said, \"and so openly pro-fascist that the Ukrainian people won't support it. It's the lumpenized part of the population,\" he said, and their fury is aimed at all \"non-Ukrainians,\" not only Jews. **********\"But it's the Ukrainians who fear these groups most, because they might disturb the process of building independence and hurt the country's reputation,\" he said. \"They react not out of love for Jews or minorities, but out of love for an independent Ukraine.\" **********The impact of 70 years of Soviet power and Nazi occupation are still being deeply felt. \"The last of the culture-bearers were executed 40 years ago,\" Mr. Burakovsky said. \"Schools, synagogues, libraries were all abolished.\" Mr. Shlayen added, \"They started to beat the Jewishness out of Jews a long time ago, under the czars.\" **********When he entered Kiev University, Mr. Shlayen said, Jews there were rare. The director of the physical-education department came to sign him up as a student. \"I said I wanted law or journalism,\" Mr. Shlayen recalled recently over coffee and cake, \"but he said, 'When we have a university named after Sholom Aleichem, then go to that.' \" **********Now, Mr. Burakovsky said, the \"elder Soviet brother that oppressed many Jews, just the first in the chain, is gone.\" He said Ukrainians \"don't have a pathological anti-Semitism,\" but were manipulated by anti-Semitism \"from above.\" **********Until Russia took over part of Poland in 1772, few Jews lived in the Russian empire, and then under strict regulation. The incorporation of the heavily Jewish areas of what had been Poland led to creation of \"Pales of Settlement\" in the Russian empire, the strictly defined Jewish districts immortalized by Sholom Aleichem in his Yiddish-language works. These Jews were mostly farmers or tradesmen who spoke Yiddish, lived in their own villages and were regularly harassed by Ukrainians.  Counting the Survivors **********It was in these areas that large-scale killing of Jews was carried out in the final years of the czars. Educated and wealthy Jews were allowed to live in cities like St. Petersburg, Moscow or Kiev, but these were the exceptions. Then the provisional Government of February 1917, which took over after Czar Nicholas II abdicated, lifted all restrictions on Jews. **********At the turn of the century, there were three million Jews in Ukraine. More than a million left after a series of the pogroms. During World War II, Mr. Burakovsky said, several hundred thousand Jews fled to Russia, where assimilation was strongly encouraged; 200,000 fought at the front against Germany; 500,000 died in Nazi camps. **********Today, accurate figures are hard to get. According to the 1989 census, there were about 100,000 people in Kiev who had \"Jew\" entered in their passports and about 70,000 in Odessa, with a total of about 450,000 in all Ukraine. Many more had been assimilated, and many have emigrated since. In the 12 months ended May 1, 1991, Mr. Shlayen said, more than 19,000 Jews emigrated from Kiev alone, generally for economic reasons. **********In Kiev, there is an official Jewish Cultural Society and one synagogue, which houses two congregations. The main Jewish organization is trying to regain an elegant, pre-Revolution synagogue, which now houses a puppet theater. **********More than half of Ukraine's Jews are older than 40, Mr. Burakovsky said. Some 57 percent of Jewish women marry non-Jews, and only 6 percent of their children accept their mother's faith. Mr. Shlayen said he thought 80 percent of Kiev's Jews \"don't feel themselves Jews in education or upbringing\"; only about 15 percent speak any Yiddish. **********\"Jews are a dying nation here,\" Mr. Shlayen said. \"The young ones emigrate; the old ones are tired, and they will go only if a new Hitler should appear.\" **********Mr. Burakovsky described business trips to Chelyabinsk, in Russia, where many Ukrainian Jews fled the Nazis: \"I see young men with Jewish features, and I ask them, and their names are Ivanov and Petrov, good Russian names. And I ask them about their parents and grandparents, and they're all Ukrainian.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/12/world/with-rabin-beside-him-bush-praises-the-israelis.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Rosenthal", "pub_date": "1992-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 866, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "With Rabin Beside Him, Bush Praises the Israelis", "print_headline": "With Rabin Beside Him, Bush Praises the Israelis", "body_text": " **********After several years of cool relations between the Bush Administration and Israel, President Bush hailed Israel today as a \"strategic partner\" of the United States, as he and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin announced their agreement on a much-delayed package of $10 billion in loan guarantees. **********With Mr. Rabin beside him outside the Bush home in Kennebunkport, Me., the President said they had agreed on the basic principles of the loan program, which would run five years. **********He asked for swift action on the guarantees, which he had held up for more than a year because Mr. Rabin's predecessor, Yitzhak Shamir, had refused to impose a freeze on construction of settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. **********Then, returning to Washington, Mr. Bush told Congressional leaders that he would send them loan-guarantee legislation within two days.

This could be as low as $50 million or as high as $1.9 billion. **********The appearance by the two leaders this morning ended a 24-hour stay at the President's home, which was intended to signal an end to the tensions in the American-Israeli relationship, and to present a warm, personal relationship in contrast to the tension between Mr. Bush and Mr. Shamir. **********\"It was a true pleasure for Barbara and me to spend this time\" with the Prime Minister and Mrs. Rabin, Mr. Bush said. He added, \"We could not be happier than to have them visit us here at Kennebunkport, this very special place for me and my family.\" **********He added, \"The meetings were also significant for the tone of the discussions. Our time together can best be described as a consultation between close friends and strategic partners.\" **********Although Mr. Bush's advisers were hoping that the accord on loan guarantees and the improvement in relations would calm election-year criticism of Mr. Bush's policies on Israel, the President said he had no political motivation in reaching his decision. **********\"We're not talking here about domestic United States politics, nor are we talking about domestic Israeli politics,\" he said. \"We're talking about principle, about doing what is right.\" **********But Mr. Bush acknowledged that it \"isn't easy\" to separate his actions from the campaign and added, \"I'm going to finesse that.\" **********Offering the kind of reassuring language that American Jewish groups have complained was missing from his comments on Israel over the last three and a half years, the President spoke several times of Israel's \"strategic importance\" to the United States, signaled that he was ready to move forward with military cooperation between the two countries, and reaffirmed Washington's longstanding policy of assuring that Israel has a \"qualitative military edge\" over its Arab neighbors. Ironing Out Semantics **********Before agreeing to support the loan guarantees, American officials said Mr. Bush had sought a personal explanation from Mr. Rabin about the distinction he was drawing between construction of \"political\" settlements and those his Government considers \"security\" settlements. The leaders gave no elaboration on this distinction. **********Asked today if he agreed with Mr. Rabin's definitions, Mr. Bush said: \"We understand the position and all I will say is that I salute this change. We salute what the Prime Minister is trying to do. We understand his position. He understands our position. And obviously, we would not be going forward with this loan guarantee if we did not salute the change.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/17/business/business-people-a-departure-at-salomon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 216, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Departure At Salomon", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; A Departure At Salomon", "body_text": " **********Thomas H.

And a group of chemicals seen as an interim replacement -- hydrochlorofluorocarbons -- will ultimately be banned because they, too, harm the ozone. **********Hence, industrial engineers are pursuing other means of cooling and refrigeration. Although such exotic approaches as cooling by sound waves are being explored, most of the near-term activity involves alternatives that already have practical, though specialized, applications. **********A conventional refrigerator works by alternately compressing and expanding a fluid -- a CFC in most current models -- that tends to boil at a relatively low temperature. Each time the fluid changes from the liquid to a vapor, heat is absorbed. When it goes from vapor to liquid, heat is given off. Through this cycle, heat is drawn from the food-storage compartment and radiated into the room through the condenser coils on the back of the refrigerator. (An air-conditioner cools a room in a similar manner, except that the heat is expelled from the building.) **********The heart of the system is the compressor, which rapidly compresses the vapor that has removed heat from the refrigerator's interior. This raises both its pressure and temperature -- to the point where it is hotter than the surrounding air. **********This heated substance is pumped through condenser coils, where it gives up both the heat of compression and the heat removed from the interior and changes back to the liquid state. Then the pressure is removed as the refrigerant passes through an expansion valve and the liquid expands to the gaseous, heat-absorbing phase as the cycle is repeated. **********But running the compressor consumes a lot of energy. An alternative technology, backed by the natural gas industry, eliminates the compressor. After the refrigerant has done its cooling job -- regular water is often used as the refrigerant in such systems -- it is absorbed by another fluid, like lithium bromide, quickly dissipating the accumulated heat. A modest pump is enough to keep the process going.  The mixed liquids are sent to a boiler where the more volatile refrigerant is boiled off into a gaseous form that is sent to the condenser to be cooled and returned to the liquid-refrigerant state. The absorbent lithium bromide, meanwhile, never leaves the liquid state as it is continuously recycled through the system. Favored by Gas Suppliers **********These absorbent-type chillers are frequently used in air-conditioning equipment in commercial buildings. Since the refrigerant does not need to reach subfreezing temperatures, water can often be used, easing environmental concerns. And gas suppliers are fond of the systems because the boilers give them an opportunity to sell gas during the cooling season as well as the heating season -- even though burning gas to cool the air seems implausible at first blush. **********Absorption chillers are widely used in Japan, because of policies that discourage additional use of electric power, according to officials of the Gas Research Institute, a cooperative research organization supported by the United States gas industry. Absorption units based on Japanese designs are marketed by all four major American manufacturers of chillers: Carrier; Snyder General; Trane Thermal and York International.  Another tack, a solid-state approach to cooling, is being taken by the Thermo Electron Technologies Corporation of Waltham, Mass. This is based on the phenomenon of thermocouples, devices in which two semiconducting materials are joined by electrical circuitry. **********Through two principles of electronics, if one end of the thermocouple is chilled and other other heated, a voltage is generated. Conversely, if a charge is applied, the material grows either hotter or colder, depending on the direction of the current. **********Thermo Electron has used thermocouples to provide power in space, taking advantage of the extreme temperature difference between the side of an object facing the sun and the part in shadow. **********Now thermocouple manufacturers are looking at consumer markets. One application is a picnic cooler with thermocouples and a small fan to circulate cooled air. The device plugs into a car's cigarette lighter. **********John S. Beaty, a senior program manager for Thermo Electron, said the company was working on a prototype of an air-conditioner that would be no more than 2 inches thick, with the surface area depending on the size of the room; the prototype is 18 inches long and 12 inches wide. It is intended to be mounted on a wall or in front of a window. Less Power Is Needed **********One problem had been that the best thermocoupling materials, like bismuth telluride and lead telluride, are brittle and can be damaged by physical abuse. But Thermo Electron engineers have found ways to encapsulate them so thay can be banged around and still function. **********Another consideration is power consumption. Since thermocouple air-conditioners are only 10 to 15 percent efficient at using electricity, compared with 25 to 30 percent for compressor-based units, power use is likely to be higher. But they would contain no CFC's and, as solid-state devices, would probably last longer than conventional air-conditioners. **********Besides, these devices could do more than cool a room on a hot summer day. Because the thermocouple effect is reversible, needing only the electric current to flow in the opposite direction, such a device could be used as an air-conditioner in the summer and as a heater in the winter. \"All you would have to do is set the temperature,\" Mr. Beaty said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/28/business/company-news-stock-sale-is-planned-at-domino-s.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1992-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 691, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stock Sale Is Planned At Domino's", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Stock Sale Is Planned At Domino's", "body_text": " **********Tom Monaghan, the entrepreneur who owns Domino's Pizza Inc., has decided to sell stock in his company to the public later this year, the company said today. **********Accordingly, Mr. Monaghan, who now serves as Domino's president, is cleaning up Domino's balance sheet to make the company more attractive to investors by writing off bad loans and selling Domino's assets not related to pizza. **********Mr. Monaghan also plans to sell the Detroit Tigers baseball team, which he owns separately from Domino's. **********While Mr. Monaghan, who owns 98 percent of Domino's, initially expects to retain majority ownership and remain as president, the offering could make the pizza chain one of the largest publicly owned fast-food operations in the nation, smaller than McDonald's but in the same league with Wendy's in terms of capitalization, said John McDevitt, the chief financial officer of Domino's, which is based in Ann Arbor, Mich. **********The decision to take Domino's public and sell the baseball team was motivated by \"estate planning considerations,\" said Mike Jenkins, a Domino's spokesman. Mr. Monaghan, who declined to be interviewed, is married, has four daughters and is 54 years old. Two years ago, he put Domino's up for sale for $1.2 billion but got no takers. **********Goldman, Sachs & Company, Domino's investment bank, is advising Mr. Monaghan on the sale of his stock. Mr. McDevitt said that Goldman, Sachs and the NBD Corporation, which owns the holding company for Detroit's biggest commercial bank, would handle the sale of the Tigers. **********Among those who have said they are interested in buying the team are Edsel Ford 2d, a Ford Motor Company executive and son of the late Henry Ford 2d; Keith E. Crain of Crain Communications Inc., a publishing company that owns Advertising Age, Automotive News and business weeklies in several cities, and Joel Ferguson, a real estate developer and businessman in Lansing, Mich. **********All three men have said separately that they are interested in buying the team, but Mr. Ford and Mr. Crain did not return telephone calls today; Mr. Ferguson could not be reached. Favorable Environment **********Analysts say the market environment for restaurant stocks was favorable. Shares in restaurant companies are generally performing well, and chains that offer low-priced, good- value meals are relatively recession-proof, one analyst said. **********Still, many questions remain about Domino's. Michael G. Mueller, a restaurant analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said he would be curious to know Domino's strategy for long-term growth in the intensely competitive pizza business. More fast-food companies are offering pizza, including McDonald's in many of its outlets, and fancy pizza is also growing in popularity, he said. **********\"There's a pretty big proliferaiton of higher-quality pizza operators,\" Mr. Mueller said. **********Mr. Jenkins said \"a lot of people have been saying we must be in some kind of financial trouble\" to consider selling stock. \"But nothing could be further from the truth,\" he said.  Loss Is Expected **********Because of the write-off of $41 million of bad debt, which has been carried on Domino's books for several years, the company expects to post a $48 million pretax loss on revenue of $1.7 billion for 1991. On an operating basis, however, Domino's is profitable, Mr. Jenkins said. **********\"We sold 12 million more pizzas last year than in 1990, but there was a lot of discounting,\" he said, adding that about half the pizzas sold last year were discounted. **********Domino's has more serious competition now in the pizza delivery business, the niche where it dominates the national market. Pizza Hut, a unit of Pepsico Inc. that mainly operates restaurants, last year branched into the delivery business. **********With many customers seeming to prefer Pizza Hut's recipe, Domino's in recent months has been putting more cheese and more toppings on its pizzas and heavily promoting its new recipe. **********\"Our market tests show that consumers preferred our hand-tossed pizza to their hand-tossed,\" Mr. Jenkins said, adding that Domino's product costs slightly less. Domino's contends that Pizza Hut has not gained market share despite spending aggressively to expand home delivery."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/14/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-398392.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Bridgestone Tire, Nashville, to TBWA Advertising Inc., New York, for image advertising.

But these officials emphasize that any destruction program that Baghdad follows must be a complete one and acceptable to the special commission. **********A 35-member team of United Nations ballistic missile experts is in Baghdad waiting to receive the Iraqi plan next week. If President Saddam Hussein's Government meets the deadline and produces an acceptable schedule of arms destruction, the team will stay on to oversee the work, officials say. **********Otherwise it plans to leave, raising the possibility the United States and its allies might opt for a military strike to destroy the nuclear-related sites. New Resolution **********It is unclear whether the allies, for political reasons, would seek a new Security Council endorsement of such military action or whether they would operate on the basis that since Iraq refuses to comply with the cease-fire terms, that truce is no longer in effect and they are free to attack again. **********The United States already has a bomber force in Saudi Arabia, as well as planes aboard a carrier in the Persian Gulf. In addition, B-52 bombers have recently arrived in Britain on what are described as exercises. **********In Washington today, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney insisted that the Bush Administration was still committed to using United Nations diplomacy rather than force to eliminate the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. But Mr. Cheney did not rule out the use of force. **********The Security Council has warned Iraq four times since the end of the gulf war a year ago that it is violating the truce terms and that it would face serious consequences unless it complied with them. **********Last week President Bush said he would \"contemplate all alternatives\" if Mr. Hussein did not bow to United Nations pressure. The British Prime Minister, John Major, has said he would back a military strike. **********The Council, after its latest warning to Baghdad, summoned Mr. Aziz and his delegation for a series of meetings. There, members called for full and immediate compliance with their orders and said they would not negotiate these. **********Iraq has been ordered to turn over full details of its banned weapons-development programs including remaining nuclear installations, to cooperate with plans to monitor its arms industry to insure that no new projects are begun, and to destroy the buildings and equipment designated by the special commission. Pressure on Libya, Too **********Big-power pressure at the United Nations is not limited to Iraq. The United States, Britain and France have circulated the draft of a resolution to Security Council members that would impose an array of new sanctions on Libya unless it turned over intelligence agents they have accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, and a U.T.A. flight over sub-Saharan Africa, with a combined loss of 440 people. **********The resolution, which the Council is expected to approve in the next few days, severs all airline links with Libya, bans the sale of aircraft, spare parts and maintainance services as well as all military deliveries, and requires governments to reduce the size of Libyan diplomatic missions and restrict the movement of Libyan envoys in their countries. **********In January, the Council ordered Libya to hand over two men accused in the destruction of Pan Am 103 for trial in Britain or the United States and to allow a French magistrate to question those accused of blowing up the U.T.A. plane. **********But so far Libya has refused, but has offered to put them on trial and has asked the accusing Western Governments to provide evidence against them. Libyan Expresses Outrage **********In a news conference this afternoon at the United Nations, the Libyan representative condemned the proposed resolution. **********The envoy, Ali el-Houderi said: \"This draft resolution does not reflect the will of the entire Security Council, but only the wishes of the three co-sponsor countries,\" referring to the United States, Britain and France.  \"Any pressure that might be applied against member countries of the Security Council to adopt this draft resolution will be considered as coercion and domination in its worst and most blatant form.\" **********He said the resolution \"gets close to declaring war by using the Security Council.\" **********The United Nations plans in the next few days to test Iraq's willingness to accept the destruction of most of its Al Atheer nuclear-weapons plant south of Baghdad. The special commission and the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations specialized agency, will send the Iraqis a list of the installations they want eliminated. **********Al Atheer was undamaged in the gulf war because the allies did not realize at the time that it was where Iraq planned to build and test a bomb. At last week's Security Council meeting with Mr. Aziz, the United States called for the plant's destruction. **********Mr. Aziz, officials say, took a more flexible approach with Mr. Ekeus on two other issues where it appeared to be heading toward a fresh confrontation with the Security Council. **********The Iraqis gave Mr. Ekeus an Arabic document that they say is the list of military industries requested by the special commission to monitor these factories, insuring that they are not used to make weapons of mass destruction. But it will take about two weeks before the document is translated into English and the commission can assess its value. Some Give and Take **********The Iraqis also said they were prepared to give the commission a requested list of the materials they have imported in their push to build nuclear, chemical and biological arsenals. **********But the Iraqis appeared unwilling to provide names of the companies that supplied these goods, as the commission also wants. And Mr. Aziz repeated that his Government does not accept Security Council Resolution 715, which provides for this long-term montitoring, calling this a breach of its sovereignty."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/05/business/wells-fargo-prices-floating-rate-notes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wells Fargo Prices Floating-Rate Notes", "print_headline": "Wells Fargo Prices Floating-Rate Notes", "body_text": " **********Wells Fargo & Company yesterday priced $150 million of floating-rate notes due 1994 through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers. **********The two-year floating-rate notes were priced at 100 to float quarterly at a full percentage point above the three-month London interbank offered rate, the basic short-term interest rate in the Eurodollar market and the rate to which many Eurodollar loans and deposits are tied.

The Japanese have saved us from ourselves. **********The trip was an attempt to deal with our trade deficit with Japan, half of which comes from trade in cars and car parts. Japan did agree to raise imports of those and other items, but to the chagrin of auto executives and Bush Administration officials, Tokyo evaded American demands for import targets on what -- and how much -- it would buy. **********And that's a good thing. The trip was a success for the very reasons it has been labeled a failure -- namely, the lack of import targets. Targets would give producers a guaranteed market, which would hurt their competitive abilities, damaging them in the long run. **********Two fundamental questions remain: Why Japan imports some $40 billion less than it exports to the United States and why there is not a corresponding surplus in American exports elsewhere. **********If, as many economists believe, America's trade deficit is linked to its budget deficit, adjusting the trade flow will not affect the trade deficit. When the budget deficit rises, Washington borrows, American interest rates rise, yield-sensitive capital flows in from abroad and the dollar appreciates, making our exports pricey and our imports cheap. The way to fight the trade deficit, then, is to balance the budget. **********But the Administration has adopted a different strategy to deal with the trade deficit with Japan. It wants Japan to open its markets and make commitments to raise imports from the United States; it wants to force the dollar to depreciate vis-a-vis the yen to make American products cheaper in Japan. This will not work. Opening Japanese markets might help in the long run but commitments to raise imports will hurt us. And trying to force the dollar to depreciate works against foreign-exchange market forces. **********Two things affect America's trade deficit: lack of access to Japanese markets and the fact that American producers can't seem to make products that the Japanese want, or at least make them at competitive prices. **********Government efforts to identify and seek reforms in practices and regulations that block access to Japanese markets are a step in the right direction. And new Japanese rulings on some restrictive laws are allowing more retailers, including Toys 'R' Us, into Japan. But such barriers have to be individually identified before they can be targeted by trade talks, so this will help only over time. **********The inadequacy of American producers is a bigger problem now. And the worst offender is the auto industry. **********Its export performance to Japan has been dismal, especially in light of rising exports from Europe. Setting auto import targets for the Japanese is shortsighted -- and would be hard to implement. It is easier to restrict imports than to mandate increases in them. **********Even if targets could bolster export performance, that would just allow Detroit to avoid competitive reality, which could lead to future interventionist demands. We should be glad Detroit didn't get what it wanted in Tokyo.

But while sales of oil and electric furnaces have fallen in the last three years, sales of gas furnaces are edging back up. **********Furnaces that burn natural gas to produce hot air are far and away the nation's largest source of residential heating. Industry experts say that the current sales rebound is partly because natural gas utilities have become more aggressive in extending their pipelines -- and marketing muscle -- into the Northeast, where oil heat still predominates. **********In any case, 2.1 million gas furnaces are expected to be shipped nationally this year, up from 2.06 million last year and 1.95 million in 1990, said Johnny Johnson, director of residential heating products at the Carrier Corporation's Indianapolis office. Carrier, a unit of United Technologies of Hartford, is one of the nation's largest sellers of heating and air-conditioning systems. **********This year, new sales of all furnaces have been aided a bit by a new Federal law that requires builders to install more fuel-efficient furnaces in new homes and apartments. **********\"The heating industry is moving in the direction of making products as small as we can make them and more efficient to lower monthly operating costs,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"Most importantly we're trying to make products more environmentally correct.\" Aging Systems  Choosing a Fuel And Delivery Mode **********Home heating systems start with a fuel source, usually gas, electric or oil. The fuel then heats either a hot-air furnace, or a hot-water boiler. Depending on the system, hot air flows through ducts, or hot water or steam flows through pipes and radiators. **********Electric baseboard heating systems, with no furnace or boiler, work more like a toaster oven, by heating coils embedded along the bottoms of walls. **********Despite the poor economy, companies like Carrier; York International, in York, Pa., and the Burnham Corporation, in Lancaster, Pa., have not suffered as much as they might have, heating experts say. All are among the biggest sellers of furnaces or boilers. **********Sales have been helped by homeowners and landlords replacing aging heating systems with more energy-efficient ones. Also, many consumers, staying put during the recession, have been upgrading their systems as part of upgrading their homes. **********For some affluent people who are building new homes, the heating system of choice is hydronic radiant floor heating, in which hot water is circulated through a maze of polyethylene pipes beneath floors. **********Because of the work involved in snaking coils of flexible pipe throughout a house, a radiant system is very expensive to install. But it is inexpensive to run, because it operates at much lower water temperatures than other systems. **********Only about 7 percent of new homes in the United States have the system, but the market for radiant heat has grown nearly 30 percent yearly over the last six years. **********Hot-air systems and electric baseboard heating are the cheapest for builders to install, and so continue to be standard in many new homes and condominiums. But monthly fuel charges and maintenance costs are often high. **********\"The builders don't really care about the monthly cost,\" said John Kaussner, president of the Hydronics Institute, in Berkeley Heights, N.J., a manufacturers' trade association. \"They're interested in building homes and selling them quickly for a profit.\" **********Decades ago, electric heat was cheap. But as the cost has risen, electric systems have become prohibitively expensive, especially in the colder climates. **********Heat pumps are largely used in the South.  Essentially, they are central air-conditioners with a reversing valve that can provide a limited amount of heat from the outside air in mild winters. **********York International says sales of residential heat pumps are expected to fall to 550,000 units this year, from 558,000 units in 1991. **********Forced hot-air systems use the same ducts as the central air-conditioning. But the heating system tends to leave cold spots in rooms and circulates dust throughout the house. The Changing Law  More Efficiency Is Now Mandated **********A big reason that gas furnace sales have risen and that others have fallen only moderately is the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, which took effect on Jan. 1. **********The law, which also applies to air-conditioners, heat pumps and other appliances, mandates that furnaces bought after that date have an annual fuel utilization efficiency of at least 78 percent. Older furnaces often operate at 50 percent or less efficiency, experts say, meaning that half the oil or gas they burn does not directly heat the house. **********The more efficient furnaces can cost $1,000 to $3,000, depending on size. **********\"Many people are refinancing and upgrading their houses, especially to make their houses more fuel efficient so that their monthly payments will be down,\" said Mr. Johnson of Carrier. **********Boilers can last 20 or 30 years, compared with 15 years or so for furnaces. Executives at Burnham, a leading boiler maker, said that industrywide boiler sales this year should be 325,000 units (62 percent gas and 38 percent oil). That would be up from 296,000 last year (60 percent gas and 40 percent oil). **********Robert L. Coons, vice president for marketing at Burnham, said 80 percent of boiler sales were to replace existing units at a cost of about $3,200 for a 4,000-square-foot home. **********\"One of the trends that is helping the boiler market grow is radiant heat,\" he added, because of switching from furnaces or electric heat to boiler-powered radiant systems. Radiant Heat  Installation Versus Monthly Expenses **********Randy Woodworth, an independent contractor and plumber in Hunter, N.Y., has just built a 4,000-square-foot house in the mountains around a hydronic radiant floor heating system. He designed the system with engineers from Wirsbo, a supplier of radiant floor heating systems based in Apple Valley, Minn. Wirsbo's parent company, the Uponor Group, is based in Espoo, Finland, near Helsinki. **********He said that the radiant system for the three-bedroom house cost about $16,000 to $19,000 to install. But the heating bill is about $80 a month. That compares with $600 to $800 a month in the winter for electric systems, and $400 a month for a conventional oil-fired hot-air or hot water system. **********Besides the initial cost, radiant systems have another potentially big drawback. Improperly installed, the pipes can crack or leak underneath the floor, turning into a homeowner's nightmare. **********Joel Hollenberg, a professor of mechanical engineering at Cooper Union in Manhattan, says neither gas nor oil will be the choice of the next generation. He thinks it will be hydrogen. \"Hydrogen can be burned with no pollution and I see this as the fuel of the future,\" he said. DAVIDS, LOSING TO GAS GOLIATHS **********Nearly everywhere in the United States, except in parts of the Northeast where gas pipelines are not yet common, natural gas is the fuel of choice for home heating systems. **********And even in the Northeast, gas companies have made inroads by marketing their product as a steady provider of clean, even heat. They also assert that oil is dirty and unhealthy to live with. **********For their part, oil suppliers strongly hint that gas can blow up your house. At least that is part of their counter-advertising. They assert that you don't save money by switching to gas. And they make much of the fact that to get service for gas systems, homeowners have to make a dreaded call: to a plumber. **********Gas companies are public utilities with multimillion-dollar budgets. Heating oil companies, by contrast, are mostly small, independently owned businesses. **********\"It's an impossible battle to compete with gas companies,\" said Cliff Sullivan, owner of the Sullivan Fuel Company in Salem, N.H., which pumps about 1.5 million gallons of fuel oil a year, for which it currently charges 82.9 cents a gallon. \"Every time you look there's another gas advertisement.\" **********His company, which has been in the Sullivan family for three generations, has seen sales decline since the recent installation of natural gas lines in the area. **********\"Gas is becoming more popular because people perceive it as a better way,\" said Mr. Sullivan. Despite gas-company ads that depict oil as a dirty fuel, he insisted that oil was no worse for the environment than gas. **********To combat gas utilities' marketing campaigns, independent oil companies have joined forces in groups like the New York-area Metropolitan Energy Council, to pool money to pay for better advertising. **********A main point of the gas industry ads is that natural gas is cheap, plentiful and not subject to Middle East wars or politics. But people who follow oil prices say they can be slightly cheaper than gas. **********\"The price of oil is staying about where it is,\" said Paul Geiger, editor of Fueloil and Oil Heat, in Fairfield, N.J., a trade magazine."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/18/world/east-jerusalem-funeral-doubles-as-arab-protest.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1992-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 731, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "East Jerusalem Funeral Doubles as Arab Protest", "print_headline": "East Jerusalem Funeral Doubles as Arab Protest", "body_text": " **********Outlawed Palestinian flags were flown and nationalist slogans chanted as several thousand Palestinians marched through a ramshackle neighborhood of East Jerusalem today in a funeral procession that doubled as an anti-Israel protest. **********It was one of the larger demonstrations of its kind in Jerusalem in years, involving several Palestinian factions that are normally rivals, and it reflected a recent revival of the anti-Israel uprising that had been dormant for many months. **********Israeli police officers were out in force in East Jerusalem, but they stayed well away from the funeral march, for two cousins, as it wound along the hilly streets of Jabel Mukaber, a hardscrabble district where donkeys are as much a means of transportation as cars. It was clear that the Israeli authorities and the Palestinian leadership wanted to avert a serious clash that could unhinge the next round of Middle East peace talks, scheduled to begin in Washington on Wednesday. Hunger Strike by Prisoners **********Nonetheless, tensions were high, as they have been for the last three weeks as the result of a hunger strike by Arab prisoners, which before ending this week managed to galvanize Palestinian public opinion and breathe fresh life into the uprising, or intifada. **********While the situation is a far cry from the huge protests that marked the revolt in its early days four or five years ago, there has been a sudden surge of violence, with at least a dozen Palestinians killed by Israeli gunfire this month and three Israelis killed by Arabs in the last week, including a man who died tonight in a when a van was firebombed in the West Bank. **********Today, three Palestinians were found shot to death in a village near Nablus in the northern West Bank, all reportedly killed by the militant Black Panther group for suspected collaboration with the Israeli military occupation. **********The funeral today was for two cousins from Jabel Mukaber: Hussein Obeidat, 26 years old, a prisoner who died on Wednesday after ending his hunger strike, and Mustafa Obeidat, 23, who was shot a week ago by an Israeli policeman during a march supporting the striking inmates. **********Mustafa Obeidat died in a hospital this morning, the news reaching his family as it gathered for Hussein Obeidat's burial. His body was quickly brought to the village, and the demonstration was turned into a double funeral, a procession led by masked young men representing various factions that claimed each of the cousins as their own \"martyr.\" **********Some Palestinians have asserted that Hussein Obeidat died as a result of inadequate medical attention during the prison hunger strike. **********But on Friday an Israeli pathologist said after performing an autopsy that the death was caused by a heart infection having nothing to do with the prison protest. There was no sign of malnutrition, he said, and according to the Israeli Prison Authority, the Obeidat family has a history of heart trouble. **********The thousands of funeral marchers included representatives of the left-wing Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Hamas movement of Islamic fundamentalists. **********\"Rest, martyrs, rest, we will continue the struggle,\" they chanted, waving outlawed Palestinian flags and copies of the Koran as they climbed a rocky slope to the neighborhood cemetery. Threat to Mideast Talks **********An hour later, at Hussein Obeidat's grave, a speaker told the gathered crowd, \"We renew the promise to continue to escalate the intifada until we achieve the dream of having an independent state.\" **********Many of those present were from groups opposed to Palestinians' negotiating peace with Israel. **********For now, those supporting the talks have the upper hand. But their position is not solid, and within the Palestinian delegation to the Washington round there was concern that the prison strike, if pushed too far, could have led to deaths that would have given them no choice but to stay home. For a while, Hussein Obeidat's death looked as if it might have had that result, but the threat rapidly disappeared. **********In Tunis on Friday night, the Palestine Liberation Organization formally endorsed the next Washington meeting. But P.L.O. leaders, acknowledging the strength of the so-called rejectionists, warned that the peace talks would collapse unless Israel agreed that United Nations land-for-peace resolutions applied to the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/31/business/market-place-doubts-trail-sun-microsystems.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1992-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 844, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Doubts Trail Sun Microsystems", "print_headline": "Market Place; Doubts Trail Sun Microsystems", "body_text": " **********Sun Microsystems, the enfant terrible of the computer industry, turns 10 years old next month. Throughout its short life people have always predicted that the fast-growing company, whose young executives frequently thumb their noses at older, stodgier computer companies, would stumble. But except for one quarterly loss in 1989, Sun has kept on growing and is now approaching $4 billion in annual revenue. **********But questions are again being raised about whether Sun can keep its perch atop the intensely competitive market for work stations, desktop computers that generally offer more power than personal computers. Work stations are used by engineers, researchers and scientists who need to manipulate large amounts of data and numbers.  Profits Rise but Stock Falls **********The questions remained even after Sun this week defied the recession by reporting earnings and revenue growth of 21 percent in the fourth quarter. In fact, on Wednesday, the day after the announcement, the company's stock, traded over the counter, plunged $4, to $29.875 **********The concern about Sun is based on intensifying competition from the Hewlett-Packard Company, the International Business Machines Corporation and the Digital Equipment Corporation. Hewlett-Packard in particular has leapfrogged Sun is the amount of computer power it offers for a given price, analysts say. And all three rivals have recently introduced machines priced at under $10,000, the segment of the market dominated by Sun. **********\"At the desktop level the company faces increasingly significant challenges,\" said David R. Korus, analyst with Kidder Peabody & Company, who believes Sun's stock will underperform the market. He said that in addition to competition from its traditional work station rivals, Sun would face increasing competition from personal computers based on Intel 's powerful 486 microprocessor. **********On top of that is the poor economy and the fact that while several significant new products Sun is expected to announce later this year could help restore the company's competitiveness in terms of machine speed, there have been recurring rumors that the machines will be late. **********Even so, many analysts still favor the company and recommend its stock. One reason is simply that the company has survived so many other threats that were supposed to blow it out of the water. These included the acquisition of Sun's old rival, Apollo, by Hewlett-Packard, the entrance of I.B.M. into the work station business, and the formation of a consortium by Compaq, Digital and the Microsoft Corporation. **********Robert G. Herwick of Hambrecht & Quist said that even if the speed of Sun's computers lagged behind some competitors, \"they really do have strong momentum.\" **********Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said that Sun's growth in the quarter that ended in December indicated that it was not losing many customers to Hewlett-Packard or I.B.M. Big customers apparently did not put off purchases of Sun machines to wait for new offerings from Sun's two rivals. While both those rivals announced new machines only recently, big customers generally are told in advance. **********\"The customers are simply not reacting and pulling back orders from Sun,\" she said. She also said the price of Sun's stock relative to earnings was relatively low, even though it has risen from the low 20's in the last two months. **********Also in Sun's favor, some industry experts say, is that the work station market is broadening beyond engineers and computer programmers to banks, brokerages and other commercial customers, providing new sales opportunities. Moreover, some analysts say, there is more software available for Sun's machines than for those of the company's rivals. **********But momentum will carry Sun only so long if its machines are uncompetitive. And that is why the eyes of Wall Street are focused on Viking, a new version of Sun's Sparc microprocesor that will be the core of Sun's next line of computers. **********The Viking chip, which will be made by Texas Instruments, is expected to be a monster, with more than three million transistors and able to operate at blazing speeds. **********Sun is expected to introduce its first machines based on the chips around the middle of the year. The products are likely to be high-end desktop machines and servers, which are even more powerful machines that provide central storage for groups of work stations. Sun is also expected to introduce low-end products later this year, though not based on Viking. **********But the Viking project has experienced delays and rumors are still swirling that Texas Instruments is having trouble making the extraordinarily complex chip. **********\"They're having some degree of trouble getting it into a production- ready state,\" said Michael Slater, editor of the Microprocessor Report, a newsletter that focuses on such chips.  However, he said, such problems are to be expected with any new chip and that it is hard to find out how serious the problems are. **********Tom Meredith, Sun's treasurer, said such rumors were unfounded and that the company was pleased with the progress on the Viking project. **********In the next few months, Sun's stock will fluctuate with rumors or information about the progress of Viking.  \"Sun has invested about $150 million into Viking,\" said Ms. Conigliaro of Prudential. \"They are deadly serious about the importance of Viking.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/17/business/world-markets-tough-sledding-for-canada-s-banks.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1992-05-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 940, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Markets; Tough Sledding for Canada's Banks", "print_headline": "World Markets; Tough Sledding for Canada's Banks", "body_text": " **********Although Olympia & York Developments has finally let the other shoe drop by filing for bankruptcy, little has changed in the outlook for Canadian banks and investors who own their stock. The banks are still in trouble because Olympia & York's difficulties are only one of many problems besieging Canada's six major banks. **********The banks also face real estate problems in other areas that, in some cases, are just as serious as the difficulties Olympia & York faces. And the banks' earnings outlook, especially for next year, has been seriously undercut by an economy that has refused to snap back from its long recession. **********\"The economy has sputtered and is sitting on the bottom,\" said Roy Palmer, bank analyst at Bunting Warburg in Montreal. \"So that took away some of the hopes for the banks.\" **********Alain Tuchmaier, bank analyst at McLean McCarthy in Toronto, added, \"I have been saying all along that the Olympia & York situation is just the most visible example of a systematic problem in the area of commercial real estate.\" **********The one thing that the bankruptcy filing is likely to do is to force the relatively secretive Canadian banks to reveal a lot more about their exposure to bad loans and the losses they may face when they begin reporting their second quarter earnings at the end of this month. **********The chief financial officer of one of the six banks, who spoke on the condition that he not be named, phrased the issue delicately. \"In making public their second quarter results, banks will have to review their position versus Olympia & York,\" he said. **********This is something the banks have not done yet, leaving analysts to estimate their exposure and to sift for clues to their reserves against these loans and the potential losses. According to estimates from several analysts, the six major banks have about $2.5 billion exposed in loans to Olympia & York. **********The two banks at the greatest risk to real estate problems, according to Mr. Tuchmaier, are the National Bank of Canada and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Based on Mr. Palmer's estimates, Bank of Commerce, with $830 million in exposure, has twice the exposure of National Bank, with $375 million. **********Yet, National has a similar risk profile because it has other loans that are concentrated among smaller private real estate developers in Ontario and Quebec, Mr. Tuchmaier said. Both banks' stock performance has reflected these assessments. Since their 52-week high, National's stock is down 32 percent and Commerce's, 23.6 percent. **********At the other end of the risk spectrum, according to Mr. Tuchmaier, is the Bank of Montreal. It has about $290 million in exposure to Olympia & York but very little exposure elsewhere. Toronto Dominon bank is a little up the risk scale from Bank of Montreal, even though it has no exposure to Olympia & York. Mr. Tuchmaier said he believed that at one point Toronto Dominion led a syndicated loan for Olympia & York, but then had the foresight to sell the loans. **********Again, the stock price performance has reflected the banks' individual situations. Toronto Dominion stock is 14.6 percent off its 52-week high, but it has risen 2.3 percent since March 20, the Friday before Olympia & York made public its problems that eventually led to the filing for bankruptcy protection. Bank of Montreal, on the other hand, is down only 9.5 percent from its 52-week high, but unchanged since March 20. **********The Bank of Nova Scotia is next up the risk scale from Toronto Dominion, and the Royal Bank of Canada is even higher. The Royal Bank of Canada has a $625 million exposure to Olympia & York compared with $415 million for the Bank of Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia's stock is off 17.6 percent since its 52-week high and Royal is off 18.5 percent. **********Mr. Tuchmaier estimates that the existence of additional real estate problems means that bank stocks still have another 10 to 15 percent to fall before they are fairly valued again. Mr. Palmer and a third analyst, who spoke on the condition that he not be named, also expect more volatility in bank stock prices. They feel they could fall further, especially as the restructuring of Olympia & York under court guidance unfolds. **********Still, they aren't so glum that they think the banks face a severe crisis. They cite several reasons for this optimism. **********The analyst who asked not to be identified argued that of the $2.5 billion exposure to Olympia & York among the five banks with exposure, about $835 million will have to be written off. But he said that total earnings before loan losses and taxes in 1991 were $7.5 billion. \"A billion dollars is a lot of money but that does not come close to sinking the ship,\" he said. **********Mr. Palmer, in a separate analysis, tried to calculate the potential loss relative to quarterly earnings. Based on the first quarter of the 1992 fiscal year, he said the Bank of Montreal would take 1.3 quarters to cover its exposure; Bank of Nova Scotia 1.3 quarters, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 2.8 quarters, National Bank of Canada 6.3 quarters and Royal Bank of Canada, 1.9 quarters. **********Nevertheless, figuring out what happens from here on out will be tricky. \"So much of what Olympia & York does is not known to the public,\" said Eric Sprott, president of Sprott Securities in Toronto. \"And that is what keeps pepple from commenting.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/26/business/the-executive-life-a-place-that-scorns-synergy-and-simpsons.html": {"writer_name": "Mary Billard", "pub_date": "1992-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 946, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Executive Life; A Place That Scorns Synergy and Simpsons", "print_headline": "The Executive Life; A Place That Scorns Synergy and Simpsons", "body_text": " **********There are literary agents and there are secret agents -- and sometimes there is even a literary secret agent like the one Daniel Edelman met during his first days in London as the latest American to take charge of the venerable British literary agency Curtis Brown. Or at least that's how Mr. Edelman now sees it. **********The senior Curtis Brown staffer who took him to lunch shortly after he was recruited from New York two years ago filled him with tales of subterranean alliances, hidden motivations and personal agendas, information the \"mole\" obviously thought would be valuable for the new Yank in London town. **********But Mr. Edelman didn't get it at the time. **********\"He told me every secret in the firm,\" Mr. Edelman now knows, describing the lunch as more akin to a briefing out of a John le Carre novel than a polite \"welcome to our firm.\" \"I just didn't understand what he was telling me,\" he said in a telephone interview from his London office. \"The phraseology is different. The context is so different.\" **********To be sure, the native New Yorker, now 36 years old, proved equally puzzling to his new British colleagues. Says a literary agent at a rival firm: \"He took people aback with his diamond earring stud. And his Italian suits.\" **********A well-traveled man who had helped produce a documentary on Isaac Stern's trip to China, Mr. Edelman did not consider England foreign when he was hired to bring Yankee business know-how to a firm founded in 1899 by another Yank, Albert Curtis Brown. **********After all, his first encounter at the agency that has represented A. A. Milne, Winston Churchill and C. S. Lewis went deceptively well: As an independent management consultant who specialized in entertainment companies in the United States, Mr. Edelman was hired to do a management study of the firm, whose clients now include \"Dancing at Lughnasa\" playwright Brian Friel as well as a number of Britain's television and movie writers. And on the strength of that well-received report, he was hired to be the agency's managing director. **********Curtis Brown was then in a time of transition. The younger agents in the firm wanted more of a say in management and to generally update the business. After interviewing home-grown talent, the agency selected Mr. Edelman, in part because he represented a new perspective, but not too radical a one. His long-term strategies -- including weeding out the client list, spinning off the New York office, recruiting new agents with established client lists and putting a personal computer on every desk -- were considered bold but not    too    American for the firm, which now has a staff of 50, including 15 agents. **********Mr. Edelman also decided to announce the bonus structure for the agents, disclosing what to expect and why. \"It was a bit of a shock,\" said Leah Schmidt, a Curtis Brown agent. Previously, bonuses had been determined behind closed doors by three senior executives. (Notably, Mr. Edelman, saying he felt his purpose had been served, dropped the public disclosures the next year.) **********As he tried to analyze the agency, Mr. Edelman was amazed at first to discover the general lack of knowledge about other agents at competing firms and their clients. Agents didn't woo potential clients, they beckoned politely, writing to authors they admired. \"It is very genteel,\" Mr. Edelman said. It is also, he discovered, the only approach likely to work in a market still ruled by writer loyalties. **********In his latest tussle with British tradition, Mr. Edelman has suggested moving the firm's offices from their venerable West End location on Regent Street to more modern, spacious and efficient quarters. Old-line staffers are so far holding the line. **********Another American in literary London, Bronx-born Ed Victor, sympathizes with Mr. Edelman as having a difficult job. Curtis Brown, Mr. Victor said, is massive, and \"It is a big task, steering an old ocean liner.\" **********Mr. Victor, by contrast, heads his own literary agency, a boutique-like operation representing Jack Higgins and Erica Jong, among others, with a Hollywood-like flair. \"I think I do ruffle feathers,\" said Mr. Victor, who has lived in Britain since 1961. \"I'm paid to ruffle feathers.\" **********Ms. Schmidt, pondering Mr. Edelman's style, said, \"The primary change is openness, a shift in attitude. There is a sense of involvement, a sharing of information.\" **********But Mr. Edelman found openness for openness's sake to be a novel concept at the agency. Even a fast breakfast (fresh orange juice and croissants in the board room) was misunderstood. Mr. Edelman saw the exercise as an informal team-building affair; the assembled, meanwhile, nervously awaited an important speech. \"They thought I would hit my spoon against the glass and clear my throat,\" he said. He didn't. **********Mr. Edelman was astounded to learn that his co-workers found TV's Simpson family -- which he adored -- \"cloyingly sentimental.\" Far worse for the manager was the discovery during a game of Trivial Pursuit some months into his tenure that his colleagues had trouble understanding    his    accent.

Now, as the sanctions' bite grows more painful each day, waiters and cabdrivers routinely but apprehensively ask foreign customers when America will bomb Belgrade. Inflations Soars Daily **********It has been slightly more than three weeks since the Security Council moved to bar all trade with Serbia and its allied republic of Montenegro, except for humanitarian aid, and to cut air links. Since then the economy has gone from eccentric to fully crazed. Inflation has zoomed to the point where, measured by the prevailing rates for foreign currency, it is climbing at more than 10 percent a day. The important textile industry has shut down. Most construction projects have been suspended. **********Tens of thousands of people have been given paid leaves financed by sending the already high-speed printing of dinars into inflationary overdrive. Next week tens of thousands more are scheduled to lose their jobs. **********Three weeks ago a 5,000 dinar note, the largest denomination available, had a value of about $550. Today, both banks and the legions of street hustlers exchanging money are delighted to trade a 5,000 dinar note for $2.70. Hard on Pensioners **********For pensioners the effect has been particularly devastating. A woman in her 60's who worked for 25 years in a chemical plant said the other day that her entire monthly payment of 35,000 dinars would buy no more than 44 loaves of bread, or three-quarters of a tank of gas for her son-in-law's car if he gave her the right ration coupons. **********\"Only the criminals can live on what they earn now,\" said Milos Vlasic, an editor at a news magazine. \"The rest of us are living on the foreign money we have kept in our mattresses. When those dollars and Deutsche marks are gone, I can't imagine what people will do.\" **********Under such volatile conditions, the facade of aloofness from war that Serbia's leader, Slobodan Milosevic, was able to project here, even as he was encouraging Serbs to fight for territory beyond the republic's borders, is tearing sharply. So is the tight control he has maintained over political debate and dissent. **********For the last 11 days, students occupying the university, where the enrollment is 80,000, are demanding that Mr. Milosevic \"step down and go away.\" **********The bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which is sometimes described as \"more Serbian than Christian,\" have also called for Mr. Milosevic to resign in favor of a \"Government of National Salvation.\" A Rally Is Planned **********The more formal political opposition, long stymied by Mr. Milosevic's control of television and by the wide appeal of his image as a uniter of all Serbs, is organizing a rally for this Sunday that its leaders say is sure to stagger the Government, if not yet bring it down. The main figure in this opposition, Vuk Draskovic, a 44-year-old writer and lawyer, said the protest, which was originally scheduled for last week, was delayed until St. Vitas Day, the most significant date in Serbian history. **********Not only does it mark Serbia's nation-building defeat in the battle of Kosovo in 1389 and the beginning of what was to be 500 years of occupation by the Turks, but it is also the day chosen by a Serbian nationalist named Gavrilo Princip to assassinate Archduke Francis Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, while he was visiting Sarajevo in 1914. The shooting ignited World War I. **********\"Every Serb is aware of history,\" said Mr. Draskovic, a bearded and long-haired man who, dressed in floral Hawaiian shirts and with a retinue of bodyguards, looks like a rock star. Asked about the potential for violence at the demonstration, he said it was taking place on the only day of the year when it was \"unthinkable for Serbs to kill Serbs.\" **********\"We expect our rally will mark the beginning of the end of Communist rule and a new and better time for Serbs, for Serbia and for Europe,\" he said. **********Adding still more yeast to the suddenly heady brew of Serbia's politics, the son of Yugoslavia's last King is scheduled to arrive here this weekend intent on eventually restoring the monarchy that ended when his father, King Peter, fled the throne as Nazi forces invaded. Although he speaks Serbo-Croatian only haltingly, the pretender, Alexander Karajorjevic, has generated some support among young people, who seem to regard him less for his royal lineage than for the understanding and respect for democracy they assume he acquired by living in Britain. For some others, the monarchy is revered as a link to the pre-Communist past. 'Anything Can Happen' **********\"We can see for him a role like that of Juan Carlos in Spain,\" said Voja Kalic, a 25-year-old philosophy student taking part in the university protest. \"He may be the only person in this country who can attract enthusiasm from people like us and also appeal to the people in the countryide who are supporting Milosevic because they think he will bring them their dreams of Greater Serbia.\" **********A few days ago a local newspaper used the headline \"Anything Can Happen\" to describe the political situation that has developed in the wake of sanctions. In the article and in seemingly never-ending discussions in every restaurant and coffeehouse, the possibilities suggested range from the toppling of Mr. Milosevic by the kind of peaceful protests that succeeded in Czechoslovakia to dire warnings of civil war in Serbia or an even wider conflict that would once again directly involve Serbs and Croats. **********Fears are being expressed that students at the university might be attacked by workers, the police or any of several paramilitary groups to inhibit attendance at the Sunday rally. When a delegation planning the demonstration week asked for Government assurances that the army would not intervene, they were told by Dobrica Cosic, the nationalist writer chosen by Mr. Milosevic to head a new Yugoslav Federation that links just Serbia and Montenegro, that he could not offer them such a pledge. **********A view widely held among Mr. Milosevic's critics is that he has in the past vaulted over problems in Serbia by aggressively defending Serbs and Serbian interests in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. \"Whenever he runs into trouble at home he extends the field of battle,\" said Miodrag Perolic, a mathematician who publishes on opposition monthly, Monitor, in Montenegro.  A Diversion Is Suspected **********Such analysis, on the first anniversary of Croatia's and Slovenia's secession from Yugoslavia, has led some of Mr. Milosevic's opponents to suspect that the Government may try to divert attention from its difficulties by raising the nationalist banner over Kosovo. Although two million ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, it lies dear to the hearts of all Serbs as the site of their defeat by the Turks. A few of the critics said their suspicions grew after Serbian forces surrounded an Islamic school in Pristina on Wednesday to prevent the Kosovo Albanians from convening a parliament they had chosen in clandestine balloting. **********But there is mounting evidence to suggest that however much Mr. Milosevic might be tempted to confront the students, the political opposition or the Albanians, he is constrained from doing so by the sanctions. **********On the outskirts of Vukovar, a Croatian city of 43,000 that Serbian guns blasted into a stark wasteland during three months last fall, ethnic Serbs complained that the region they had carved out of Croatia and renamed Krinea was in danger of being sold out by Belgrade. **********Even more indicative of Mr. Milosevic's reduced options has been the silence of the Government-controlled news media about recent attacks by Croats against ethnic Serbian units across a six-month-old cease-fire line. The television and radio here have played down the news, presumably to keep the public from either demanding military action, which could only bring about greater isolation and international reprisals, or from asking whether in the light of Croatian gains and their own current sacrifices, Government policies had been worthwhile. **********In the absence of a military option, it appears the Government continues to pin its hopes on some miraculous political stratagem that will lead to a reduction of sanctions without forcing the resignation of the leadership here. **********In this vein, there were reports today that Mr. Cosic, who has not yet appointed a Yugoslav Prime Minister, as he was constitutionally obliged to do two days ago, is continuing discussions with Milan Panic, a naturalized American and a millionaire entrepreneur from California, in hopes of persuading him to take the post. Mr. Panic had earlier refused to consider such an offer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/19/business/at-work-data-on-disabilities-true-and-false.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Noble", "pub_date": "1992-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 926, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At Work; Data on Disabilities, True and False", "print_headline": "At Work; Data on Disabilities, True and False", "body_text": " **********Among the early pages of a new study on the impact of the Americans With Disabilities Act is a chart listing 10 dearly held attitudes about people with disabilities and their ability to work. Among them: *********** Employees with disabilities cannot succeed in the competitive job market. *********** Employers believe it will be unduly expensive to provide accommodations for workers under the act. *********** Employees with disabilities create safety risks in the workplace. *********** Customers and clients are uncomfortable in the presence of disabled employees. **********Perhaps the study's author, Peter David Blanck, a law professor at the University of Iowa and a fellow of the Annenberg Foundation, a nonpartisan research group based in Washington, could have simply incorporated the 10 into his text, but that would have lessened the impact of what appears just to the right of each statement: The word \"False,\" forming a 10-rung ladder of reproach down the column. **********The questions, of course, are, how does Mr. Blanck know what he says he knows and how does he know it now? The second phase of the A.D.A., requiring compliance from employers with more than 25 workers, does not go into effect until next Sunday. The first phase, affecting public accommodation of people with disabilities, began only in January, and there has been so much anticipatory sound and fury over the legislation that there has hardly been time for a dispassionate evaluation. Is Mr. Blanck just another Harvard-educated, Stanford-trained smarty-pants with a sociopolitical agenda? **********\"I am at the interface of employers and advocates,\" Mr. Blanck said during a telephone interview from his office in Iowa City. \"The point was to begin a dialogue on these issues and to help resolve disputes without resorting to litigation.\" **********At least four years ago, he said, when the A.D.A. was still just a blur in the eyes of several legislators and lobbying groups, there was an obvious need for empirical information on the ability of people with disabilities to work -- and the ability of workplaces to accommodate them. \"There was a lack of information out there,\" he said. \"Just a lack of hard facts.\" **********\"We knew that a Federal effort was down the pike, though we didn't know what it would be,\" Mr. Blanck said. As a scholar with training in psychology, the science of individual behavior, and law, the formal rules of social behavior, Mr. Blanck was aware that policy, the implementation of good intentions, frequently outruns knowledge. There was, for example, little longitudinal research on the impact of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a measure affecting Federal workplaces and contractors that was the spiritual ancestor of the A.D.A. **********Thus was Mr. Blanck's project, which began in 1989, both obvious and, in policy science, unusual. \"To have subsequent comparisons, we needed baseline data,\" he said. His approach, drawing on techniques used in economic, medical and social research, was interdisciplinary and inclusive of those he refers to as \"consumers\" of the A.D.A. -- people with disabilities -- and \"users\" -- the employers. **********The consumers studied were mentally retarded, many with various \"physical challenges.\" Mr. Blanck estimates that 20 to 30 percent of the 43 million Americans said to be disabled fall into the category of people he studied. His users covered a range of large and small workplaces, from fast-food businesses to hospitals to sales organizations to high-tech production companies. **********It is on the basis of the first year of data, from 1989, that Mr. Blanck assigned some common beliefs about disabilities to the realm of mythology. Perhaps most surprising, given the protesting voices of several trade associations in recent months, was that in 1989 at least, employers displayed little concern over the potential costs of the A.D.A. That may be because employers are more familiar than trade associations with the work of employees with disabilities. Even in 1989, many companies were making efforts to accomodate those with disabilities.  \"Larger, innovative employers have been doing this all along,\" Mr. Blanck said. **********Employers may do well to transfer that sense of inevitability to other groups of employees. Woven into the wealth of detail on attitudes of and about people with disabilities in Mr. Blanck's study is a subtext about the workplace of the future. More and more employees are seeking flexible work arrangements tailored to their personal lives. The A.D.A. is one version of what employers are doing all the time, said Mr. Blanck: \"Accommodating.\" IS IT PERSONAL, OR JOB RELATED? **********The Americans With Disabilities Act requires employers to make \"reasonable\" accommodations so that people with disabilities can perform the \"essential functions\" of their jobs. But the definition of \"reasonable\" has vexed the collective corporate mind for several years, according to a baseline study by Peter David Blanck. Part one of the research is published in the current issue of the Journal of Corporation Law. **********The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \"said there had to be a 'nexus between an individual's disability and the need for accommodation,' \" said Mr. Blanck. That is a less-than-crystalline standard. Employers are particularly concerned about finding the line between personal accommodations, which they need not make, and the job-related accommodations they are required to make. **********With many disabilities, there is no clear distinction between the personal and the job -related. Some of the disabled people might need help help getting to the bathroom or communicating with co-workers and clients, for example. \"Their personal needs are intimately related to their ability to work,\" Mr. Blanck said. \"Where do you draw the line?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/07/world/bristol-journal-these-youths-are-sparks-living-in-a-powder-keg.html": {"writer_name": "William Schmidt", "pub_date": "1992-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 907, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bristol Journal; These Youths Are Sparks, Living in a Powder Keg", "print_headline": "Bristol Journal; These Youths Are Sparks, Living in a Powder Keg", "body_text": " **********It began senselessly, the ways suchthings often do. Two young men stole a police motorcycle and, in the ensuing chase, were killed. Spurious rumors spread that the police in this west England city had deliberately run them down, and an angry crowd soon gathered. **********Within hours, several stores in the center of the Hartcliffe public housing project had been set on fire, cars were overturned and burned and more than 500 police officers in riot gear were fanning through the streets. When it was over, 15 officers were hurt, and more than 80 young people had been arrested. **********The disturbances in Bristol last month were part of a pattern of civil unrest that has hit Britain over the last two and a half months, marking the second straight summer in which mostly white, mostly poor and mostly unemployed young people living in provincial cities far removed from the population centers of London or Birmingham have taken to the streets to battle the police. **********This summer alone, the police have clashed with youths in nine cities, resulting in scores of injuries and more than 325 arrests. The violence has inflamed a sharp public debate over what the police and the Government should be doing differently to curb a growing sense of lawlessness and despair among Britain's young. No Hope of a Job **********\"You have a whole generation of young people who not only don't have jobs; they don't have a hope of getting a job,\" said the Rev. Brian Fessey, an Anglican priest who lives and works in Hartcliffe with his wife, the Rev. Annis Fessey. **********As many as two-thirds of young men under 25 in Hartcliffe are unemployed, according to some estimates.  Nationally, the unemployment rate is 9.6 percent. **********Craig Andrew, 18 years old, says he has not been able to find work since leaving school two years ago.  \"There's no jobs and no money and nothing to do,\" he said, sitting with other teen-agers on the steps of a youth center. \"If even adults can't find a job, how are we supposed to?\" **********Vasso Papandreou, an official of the European Commission, recently issued a rare public condemnation of British Government policy, asserting that the Government's effort to keep inflation low at the expense of high unemployment was to blame, in large part, for this summer's violence. \"Social exclusion manifests itself in social unrest,\" she said. **********Others assert that the disturbances are less a reflection of social deprivation than a growing contempt for law and authority among young people who are bored and idle and looking for trouble on warm summer nights. **********The disturbances the last two summers are in marked contrast to the urban rioting that swept Britain a decade ago. Then, the battles were between the police and black or Asian demonstrators, in the inner districts of Britain's largest cities. **********Paul Smith, a 28-year-old member of the Bristol City Council who was raised and still lives in Hartcliffe, says the problems across the country mostly involve white, working-class youths who live in isolated areas in smaller communities like Coventry and Huddersfield and Stockton-on-Tees. \"I think part of the problem is that the inner cities have gotten all the attention and money, and people who live in places like this feel they've been forgotten,\" he said. **********Sprawling beneath green hills at the southern edge of Bristol, a city of 375,000, Hartcliffe is in an almost pastoral setting: two-story terrace apartments march along curling roads on the edge of the hills, and even the high-rise apartment towers where many of the poorest tenants live overlook open green fields. **********But on the verdant hills above the project, which has a population of 14,000, are the scarred hulks of stolen cars, set on fire by car thieves after nights of joy riding. There are few apartments in the area that have not been burglarized; the Fesseys have lost a television, a video recorder, two bikes and a car in separate incidents over the last year. **********The health files of children in the project here were often stamped \"normal for Hartcliffe,\" to account for the fact they regularly scored below the national mean on traditional measures of fitness and well-being. **********One survey found that three-quarters of the families at a Hartcliffe health clinic were on welfare and half were single-parent families. Infant mortality is 50 percent higher in Hartcliffe than in Britain as a whole. **********Hartcliffe, like similar public housing projects elsewhere in Britain, is in many ways a failed model of 1950's and 1960's social engineering. It was created to move people from inner-city slums to new housing on the green fringe of the city, six miles from downtown. **********But not only do people now complain of being isolated from the city, but thousands of industrial jobs in nearby factories have disappeared in recent years. **********The site where the two men were killed last month is now marked by a white banner on which the message \"We All Miss You\" has been scrawled in black paint. Alongside, bright bouquets of flowers have been pushed through the chain links. **********The police said most of the flowers, neatly tied with ribbon and wrapped in clear plastic, came from the window of a local florist shop, looted on the first night of the disturbances."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/20/world/yugoslavia-votes-divided-and-fearful.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1992-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1200, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yugoslavia Votes, Divided and Fearful", "print_headline": "Yugoslavia Votes, Divided and Fearful", "body_text": " **********Voters in what is left of Yugoslavia go to the polls Sunday, bitterly divided about their country's future yet agreeing on one thing: the weeks ahead are full of new and terrible dangers. **********The two remaining republics that now make up federal Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro -- are rife with rumors of coups, military uprisings and even impending war among the rival factions who are contesting the election within Serbia. No matter who wins the voting, most citizens believe that neither side will accept the results peacefully. **********\"I am so scared I can't sleep at night,\" one Belgrade worker said. \"I want to go into my basement and stay there until the whole thing is over.\" **********Most attention is focused on the crucial contest for Serbia's presidency, although voters will be choosing three new Parliaments, a federal one for Yugoslavia and one for each of its constituent republics, Serbia and Montenegro. The Serbian presidential contest pits two radically different candidates against each other. A Distinct Choice **********The incumbent, Slobodan Milosevic, 51 years old , is a nationalist militant who views himself as the bearer of Serbia's centuries-old tradition. His supporters see him as a heroic figure who embodies the mystic Serbian consciousness. But his critics, among them most world leaders, consider him a brutal criminal responsible for the cruel war still ranging in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********Mr. Milosevic's main opponent, Milan Panic, 63, the federal Yugoslav Prime Minister, says he is determined to lead his country into the modern world. **********Born in Belgrade, Mr. Panic emigrated to the United States as a young man, made a fortune in the pharmaceutical business, and returned to his homeland less than six months ago to take the job of Prime Minister. He pledges to end the fighting in Bosnia, make Yugoslavia into a democracy, and shake Serbs out of the nationalist fervor that has led them to the status of international outcasts. **********Public opinion polls here are notoriously unreliable, so there is no clear indication whether Mr. Milosevic or Mr. Panic is ahead. Most people say they believe that the race is close, and that the five minor candidates will win enough votes to deny anyone an absolute majority. **********If that happens, the two leading candidates will have a runoff election in two weeks. Incumbent Advantage **********During the campaign, Mr. Milosevic has used every advantage available to incumbents in authoritarian countries. State-run television has been heavily biased in his favor, and Government funds have poured into his campaign. **********But Mr. Panic has run a surprisingly strong race. To many voters, especially the young, he represents the first hope for a genuine change that this country has had since World War II. **********Because Mr. Milosevic is a lifelong Communist who has shown himself willing to use all means necessary to win political victories, many Yugoslavs fear that he will not abide by the results if he loses. **********\"I can't imagine Milosevic out of power altogether,\" said Stojan Cerovic, who covers the campaign for the Belgrade news magazine Vreme. \"For him, it's almost crazy to think that someone should leave office just because of voting. He is surely thinking of using force if that is necessary to keep his job. **********\"The opposition is not ready to accept defeat either,\" Mr. Cerovic added.  \"If Milosevic wins, opposition parties will say that his victory is illegitimate because the campaign was so unfair. People could pour out on to the streets, and you could have a Beijing-style massacre.\" A Dangerous Time **********\"This is quite a dangerous period, and no one can count on a peaceful solution,\" he said. \"I'm pretty pessimistic. There are too many weapons around, mostly on Milosevic's side. He's a gambler.\" **********Much speculation has centered on the role of the army, the police and the various paramilitary forces that have sprouted here during the last year. **********The army is under the official control of Yugoslavia's federal President, Dobrica Cosic, a novelist who has wide public support. In recent weeks, Mr. Cosic has held a series of meetings with senior military officers, seeking to guarantee their obedience. **********\"The police force has been greatly expanded,\" said Predrag Simic, director of the nonpartisan Institute of International Politics and Economics. \"It has more than 40,000 people in uniform, and about 16,000 of them are political police, trained in special tactics and intensely loyal to Milosevic. Many of them are not from Serbia. They are refugees from Croatia and Bosnia who see Milosevic as their only hope to go back home and continue their wars. If you combine them with these ruthless Mafia-style gangs, you see the possibility for a very deep confrontation here. **********\"Milosevic realizes that the end of his political career could be the end of his biological career,\" Mr. Simic said.  \"Something like half of the Serbian population holds him responsible for the greatest catastrophe that has faced them in modern times. The world wants to try him as a war criminal, and except for Cuba or North Korea or maybe China, he has nowhere to hide. Do you know of any examples of a totalitarian ruler going into peaceful retirement?\" Threat of Foreign Intervention **********Many Yugoslavs also worry about foreign intervention. World leaders have threatened an increase in pressure on Yugoslavia if Mr. Milosevic wins. Diplomats said responses could include closure of foreign embassies here, blockades of international borders, and cutting of telephone and other services to Serbia. **********If Mr. Milosevic wins, diplomats say, Western governments will seriously consider attacking Serbian military positions in an effort to end the Bosnia fighting. These attacks could be aimed at artillery batteries being used to shell Bosnian towns, or at targets inside Serbia itself. **********\"Outside pressures intended to support Panic and the opposition have been counterproductive, and future pressures will have the same effect,\" warned Bora Kuzmanovic, a professor of social psychology at the University of Belgrade. \"They provoke nationalist feelings. If someone from abroad tries to help the opposition by intervention, even limited intervention, they will cause a pro-Milosevic uprising that will destabilize the whole situation.\" **********Many Yugoslavs say that if Mr. Milosevic cannot win an outright victory on Sunday, his air of invincibility will be lost, and prospects for his electoral defeat will dramatically increase.

Advice for Americans **********The European program has a world of cautions to offer to the separate high-profile, two-week military airlift of American humanitarian aid that is about to begin across a Soviet empire that may be collapsed but is hardly supplicant, according to Miss Apraxine's dealings with some proud and wily Russian officials. **********The American program is to begin Monday with the arrival of the first 12 of 54 flights being directed to the former Soviet republics with a total of more than 2,000 tons of surplus bulk food like rice, flour, sugar, coffee and canned meat, plus some medical aid. Officials say this aid will be far more useful than some of the outdated combat rations airlifted here in December in time for Christmas publicity. **********The new airlift is dwarfed by the European Community's winter program but may well get more attention because of its intimations of deliverance by the cold war superfoe. **********\"Of course it is very impressive to send the aid by air as most of the donors now do,\" Aleksandr Zhitnikov, Russia's Deputy Minister of Social Welfare, said in a local newspaper interview. \"But it would be wiser to save on transportation expenses and send more stuff by sea or rail.\" A Morale Booster **********The latter is totally impractical for the quick, limited gift arranged by the State Department and United States Air Force, which will spread the aid in a tight time frame as a morale booster across at least a dozen former Soviet republics. **********The European program, by contrast, is seven times as large, with 144,000 tons being delivered less impressively in three months of truck convoys from Europe to the two chief cities of Russia. This is one of several community programs being augmented by individual national help, like Germany's $3 billion worth of aid. **********The large European effort is understandable since one motive, beyond compassion, is to head off social pressures that might flood Europe with waves of illegal refugees. **********Russian airports were ruled out as charity drops once European administrators discovered that Moscow's international airport was unable to handle cargo effectively and let the first shipments wait open to potential thievery. **********\"They simply can't unload the planes,\" said Miss Apraxine, cautioning the Americans and adding that St. Petersburg, for all its waterfront beauty, has only one, slow cargo dock. **********American officials say that some planes will have unloading crews aboard and that the State Department will see to proper monitoring. European Community officials say monitoring the security of carefully selected warehouses and shops is hard work, but is the key to getting an effective program under way. Surge in Aid **********Humanitarian aid will quadruple to Russia this year, totaling one million tons. It is a complex subject that can easily be reduced to a clash of foreign impulsiveness, native pride and the guiles of petty racketeers and reactionary bureaucrats devoted to the deep-rooted remnants of central dictate. **********Russian officials, for example, quickly questioned the value of the decision by independent German donors to send 12 tons of chocolate to Moscow's Baumansky district just because it once was the city's main German neighborhood. **********Mr. Zhitnikov says that wise donors realize that they cannot nourish the vast Soviet empire, and that they listen when he stresses that the realistic winter hope is for a single pensioner or invalid to receive a two-kilogram package of milk powder. Conflict With Officials **********But Miss Apraxine said she had often found bureaucrats who \"don't want food aid in general,\" because they want their own monopoly system's prices to stay high for better profits. **********As for milk, she described as a \"scandal\" the current standoff in which tons of powdered skim milk have been rejected for the last month by city officials who say that skim milk is not part of the traditional Russian diet and that the powder should be used only for ice cream. **********Similarly, she said officials in St. Petersburg were merely defending bureaucratic prerogatives when they contended that a shipment of European Community beef was not good enough for Russian standards. \"We finally sent the meat up to Murmansk and they were happy to have it,\" she said. **********One pervasive problem the community has found is how links with the old system survive, particularly in the power of neighborhood districts to decide what will be sold in local stores. \"It is quite astonishing,\" said Miss Apraxine, who helps oversee a chain of European Community food counters established in the last month in 137 shops in Moscow and 50 in St. Petersburg. **********\"I have feelings of considerable gratitude and satisfaction, but there's also some humiliation,\" said Tatyana Levit, a 34-year-old housewife waiting on a line at a shop selling boneless frozen meat from the European Community. It is strictly priced at about 30 rubles a pound by the Europeans, about a third less than the bony, fatty meat available elsewhere. It is a cut-rate price intended to be more affordable and to encourage some price competition. **********At the request of Russian officials, the Europeans are selling rather than giving away the program's 81,000 tons of meat, 28,000 tons of milk powder, 22,000 tons of butter, 10,000 tons of cooking oil and 3,000 tons of baby food. Local officials say they fear that free goods would be resold in the black market. **********The European Community has worked out a warehousing and delivery system with its own monitors, one designed to see daily goods directly into open retail counters, rather than through the infamous back rooms where the black market can siphon off its share. The sales, with monitors trying to track the profits, will realize 4.5 billion rubles, which is to be donated to local charities. **********One shopkeeper was caught bartering meat for wall tile and another found missing butter after some chagrin, but no major scandal has occurred since the convoy of German butter was lost, according to European Community officials. **********\"It can't happen,\" insisted Nina Sokolova, a shop director selling community butter at 56 rubles a kilogram, 24 rubles below the going rate. \"We have a special worker watching the butter,\" she said as shoppers carefully eyed and inched up on the butter to buy half a kilo each. **********\"All in all we're satisfied,\" said Miss Apraxine, summarizing the European operation. It is multinationally staffed and even includes a successful German army general in downtown Moscow in charge of a mufti contingent of food watchers along the old eastern front."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/23/business/company-news-mci-buys-250-million-of-new-transmission-equipment.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MCI BUYS $250 MILLION OF NEW TRANSMISSION EQUIPMENT", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; MCI BUYS $250 MILLION OF NEW TRANSMISSION EQUIPMENT", "body_text": " **********In a move to double the amount of traffic it can transmit over its network, MCI Communications Inc., the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, said yesterday that it had awarded Northern Telecom Ltd. $250 million in contracts for advanced fiber-optic transmission equipment. **********MCI has already installed some of the Northern Telecom systems, which deploy the so-called synchronous optical network (Sonet) standard.

The fact that the rate cuts were announced in advance by politicians raises doubts about the independence of the Bundesbank.\" **********But Bundesbank officials bristled at suggestions that they had abandoned sound monetary policy to cater to political concerns. 'A Sovereign Decision' **********\"There can be no talk of our selling out or making a tradeoff,\" asserted the bank's vice president, Hans Tietmeyer. \"We did not act under pressure. Our decision was a sovereign decision of the Bundesbank.\" **********One leading analyst of German economic and monetary policy, Willi Leibfritz of the Institute for Economic Research in Munich, found a middle ground. **********\"It is true the bank is now responding to politics, but not to partisan politics, just to monetary politics,\" Mr. Leibfritz said in an interview. \"There are hawks and doves inside the Bundesbank, and until recently the hawks have been winning. Now the doves are having their day. The board is not acting under pressure, but it is allowing itself to be influenced by discussions going on in Bonn and in other parts of Europe.\" **********The pressures include both the sharp erosion of the lira, the dollar and other currencies against the German mark and the French vote on Sunday on the Maastricht treaty on European unity.  A Weekend Deal **********Even with the cuts, German rates remain high. The Lombard rate, the ceiling on short-term rates, was cut a quarter of a point to 9.5 percent, while the discount rate, at which commercial banks borrow from the central bank, was cut a half point to 8.25 percent. **********The cuts were part of a weekend economic deal under which the lira was effectively devalued by 7 percent on Sunday. **********\"Bundesbank policy makers have always insisted that their only concern was money supply and controlling inflation,\" said Wolfgang Roth, a member of Parliament who specializes in economic issues. \"Now they are signaling that they are ready to begin considering factors like the stability of the European and world economy. This is a tremendous change.\" **********German political leaders, members of Parliament and banking officials said the rate cuts were intended partly to reassure France and other countries that in a more united Europe, the Bundesbank would weigh political considerations when making monetary policy. That would mark a major break in Bundesbank tradition; for decades, the bank has thrived on its independence, refusing to bend to the will of elected officials in Bonn or other capitals. Effect on French Vote **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he hoped today's move would show French voters that the Bundesbank recognizes and accepts its European responsibilities. **********\"I think it is positive in view of the situation in France,\" Mr. Kohl told reporters who asked for his reaction. **********In Paris, Finance Minister Michel Sapin of France welcomed the Bundesbank's new approach. **********\"One of the very novel elements in this decision is that the Bundesbank has examined matters from a European perspective,\" Mr. Sapin said at a news conference. \"It is taking account of everybody's interests, of all the countries of Europe and not just the situation of Germany, however legitimate that might be. The spirit of Europe has carried the day.\" **********Other European officials also praised the decision as a sign that the Bundesbank was prepared to play a cooperative role, rather than continue defending strictly German interests. **********\"It would be wrong not to regard this as a very significant development indeed,\" said Desmond O'Malley, Minister of Industry in Ireland.  \"What is important is not so much the amount of the cut, but the fact that they made a cut.\" **********For several decades, the Bundesbank has been probably the most revered institution in Germany. According to a familiar joke, not all Germans believe in God, but all believe in the Bundesbank. Considerable Independence **********Unlike central banks in some other countries, the Bundesbank enjoys considerable independence, and has often refused to heed pleas from politicians in Bonn. **********At the same time, the Bundesbank has been a supporter of the European Monetary System, which has stabilized the relationships of different nations' currencies and ended wild swings in value. By its action today, the bank was acknowledging the importance its attaches to the system. **********\"Having the strongest currency in the E.M.S., we saw ourselves in a situation in which we were no longer able to continue our monetary policies,\" said the Bundesbank's president, Helmut Schlesinger, who only last week said he saw no maneuvering room for the bank to cut rates. **********But German rates, at these high levels, have begun distorting European currency markets. **********\"Traders put their money where the rates are highest, and as long as Germany had such high rates, the other countries were getting soaked,\" one economist said. \"The currency volatility came at a time when economies are weak almost everywhere, when there is a tight election coming up in the United States, and when France is getting ready to decide the future of European unity.

Apple is counting on the product's distinctive design to keep the machine above the price fray that has unraveled profit margins in the rest of the personal-computer industry this year. 'Turbulent Market' **********In the notebook market, whose low end offers simple monochrome machines priced below $1,000, Apple will offer the Duo at list prices beginning at $2,249, with the fully outfitted version exceeding $5,000. **********\"It's a really turbulent market out there,\" said Randy Battat, vice president of Apple's portable computing division and point man in the hunt for Bob W. \"Apple has always done particularly well by focusing on the human-to-machine relationship.\" **********Under Mr. Battat, Apple's Powerbook notebook computer organization has been a bright spot in a mostly gloomy year for the personal-computer hardware industry. Apple, which several years ago stumbled badly in the portable market with its first bulky entry, introduced the first three models of its Powerbook notebook line a year ago. In the 12 months since, Apple has become the market leader in notepad-sized systems. Notebook machines, generally weighing less than six pounds, are a subcategory of laptops, which typically weigh eight pounds or more. **********The Powerbook's overnight success has earned Apple new respect from its Japanese parts vendors. \"The first time we visited them and told them we planned to be the No. 1 maker of notebook computers,\" Mr. Battat said, \"they patted us on the head and said, 'You want to be what?' \" **********Apple said last week that it had shipped more than 400,000 Powerbooks to date, generating more than $1 billion in revenue. Infocorp, an industry market research firm, currently estimates that Apple's share of the notebook computer market has risen to 28 percent, slightly ahead of Compaq Computer, the leading maker of notebook systems that, unlike the Powerbook, are compatible with I.B.M. personal computers. **********\"It's odd, the PC-compatible makers haven't responded yet to Apple's success,\" Stewart Alsop, editor of Infoworld, a weekly computer industry newspaper, said. \"They haven't figured out what it is that makes the Powerbook so successful.\" **********Apple is keenly aware that the company will succeed only to the degree that it can continue to stay a step ahead of its competitors that are compatible with International Business Machines. Moreover, company executives say they realize that in order to make inroads outside of the existing Macintosh customer base, they must win over converts from the mainstream of the personal-computer market. So far, the computer maker has sold most of its Powerbooks to buyers who already owned a desktop Macintosh. Currently, only about 25 percent of those who buy a Powerbook have not previously owned or used a Macintosh. Crucial Second Year **********In interviews here last week Apple executives acknowledged that it would be the Powerbook's crucial second year that determines whether the rapid sales are merely the result of pent-up demand generated by the computer maker's late entry into the notebook market. **********\"Sure we're pleased with our first year in the market,\" Mr. Battat said, \"but I'm going to wait for several years before I'll be convinced that we've proven ourselves.\" **********Despite his caution, Mr. Battat, who is 33 years old, and a small group of managers who work for him are being given credit for doing what has been impossible for most other hardware makers in the personal-computer industry -- succeeding independently from the Microsoft Corporation, the leading publisher of personal-computer software. Unlike the makers of I.B.M.-compatibles, Apple produces the primary software for its machines. **********The Powerbook line's first-year success has led many people to suggest that Mr. Battat is destined for more responsibility at the computer maker in the future. **********\"He's definitely one of Apple's shining stars,\" Tim Bajarin, an industry consultant at Creative Strategies, a San Jose, Calif., research firm, said. **********It has not always seemed so. Mr. Battat is one of the few remaining top-ranking executives at Apple who span both the company's early years under its co-founder, Steven Jobs, and the period since the current chairman, John Sculley, who succeeded Mr. Jobs in 1985. A 12-year veteran of Apple, Mr. Battat was a protege of Jean-Louis Gassee, the French executive who took over Apple's product research and development after Mr. Jobs left Apple in 1985. When Mr. Gassee departed in 1990, many thought that Mr. Battat's career at Apple would be eclipsed. Remained Loyal **********Even though his duties were narrowed from broad product-marketing responsibilities under Mr. Gassee to the position of managing portable products, Mr. Battat remained loyal to the computer maker and, with Powerbook, has capitalized on his change of status. **********\"Randy bleeds in six colors,\" one longtime Apple executive said, referring to the company's multicolored Apple logo. **********Mr. Battat said that the company's goal today was to differentiate hardware in a way that permits a computer maker to obtain more than the razor-thin profit margins that have become the industry standard in the past year. **********In doing so, Apple has a significant advantage over its I.B.M.-compatible competitors. Because it controls both its hardware and software, it is able to couple them together more closely than hardware vendors who must depend on software developed by Microsoft. **********Apple will also announce on Monday a second component of its strategy to differentiate its products. It will begin charging separately for updated versions of its operating system software, rather than giving the updates away to existing Macintosh and Powerbook users. The computer maker is introducing a new version of its System 7 operating system and will charge $99 to users who want to upgrade the older software. (As in the past, the operating system -- the command-and-control software for a computer -- will come at no extra charge with sales of new Macintoshes and Powerbooks.) **********In addition, Apple will introduce two new, more powerful, models of the original Powerbook family, the 160 and the 180. The company is also introducing two mid-range personal computers, the Macintosh IIvi and Machintosh IIvx, to fill gaps in its current desktop line. The Macintosh IIvi will be sold only in Europe and Asia. **********Apple's Duo system tries to combine portable and desktop computing features with ease-of-use capabilities previously found only in the broader consumer electronics market. For example, the computer maker has designed a docking mechanism for the notebook unit that mechanically ejects the portable system from the desktop machine, much as videocassette recorder or a compact-disk audio player automatically ejects a cartridge or a disk. **********Industry analysts who have previewed the Duo system say that it is the most polished example of Apple engineering to date, but that it entails a degree of risk. Sony's Role **********The one disappointment in Apple's first Powerbook product line was the low-end Powerbook 100, which the computer maker designed in conjunction with the Sony Corporation. Because it came with a slower processor than the other Powerbooks and without a built-in floppy drive, many United States customers viewed that system as inadequate. **********The new Duo machines, although they have a better display and a faster processing chip than the Powerbook 100, also come without a floppy disk in their basic configuration. Moreover, the Duo notebook unit has a monitor that offers only 16 shades of gray, rather than the color screens available on many I.B.M.-compatible notebooks. Only when the Due is plugged into the desktop Macintosh does the computer have full-color capabilities. **********\"It's a relatively high-risk product,\" Mr. Alsop of Infoworld said. \"Its success will depend on the degree that they are able to sell it as a complete package.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/26/business/credit-markets-subpar-growth-signs-help-prices.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1992-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 986, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Subpar-Growth Signs Help Prices", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Subpar-Growth Signs Help Prices", "body_text": " **********Additional signs of subpar economic growth drove up prices of Treasury notes and bonds yesterday and caused long-term interest rates to fall to their lowest level since early February. **********An upward revision by the Commerce Department in first quarter economic growth to 2.7 percent from 2.4 percent was discounted by traders as old news, even though the rate of expansion was the strongest since the fourth quarter of 1988. **********But credit market participants began to bid up prices almost immediately after the Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment insurance rose by 16,000 in the week ended June 13, to 422,000. **********Economists said they were particularly troubled by the fact that the weekly claims numbers remained above the 400,000 level.

Within hours, the State Department in Washington said he was refused a United States visa last year because of suspicions that he was linked to drug trafficking. **********The department said that the politician, Narong Wongwan, was denied a visa last July under terms of an immigration law that allows the United States to bar entry to anyone who \"is or has been an illicit trafficker in any controlled substance\" or who assists a drug trafficker. The department released no other details. **********Mr. Narong, a 66-year-old wealthy businessman and politician from northern Thailand, is the leader of the Justice Unity Party, or Samakkhi Tham, which captured more seats than any other party in Sunday's parliamentary election, the first since a coup last year. **********Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, released the information about Mr. Narong and the drug allegations in response to questions at a news conference in Washington early Wednesday afternoon.

According to Reuters, Mr. Narong was asked at the news conference about the rumors and replied: \"I have no duty to explain to the people. I don't deny it. I just ignore it.\" **********Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, leader of the opposition New Aspiration Party, declined to comment directly on reports linking Mr. Narong to drug trafficking. But he said, \"The Prime Minister must be acceptable internally by the people and by the international community.\" Big Drug Center **********Thailand is a major center for international narcotics trafficking, principally for the transshipment of drugs produced in the so-called Golden Triangle of northern Thailand, eastern Myanmar and northern Laos, a region that produces more heroin than any other in the world. **********In recent years, the United States has underwritten several projects with the Thai Government intended to curtail drug traffic in the Golden Triangle. **********In Sunday's election, Mr. Narong's Justice Unity Party won 79 of the 360 Parliament seats at stake, more than any other party. His selection as Prime Minister came after extensive backroom negotiations this week over whether Thailand's next leader should be an elected member of Parliament or a general. **********Opposition parties, which performed better in the election than had been expected, threatened public unrest if an unelected military leader became Prime Minister. **********Mr. Narong was a compromise choice. He is an elected legislator who also leads a political party that its opponents believe was created to be the political arm of the junta.  Announcement's Effect Unclear **********It is unclear if the State Department announcement will dash Mr. Narong's hopes of becoming Prime Minister. The appointment needs final approval from the Thai military and from the nation's constitutional monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej. **********Nor is it clear how the appointment of Mr. Narong will affect Thai-American relations, which were strained severely by last year's coup. **********The Bush Administration cut off virtually all United States aid to Thailand to protest the coup. While aid was expected to be restored by Washington as a result of Sunday's election, it seems unlikely that the Administration or Congress could justify resuming aid to Thailand if there is evidence linking the Prime Minister to drug trafficking. **********If he is confirmed as Prime Minister, Mr. Narong will replace Anand Panyarachun, a businessman and former Ambassador to Washington. **********Even before the State Department's disclosure, foreign diplomats in Bangkok reacted with no enthusiasm to the choice of Mr. Narong, who is seen as a traditional politician in a country where the term is usually pejorative. **********He was Agriculture Minister in the administration of Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan, who was brought down by the military in the bloodless coup in February 1991."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/05/business/networking-it-may-be-3-am-but-somewhere-a-cne-is-awake.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 442, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Networking; It May Be 3 A.M., but Somewhere a C.N.E.

Consumption of fruits and vegetables has risen steadily in recent years, and the produce in German open-air markets now rivals that of France.

Now, incredibly good food and wine is coming from the United States. It is creative, full of new ideas and new flavors. The dishes combine influences from around the world.

Led by the Wine Institute, a lobbying and trade group in San Francisco that represents 400 of the state's vintners, and the United States Agricultural Trade Office in Hamburg, a two-year campaign has made inroads into Germany's market. **********In April, for example, Kafer began carrying a full line of California wines at its headquarters store on Munich's tony Prinzregentenstrasse, and California cuisine was introduced at the cozy restaurant on the top floor. Diners can now savor Sonoma duck and papaya salsa or tuna seared with lavender and pepper in a whole-grain mustard sauce. 'The Red Wines Are Elegant' **********The California wines have sold well, said Renate Harbert, Kafer's wine and spirits buyer. Invited by the Wine Institute, she spent a week in the California wine country last year and came away impressed. **********\"In my opinion, California wines are absolutely perfect for German tastes,\" she said. \"The white wines are no longer as heavy as they once were, and the red wines are elegant.\" **********The wines come from a cross-section of California vineyards, including Beringer, Fetzer, Sterling, Bel Arbors, Schug, Benzinger, Cuvaison, Inglenook and Robert Alison. **********Jens Samstag, a Kafer wine salesman, said the star of the show thus far has been a 1990 Chardonnay from the Robert Alison vineyards that sells for about $7.60 a bottle. **********Steve Burns, the Wine Institute's international marketing director, said, \"Kafer is the market leader. Once they start something, it is going to work.\" **********Kaufhaus des Westens, a prestigious Berlin department store known for its extensive food department, will begin carrying California wines soon, Mr. Burns added.'People Are Still Skeptical' **********But smaller retailers in other parts of Germany are finding customers less receptive to American wines. **********Patrick Sindezingue owns La Petite France, a wine store in the Bonn suburb of Buschdorf. He began carrying California wines in February. **********\"People are still a little skeptical,\" he said. \"I have to tell them a lot about the wine and give out a lot of sample bottles.\" **********While American cuisine is making inroads in the more refined realms of German eating, it is already a major force in Germany's mass market, thanks to the hamburger. **********McDonald's first restaurant in Germany opened in Munich in November 1971, and the 400 restaurants in Germany have sales of about $904 million annually.

But more distressing still for the two widows is the fact that their principal is also shrinking. Now they fear that they received bad advice -- and made the wrong decision -- three years ago when they chose an investment that promised a high return. **********Their story is a cautionary tale for people who receive retirement money in a lump sum with no clue about how best to invest it. The two women, who live in Bridgeport, Conn., now face a painful choice familiar to many other novice investors: Should they hold on, hoping the investment will bounce back? Or should they pull out what is left of their money, pay another commission and hope they do better the second time around? **********\"This is all the money we have,\" Mrs. Getts said. \"We really need to feel secure about it. We can't just watch it sink.\" **********Mrs. Roberts, 64, retired in 1989 from Rexham Inc., a maker of packaging materials, where she worked as an assembler for 22 years. Her only retirement money was the $65,000 she got in a lump sum. **********Mrs. Getts, 65, retired the same year as head of the payroll department for the accessory equipment division of the General Electric Company, where she had worked for 43 years. She left with a $700-a-month pension in addition to $60,000 from her savings plan. **********The two women went to the Society for Savings, a bank in nearby Trumbull, for help in investing the money. The Society for Savings is one of many banks that sell mutual funds in their lobbies, working with a brokerage firm that registers the brokers. In this case, the brokerage was the Invest Financial Corporation, a unit of the Kemper Corporation that is based in Tampa, Fla. **********Michael Garofalo, a broker who no longer works for Invest, recommended that both women put all their money in the Pilgrim Short-Term Preferred Fund, Mrs. Getts said. They did, paying a 3.5 percent commission. **********At the time, the fund was investing in high-yield preferred stock. \"It was designed for sophisticated investors who understand the risks of investing in high-yield securities,\" said Robert Grunburg, president of the Pilgrim Group, a family of mutual funds based in Los Angeles. \"It is the analogue of a junk bond fund.\" **********But Mrs. Getts says \"they never explained to me that it was risky. They said it was the ideal thing to take for our financial situation.\" Did the broker suggest putting their lifetime savings into more than one investment for diversification? \"Never,\" she said. **********Harold Evensky, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla., who is paid on a fee-for-service basis rather than on commission, says the fund was a poor choice for the widows. \"It was an extraordinarily volatile and risky investment,\" Mr. Evensky said. \"It would have been grossly inappropriate to recommend that someone put all their money in that fund.\" **********Mr. Evensky said the fund was \"heavily, heavily marketed\" when it was introduced by Pilgrim in 1987 as an investment with \"incredible income and little risk.\" Brokers who do not do their own research into investments may simply repeat this marketing pitch, he suggested. **********In 1990, the fund changed its strategy, becoming what Mr. Grunburg describes as a \"global currency\" fund that invests in \"short-term bonds denominated in foreign currencies with a view to getting higher interest rates.\" It is now called the Pilgrim Short-Term Multi-Market Fund. **********The two women say they were not told of the change. Meanwhile, the bank switched brokerage firms and closed its Trumbull branch. Mrs. Getts, who began calling Pilgrim's 800 number to learn what she could, said she was advised to \"just hang in there\" because \" 'if you sell now, you could be selling at the fund's lowest level.' \" **********By now, Mrs. Roberts's income from the fund has dropped to $361 a month, from $593, and her principal is down to about $54,000 from the original $65,000. Even though Mrs. Getts has been reinvesting her earnings, she has a bit less than she started out with. **********Mr. Grunburg and Peter Mulligan, executive vice president at the Society for Savings in its Hartford headquarters, agreed that the Pilgrim fund would not be appropriate for all of an investor's money. \"If these are the only assets they had, it wouldn't be easy to justify,\" Mr. Grunburg said of the widows. **********Mr. Mulligan said there are two issues: \"Did the rep provide them with the correct advice?\" Did he \"provide them with all the information that they would need to make an informed decision about their investment?\" **********Both the bank and Pilgrim say that the prospectus for the fund, which the widows should have received, clearly disclosed the risks. Any complaints about the sales process should be directed, they said, to Mr. Garofalo and Invest, his former brokerage. **********Mr. Garofalo now works as a wholesaler for Pilgrim. A wholesaler is a sales representative who works with brokers, encouraging them to distribute the company's funds. Mr. Garofalo did not return phone calls. **********Bill Turner, head of the compliance department at Invest, said the firm would have responded to a complaint and that the two women could have requested arbitration if the response was unsatisfactory to them. But the women, who say they were unaware of that option, which remains open to them, have not filed a complaint. **********In fact, they say they still don't know what to do. \"This is causing us untold agonies,\" Mrs. Getts said. \"I'd love to let other people know what they're getting into when they don't know anything about investing.\"WHAT TO EXPECT, HOW TO COMPLAIN **********You don't get a guarantee when you buy securities. But you can expect the salesperson to fairly represent the product and the risks involved. And you can expect the investment he or she recommends to be suitable to your financial situation. **********Before you invest, you can check out a broker by calling the National Association of Securities Dealers at 1-800-289-9999 to find out if any disciplinary actions have been taken by the group, said James Spellman, an N.A.S.D. spokesman. **********If you have already invested and have a complaint, write to the brokerage firm's compliance department, which is obligated to respond. If you remain unsatisfied, send a copy of your letter and the response to the N.A.S.D. and the Securities and Exchange Commission, both based in Washington. **********You also have a right to arbitration. If you have been misled, if you have been advised to invest in something totally unsuitable or if your account has been \"churned\" (actively traded for no good reason except to generate commissions), you may have a good case for compensatory and even punitive damages. Both the N.A.S.D. and S.E.C. offer brochures explaining how to proceed with arbitration."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/25/business/at-work-the-missing-issue-in-campaign-92.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Noble", "pub_date": "1992-10-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 926, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At Work; The Missing Issue in Campaign '92", "print_headline": "At Work; The Missing Issue in Campaign '92", "body_text": " **********It may be the year of the woman, but women's issues have been curiously inconspicuous during the Presidential campaign. True, when pressed in the final debate last week, George Bush cited his appointments; Bill Clinton cited his appointments and his award from the National Women's Political Caucus; Ross Perot cited one appointment and his wife and four \"beautiful daughters.\" **********But the income issues women's groups used to filter into campaigns, in the last few years via the hapless Democrats, have been obscured this year. The Presidential tickets have been too busy lobbing family-value bombs back and forth, and women themselves have been busy running for office in record numbers. \"Women are focused on getting women elected,\" said Heidi Hartmann, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, a Washington economic research group. \"There's less energy for the national campaign.\" **********The lack of debate on women's issues inspired Ms. Hartmann and several colleagues, all economists and all removed enough from the immediate fray to have a little scholarly perspective, to form the Economists' Policy Group on Women's Issues. Earlier this month the group issued a \"women's policy agenda\" and rated the two major-party candidates on issues the group regards as crucial to women. The agenda has been endorsed by a two-and-a-half page list of economists, including Nobel prize winners James Tobin, Franco Modigliani and Robert Solow. **********The group is concerned almost entirely with classic liberal bread-and-butter issues. The agenda calls for: *********** Changes in the welfare system that would make it easier for single mothers -- 40 percent of whom are poor -- to climb out of poverty. *********** Renewed efforts to promote \"equality of opportunity\" in hiring, promotion and wages, by race and gender. *********** Federal support of child-care and family-leave initiatives. *********** Universal access to health care. **********Though the wage gap between men and women has narrowed -- women now make roughly 70 percent of what men make, up from 59 percent in 1968 -- women unattached to men continue to be vulnerable. According to research done by Barbara Bergmann, an American University economist who leads the policy group with Ms. Hartmann, a single mother in the United States needs to make at least $19,000 year to escape poverty, well above the Government's official standard of $10,973 for a family of three. **********In France, a single mother can have the equivalent -- or better -- standard of living earning only $13,000 because of Government cash and transfer payments, state-supported day care and a national health program. One consequence of the sievish American welfare system, research indicates, is that women may feel forced to stay in abusive relationships to keep the support of a second wage earner. **********THE pay-gap gains of the 80's made it possible for white-collar and professional women to support themselves. But Ms. Hartmann says women remain vulnerable, pointing to less-than-enthusiastic enforcement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the Reagan-Bush years. \"More depends on particular employers and whether they are compliant,\" she said. **********If the agenda seems weighted heavily toward damage repair after 12 years of a free-market approach to inequality, the economists' group also proposes several policy and legislative moves. **********It would, for example, like the Labor Department to establish guidelines for pay equity -- an issue once known by the phrase \"comparable worth\" -- that would equalize the wage differences between \"women's work\" and \"men's work.\" It would push Congress to devise a national health-care plan and a child-care system. It would also urge Congress to pass a version of the family-leave legislation recently vetoed by President Bush, less because of the leave itself -- many companies already offer more than the measure calls for -- than because it would confer the right to return to a job. \"People underestimate the importance of a job guarantee,\" Ms. Hartmann said. **********The group doesn't apologize for its agenda's $100 billion price tag. Ms. Hartmann theorizes that Mr. Clinton is pedaling softly on issues he basically supports because of the money stigma. But, she says, the group is proposing nothing that virtually every other industrialized country doesn't already provide as a matter of course to its citizens. And nothing that couldn't come about by paring the military budget and raising taxes. Would they -- quick intake of breath -- tax and spend? A big public sector can account for the failure of the market system to provide the \"goods\" women need, Ms. Hartmann argues: \"Women should want big government.\" HOW THE CANDIDATES RATED **********Given that the agenda of the Economists' Policy Group on Women's Issues has what some Republicans might call a parlor-pinkish slant, it is no surprise that Gov. Bill Clinton gets a higher grade from the group than President Bush. Mr. Clinton's support of a ban on gender discrimination in Federal hiring, promotion and contracts and uncapping the damage awards available to women who have experienced discrimination helped win him an overall grade of B-. Mr. Bush paid for twice vetoing the Family and Medical Leave Act and a laissez-faire attitude toward affirmative action with a grade of D. **********The policy group was unimpressed with the records of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush on welfare reform -- they get a C+ and C, respectively -- and health insurance, for which both receive C's. The Administration's four-year failure to introduce a health-care plan incites skepticism, as does the vagueness of Mr. Clinton's proposed cap on health-care expenditures. **********Ross Perot was out of the race when the candidates were rated."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/28/business/company-news-jp-morgan-is-bt-customer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 218, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "J.P.

Last-Minute Allotment **********The Bush Administration has clearly and frequently expressed its displeasure with Israel's settlement activity in the occupied territories, and it appears unlikely that Washington will take kindly to the spending plans. **********The allotment of housing money, reported in the Israeli press in the last few days, came as part of a political battle that prevented Israel from entering the new year with a budget, as required by law. The governing coalition has been so pummeled by internal strife that serious doubts arose that it could hold itself together much longer. Most of the fighting has centered on demands from religious parties for control over millions of dollars in extra public spending as their price for staying in the Government and keeping it limping along for a while longer. **********This sort of blatant cash demand by the rigorously Orthodox is hardly new to Israeli politics. But political experts say that this time the game has been played more roughly than usual. Although most expected ultimate agreement as negotiations dragged on in Parliament tonight, there was no guarantee that the Government would avoid collapse. **********As matters stand, the Government must call national elections by November. A widely shared assumption is that Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir will move to advance the date by several months once he achieves several immediate political goals. **********The budget wrangling stirred dismay among Israeli business leaders and other Government outsiders who complained that Israel was ignoring fiscal discipline and in the process repelling potential foreign investors. Some expressed worry that the Government's actions could weaken the country's claim to the $10 billion in loan guarantees that it is seeking from the United States to help resettle Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The request, postponed last fall after a nasty fight with the Bush Administration, is expected to be resuscitated later this month. **********Under the agreement, the occupied territories will get 5,000 of the 7,500 publicly financed housing units provided for in the proposed 1992 budget. **********Originally the 5,000 units were supposed to be built in Israel proper. But pressure to shift the money to the territories was applied by small right-wing parties in the Government coalition and by Jewish settlers, who have shown increasing militancy in recent weeks after three of their number were killed by gunmen in the West Bank. Another Settler Killed **********Another settler was shot to death today near the Palestinian refugee camp at Dir al-Balah in the Gaza Strip. **********The Government's settlement activity, while highly disputed domestically and broadly condemned overseas, is something of a numbers game that can lead to various interpretations. **********Some officials, for instance, say that the 5,000 units now budgeted for the territories could be viewed as a significant drop from the 13,500 that were built there in a burst of construction over the last 14 months by the hawkish Housing Minister, Ariel Sharon. **********No one knows for sure how many apartments will actually be built, one official said. The real intention, he argued, is to keep the Government together for a while longer. \"We have to have a Government to have the peace process,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/16/business/company-news-coming-to-pizza-huts-all-you-can-eat-buffet.html": {"writer_name": "Eben Shapiro", "pub_date": "1992-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 651, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Coming to Pizza Huts: All-You-Can-Eat Buffet", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Coming to Pizza Huts: All-You-Can-Eat Buffet", "body_text": " **********In an attempt to lift sales, Pizza Hut, the nation's largest pizza chain, plans to install all-you-can-eat buffets in 2,000 restaurants by the end of the year. **********Sales at Pizza Hut climbed by 10 percent last year as its delivery business grew, but sales inside its restaurants have been flat. **********\"It is phase one of our effort to revitalize our dine-in business,\" Pizza Hut's president and chief executive, Steven S. Reinemund, said of the buffets. **********Pizza Hut, a division of Pepsico Inc., is making a major commitment to the 14-foot buffets.

Tests at Four Sites **********After testing the buffets for four months at Pizza Huts in Dallas, Indianapolis, Savannah, Ga., and Tulsa, Okla., the company began introducing them last week in other restaurants around the country. \"We're into it hot and heavy,\" Mr. Reinemund said. **********The buffet program represents Pizza Hut's first big step to stimulate sales inside its restaurants. In recent years, the company has devoted more effort to expanding its delivery business. **********\"You cannot have one asset that is flat or growing very slowly and have the entire company growing very rapidly,\" Mr. Perkins, the marketing executive, said. He added that the buffets would eventually be in most of the 2,700 company-owned traditional Pizza Hut restaurants. **********Individual franchisees have added buffets to their Pizza Hut stores over the years in some parts of the country but this is the first time that the company is providing the financing for the buffet tables. **********Pizza Huts in the New York area will get buffets in July and August. **********\"It's a smart move,\" Ron Paul, president of Technomic Inc., a restaurant consulting firm in Chicago, said of the buffets. **********But Mr. Paul and other analysts said that Pizza Hut might have trouble keeping pizzas hot and alluring on the buffet tables. **********Michael Mueller, a restaurant analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said: \"It's not an easy business to operate well.

He termed Pizza Hut's 2,000-store plan aggressive but feasible. **********Pizza Hut has been testing several concepts recently. The buffet plan is the first one to receive the capital for rapid expansion. **********In an effort to compete with casual dining restaurants like General Mills' Olive Garden chain, Pizza Hut last year opened the Pizza Hut Cafe in its home base, Wichita, Kan. The test cafe has tablecloths, desserts and a wider menu selection than a traditional Pizza Hut. **********Pizza Hut earlier this year opened Fastino's, which sells pizza for takeout only. Unlike Pizza Hut restaurants, Fastino's, which is also in Wichita, sells pizza by the slice. **********The company is still tinkering with Fastino's and the Pizza Hut Cafe, and said it was too early to know if it would pursue the concepts. **********Pizza Hut's parent, Pepsico, recently acquired a 50 percent stake in California Pizza Kitchen Inc., a small chain of pizza stores.

They gathered in a Tel Aviv hall, where many embraced one another, pummeled each other's backs and talked happily about how, if all goes as planned, the Government will be theirs once again on Monday. **********\"The change or upheaval has created a new atmosphere among the public -- a feeling of hope, a feeling of belief that it can be different, that it can be better,\" Mr. Rabin told them. **********There were no grand surprises in the Cabinet announced, for the names of principal ministers began to dribble out over the last few days. **********The Foreign Minister will be Shimon Peres, a former Labor Prime Minister whom Mr. Rabin dislikes and has described as being about as honest as a winter's day is long. But Mr. Peres, who was Foreign Minister from 1986 to 1988 in a Likud-led coalition, is an accomplished and polished man. And Mr. Rabin could not shunt his rival aside without creating political problems. **********But aides said the new Prime Minister would retain primary responsibility for the Mideast peace talks. **********As expected, Mr. Rabin named himself Defense Minister, a post he has held before. He took the job, he said, because \"there's a connection between political moves and security problems\" in negotiations over self-rule for Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territories. He picked Mordechai Gur, like himself a former armed forces Chief of Staff, to be Deputy Defense Minister, in charge of day-to-day operations. **********The Finance Minister will be Avraham Shochat, a Labor veteran who will oversee hoped-for economic changes.

The ministry will now be headed by Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, a Rabin associate. He said he would concentrate on housing for young couples, young army veterans and the poor. **********Altogether, Mr. Rabin has handed out 21 Cabinet portfolios to 17 people. He has retained several posts for now so he might give them later to two small parties that he hopes to bring into his governing coalition. For now, Labor has 13 ministers, the left-wing Meretz bloc 3, and a religious party, the Sephardic Torah Guardians, or Shas, 1 -- the Interior Ministry. **********On Monday, Mr. Rabin will seek approval of the Cabinet in Parliament, but that should be a formality since Labor, Meretz and Shas control 62 of the 120 seats. **********Still, the Labor Party leader does not have the alliance he really wants: It is too left-leaning for his taste. **********He remains eager, for balance, to bring aboard the right-wing Tsomet Party and a rigorously Orthodox group called United Torah Judaism. **********In a television interview on Saturday night, Mr. Rabin said he wants to meet with American leaders in the next few weeks to discuss autonomy negotiations with the Palestinians and possible economic aid, including presumably $10 billion in loan guarantees that have been frozen over the issue of building new settlements in the territories. **********Officials of American Jewish groups have recently said that the Bush Administration is ready to provide the assistance, conditions permitting.

Print Operations to Stay **********Mr. Whittle said this would be accomplished not by cutting back on print operations, but by developing and increasing the electronic side. Whittle publications include Dental Health Advisor, which goes to 30,000 dental offices; a pet-care report, which is distributed to veterinarians' offices, and a weekly magazine for doctors that goes to 3,000 hospitals. **********The two main electronics projects are the two-year-old Channel One news program, which is seen in 10,000 schools around the country, and the Special Reports Family Network, which televises news reports complemented by printed health information to 32,000 medical offices. **********Whittle's book publishing projects will not be affected.

But the yearnings of Kosovo's two million ethnic Albanians have only grown louder and more insistent, despite the imposition two years ago of a state of emergency and direct rule by Belgrade. Patient Waiting Advised **********So far, the struggle between the Serbs and Kosovo's Albanians has not involved armed conflict. Instead, it has been characterized by deliberate repression and nonviolent resistance. Through their policies, the Serbian authorities have denied the Albanians livelihoods, education, medical attention, news organs and political rights. **********In response, the Albanians have waited, relying on community organizing, international diplomacy and the highest birth rate in Europe. They have built up their own institutions, from schools to clinics to an unofficial parliament chosen last month in balloting conducted in private homes. **********\"We know that if we wait patiently, we will win,\" said Ibrahim Rugova, the man elected as Kosovo's \"president\" in the May 24 vote. He is a gaunt and ascetic-looking man of 47 who studied literary criticism at the Sorbonne. Now he spends his days in the small house of the Albanian writers' union, behind the soccer stadium. **********\"We have no army, of course, or post office, and we exist on the charity of our people,\" he said. \"But there is no doubt that we have moral and political power. De facto, we are in power, and we must be invited as the legitimate representatives of Kosovo to any international conference on Yugoslavia.\" **********Mr. Rugova said that what the Albanians wanted was independence, adding that they might decide to join with neighboring Albania but that this could only be done through democratic means like a referendum. Albania Too Poor to Help **********There have been occasional attacks on Serbs reported here in the last few years, but the Albanian leaders all contend that anything beyond passive resistance would be madness and they constantly warn against any deed that could serve as a pretext for greater Serbian repression. **********\"We are unarmed and the Serbs have planes and bombs,\" said Shkelzen Maliqi, the leader of a social democratic faction. He said that early in the movement some people had hopes that they might gain the armed backing of the Albanian Government in Tirana, but added that this was before people in Kosovo had been able to visit Albania. **********\"Now,\" he said, \"everybody knows that they are so poor and weak and that they cannot help us, that someday probably we will have to help them.\" **********Mr. Rugova made it clear that he believed that the Belgrade Government could unleash new attacks on Kosovo's Albanians, regardless of the pressure of the United Nations sanctions now imposed on the rump Yugoslavia -- including Kosovo -- over the Serbian leadership's role in the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********\"What has happened in Bosnia has had a positive effect,\" he said, \"since it has made the international community aware of the kind of authorities that exist in Belgrade. But the tragedy is that the conflict could spread here and we have no means of defending ourselves.\" **********From its beginnings in 1981, the confrontation here has pitted Albanian demographics against the weight of Serbian history and Serbian nationalism. The Albanians, mostly Muslims, represent 90 percent of the population in Kosovo and the rate of their natural increase can be seen in the swarms of youngsters playing in every courtyard and alley of this labyrinthine city of 250,000. Every Albanian here believes that sooner or later Albanians will have to become masters of their own house. **********The Serbs, a small minority here but at 10 million the largest group within old Yugoslavia, consider Kosovo to be eternally Serbian. For them it is revered, blood-soaked soil where Serbia's nationhood was forged in 1389, when Turkish armies defeated Serbian forces on the Kosovo plain, ushering in five centuries of Muslim Ottoman domination and Christian Orthodox Serbian resistance. **********Unlike the breaking away of Croats, Slovenes, Bosnians and Macedonians from Yugoslavia, the separatism of the Albanians involves land within Serbia, and it is not hard to find people in Belgrade, even critics of Government policy, who say they would fight for Kosovo today, or send their children to fight for it. **********Anxiety over the impasse in Kosovo is extending beyond the borders of what used to be Yugoslavia, most notably in Greece. There, the fear is that resurgent Albanian nationalism might spread among the large Albanian minority in Macedonia, and that Albanians both in Tirana and Kosovo might establish close ties with Turkey, an independent Macedonia and Bulgaria, lining Greece's northern frontier with countries that would be less sympathetic to it than to each other. **********But most Albanians in Kosovo are adamant. \"There really is nothing to be negotiated here,\" said Mr. Surroi, who was one of those selected for parliament in the elections held by the Albanians. \"We are not Slavs. We are certainly not Serbs. We have our own culture. We were the third largest group within Yugoslavia after the Serbs and Croats. It is just a matter of time.\" **********Feelings of solidarity and defiance were evident at the fenced-in compound of six houses belonging to Hamdi Aliu, a patriarch of a large family who had made a comfortable living by renting out earth-moving equipment on Government constructions jobs. He has not had a job in the almost two years, but when all Albanian high school teachers were dismissed and all Albanian high school students stayed out in sympathy, Mr. Aliu turned over two five-room houses and a shed to the teachers and their students, who set up an unofficial school. **********In the shed, Shaban Carreti, the principal, pointed to schedules to show how 1,538 students were being taught in 10 rooms by 56 teachers working three shifts without pay. **********\"None of our teachers have received any pay for 18 months,\" said the principal, who spent three months in prison on charges that he had incited students to strike. \"We do it because it is our patriotic duty. The Serbs want to cut the line of education and destroy a generation and we must prevent this. We are teachers, so we are teaching, but we are also on the barricades of our nation's struggle.\" **********Mr. Carreti explained that there were perhaps a dozen high schools like the one he administers and that virtually all high school students were receiving education, except those young men who had fled he country to avoid induction into the army. Albanian university professors have also been dismissed, and now take their students into homes. Only younger children are still attending state elementary schools, where Albanian teachers have been rehired and permitted to teach in the Albanian language. **********In a neighborhood called the Hill of the Heroes, another maze of winding alleys, clay houses and modest brick dwellings, Albanian doctors dismissed from the hospitals were treating patients in a three-room clinic. Sabahete Capuni Paragra, a pediatrician, said that since the dismissals of the doctors most of Kosovo's Albanians had been without medical attention. Some, she said, simply did not trust the Serbian doctors at the hospitals, but a far larger group lost access to the hospital when the family breadwinner was dismissed and his medical coverage canceled. **********Flaka Surroi, the director of the Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedom, which tries to document harassment and police attacks on Albanians, said she had to laugh when the United Nations sanctions were imposed at the beginning of June. \"We've been living with Belgrade's sanctions for more than two years,\" she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/24/world/ousted-arabs-shiver-and-wait-in-lebanese-limbo.html": {"writer_name": "Ali Jaber", "pub_date": "1992-12-24", "snippet": "\"We are thirsty, cold and hungry,\" said Dr. Abdul-Aziz Rantisi, spokesman for the 415 Palestinians expelled by Israel, as he announced that the deportees have started to ration food and drinking water.\n\nOn Monday, the Lebanese Army imposed a ban p...", "word_count": 456, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ousted Arabs Shiver and Wait in Lebanese Limbo", "print_headline": "Ousted Arabs Shiver and Wait in Lebanese Limbo", "body_text": " **********\"We are thirsty, cold and hungry,\" said Dr. Abdul-Aziz Rantisi, spokesman for the 415 Palestinians expelled by Israel, as he announced that the deportees have started to ration food and drinking water. **********On Monday, the Lebanese Army imposed a ban preventing all relief organizations, including the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, from aiding the deportees from the Lebanese side. **********The Beirut Government insists that it does not control the territory where the deportees are stranded and said any aid should come from the Israeli side, while Israel says this is up to Lebanon.Tent Camp in No Man's Land **********Denied entry to the Lebanese-held areas north of Israel's self-declared security zone, the Palestinians, who are Islamic fundamentalists, have set up a tent camp here.

The United States channeled hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and other aid to Unita to offset the large-scale backing the Luanda Government had received from the Soviet Union and Cuba. **********The Angola radio said on Tuesday that heavily armed Unita troops had taken over an airport Monday in Cuito, in the central province of Bie. Unita loyalists were also reported to have captured a plane operated by the national airlines. The radio said the troops had threatened to shoot down any aircraft trying to land or take off, a report that Unita officials have denied. **********Earlier, Unita officials said its forces in Bie had captured 11 police officers after what they said was an attempt to assassinate the Unita leader, Jonas Savimbi. **********The state radio also reported that 13 people had been killed over the weekend in political violence, including eight in a clash between the police and Unita supporters in the eastern city of Luena.

Yeltsin's public rebuff of American demands in arms control negotiations as part of the public posturing that is common in such talks. They did not seem particularly worried about it -- for now. **********Indeed, as Mr. Yeltsin was challenging demands for the elimination of his country's land-based, multiple-warhead missiles in an address to senior officers at the Russian Defense Ministry, his Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, was continuing negotiations by telephone with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. **********American officials said the two officials exchanged some ideas and that Mr. Baker would decide on Thursday after another conversation with Mr. Kozyrev whether he should fly to Moscow to try to negotiate an accord for deeper cuts in strategic nuclear arms in advance of a summit meeting between President Bush and Mr. Yeltsin next week. **********\"No one here is panicking,\" a White House official said. \"You have to expect this kind of back and forth.\" Some Share Yeltsin View **********Commenting on Mr. Yeltsin's speech, one State Department official said: \"He has his proposals and we have ours. He likes his proposals. We like ours. This sort of thing happens all the time in these negotiations. **********\"His speech was intended partly for his domestic audience and partly for us,\" the official added. \"He has to show that he is getting the best deal possible for the Russian people.\" **********But many officials and arms control experts outside -- and some within -- the Bush Administration share Mr. Yeltsin's view that the Administration is being unrealistic in expecting Russia to give up virtually all of its land-based, multiple-warhead nuclear missiles while Washington insists on retaining a significant number of its own sea-based multiple warhead missiles. **********Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Delaware Democrat who is chairman of the Senate subcommittee on Europe, accused the Bush Administration of asking too much of Russia, saying: \"Russian leaders have made clear their desire to negotiate deep mutual cuts. But the Administration persists with proposals where U.S. cuts would be minimal. The Initial Proposal **********\"This translates to Russian leaders as the pursuit of unilateral advantage,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Even a weakened Russia is not going to be pressured into unilateral disarmament.\" **********Daniel Ellsberg, an arms control analyst for the Physicians for Social Responsiblity, pointed out that Russia's initial proposal called for both countries to reduce their nuclear warheads from the level of about 8,500 set in the recently signed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to between 2,000 and 2,500 warheads each. That would require both sides to give up all of their land-based, multiple-warhead intercontinental ballistic missiles. **********It was the American side that refused to make such deep cuts and held out for 4,700 warheads each while insisting that the Russians give up all of their land-based multiple warheaded ICBM's, in particular the advanced SS-18's and SS-24's. **********\"There is no way that it is in the U.S. interest for the successor to Mr. Yeltsin -- whomever he might be -- to possess 4,000-odd warheads, when we could get him to go down to 2,000 right now,\" Mr. Ellsberg said. **********Both sides still seem interested in striking a deal that would involve radical cuts, said Peter W. Rodman, a former official of the National Security Council who now teaches at Johns Hopkins University. **********\"It makes sense to aim high,\" he added. \"But they have been trying to compress an awful lot in a short space.

In addition to the phrases, with phonetic renderings, it is sprinkled with history, geography and culture, not to mention the photographs of small arms and mines found in great abundance in the Horn of Africa. **********Thirty thousand guides have been printed, and the Pentagon hopes that few troops will leave home without one.

As the lexicon makes clear, it is useful to know how to talk about scorpions, snakes, pains, wounds, fever and diarrhea.

As the handbook explains, infectious disease and health problems \"are the greatest threat to the effectiveness of operational units and the success of the overall mission.\" **********Aside from diarrhea and other intestinal problems, which the guide warns could \"degrade the effectivness of over 10 to 20 percent of the force within 24 to 48 hours,\" there are respiratory diseases; skin diseases; sexually transmitted diseases; malaria and other diseases spread by mosquitoes, ticks and fleas; viral hepatitis; meningitis, and diseases spread by sandflies or hookworms and other parasites that enter the skin. **********Then there are the snakes, which get two pages in the guide. The black mamba and the carpet viper are the most venomous, but the Mozambique spitting cobra and the Arabian mole viper are also a threat. **********The book contains an extensive section on land mines, and pictures of the Soviet and American weapons that Somali clans possess.

The guide cautions that Somali clan leaders may be unable to control their forces. **********Lieut. Col.

On Tuesday, Mr. Mauroy described Mr. Rocard as the party's \"virtual candidate.\" Today, Mr. Fabius said he \"carries our hopes and those of many French people.\" **********Political experts said that while the succession race is far from over, the revival of Mr. Rocard's fortunes reflects Mr. Mitterrand's loss of influence over fellow Socialists as party leaders prepare for what is increasingly referred to as the \"post-Mitterrand\" era. Relations Are Tense **********Although Mr. Rocard served as Mr. Mitterrand's Prime Minister for three years, relations between the two men have long been tense, dating to the days when they first competed for the leadership of the Socialist Party in 1971. **********In their political views the two men are not far apart. But when Mr. Rocard was replaced as Prime Minister by Edith Cresson in May, it was widely assumed that Mr. Mitterrand was trying to prevent his 61-year-old rival from emerging as his natural successor. **********In recent months, Mr. Mitterrand has also hinted that he believes the best Socialist candidate in 1995 would be Jacques Delors, who is now the influential president of the European Community's executive commission in Brussels. Mr. Delors, who served as Mr. Mitterrand's first Finance Minister, has in turn indicated interest in returning to French politics. **********Some experts believe that Mr. Delors's rising star was an important element in producing the new alliance between Mr. Fabius and Mr. Rocard, who until recently headed competing factions in the Socialist Party. The third main faction is led by Lionel Jospin, the Education Minister. **********Mr. Fabius, who is also a former Prime Minister and was long regarded as Mr. Mitterrand's favorite, is still only 45 years old and can probably afford to bow to Mr. Rocard's greater experience and popularity with an eye on the future. **********At the same time, by assuming the challenge of trying to revive his party's sagging fortunes before regional elections in March and crucial parliamentary elections in 1993, Mr. Fabius is gambling with his own political reputation in his new post as first secretary. Slump in Popularity **********After his election today, he pledged to \"renovate, rally and reform the party,\" which has been shaken not only by bitter infighting but also by a slump in the popularity of Mr. Mitterrand and Mrs. Cresson. Recent polls show that only one in five French voters still support the Socialists. **********While an opposition victory in regional elections in March now seems unavoidable, the Socialists are above all anxious not to lose parliamentary elections next year. If they do, Mr. Mitterrand would be forced to share power with a conservative Prime Minister, weakening the Socialists' hopes of retaining the presidency in 1995. **********With many French voters blaming Mrs. Cresson for rising unemployment and a slowdown in economic growth, some Socialists argue that she should be replaced as Prime Minister now. **********Today she showed no interest in resigning. \"I was appointed to be daring and vigorous,\" she said. \"We will continue to work together for the whole of this year.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/19/business/credit-markets-tva-bonds-selling-well.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 215, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "T.V.A.

In the last three days, August gold on the exchange has dropped $16.30 an ounce, or 5 percent. In London, gold slumped $9.50 an ounce yesterday, to $337.30. **********The sudden drop wiped out weeks of incremental advances, which many traders and analysts had heralded as the long-awaited comeback in the gold market after years of moribund trading. **********Yesterday's New York close was the lowest since Jan. 1986, when gold bottomed at $326.30, according to Daphne Bloore of the World Gold Council, an association of gold-producing companies. **********This week's fall came as speculators, betting heavily on a rising gold price, were surprised by a convergence of economic factors that were minor when viewed independently but scared traders into selling. **********\"It was like a snowball effect,\" said Warren Myers, vice president of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. \"Commodity funds were liquidating their positions, and fear began feeding on itself.\" **********Oddly, one of the factors that initiated the selling panic was a rise in gold prices in Australia, which kicked off a flurry of sales by major Australian gold producers. At the same time, a trio of economic indicators in the United States signaled that inflation was remaining low. Gold is a favored hedge against inflation. **********When platinum prices suddenly dropped, the selling panic was on. Managers of large commodity funds, many of whom had accumulated large gold positions as the price rose in recent months, became afraid of further price drops and began selling.

Now that gold is under $335, Mr. Schenk said, it could fall even more precipitously. **********But most precious metals analysts agree that an eventual and gradual rebound is likely because many of the speculators who sold gold short in anticipation of its fall will eventually have to buy into the market. **********Mr. Myers of Merrill Lynch also noted that once the price of gold falls much below $350 an ounce, it becomes unprofitable for many gold producers to keep mining operations at full capacity.

The F.C.C.'s chairman, Alfred C. Sikes, has argued that allowing greater consolidation will allow broadcasters to cut costs. **********Andrew C. Barrett, the only black on the commission, abstained. In a rare public outburst, he accused his colleagues of paying \"lip service\" to minority broadcasters and leaving him out of last-minute negotiations. **********Mr. Barrett, a Republican from Illinois, argued that the commission was \"grossly altering\" the ownership structure of the industry. Although he abstained, Mr. Barrett said he would probably change his vote to a formal dissent when the commission published the final rule in several weeks. **********Key Democrats in Congress, who favor stricter limits as a way to preserve diversity in radio, quickly objected and promised to introduce legislation to reverse the decision. **********But the chances are strong that the new rule will ultimately remain in place. While members of the House are clearly upset, senators who disagree with the change have restrained their comments in recent weeks. President Bush generally favors deregulation. **********The rules adopted today, which take effect on Aug. 1, will permit a single person or company to own as many as 30 AM and 30 FM stations nationwide. Under the current rules, one owner may have no more than 12 AM and 12 FM stations nationwide and no more than one of each in any market. Minority owners are currently permitted up to 14 AM and 14 FM stations. **********The changes are likely to lead to spirited bidding for some stations. Large broadcasting companies that are close to the old limit -- including CBS, Capital Cities/ABC, Group W-Westinghouse Broadcasting and Infinity Broadcasting are believed to be eager to buy additional stations in large markets. **********But it is unclear whether the new ownership limits will have much immediate effect in New York and the other largest markets because big-city stations are generally profitable and under less pressure to sell. **********\"I think there will be a lot of interest, but I don't know how many opportunities there will be,\" said Robert F. X. Sillerman, head of the Sillerman Companies in New York, which owns 50 percent of WNEW-AM and has investments in many other stations. **********But Mel Karmazin, the president and chief executive of Infinity, had said when the new rules were first proposed: \"We would love to have another station in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. A change in ownership rules would be very favorable to us.\" Mr. Karmazin was out of the office and could not be reached today. **********F.C.C. officials said the old rules had long been outdated because radio stations face ample competition from cable television and other forms of communication. **********In a staff report on the industry intended to shore up its decision, the F.C.C. said that more than half of all stations in the country were losing money. Because many broadcasters could neither turn a profit nor sell their licenses, 153 stations simply shut in the last year. **********The move is also part of a broader effort initiated by Mr. Sikes to loosen a wide range of other restrictions, including rules that limit a company to 12 television stations. Television was not addressed in today's action. F.C.C. officials said that in the next few months they also would accelerate action on a proposal to allow television networks to acquire cable television outlets. **********The five commissioners spent the last week trying to resolve differences. Mr. Sikes and Sherrie P. Marshall generally supported a staff recommendation to eliminate the national ownership limits and allow companies to acquire four AM and four FM stations in a single city. Mr. Barrett, Ervin S. Duggan and James H. Quello wanted to move more cautiously. Market-Size Formula **********Besides lifting the national ownership limits, the new rule will revise the so-called duopoly rule that barred a company from owning more than one AM and one FM station in a single city The new regulation would raise the limits based on the size of the market. **********In cities with a total of fewer than 15 stations on both bands, a company will not be allowed to buy stations that account for more than half the market share of listeners. In all the bigger cities, the limit will be 25 percent. **********In the cities with fewer than 15 stations a company may own three stations, but no more than two FM stations. FM stations, with their superior sound quality, are generally more profitable than AM stations. **********Companies would be allowed to buy two AM and two FM station in cities with between 15 and 29 stations; three AM and two FM stations in cities with between 30 and 39 stations, and three of each in cities with more than 40 stations, like New York. **********\"We're delighted with the F.C.C. action,\" said Stephen A. Hildebrandt, chief counsel of Group W Radio, which owns a total of 17 AM and FM stations, including WINS in New York City. 'Competitive Disadvantage' **********Members of minorities in the broadcasting industry argued that the new rule would make it hard for people who own small stations to \"trade up\" to larger ones. The rule \"means you put at a competitive disadvantage those who cannot afford to buy multiple stations,\" said Lois Wright, vice president of the Inner City Broadcasting, which owns WLIB-AM and WBLS-FM in New York and is general counsel for the National Association of Black-Owned Broadcasters. **********But the angriest reaction came from Mr. Barrett, who complained that he had not learned about the final agreement until someone outside the F.C.C. presented it to him. \"Don't play games with me,\" he told Mr. Sikes. **********The commission also placed some restrictions on what are known as time-brokering agreements, under which one station can lease most of its air time to another station nearby.  Under such agreements, which have become popular in the last year, the station that turns over its airtime usually becomes what amounts to a robot transmitter for the other. **********The F.C.C. has permitted these arrangements but reuled today that a station could only enter one if it would be eligible to buy the other station under the limits set today. **********In a related action, the commission asked for comment on a proposal to let banks and other lenders hold a security interest in a broadcast license as collateral for a loan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/12/business/company-news-connecticut-radio-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 38, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Connecticut Radio Deal", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Connecticut Radio Deal", "body_text": " **********Clear Channel Communications Inc. of San Antonio said today that it had completed the acquisition of WKCI-FM in New Haven from the Noble Broadcasting Company of San Diego for $14 million in cash."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/15/world/us-comment-on-old-issue-inflames-israelis.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1992-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 693, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Comment on Old Issue Inflames Israelis", "print_headline": "U.S. Comment on Old Issue Inflames Israelis", "body_text": " **********At her regular news briefing the other day, the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, affirmed United States support for an old United Nations resolution, going back to 1948 and governing the right of Palestinian refugees to return to Israel. **********On one level, there was nothing remarkable in what she said. It was simply a restatement of a 44-year-old position, and her comments got scant attention in the American press. **********But sometimes what seems like a mere sneeze in Washington has a way of turning into pneumonia in Israel, and so it was this week as the Tutwiler briefing landed here with the political and diplomatic equivalence of a low-megaton bomb. **********Suddenly, the question of Palestinians returning to Israel and the American view of that have been injected into the Israeli campaign for June national elections. And some political scientists and commentators say the United States may have inadvertently given a healthy boost to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, an interesting twist since the prevailing assumption here is that the Bush Administration would love to have Mr. Shamir and his Likud Party displaced next month by Yitzhak Rabin of the opposition Labor Party. **********While the effects of the Tutwiler remarks may wear off before election day on June 23, Mr. Rabin, whose party is substantially ahead in opinion polls, was reliably reported to be furious with the Americans for having handed Mr. Shamir what he regarded as a substantial gift. **********\"It shows either complete insensitivity to Israeli domestic politics or utter stupidity,\" said Shlomo Avineri, a pro-Labor professor of political science at Hebrew University and a former director general of the Foreign Ministry. **********For Israelis of all political stripes, there is perhaps no issue more delicate -- and no concept more of an anathema -- than Palestinian claims to the \"right of return\" to homes that they left in 1947 and 1948 as Israel came into being and fought for its survival. A large-scale return of Palestinian refugees, whose numbers are put at 2.6 million by the United Nations, would erode Israel's majority of 4.1 million Jews in an overall population of 5.1 million, and, Israelis say, jeopardize the very existence of the Jewish state. **********So by reaffirming support for United Nations Resolution 194 of 1948, which calls for international controls over Jerusalem and upholds the right of refugees to go back to their homes, the United States struck deeply into an Israeli nerve. The resolution says in part, \"The refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date.\" **********\"It will never happen, in any way shape or form,\" Mr. Shamir said. \"There is only a Jewish right of return to the land of Israel.\" **********Miss Tutwiler, first on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, insisted that the Administration was not prepared to discuss how to interpret Resolution 194, whether it means, for instance, that Palestinians should be allowed to go back to once-Arab Jaffa, a suburb of Tel Aviv on the Mediterranean coast. That was a matter for Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate directly between themselves, she said. **********But for Israelis, that the Americans had publicly discussed the issue at all was enough. In addition, the fact that Miss Tutwiler's remarks were a delayed response to a reporter's question put to her several days earlier suggested to officials here that they were not a mistake but rather a calculated step, perhaps to take a swipe at Israel for boycotting peace talks on Middle East refugees under way in Ottawa. **********Likud wasted no time to use the issue to portray Labor as a leftist band soft on Israel's security needs. **********Likud maintains that not an inch of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip should be returned to Arab control, while Labor says it is prepared to give up parts of the territories in exchange for a guaranteed peace. Now, some political commentators say, Mr. Shamir should have an easier time persuading many Israelis that the Palestinians may be talking today about the West Bank, but that tomorrow they will want Jaffa and Haifa back and only Likud is tough enough to prevent that."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/20/world/death-sentence-reaffirmed-for-cuban-exile-report-says.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Death Sentence Reaffirmed For Cuban Exile, Report Says", "print_headline": "Death Sentence Reaffirmed For Cuban Exile, Report Says", "body_text": " **********Cuba's governing State Council has upheld a death sentence against one of three Cuban exiles convicted of planning terrorist attacks on the island, state-run Radio Reloj reported today. **********Eduardo Diaz Betancourt, 38 years old, who was captured with two other men on Dec. 29 when they landed on Cuba's northern coast, faces the firing squad now that the Council headed by President Fidel Castro has declined to reduce his sentence, the radio said. **********Radio Reloj said the Council commuted the death sentence against one of the accomplices, Daniel Candelario Santovenia, 36, to 30 years' imprisonment.

Phone calls have been flooding the 13-year-old private nonprofit Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corporation, deep in the heart of riot-ravaged South-Central Los Angeles, which Mrs. Battle-Bey, the president, has run since 1981. **********She and her staff are on the front lines of the \"Rebuild L.A.\" movement because they already know how to do it. With money scraped together from the City of Los Angeles, foundations and banks, they have built a neighborhood shopping center, an affordable apartment building and a low-rent \"incubator\" to house five fledgling businesses; they rehabilitate 75 to 100 housing units a year. The black-owned McDonald's at their Vermont Slauson shopping center has so little competition right now that on Monday it ran out of french fries. **********Today, Vermont Slauson is struggling to keep up with the sudden onslaught of meetings and requests. \"I'm trying to catch up,\" Mrs. Battle-Bey tells her husband on the phone. \"I can't; it's a whirlwind.\" At her narrow storefront at Vermont and Slauson, which was miraculously spared in twin conflagrations that engulfed the stores on either side, Mrs. Battle-Bey, an imposing woman in her late 30's, wearing a flowing lavender pantsuit, starts her 8:30 A.M. staff meeting. As she sorts through mail, her staff fills her in on various meetings she couldn't attend. **********Opportunities await. Mrs. Battle-Bey is already dusting off old projects because they now have a better chance of getting funding. There's now plenty of real estate to be developed, she reminds grimly: at the intersection of Vernon and Central, four corners of prime space, leveled in the riot, are available. **********And there's more money chasing these projects. \"It takes a crisis and newsworthy attention,\" Mrs. Battle-Bey said. \"Now, we can put all the things together that we couldn't get done in the last 10 years, when there was no money. Everybody wants to be involved in this crisis intervention and resolution. We'll try to be as selective as possible, do our own stuff, let the dust settle.\" **********Like many nonprofit workers, Mrs. Battle-Bey and her staff are accustomed to throwing around acronyms and abbreviations: today's agenda includes mentions of S.B.A. (Small Business Administration), FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) and C.C.E.D.A. (California Community Economic Development Association). So far, they aren't encouraged by the data on loans and disaster assistance. \"Sounds like folks have a couple of things to jump through to get money,\" Mrs. Battle-Bey said. \"We'll get more information tomorrow at the Mayor's Office, and I'll report back on what's happening at Rebuild L.A.,\" a project headed by Peter Ueberroth that will parcel out private contributions, mainly from corporations. **********Richard McNish of the Community Redevelopment Agency drops in unannounced, eager to report that Vermont Slauson is apparently on a list of five agencies that Washington will endow with a portion of some $12 million in direct equity financing. \"This is the best money in the United States,\" he says. \"It's liquid money in the bank. It doesn't go through the city.\" **********After Mr. McNish leaves, the group discusses setting up open-air farmers' markets for street vendors and conducting small focus groups. But Mrs. Battle-Bey exhorts her employees: \"I don't want you to think about what our response should be. I want you to think about what the need is and how we can address that need. We can fund much of this ourselves. We're not going to sit around and wait for little pots of money. If they come, great. We'll do our programs regardless. We still have proposals on the table for funding -- like our $2.5 million entrepreneurial plastics manufacturing company that actually produces products and provides long-term jobs.\" **********Mrs. Battle-Bey still has to conduct continuing business, including her weekly confab at the construction site at Central Avenue and 40th Place, 20 almost-finished units of affordable housing. En route, Mrs. Battle-Bey surveys the scarred landscape and complains, \"I can't find doughnuts anywhere.\" **********Vermont Slauson owns this building, so she's responsible for riding herd on construction quality and costs. In a trailer cramped with five construction supervisors and an architect, she selects the colors for the oak doors, the table in the laundry room and the child-safe height of the roof railing. One supervisor reports that as soon as they finished painting the outside walls, graffiti vandals sprayed them right through the fence. Mrs. Battle-Bey instructs him to clean it up right away or more will follow and happily pockets two sugary crullers as she leaves. **********After picking up a bean-cheese-avocado burrito and a large lemonade at a Mexican food stand across the street, Mrs. Battle-Bey takes a damage tour along Vernon and Broadway. Flea markets, or \"swap meets,\" were targeted not only because looters wanted goods, especially clothing. They might also have been targeted, she says, because of anger at Koreans who ran the markets but would not let other vendors participate. Many gas-station markets were hit. And one burned-out bank was community owned. **********The problems in Los Angeles \"have been building for the last 10, 15 years,\" she says. \"It's a whole different kind of inner city than it was after the Watts riots, with more ethnic diversity, and some communities in transition.

Its shares have taken a pounding, falling nearly 8 percent in the two days since the giant computer company reported a fivefold jump in profits for the second quarter. **********To be sure, the profits reported on Friday were a few cents a share short of analysts' expectations: $1.25 a share, compared with a consensus estimate of $1.33. But the results would scarcely seem to justify the selloff on Friday and yesterday. I.B.M.'s share price dropped in only two days from $100.25 a share to $92.875. **********Yet the sharp reaction underlines the wariness with which the cottage industry of professional I.B.M. watchers -- 225 securities analysts and 700 portfolio managers -- is following the computer maker's effort to cut costs, eliminate bureaucracy and trot out new products faster. Projections Were Raised **********In the last couple of months, many analysts adopted the view that the overhaul of the International Business Machines Corporation, announced late last year, was going more smoothly than expected, and raised their earnings projections for the year. The company's shares climbed from $81.625 on April 6 to more than $100 last Thursday. **********So while $1.33 a share was the consensus estimate for the quarter, \"the whispers had been that it would come in at more than $1.33 a share,\" said Stephen Cohen, managing director of the Soundview Financial Group. And when the reported profits came in below the consensus, it was more of a blow than the 8-cents-a-share shortfall would suggest. **********The I.B.M. watchers' forecasts for 1992 suddenly headed down. Since I.B.M.'s earnings were reported on Friday, 10 of the 21 analysts who follow I.B.M. and are tracked by the First Call Corporation have reduced their 1992 profit forecasts. The list of securities firms trimming their earnings estimates, and their optimism, reads like a Wall Street Who's Who: Merrill Lynch; Morgan Stanley; Shearson Lehman Brothers; Goldman, Sachs, Salomon Brothers; Smith Barney; Paine Webber; Sanford C. Bernstein; Alex. Brown, and UBS Securities. A Time of Turmoil **********I.B.M. has become an analyst's nightmare. The giant is undergoing a sweeping overhaul at a time of slower growth, price wars and unrelenting technological change in the computer industry. \"There's a heck of a lot more variables in I.B.M. than in most companies,\" said Barry Bosak of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, whose second-quarter estimate of $1.40 a share was a bit high. **********Mr. Cohen of Soundview was one of the few analysts who could claim a bull's-eye with his estimate of $1.25 a share. Yet in the first quarter, he had underestimated the bite of I.B.M.'s cost-cutting program when he forecast a profit of 25 cents a share. The company reported first-quarter earnings of $1.04 a share. \"That's ancient history,\" Mr. Cohen said. **********Many of his peers, no doubt, take comfort from the fact that the same will soon be said of the second quarter. Stephen Dube of the Sherwood Research Group overestimated the quarterly profits by just a nickel. But he expressed a healthy respect for the uncertainty in I.B.M.'s outlook. **********\"The short term is unpredictable, and nobody knows where this industry is going in the long term,\" Mr. Dube said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/29/world/miyazawa-accepts-resignation-of-power-broker.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1992-08-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 611, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Miyazawa Accepts Resignation of Power Broker", "print_headline": "Miyazawa Accepts Resignation of Power Broker", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa accepted the resignation of the governing party's kingmaker today, a day after the official admitted accepting an improper cash contribution from a mob-linked trucking company. Mr. Miyazawa has come under fire for his reported attempts to persuade the official to remain his party positions. **********Mr. Miyazawa had acted after Shin Kanemaru, Japan's most powerful politician, stunned the country on Thursday by announcing at a press conference that he had accepted $4 million in cash from the trucking company and did not report it, as required by law. **********What was particularly striking is that Mr. Kanemaru said he accepted the money in early 1990, only months after Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita was forced to resign because of an influence-peddling scandal. The Liberal Democratic Party vowed at the time that it would reform what is known as money politics. Will Keep Parliament Seat **********Mr. Kanemaru said he was resigning as vice president of the party and as head of its largest faction, from which the Prime Minister derives his support and to whom he owes his office. Mr. Kanemaru, however, will keep his seat in Parliament. **********Some politicians and newspaper editorials said they were astonished that Mr. Miyazawa had sought to persuade Mr. Kanemaru to reverse his decision. **********Few said they understood how the Prime Minister could remain close to a leader who admitted to accepting such a big sum from the scandal-tainted trucking company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. Several of the company's former top executives have been indicted, and it is believed that Mr. Kanemaru was implicated by them in their cooperation with prosecutors. Efforts to Sway Decision **********Today, Mr. Miyazawa sent a series of party elders as envoys to Mr. Kanemaru's mansion in Tokyo. Each of them was said to have reported back that Mr. Kanemaru, a former Deputy Prime Minister, was firm in his resolve. How much of Mr. Miyazawa's efforts was political theater and how much was sincere was difficult to determine. But the spectacle only added to the public cynicism over the ethics of the governing party, which has been hit with a series of money scandals in the last three years. **********\"It was strange to us, also,\" said Hideyuki Aizawa, a Liberal Democratic member of the Parliament. \"It just seems that something happened to Kanemaru to make him do this so hastily. Something.\" **********There was speculation of other senior politicians also being implicated for accepting improper contributions from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a development that politicians and commentators said could bring down Mr. Miyazawa's Government, although there were no signs that this was about to happen. **********News reports have said the former head of Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, Hiroyasu Watanabe, told prosecutors that he had given more than 2 billion yen, or $16 million, to a dozen politicians, including several former Prime Ministers and sitting Cabinet ministers. **********\"All we've learned so far is what happened to 500 million yen\" of those reported contributions, Mr. Aizawa said. \"It should be interesting to find out what happened to the rest.\" **********Mr. Miyazawa also started to try to rebuild his Government's credibility today, meeting with party leaders and reportedly asking that they begin to plan immediately for a major political reform program. The Liberal Democratic Party has promised such reform ever since Mr. Takeshita was forced from office, but has yet to deliver a strong program. The program would reportedly consist of a reapportionment of seats in the Parliament, to remove the heavy overrepresentation of some rural districts, and control the immense flow of money into political coffers that is the norm."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/23/business/credit-markets-amr-is-offering-9-debentures.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMR Is Offering 9% Debentures", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; AMR Is Offering 9% Debentures", "body_text": " **********The AMR Corporation, the holding company for American Airlines, offered $350 million worth of 20-year noncallable debentures yesterday through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********The 9 percent securities were priced at $100, or par, 1.38 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing. **********Because of strong demand, the issue was increased in size from $250 million. **********The securities are rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/19/business/credit-markets-election-day-initiatives-may-affect-bond-issues.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1992-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1017, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Election Day Initiatives May Affect Bond Issues", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Election Day Initiatives May Affect Bond Issues", "body_text": " **********In the tax-exempt bond market, traders and investors face political uncertainty even beyond the outcome of the Presidential election. At the state and local level, there are numerous spending and taxing initiatives that could affect the credit outlook for the state and local governments, which would have a major impact on bonds. **********There are also about $10 billion in bond issues on state and local ballots that are waiting for the thumbs-up or thumbs-down from the voters. **********The impact of the spending initiatives, like those awaiting voter decisons in Colorado and Michigan, would be limited to the bonds from the particular state. But the concern is great enough that the credit-rating agencies are closely monitoring the contests for their potential effect on local credit ratings. Investors, too, must proceed with caution. Already in Colorado there is a rush to get issues sold before Election Day. **********And while the defeat or approval of billions of dollars in new bond issues is not likely to have an immediate influence on the municipal market, the results will provide a sense of voter sentiment that could affect the longer-term flow of bond issues, said James Cooner, a senior vice president at the Bank of New York. A Vote on Spending Limits **********In Colorado, the initiative in question, known locally as the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, would limit both increases in spending and revenue at the state and the local level to the rate of inflation. Surpassing these ceilings would require advance voter approval. **********Because the Colorado proposal would limit the flexibility of govenment to manage its fiscal affairs, \"we are very concerned about it,\" said Ditmar Kopf, assistant vice president at Moody's Investors Service, the credit-rating agency. **********Moody's said the proposal might not affect existing bonds. But the firm said in an analysis that \"passage could seriously erode the credit quality of local governments because of the severe financial and debt management restrictions which would be imposed, as well as the uncertainty created by portions of the proposal.\" Property Taxes in Michigan **********In Michigan, two proposals on the ballot could impair the credit rating of new bonds from state and local governments, some analysts say. One measure would cut by 30 percent the property taxes that pay for school operating costs and would limit growth in property tax assessments to 3 percent, or to the inflation rate if it is lower than 3 percent. **********A second, competing, measure, which was placed on the ballot by the Legislature, would limit all property-tax assessment increases to 5 percent or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower. In the event both proposals are approved, the one with the most votes prevails. Bond Votes' Negative Trend **********Regarding the actual proposed bond issues on the ballot, Mr. Cooner of the Bank of New York said that if the trend of the last two years continued, a major portion of the bonds on the ballot will be defeated. In 1990, 59 percent of the dollar value of state and local bonds were defeated and in 1991, 52 percent were defeated. These setbacks came after voters approved nearly 90 percent of the dollar value of bonds on the ballot between 1982 and 1989. **********Mr. Cooner said the higher level of defeats the last two years indicated that voters \"equated new bond sales today with increased taxes in the future.\" What is more, he said, \"voting negatively on bond issues was a way of expressing dissatisfaction with state and local financial operations.\" **********The $10 billion in ballot proposals is small compared with the total $200 billion of new state and local tax-exempt issues this year. But Mr. Cooner said that a defeat of many of them would be a good indicator of \"voter comfort or discomfort with bond sales in the future.\" **********Of the $10 billion, about half are on the ballot in California, including $1.9 billion in state general obligation bonds and $1.5 billion in bonds to be issued by Los Angeles. There is also an $800 million State of New York bond issue on the ballot and a $345 million proposal on the state ballot in New Jersey. The Clinton Factor **********The Presidential election will have an additional impact on the municipal bond market if the Arkansas Governor, Bill Clinton, wins. His tax-increase proposal, which would raise taxes on people with incomes of $200,000 and higher, could drive more investors into the tax-exempt municipal market as they seek shelter from higher tax rates, analysts say. **********As of now, a tax-exempt bond with a coupon of 6 percent has an after-tax equivalent yield of 8.69 percent. If the current 31 percent top tax rate rises to 36 percent, the after-tax yield for a 6 percent bond jumps to 9.37 percent. **********\"That is significant,\" said Clark Wagner, the portfolio manager for municipal bond funds at First Investment Management Company in New York. Although he argued that many of these high-income investors already have their money in tax-exempt municipal bonds, he said the tax increase surely would not hurt the municipal market. **********But the election itself, if Governor Clinton wins, may swamp the reverberations from these other Election Day issues. **********What investors are most afraid of right now, just over two weeks before Election Day, is Mr. Clinton's promise of a spending package to stimulate the faltering economy. **********While investors may want a stronger economy, the resulting rise in the budget deficit and the threat of higher interest rates and rising inflation that it might bring is a cold shower for the entire bond market, from municipals to Treasuries. **********But given the fall in the prices of municipal and Treasury bonds recently, including the 3/16 -point drop in the 30-year Treasury on Friday, much of the threat of a Clinton stimulus program may have already been priced into the market. **********\"Judging from the market reaction, it appears that they have thrown in the towel on Bush,\" Mr. Wagner said Friday, the morning after the second televised Presidential debate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/26/world/salvadorans-demobilize-with-verbal-sniping.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1992-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 656, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Salvadorans Demobilize, With Verbal Sniping", "print_headline": "Salvadorans Demobilize, With Verbal Sniping", "body_text": " **********After several months' delay, the Salvadoran Government and its former guerrilla adversaries have taken the first steps toward demobilization, but each side has accused the other of not complying fully with the Jan. 16 peace accords. **********Over several days at the end of June and beginning of July, the Government legislated out of existence two of the security forces -- the Treasury Police and National Guard -- while the former rebels demobilized more than 1,600 people, said to be 20 percent of their force. **********But the Government incorporated most members of the two disbanded security forces, estimated at 8,000 men, into two new groups, the Border Police and Military Police, which will form part of the army. **********The guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, for their part, turned in to United Nations peacekeepers only enough weapons for a fraction of the people demobilized. The Government said that the total number of weapons was 220, and guerrilla leaders tacitly confirmed that number. No Shooting Incidents **********Each side has criticized the other's action, but international peacekeepers say there has been no reported incident involving shooting between the two sides to mar the cease-fire that began on Feb. 1. **********The peace accords, which ended more than a decade of civil war between the Washington-backed Government and the leftist guerrillas, involve an interlocking series of steps to be taken by the two sides over two years that are intended to further democratize and modernize Salvadoran society while finding a place in it for the former insurgents. **********Since the accords took effect, the army and the two security forces just disbanded have essentially been confined to bases and recruitment has stopped. The National Police continues to perform police functions pending formation and training of a new police force that is to include some former guerrillas. **********The guerrillas, still armed except for those recently demobilized, have concentrated in 15 security zones around the country from which they are to be demobilized at the rate of 20 percent a month, handing in their weapons to United Nations forces and receiving identity cards allowing them to move into civilian society. **********The Government was supposed to have disbanded the National Guard and Treasury Police on March 1, but military authorities said it was not done because they knew the guerrillas would not comply with their part of the schedule, which was to be concentrated in the 15 zones and begin demobilization by May 1. Schedule Called Too Tight **********Both sides have said the schedule, drawn up in New York under pressure from the United States and the former Soviet Union to end one of the last vestiges of the cold war, is far too tight to be realistic. **********Gen. Rene Emilio Ponce, the Defense Minister, has relentlessly criticized the former guerrillas in recent days for the quantity and quality of the weapons they turned in on July 1. He also charged that they have maintained more than 200 armed people outside of the zones of concentration. **********Jorge Shafick Handal, one of the guerrilla leaders, countered that the guerrillas had never had a high ratio of weapons to combatants. The general dismissed that by citing documented evidence of numerous arms shipments to the rebels from Nicaragua and elsewhere in the war years. **********Mr. Handal acknowledged that most of the people who left the rebel ranks on June 30 to take up civilian life were unarmed \"support personnel\" and \"people of advanced age.\" He said rebel leaders had previously explained to the United Nations peace force their intention to demobilize those people first. **********President Alfredo Cristiani said that the peacekeepers were dissatisfied with the small number of weapons the former guerrillas had turned in, but the peace mission has said nothing about the number of weapons and has limited its public comments to confirming that the demobilization took place."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/14/world/4-weeks-after-protests-for-democracy-anguish-grows-over-missing-thais.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1992-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1260, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "4 Weeks After Protests for Democracy, Anguish Grows Over Missing Thais", "print_headline": "4 Weeks After Protests for Democracy, Anguish Grows Over Missing Thais", "body_text": " **********The Thai Government says 159 people are still missing.

When asked last month about unofficial reports that hundreds had died in the street clashes, he replied coolly, \"Line up the corpses and prove it.\" **********A more widely trusted count is being compiled by Mahidol University. It is based on information from private telephone lines set up to take calls from the family and friends of people missing since troops opened fire on the pro-democracy crowds early on the morning of Monday, May 18. **********The university's missing persons count is 711.

In an editorial last week, the newspaper said it feared the missing were the \"victims of a conspiracy of monumental evil.\" **********Dr. Kritaya Archavanit kul, an assistant professor of demographics at Mahidol who is running the university's missing persons project, said, \"The numbers have been steady for about one week, so we believe that we are close to the real number of people missing.\"  'Double-Check the Figures' **********\"We double-check the figures by calling the families back again and again and sending them letters,\" she said, \"to make sure that the missing people have not returned home.\" **********Dr. Pradit, Mahidol's rector and the head of the Government's investigation, accepts the higher figure. **********The Mahidol list, he said, shows that most of the missing are middle-class Thais who lived in or near Bangkok and worked in private businesses -- hardly the description offered by Thai Army commanders, who have suggested that most of the protesters were Marxist hooligans. On Mahidol's missing persons list, the ratio of men to women is about five to one, and most of the missing are young adults. Reports on the Missing **********\"It would be very unusual that people like this should be missing, that they would not contact their families for weeks,\" he said. **********Investigators say they have received several reports from central Kanchanaburi province that large numbers of military vehicles pulled into an army camp in the province shortly after the soldiers charged protesters in Bangkok early on the morning of May 18. According to the reports, earth-moving equipment could then be heard at work inside the compound. **********Investigators say that it is possible that some of the missing protesters are still being detained secretly. **********But Thai democracy groups say that seems unlikely, if only because battered Army leaders know their careers might not survive such a revelation. Secret detentions might also jeopardize a disputed amnesty decree issued by former Prime Minister Suchinda Kraprayoon only hours before his resignation last month. The decree, if upheld, would bar prosecution of military officials, as well as General Suchinda, for actions in the crackdown. Believes Missing Are Dead **********Gothom Arya, a leader of the democracy movement and an engineering professor at Chulalongkorn University, said he believed that most of the missing are now dead. **********The best hope of resolving the mystery of the missing protesters appears to rest with the newly appointed interim Prime Minister, Anand Panyarachun, a respected businessman and former diplomat named to replace General Suchinda last Wednesday. **********Chawaeng Rathangsu, a Bangkok insurance salesmen, is among those who believe the Government is hiding the truth about what happened to the missing protesters, among them his 15-year-old son, Chaitawat. Went to a Demonstration **********Mr. Chawaeng is a member of the Palang Dharma, or Power of Virtue, political party, whose leaders have been at the forefront of the democracy movement, and on May 17 he took his son to what was being billed as a peaceful demonstration. **********They remained at night as the demonstration turned violent, with soldiers and police firing onto the crowd. **********At about 5 in the morning, as protesters ran to escape the soldiers, Mr. Chawaeng and his son were separated. Mr. Chawaeng said it was the last time he saw Chaitawat -- \"a shy boy who had never been in trouble with the police, or in trouble with anybody.\" **********Mr. Chawaeng was later arrested along without thousands of other demonstrators who were rounded up and taken to nearby army and police camps. He was held for about 12 hours and had assumed, and hoped, his son had gone home."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/20/business/commodity-fraud-charges.html": {"writer_name": "Matthew Wald", "pub_date": "1992-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 347, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Commodity Fraud Charges", "print_headline": "Commodity Fraud Charges", "body_text": " **********The Commodities Futures Trading Commission said yesterday that it had filed administrative complaints against eight brokers and traders on the New York Mercantile Exchange; the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, and the Commodity Exchange. **********The charges grow out of an extensive investigation of civil and criminal violations that became public in May 1989 with a series of raids on the offices of member firms.

But no one could fail to notice that something was wrong. Even under a bright sun, the horizon vanished in a pale haze. The air had the taste of bus exhaust mixed with saccharine. Traffic Is Lighter **********In January 1989, Mexico City extended school vacations for several weeks because of pollution dangers. But it had never before imposed the series of measures that went into effect this morning. They included reductions of 50 percent to 75 percent in the operations of about 225 major industries, a ban on the use of half of all Government vehicles in the city, and a halt to road work. **********Despite an improvement in the readings today, residents of the city still complained, eyes still watered, throats still burned and heads still throbbed. The traffic was noticeably lighter than usual today along many main streets. Many women took their school-aged children to work. But much of the city's business went on as usual. And some even seemed to go better. **********Traffic police officers, many of whom live on the huge bribes they can extort if they catch a car driving on the weekday when it is supposed to sit idle, appeared especially vigilant. On any given day, one-fifth of all cars -- their license plates coded by color -- are not allowed on the streets. But as part of the emergency measures today, another fifth were ordered out of circulation, and some people expected a police windfall of ill-informed drivers. **********\"If I grab just one of them, it will be 30 days' pay at the minimum wage,\" said Sgt. Rodrigo Montes de Oca, who stood directing traffic along the Paseo de la Reforma, a once-elegant avenue that courses through the city center.

Sergeant Montes de Oca reached into his patrol car, grabbed a napkin and wiped his face with it. Then he handed the blackened paper back to the younger officer. \"You really want to know?\" the sergeant asked him. Surrounded by Mountains **********Like Los Angeles, Mexico City suffers from dual geographic afflictions. It is vast and full of cars, only a fraction of which burn unleaded gasoline. And even more than Los Angeles, Mexico City is ringed by mountains that trap the smog during regular thermal inversions. On Monday, there was almost no wind. **********California authorities have at times urged school districts in the Los Angeles area to curtail sports activities when smog is at high levels, but an official there said he could not recall any outright closings of schools due to air pollution. **********Comparing Mexico City's smog to that of New York City, Eric A. Goldstein, an air-quality specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said by telephone from Manhattan, \"For a typical Mexico City resident, it's like living in the Holland Tunnel.\" **********Attesting to the partial success of Government pollution-control measures, a handful of contaminants that were omnipresent in Mexico City until a few years ago -- lead, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide -- stayed below toxic levels during the emergency, said Fernando Menendez, the city's pollution-control chief. But early on Monday afternoon, when Mexico City's ozone hit the most dangerous level recorded since the current monitoring system was instituted in 1989, its peak was more than triple that of the worst ozone pollution recorded in New York City in 1990. **********That year, according to a New York State air-quality report quoted by Mr. Goldstein, the ozone in New York City exceeded maximum acceptable levels nine times. Mexico City surpassed similar standards on 303 days that year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/17/business/laredo-tex-braces-for-free-trade.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1992-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1434, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Laredo, Tex., Braces for Free Trade", "print_headline": "Laredo, Tex., Braces for Free Trade", "body_text": " **********For the last 250 years, the economic rhythms in this town at Mexico's doorstep have been set by events on the other side of the Rio Grande. But it is clear that few developments in Laredo's colorful history will prove more epochal than the removal of high tariffs that protected Mexican commerce from competitors in the North. **********After it joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1987, Mexico slashed tariffs on American imports of shoes, apparel and soft drinks, to an average of 5 percent today from 80 percent. Since then the Laredo economy -- dominated by warehousing, trucking and retailing businesses -- has been surging. **********And if the optimists are correct, the economic growth will continue as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement on which negotiators completed work last week. The deal still requires legislative approval in Canada, Mexico and the United States, but residents, developers and bankers here are already hoping that American and Canadian companies will begin to build manufacturing and distribution plants in Laredo to be closer to Mexican markets.  The Obstacles to Growth **********But obstacles on both sides of the border could prevent or restrict those investments. They include poor roads made dangerous, and occasionally deadly, by the lengthening caravans of 18-wheel trucks bearing down from the north. And some local businessmen say there is a tradition of occasional graft in the Mexican courts that would make expansion by American companies risky. **********Laredo, a town with an Old World Spanish feel, is populated mainly by poor Mexican-Americans. Half of all freight shipments moving into Mexico from the United States pass through Laredo, which sits on the Pan American Highway, 150 miles south of San Antonio and north of Monterrey, a big Mexican industrial city with more than three million people. **********As the United States' overall exports to Mexico have tripled to more than $33.5 billion in five years, so has the number of trucks crossing at the International Bridge at Laredo. Most haul raw materials, component parts and other products to 170 maquiladora plants in Nuevo Laredo and other towns in northern Mexico. **********Analysts and business leaders here say that more maquiladoras, assembly sites for everything from wire harnesses for automobiles to shoes and kitchen cabinets, will be built whether or not the trade agreement is enacted. The cheap labor, with hourly wage rates near $1 now, has steadily lured more American companies since the Mexican Government sharply devalued the peso against the dollar in 1982 -- a decline that has continued virtually unabated. **********But many Laredo business owners who prospered by adjusting to the ways of protectionist Mexico say the free trade era could ruin them. The network of customs brokers that sprang up to guide shippers through the rituals of Mexican customs agents is threatened. **********So are Laredo trucking companies that do most of their work within 20 miles of the border, handling the transfer of trailers stocked with American goods onto Mexican-chartered trucks. Mexican law currently bans American trucking companies from hauling any goods south of the border, but that stricture would be phased out over seven years under the free-trade pact. 'The Fear of the Unknown' **********\"If a U.S. carrier can go all the way to Mexico City, and a Mexican carrier can go all the way to Chicago, there won't be any need to stop in Laredo,\" said George Quesada, president of Gateway Transfer Inc. in Laredo. He said 80 percent of Gateway's business was transferring trailer rigs between American and Mexican trucking companies. **********Local bankers and business experts agree that free trade will jolt some parts of the border economy. Recent studies by the University of Texas and Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, concluded that many big American retailers would open stores in big population centers like Mexico City and Monterrey. **********That would mean fewer Mexican consumers traveling by car and bus from as far away as Mexico City to shop at American border stores, the studies concluded. Gerry Schwebel, senior vice president at the International Bank of Commerce, the largest bank based in Laredo, said many business owners like Mr. Quesada were confused and worried. **********\"The biggest concern we have is the fear of the unknown,\" Mr. Schwebel said. \"It's how the small and medium-sized companies adjust to improving competition that will make them succeed or get hurt.\" **********For most of Laredo, the easing of trade barriers so far has been a boon. The jobless rate, averaging 9.6 percent this year through June, is the lowest in more than a decade. About 10,000 jobs have been added in the last four years, a gain of 23 percent, to 54,000, according to the Texas Employment Commission. The average annual pay in last year's fourth quarter, was $17,700, up 7.7 percent from $16,400 at the end of 1990. **********The opening of a new Wal-Mart discount store three miles north of the Rio Grande on July 25 gives one measure of how Laredo retail sales have surged since the Mexican Government pared tariffs five years ago. **********The hulking Wal-Mart store, the biggest of the nearly 1,800 Wal-Marts in the nation that do not sell groceries, replaced a smaller store opened in 1983 that had posted more sales in each of the last five years than any other Wal-Mart. **********Other national retailers are moving in. Laredo's first Toys \"R\" Us is being erected as part of a new mall that will stand across a field from the new Wal-Mart. A Target discount store is ready to open nearby. **********Vicente V. Garza, who owns several shops in town along the river, said more Mexicans were shopping in Laredo and border towns closer to the Gulf of Mexico, including McAllen, Harlingen and Brownsville, because the GATT rules had effectively lowered prices Mexicans pay for merchandise north of the Rio Grande. **********Local officials are scrambling to build new roads and expand other city services, while Laredoans complain of a shortage of apartments and new homes. Analysts and builders say warehouse space is leased quickly. The Laredo population is expected to reach 200,000 later this decade, up from 133,000 today. 'We Already Have Free Trade' **********For now, Laredo is the fastest growing city in Texas. The city manager, Peter H. Vargas, said new construction, business expansions and other indicators of growth should continue to rise about 25 percent a year if the free trade pact is enacted. **********\"Free trade? For practical purposes, we already have free trade in Laredo,\" Mr. Vargas said. Not entirely, of course. Mexican labor laws still make it far more costly for American companies to ship concrete forms, build metal warehouses and provide other goods and services in Mexico than in the United States. One example: Concrete mixed by machine in the United States and made into forms for roads, walls or other uses, must be priced in Mexico as if the entire process were done by hand. Wary of Expanding South **********And Mexico's legal system makes some border business executives wary of expanding south of the Rio Grande. There are no jury trials in Mexico, and legal codes are far more brief than in the United States, factors that give Mexican judges vastly more power than American judges. **********Mr. Garza, whose stores generated sales of $40 million in American border towns last year mostly from Mexican shoppers, said he had no plans to open stores across the river in Nuevo Loredo, with its 475,000 people; near the Gulf of Mexico, where another 600,000 Mexicans live by the border, or in populous Monterrey, three hours south of Laredo by car. **********\"Even with your own people, you can still get into trouble in Mexico with their laws,\" he said. \"If you try to claim anything or sue anybody, it's only the final word of the judge.\" **********Mr. Garza said that many Mexicans used to buy goods in big quantities at wholesale prices from him and other retailers on the American side, then bribe Mexican customs agents to avoid big tariffs when they crossed the border.

That could eventually lead to allied combat planes threatening to shoot down Serbian aircraft defying the ban. **********The ban was imposed by the United Nations with some fanfare in October to try to stop Serbian forces advancing through Bosnia in their campaign of \"ethnic cleansing,\" in which they have killed or expelled Muslims and Croats. At the time, there were warnings that the ban would eventually lead to problems over how it should be enforced. **********Despite the ban and warnings, the Serbs never ceased flying transport helicopters and gunships and they resumed flights of fixed-wing warplanes in mid-November, officials said. In the last month and a half, the United States has confirmed more than 200 unauthorized flights. **********European and American officials have been reluctant to do anything about the violations because they do not want allied peacekeeping forces in the area to become targets of attack or to be sucked further into the war raging in the Balkans after the breakup of Yugoslavia last year. **********Acting Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger is expected to raise the issue with more than two dozen foreign ministers at a conference on Bosnia in Geneva this month. **********The British Government today gave its strongest public indication that it might be willing to support some degree of enforcement of the ban. But there remains considerable disagreement inside the Bush Administration over whether to enforce the ban, and if so how, with some officials questioning the wisdom of using allied combat planes to shoot down Serbian aircraft. **********American officials who favor maintaining the status quo, including a number of senior Pentagon officials, argue that imposition of the ban has sharplycut the number of flights made over Bosnia and has apparently stopped the bombing and strafing of villages in the remnants of Yugoslavia. **********But other officials say that the lack of enforcement has made the ban meaningless and may embolden the Serbs to spread the war to the Kosovo region, where the Muslim majority is also fearful of persecution and attacks by Serbian forces. **********Some flights now being conducted appear to be used to move troops, deliver supplies and train pilots and soldiers, American intelligence reports say. The reports indicate, for example, that Serbs have been flying Yugoslav-made bombers on daily training missions out of the Bosnian Serbs' main air force base at Banja Luka northwest of Sarajevo. There are also unconfirmed intelligence reports that some flights have been used to attack ground targets. Armed Enforcement Sought **********The United States strongly pushed for armed enforcement as part of the initial Security Council resolution establishing the ban on Serbian flights in October. But it was forced to retreat because of opposition from both France and Britain, which expressed concern for the safety of their troops taking part in the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********President-elect Bill Clinton has said nothing about the deteriorating situation in the former Yugoslavia since the election. But during the campaign he took a more assertive position than Mr. Bush, saying in July that the United States should take the lead in seeking United Nations authorization for air strikes to protect the relief effort in the Balkans and should lend military support to such an operation. **********In London today, Prime Minister John Major said that Britain was willing to consider stronger enforcement measures, including the possible use of allied combat aircraft, if its allies and United Nations partners agreed soon that stronger action was needed. **********On the other hand, Mr. Major emphasized in remarks in the House of Commons that Britain remained opposed to direct military intervention in Bosnia, despite growing demands by Islamic nations and British opposition politicians for a tougher line against Serbian forces. **********Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, acknowledged in an interview with the BBC today that there was a problem about the ban on flights in Bosnia, adding that Britain was discussing at the United Nations and with its allies whether it should be enforced. He said that it was \"conceivable\" that Britain might consider the use of military planes to enforce the ban. 'Further Steps' Considered **********Until now, the Administration has been reluctant to characterize the flights as outright violations of the ban because there is no incontrovertible evidence that the planes and helicopters have conducted bombing raids against Bosnian targets. **********In a sign of the lingering ambivalence of the Bush Administration on how far to go in describing Serbian flouting of the United Nations resolution, Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, referred to the incidents as \"flights which appear to be violations.\" **********But in the first public hint that consultations on enforcement have begun, Mr. Boucher said, \"We are considering further steps in this regard.\" **********There remains considerable disagreement among policy makers and military officials on how aggressive the United States should be in enforcing the ban. **********\"It is clear that the Bosnian Serbs are violating the no-fly zone in massive numbers and we need to move to enforce it,\" a senior Administration official said, referring to the ban on flights. A senior Pentagon official, on the other hand, was more circumspect. He said that the main goal of the ban was to halt the bombings and that so as long as it did that the United States might be able to tolerate the flights.  'A Bit of a Tightrope' **********\"We're walking a bit of a tightrope on the no-fly zone,\" the senior official said. \"If the Serbs ever started using flights for hostile military missions, we'd go to the U.N. for an enforcement resolution.\" **********The pattern of fighting throughout Bosnia reflects a military stalemate.

Trump has reached an agreement to turn over 49 percent of his interest in the landmark Plaza Hotel in Manhattan to a group of banks led by Citibank, people involved in the talks said yesterday. **********The nearly completed deal is one of the last in a long line of debt restructurings that Mr. Trump has reached with his creditors. It would cancel $125 million of Mr. Trump's personally guaranteed debt, plus accrued interest, and would give the developer more favorable terms on the remaining $300 million of mortgage debt. **********The Plaza deal is similar to other Trump deals in swapping mortgage debt for equity, and it would leave Mr. Trump in control of the hotel, although his equity would be heavily encumbered by bank liens. **********To keep control of the Plaza, as well as two Atlantic City casinos, Mr. Trump must meet certain business projections over the next several years. If he failed to meet the projections and make the required interest payments, he would lose control of his remaining stake in the hotel. Subject to a Lien **********Mr. Trump's 51 percent stake would still be subject to a lien held by the banks that lent him $125 million. He would be allowed to pay interest as low as 5 percent on the $300 million of mortgage debt if he could not pay the original floating rate. **********The deal, which was reached last week, values the Plaza at about $260 million. Mr. Trump paid $409 million for the hotel in 1988 and will retain a $300 million mortgage on it. In 1990, the Trump Organization estimated the value of the Plaza at $830 million, while the Kenneth Leventhal Company, which was retained by Mr. Trump, put the value at $413 million to $500 million. **********\"The deal has been agreed upon by the whole group of banks and Mr. Trump, and it is 49 percent for the banks and 51 percent for Trump,\" said Richard Wilhelm, president of the Plaza Hotel, yesterday. **********The banks and Mr. Trump still have to sign a final agreement for the deal to take effect. **********Despite the formidable array of problems and the billions in debt facing Mr. Trump, he has managed to convince scores of creditors that they should grant him more time in which to try to increase the value of his deeply indebted assets and that they should release him from his guarantees for hundreds of millions of dollars of debt. **********In the case of the Penn Yards, a 76-acre tract of undeveloped land on the West Side of Manhattan, Mr. Trump has been able to improve the value by negotiating for zoning approval with city officials and community groups. **********If the Plaza proposal goes through, Mr. Trump will be personally liable for at least $115 million in debt, down from roughly $900 million in 1990. **********But Mr. Trump is far from out of the woods. In June 1993, about $350 million in mortgage debt will come due and it is unclear whether the banks will roll over the debts or demand payment. The $300 million mortgage on the Plaza comes due in 1995. In addition, Mr. Trump's $115 million of personally guaranteed debt matures in 1995. Whether he will be able to pay that plus tens of millions more that will have come due by then is anyone's guess. Eleventh-Hour Negotiations **********For two years, Mr. Trump has faced 11th-hour negotiations to shore up his empire, which has been crumbling as a result of his heavy borrowing to buy high-profile assets at inflated prices during the 1980's. With the collapse of real estate prices at the end of the decade and the troubles in the gaming and airline industries that were aggravated by the recession, Mr. Trump became trapped in a cash squeeze and was finally rescued by banks that stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars if he was forced into bankruptcy. **********Between bondholders of his Atlantic City casinos and the banks that liberally lent him hundreds of millions of dollars, Mr. Trump and the top executives of the Trump Organization managed to cobble together a series of deals that give him more time to improve the performance and value of some of his assets. **********Banks have also taken back some assets in lieu of the debt on them. Among these are the Trump Shuttle, which USAir is now operating; the Trump Princess Yacht; a 50 percent interest in the Grand Hyatt hotel in midtown Manhattan; a 28 percent stake in Alexander's department store; three Atlantic City land parcels, and hundreds of New York condominiums in the Trump Palace and another Manhattan building.  Action at the Casinos **********In addition, Mr. Trump has swapped 50 percent of Trump's Castle casino and 50 percent of the Trump Taj Mahal, two Atlantic City casinos, for more favorable debt terms granted by holders of junk bonds that he sold to finance the casinos. **********In the case of the Plaza Hotel, the proposed deal underscores the developer's difficulties. He bought the hotel for about $409 million in 1988, or about 25 times the hotel's 1988 cash flow of $16 million, from the Robert M. Bass Group of Fort Worth. With accrued interest and other borrowings, the total debt on the property before this latest deal exceeded $430 million and interest was accruing at a floating rate. **********The new deal would leave the original $300 million mortgage and its floating-rate debt in place, but it would allow Mr. Trump to pay as little as 5 percent interest and accrue the balance. By trading the personally guaranteed $125 million debt for 49 percent of his equity in the hotel, and through other such deals, Mr. Trump is trying to clear the way for a financial comeback. Remaining Questions **********Final details of the new partnership agreement are still being worked out. It is not known whether the banks will be free to sell their 49 percent equity interest in the Plaza. **********The Plaza, which is rated as one of New York's best hotels and has been performing strongly for the last few years, has not been able to generate enough cash to make its debt payments for several years now. In 1990, interest payments on the acquisition debt cost about $41.3 million, but the hotel had only $21 million in cash flow. Last year, the hotel's cash flow totaled $17.6 million, while the total accrued debt-service cost was about $42 million. **********This year, Mr. Wilhelm estimates, the hotel will generate nearly $21 million in cash flow before its debt-service cost, which will be about $15 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/23/world/official-serbian-voting-tally-puts-hard-liner-way-ahead.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1992-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 483, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Official Serbian Voting Tally Puts Hard-Liner Way Ahead", "print_headline": "Official Serbian Voting Tally Puts Hard-Liner Way Ahead", "body_text": " **********The president of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, consolidated his lead today in official returns from Sunday's balloting, in which he sought re-election.

Many of those who participate in the market expressed intense concern that the changes, if put in place clumsily, could backfire and drive up the Government's borrowing costs. **********But on Wall Street and in Washington, there was widesrpead acknowledgment that the report represents a watershed -- a shift away from the informal, behind-the-scenes regulation that has characterized the Treasury market through most of its life and a move toward a more rational, codified approach that scholars say is demanded by the modern market's size and importance. **********\"In the life of the Treasury market, these are very dramatic changes,\" said Jerome H. Powell, Assistant Treasury Secretary for domestic finance, after the release of the formal report detailing many of these administrative and regulatory changes. **********Stephen G. Thieke, president of J. P. Morgan Securities in New York and chairman of the Public Securities Association committee set up after Salomon Brothers' bidding violations in the Treasury securities market came to light in the summer, agreed that \"the idea of clarifying and codifying the rules\" that govern the market \"is one of the big positives\" in the package of new and proposed changes. **********With the Salomon disclosures, debate started in the markets and in the Government over who should regulate the marketplace, and how aggressively that policing should be carried out. **********The recommendations announced today were jointly prepared by the Treasury, the Federal Reserve System and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Changes Already in Place **********One proposal, still under study by the Treasury, would change the basic form of the bidding for the Government's debt. Others, already being put in place, call for the Treasury to sell additional securities whenever an acute shortage of one issue distorts prices and for the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, which conducts debt auctions for the Treasury, to spot-check the validity of customer bids and confirm that large bidders actually received the securities. In addition, the new rules call for the New York Fed to redefine the role that the largest Government securities dealers, called primary dealers, play in the market. **********With respect to the Treasury's willingness to sell additional securities, Mr. Thieke was more cautious in his response. The idea has potential, he said. \"But that is a part of the report where we really need further clarification of how it would be implemented.\" **********More controversial, Mr. Thieke said, will be the suggested changes in the primary-dealer system and in the auction method. Lawmaker Is Disappointed **********The report also drew fire for what it did not include. Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, said today that he was disappointed that the three regulators could not agree on the need for improved pricing information and closer tracking of the individual transactions and investor holdings in the marketplace. **********\"The regulators seem to be taking a see-no-evil, hear-no-evil approach to monitoring the market position of large traders,\" Mr. Markey said. \"The report's legislative recommendations make it clear that Treasury and the Fed remain reluctant regulators.\" **********Eugene Rotberg, the former vice president and treasurer of the World Bank, sees the opposite danger: The package of rule changes goes too far and will overregulate the market on which the Government relies to finance its debt at the lowest possible cost.  Possible Cost to Taxpayer **********\"I just don't see how this package can work,\" Mr. Rotberg said. \"The people I know on the Street confirm that this will increase the uncertainty to be borne by the market, and that will inevitably increase the costs to be borne by the taxpayers.\" **********Not everyone agreed. Merton H. Miller, a winner of the the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science and professor of finance at the University of Chicago, applauded the Treasury's intention to consider a new auction process that would sell all the proffered securities at a single price, rather than the current method in which bids are filled at varying prices until the full auction amount is spoken for. \"This is a perfectly standard method, and there is simply no reason why it should drive up the borrowing costs,\" he said. **********And John Burrs, president of the CRT Government Securities Corporation in New York, said that any uneasiness in the market was likely to be short-lived. \"Any change in the bidding process for a period of time will discourage people until they get used to it,\" he said. As for the Treasury's willingness to sell additional debt if a shortage develops, he noted that such intervention would occur after an issue is auctioned. Since it is the auction price that determines the price to the taxpayers, he said, \"I don't see at all that it would necessarily raise the price to taxpayers.\" **********In many of the proposals and new procedures disclosed today, including the gradual redefinition of the role of large primary dealers, the Treasury is just catching up, in Professor Miller's view. \"Their old rules didn't quite require you to use a quill pen, but they might as well have,\" he said. \"The primary-dealer system may have been O.K. back in the 20's or even as late as the 50's, but you just do not need that kind of a market any more.\" **********Joseph Grundfest, associate professor of law at Stanford and a former commissioner of the S.E.C., said today's report from the three regulatory agencies \"shows that their heart is in the right place\" with respect to developing a more rational framework for monitoring the Treasury market. \"But there needs to be a careful assessment of the details associated with these ideas,\" he warned, echoing a common refrain from the marketplace, \"because in the real world, success and failure lies not in the broad brush strokes, but in the details.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/20/business/for-swiss-banks-solid-world-shifts.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1992-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1737, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Swiss Banks, Solid World Shifts", "print_headline": "For Swiss Banks, Solid World Shifts", "body_text": " **********Add one more item to the list of the world's disappearing certainties: Swiss banking, long an unchanging symbol of discreet prosperity, is suddenly mired in difficulties that are ruffling the sang-froid of the nation's bankers. **********Once a bastion of security in a divided Europe, Switzerland and its banks now find themselves isolated in a Europe coalescing around them. A series of setbacks -- including the abrupt collapse of a mid-sized regional bank, the disclosure of several major bad loans, and the downgrading of Credit Suisse's credit rating -- have heightened a national mood of troubled self-scrutiny. **********\"We are like a big corporation that grows fast and then flattens out into a shaky phase,\" said Rolf Beeler, the head of international operations for Swiss Volksbank, the country's fourth-largest bank. \"We are now in that shaky phase, and have to decide what we are and where we are headed.\" **********Volksbank has announced a 38 percent plunge in profits for 1991 and the cutting of its dividend by 46 percent, reflecting higher provisions for bad loans, especially in real estate. **********In part, such problems reflect the plight of the once-solid Swiss economy, which has suffered a recession, a plunge of 20 to 30 percent in real estate prices and the indignity of much higher inflation than France and Germany over the last year. **********Although inflation is now down to 4.9 percent after peaking at more than 6 percent, it is still higher than for several of Switzerland's neighbors and more than double the average rate of the postwar years. Economic stagnation is expected to persist through the end of this year. **********But beyond this, the precise role of a banking industry that has traditionally offered a neutral refuge in a Europe divided into conflicting blocs has been called into question by the end of the cold war. **********\"The position of Swiss banks has often been one of a safe haven,\" said John J. Kriz, who follows Swiss banks for Moody's Investors Services. \"But after the collapse of the Soviet Union, there is less demand for this type of positioning.\" **********Now, said Werner Sigg, an executive vice president of Swiss Volksbank, other European financial centers are increasingly able to satisfy conservative investors. \"Political security is not an exclusivity of Switzerland any more,\" he said. \"The European Community has made other currencies very stable, and it's tougher for us to compete.\" Some Unthinkable Things **********Certainly, some unthinkable things have happened in Switzerland recently. Spar und Leihkasse Thun, a regional bank with assets of about $700 million, collapsed in October, and national television showed the solid citizens of the Swiss countryside lining up to try to recover their money. There is no equivalent in Switzerland to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. **********\"It was deeply traumatic,\" says Peter Walser, a vice president of the Swiss Bank Corporation. \"To see people trying to salvage their money from a bank with its shutters down was something we never thought could happen in Switzerland.\" **********Then, last month, two of the country's three largest banks, Credit Suisse and the Swiss Bank, suffered a bruising indignity. Moody's stripped Credit Suisse of its triple-A credit rating, the coveted badge of the world's best banks, and said the triple-A rating of the Swiss Bank Corporation had been placed under review. The other member of the so-called big three, Union Bank of Switzerland, was not affected. **********A triple-A rating is rare; it amounts to a statement that funds deposited with the bank carry almost no risk. Although two other leading rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and IBCA Inc. of Britain, did not change their triple-A ratings of the two banks, Jorge Neef, chief spokesman for Credit Suisse, conceded that \"image-wise, the Moody's decision was not very good for us at all.\" As one local newspaper noted bluntly, \"The crown of banking has been sullied.\" Moody's Reasons **********In its decision, Moody's cited the real estate loan portfolios of the two banks, the strengthening of other financial centers, a more competitive environment in Switzerland, onerous domestic taxation on securities transactions, and the uncertainty over whether Switzerland would join the European Community. It raised the possibility of \"a broad and more rapid restructuring of Swiss banking,\" Moody's said. **********Some believe Moody's was excessively alarmist. The Swiss Bank and Credit Suisse, the world's 27th- and 38th-largest banks in assets, rank 13th and 26th in shareholder equity. Union Bank of Switzerland, the world's 23d largest in assets, ranks first in shareholder equity, with $13.2 billion. **********Over the next two months, the big three banks are all expected to announce solid 1991 results, buoyed by improved margins on international commercial loans and sharply improved performances in securities and foreign exchange trading. **********Credit Suisse, for example, expects 1991 group profits in the region of $571 million, a return to 1989 levels after its poor 1990 showing, when profits were $385 million. Service Termed Overcritical **********\"Switzerland is in transition as a banking center, but so is the banking industry throughout the world, and I think Moody's was overcritical,\" said Robert Studer, president of Union Bank's executive board. The bank's profits are expected to be better than in 1990, when the group earned $606 million, and also higher than in 1989, when earnings were $668 million. **********Among the enduring advantages of Swiss banks that several executives cite are their long experience in international portfolio management and their flexibility. \"Where else,\" Mr. Studer asked, \"can you walk into a bank, open an account in Swiss Francs, dollars or ECU's, and ask for your statements in English, German, French or Italian?\" **********Moreover, the tradition of extreme discretion remains strong. Robin Munro-Davis, managing director of the IBCA ratings service, believes such a distinction remains important. \"The climate is tougher, but Swiss banks still have a unique ability to attract private banking -- that is to say the rich -- with their discretion and unusually good service,\" he said. **********However, discretion no longer means tolerance of abuse. Banks have become more severe in curbing deposits of suspect funds and more cooperative in money-laundering investigations. **********\"On money-laundering questions, our regulations are now probably stricter than anywhere else in Europe,\" said Mr. Walser of the Swiss Bank. \"You cannot open an anonymous account and our checks on the origin of money have become very stringent.\" A New Competition **********Other adjustments, some painful, appear inevitable for Swiss banking. Everyone in the business agrees that the country is overbanked. Where cartel systems used to protect everyone -- all banks offered the same mortgage rates until two years ago -- now banks have to compete. They are doing so in a tough economic climate. **********The collapse of the Spar und Leikhasse Thun bank thus seems certain to presage a period of consolidation. According to one analysis distributed by Credit Suisse, the number of banks in Switzerland will fall to 520 by the end of the decade from 625 today. More than half of the reduction will come as smaller regional banks drop to 150 from 204. **********\"There will be a transition, but we hope an orderly one, so as not to attract too much international attention,\" Mr. Neef of Credit Suisse said. \"There will be nothing on the scale of the savings-and-loan disaster.\" **********Already, the Swiss Bankers Association has set up a group to help avoid a recurrence of the Spar collapse by identifying problems early and encouraging either mergers between small banks or rescues by larger ones. Union Bank, for example, recently took over a smaller bank in the Bern region. **********For big banks, the fallout from the continuing recession, some ill-conceived loans and the collapse of real estate prices will put pressure on their domestic profits this year. **********Mr. Walser of the Swiss Bank said that the bank would increase its write-offs and provisions for losses to more than a billion Swiss francs this year from 734.6 million in 1991. Among the Swiss Bank's problem loans is a $130 million credit to R. H. Macy & Company, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month. The Swiss Bank also lent money to Robert Maxwell and to the collapsed Omni Holding group of Werner Rey, the Swiss financier. **********The Union Bank has about $32 billion of real estate loans, representing about 22 percent of total assets, and Mr. Studer said the bank would be increasing its loan-loss provisions. **********\"All the banks are going to be under pressure on their domestic base, from real estate problems and heavy competition in a saturated market,\" said Roger Gough, a European banking analyst at Barings. \"Things are not, by any means, going to be easy as they once were.\" **********An additional question is the effect of possible membership in the European Community. Although the Swiss Government favors eventual entry, it is not imminent. Could Hurt Tradition **********Membership could aid the Swiss banks by stimulating the economy and attracting more highly skilled workers to Switzerland. But it would spell the end of Switzerland's special status as a country apart, and could, Mr. Studer said, \"threaten to some degree our tradition of discretion and privacy for clients.\" **********Most banks seem to favor membership. They note that one community member, Luxembourg, has bank secrecy laws at least as stringent as Switzerland's. The only area of conflict could be in tax investigations, where Swiss banks refuse to reveal details of clients' accounts unless their strict definition of evidence of tax fraud is met. **********Behind the banks' acceptance of the community, there lies the realization that Switzerland can no longer rely on its special status to thrive, but must compete head-to-head with other major financial centers. **********To achieve this, banks hope their recent difficulties will lead the Government to lift a tax of 0.75 percent to 1.5 percent on stock trading, which makes it hard for them to compete in this area. **********\"For a long time, we have been under political pressure,\" Mr. Beeler of Volksbank said. \"There was a feeling Swiss banks were too big, too powerful and perhaps they should be cut down to size. Now I think the Government has suddenly realized that you have to be careful with the golden cow because it may be vulnerable, after all.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/12/world/nicaraguan-money-scandal-threatens-a-chamorro-ally.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1992-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 758, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nicaraguan Money Scandal Threatens a Chamorro Ally", "print_headline": "Nicaraguan Money Scandal Threatens a Chamorro Ally", "body_text": " **********The Government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is caught in growing accusations of misuse of public funds that could damage the credibility of the son-in-law she depends on to run the country. **********Some foreign aid is involved in the scandals, which include allegations of vote buying and bad loans by state banks. **********Mrs. Chamorro's chief minister and a son-in-law, Antonio Lacayo, has not been directly implicated, but the man being investigated in connection with vote buying, Antonio Ibarra, was his deputy minister at the time. **********Mr. Ibarra, who has since fled to Miami, is the focus of a broader investigation by the Controller General, Guillermo Potoy, who plans to release a report in mid-July. He implied in an interview that it would touch on many sensitive areas. Killing of Teen-Ager **********Among the Government's problems are $100 million to $200 million lost through bad loans by state banks, mostly to state companies created during the Sandinista era, and accusations that a former aide spent some $400,000 to buy votes of seven members of the National Assembly on legislation favoring the Sandinistas. **********Mr. Potoy said he had not looked into whether corruption was involved in the loan losses but had \"put many state entities on a priority list\" to be investigated when he has auditors free. **********The financial questions have come to light at the moment that another mainstay of Mrs. Chamorro's Government, Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra, the army chief, could face trial for the attempted cover-up of a killing nearly two years ago. **********On July 2, a criminal court judge ruled that the military justice system should prosecute eight of General Ortega's bodyguards in the shooting death of a 16-year-old boy who was fired on as he tried to pass a caravan carrying General Ortega. The judge also said General Ortega should go before a military court because of evidence that he helped try to cover up army involvement in the killing. **********The unlikely alliance between a former Sandinista guerrilla, General Ortega, and a former businessman, Mr. Lacayo, is the essence of Mrs. Chamorro's two-year-old Government, an arrangement brought about by Mr. Lacayo's conviction that the defeated Sandinistas would not allow Mrs. Chamorro to govern if they did not have a place on power councils. **********That policy has embittered leaders of Mrs. Chamorro's former political coalition, the United Nicaraguan Opposition, most of whom have effectively become the opposition to the Government they helped put in office. **********The United Nicaraguan Opposition members of the legislature wanted to roll back the so-called \"pinata,\" the major giveaway of land, houses and vehicles carried out by the Sandinistas just before Mrs. Chamorro took office. Mrs. Chamorro vetoed the rollback, but the Legislature had the votes to override the veto. That is said to have led to an attempt from within the executive branch to buy the votes of seven United Nicaraguan Opposition legislators late last year. **********The legislators, although they did switch their votes, have denied that they did so in return for payoffs. The veto was never overridden. **********El Nuevo Herald, the Spanish-language newspaper published by The Miami Herald, first reported the allegations of vote buying on June 21, saying the money had come from an emergency-aid program for the poor that was financed by Canada and several European countries. **********Citing sworn declarations from Government employees, El Nuevo Herald said that payments to legislators had supposedly been disguised as allocations for items like tools and seed for the poor in their districts. **********Mr. Potoy said El Nuevo Herald's version conforms to material in some of the sworn declarations taken by his auditors. Estimates of $200 Million **********As for the loans, Government officials have acknowledged that $100 million was lost, but private banking experts who have analyzed Central Bank records say the real figure, including interest lost, approaches $200 million. Most of the loans were short-term credits of 60 to 180 days. **********The significance of the loan losses can be put into perspective by comparing them to Nicaragua's total exports last year of only $280 million and its gross national product of just $1.6 billion. **********Erwin Kruger, Minister of External Cooperation, said in a recent interview published verbatim by the newspaper Barricada that the lost loan money had come from the total hard-currency resources Nicaragua received last year, including export income and aid from the United States and other countries and institutions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/24/world/beijing-journal-billions-served-and-that-was-without-china.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 984, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Beijing Journal; 'Billions Served' (and That Was Without China)", "print_headline": "Beijing Journal; 'Billions Served' (and That Was Without China)", "body_text": " **********Taking her seat this morning under the capital's gleaming new golden arches, Zhang Wei laid out the banquet on the plastic tray in front of her and slowly savored her breakfast of a hamburger, french fries, chocolate sundae and a Coke. **********\"It's a bit expensive to eat here at McDonald's,\" said Miss Zhang, a 20-year-old university student. \"But I guess for a high-fashion restaurant like this, the prices are O.K.\" **********Miss Zhang's respect for McDonald's haute cuisine seemed to be widely shared today, as thousands of customers lined up all day to mark the opening of the hamburger chain's first restaurant in Beijing. The new McDonald's, which executives hope will be the flagship of a growing presence in China, is the biggest McDonald's restaurant in the world -- and apparently the only one with a Communist Party secretary. **********By the time the new restaurant closed at 11 tonight, it had registered 13,214 transactions, setting a new one-day sales record for any McDonald's restaurant in the world. Those transactions represented about 40,000 customers, executives said. 700 Seats, 29 Registers **********In a sign of the potential of the market here, the two previous one-day sales records had also been set in China, at the two McDonald's outlets that are supplied from Hong Kong but operate in the Chinese border city of Shenzhen. One opened in October 1990 and the other just last Saturday, and they are the only other McDonald's restaurants in China. **********The McDonald's in Beijing, with more than 700 seats and 29 cash registers, is slightly bigger than the one that opened in January 1990 in Moscow -- setting a one-day record that was later surpassed by the restaurants in China. The Beijing McDonald's has nearly 1,000 employees, selected from more than 20,000 who applied, and many said they came because of the prestige of the work and the upward mobility it offered. **********\"I had heard about McDonald's, and it seemed like a good place to work,\" said Liu Xiaohong, a university graduate who abandoned her career as a model to join the restaurant as a service manager. \"When you're a model, you're finished by the age of 25 or 30, but here there's a lot more opportunity to build a career.\" **********Several Chinese customers commented on the novelty of restaurant employees who are enthusiastic rather than surly, and some speculated on how long this would last. But for now the McDonald's employees seem very serious about adhering to eccentric new standards, like smiling at customers and following the four-step instructions for washing hands. **********After several years of effort McDonald's has been able to find local sources of 95 percent of the food and materials it needs. **********Potatoes have been among the biggest headaches, because the Idaho Russett Burbank variety used by McDonald's in the United States is unavailable in China. Most local potatoes are too short and produce only dwarf french fries. For now McDonald's is relying on Chinese-grown White Flower potatoes, which have some of the characteristics of Idaho spuds, but the taste is not quite authentic. \"We're still fine-tuning the french fries,\" acknowledged Ti Chang, a Taiwan-born American who is head of McDonald's China Development Company. **********McDonald's has one of the best locations in Beijing, near Tiananmen Square at the intersection of Wangfujing, a main shopping street, and the Avenue of Eternal Peace, the main east-west thoroughfare. **********The restaurant is a joint venture with a Chinese state-owned company, which has organized a Communist Party unit in the restaurant. The McDonald's party secretary, Cai Weiqian, looked pained when asked if he planned to warn the staff against the dangers of Western bourgeois influence. \"Now the leaders call on us to open up and reform, so as party secretary I'll call on people to help the task of opening up and do a better job for McDonald's,\" he said. Hamburgers Are Not New **********The introduction of McDonald's is probably far less of a shock to Beijing than it was to Moscow, because the Chinese capital is already home to many foreign-run establishments. Kentucky Fried Chicken has four outlets in Beijing and there are two Pizza Huts, three Holiday Inns and innumerable other foreign-managed hotels and restaurants. Many young people have had hanbao (hamburgers) and jishi hanbao (cheeseburgers) before, and sheng dai (sundaes) are an old Beijing favorite. **********Because Chinese sometimes eat meat buns for breakfast, McDonald's found that it does not need to offer a special breakfast menu: at 9 A.M., people relish a Big Mac and a Coke. Indeed, the restaurant is thinking of moving its opening time earlier, to 7 A.M., to accommodate the burger-for-breakfast crowd. **********The meals are expensive by Chinese standards, at about 65 cents for a hamburger and $1.55 for a Big Mac, compared with a typical monthly income of a bit more than $30 for a Chinese worker. But most customers seemed to regard McDonald's not as fast food but as a significant culinary and cultural experience, conferring status along with the grease. **********James R. Cantalupo, the president and chief executive of McDonald's International, who arrived with other top McDonald's executives for the opening, said the company planned to invest about $50 million in the next few years opening additional outlets in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou (Canton). **********\"China has 22 percent of the population on earth, and sure, a lot of people can't afford a meal here now,\" Mr. Cantalupo said. \"But as we build up, we'll get economies of scale and improve the value, and enlarge our customer base.\" **********Sun Peiyu, a 37-year-old businessman who took his 7-year-old daughter (\"really 8 years old, almost,\" she insisted) for a hamburger and sundae, agreed that McDonald's would prosper in China. **********\"If every Chinese eats here just once,\" he said, \"they'll make a mint.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/08/business/top-executives-say-recovery-has-begun.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1992-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 638, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Top Executives Say Recovery Has Begun", "print_headline": "Top Executives Say Recovery Has Begun", "body_text": " **********Top executives from a dozen of the nation's largest corporations said this evening that with the exception of riot-torn Los Angeles, the United States appeared to have begun a slow recovery from last year's recession. **********All the executives who spoke this evening thought that an economic recovery had begun, but they differed on whether its progress was assured. The most optimistic was Robert E. Allen, the chairman and chief executive of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. \"I don't think we're going to have a booming recovery, but I think it may exceed most economists' expectations,\" he said. **********One of the most pessimistic executives was John F. Welch Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the General Electric Company, who said that while the long-term competitiveness of American industry was improving, the recovery appeared to have been less strong last month than in the three preceding months. No Enthusiasm for Cities **********However, none of the executives expressed any enthusiasm when asked if they had any immediate interest in investing in inner cities. After a moment of silence, Walter V. Shipley, the president and chief operating officer of the Chemical Banking Corporation, pointed out that some areas in Newark and Washington that were damaged in riots years ago had never been rebuilt. **********Howard P. Allen, chairman of the executive committee of the Southern California Edison Company, said that until the riots his region had appeared to be slowly following the rest of the country into recovery. But a significant pause is likely now before tourism and investment recover. **********\"The riots put a cloud not only on other things but on the economy of the Southern California area,\" Mr. Allen said. **********The answer, Mr. Allen said, was a national experiment in creating free enterprise zones, cultural centers and other programs in Los Angeles to persuade businesses that investments there would be safe and at least somewhat profitable. With such assurances, businesses might be willing to invest even for returns below those available elsewhere, Mr. Allen insisted. More Jobs Are Needed **********Mr. Welch said that businesses' main response to the riots should be to create more jobs and increase the diversity of the American work place. **********Mr. Welch heads the Business Council, a group of 100 chief executives of large corporations who are meeting here over the next two days to discuss the economy and foreign trade. Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, will address the group Friday in an effort to rally support for the Administration's attempts to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico and a global free-trade pact. **********The chief executives spoke after reviewing a very cautious report on the nation's economy by chief economists from 19 large corporations. The economists' views are important not only as an indication of the economy's direction, but also because they influence the assumptions being made by America's corporate leaders as they decide whether to expand investment and other spending this year or remain cautious. Slow, Halting Progress **********The recession appears to have ended last year, they said, but the recovery will be slow and halting, and the economies of other industrialized countries are growing more slowly than expected last autumn. **********The weakening of the Japanese, German and other European economies is hurting American exports. **********But the economists also drew some optimism from the steep fall in interest rates late last year, the wider availability of credit and, above all, increasing consumer confidence. **********They predicted 2.5 percent economic growth through the rest of this year. The prediction, \"is faster than the meager growth actually achieved during the past year,\" the economists said in their report to the chief executives. \"But it remains well below the pace typical of previous economic recoveries.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/20/business/company-news-sport-supply-macgregor.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sport Supply, MacGregor", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Sport Supply, MacGregor", "body_text": " **********The Sport Supply Group Inc. said today that it had acquired exclusive rights to the MacGregor trademarks in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and had ended talks for its acquisition in light of the deal \"and other pending transactions.\" **********Sport Supply, a direct-mail marketer of sports equipment, said it had paid cash for the trademarks, acquired from MacGregor Sports Products Inc. of Simpsonville, N.C., but did not disclose the amount. **********The company said it planned to convert \"the vast majority\" of its 5,000 sports products to the MacGregor brand. **********Sport Supply, based in Farmers Branch, Tex., also said it would continue discussions to acquire other companies \"with the goal of adding $25 million in annualized revenues in 1992 and 1993.\" It did not elaborate. **********Separately, the company said analysts' recent projections for 1992 of $1.10 a share in earnings, on $60 million in sales, were \"in the range of acceptability.\" Sport Supply said it expected to report 1991 year-end results within 10 days. **********The BSN Corporation owns 1.25 million of Sport Supply's 4.6 million shares.

Together, the funds own $6.7 million of stock in the company, whose sales exceed $400 million. **********Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that Cracker Barrel did not have to include an anti-discrimination resolution drafted by the city employees' pension funds in the proxy materials sent out for the shareholder meeting. The S.E.C. said the resolution could be excluded because it concerned day-to-day operations, which it viewed as outside the Federal agency's authority. **********\"Cracker Barrel was wrong to claim that discrimination against gays and lesbians is a matter of ordinary company business,\" Elizabeth Holtzman, the New York City Comptroller, said in a statement. \"Discrimination in employment, whether on the basis of sexual orientation, race, religion or gender, has no place in this country.\" **********Altogether, Queer Nation members own about 90 shares of Cracker Barrel. They bought the stock -- one share each, and with it an automatic ticket to annual meetings -- last year for $32 a share.

This followed a simliar incident involving six Americans two weeks earlier. In November, a group of four German tourists were robbed in the Masai Mara and one of the women was raped. **********On Tuesday, a guide was killed and his 11 Austrian tourists attacked on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast, at Watamu beach, north of Mombasa. **********The violence has brought expressions of alarm from the Kenya Association of Tour Operators, which said that there had already been cancellations by travelers planning to visit the Masai Mara. Worse Times to Come? **********\"The association is extremely worried about this situation,\" said Sammy Mwaura, the group's chairman. \"Unless immediate action is taken to bring the situation under control, we fear that our overseas agents will force us to declare a total ban on travel to the Masai Mara.\" **********Such a ban \"would lead to the collapse of the tourist trade, the leading foreign-exchange earner for Kenya,\" he said. **********The Government said Friday that it was instructing the police to work with the Kenya Wildlife Service, the body that controls most game parks, to tighten security. But how this might be carried out was unclear, since the Masai Mara is controlled by a county council, not the national Wildlife Service. **********A newspaper, The Standard, suggested today that the robberies and other attacks in the Masai Mara may have been carried out by gatekeepers who had been dismissed after they failed to include a corrupt Cabinet minister in the usual cut of park-entrance fees. **********For the Government, the most damaging effect of the violence so far has been travel advisories issued by the United States, Britain and Germany, warning their citizens about the risks of travel in this East African country. Convoys of Two **********The current State Department advisory recommends that visitors move in convoys of at least two vehicles. But a spokesman at the United States Embassy said a new advisory due out next week would cite the Masai Mara as a place for particular caution. **********Germany, whose people make up the largest number of foreign tourists in Kenya, advised its nationals to avoid the Masai Mara. And the British Foreign Office, ususally reluctant to criticize its former colony, urged travelers to use reputable tour operators and to avoid remote areas. **********Although downtown Nairobi was packed Friday with tourists preparing to go on safari in the Masai Mara, the Government is obviously worried about cancellations. **********The Kenyan economy has been hit hard from several directions, including recent refusals by Western countries and international lending organizations to grant hard-currency loans until economic and political reforms are put into effect. **********Each year, about 700,000 tourists come to Kenya, a country that is promoted as the showcase of African wildlife, one that offers first-class hotels, luxury lodges and a wide choice of safaris."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/26/business/a-sharp-rebound-in-christmas-sales.html": {"writer_name": "Stephanie Strom", "pub_date": "1992-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1314, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A SHARP REBOUND IN CHRISTMAS SALES", "print_headline": "A SHARP REBOUND IN CHRISTMAS SALES", "body_text": " **********It was a hair-raising holiday season for many of the nation's retailers: sales started out strong, dropped off precipitously and finally skyrocketed the last weekend before Christmas. **********Most merchants say their holiday business improved this year despite the ups and downs caused by unusually nasty weather and news of more layoffs and revampings among America's blue-chip companies. **********\"People have shopped this year like there really is a Christmas,\" said John J. Schultz, president of the National Retail Federation. Sales May Be Up 9% **********So much for the notion that Christmas was dead. While retailers will not release hard and fast numbers on how they fared during the holidays until Thursday, a few experts are even estimating that sales may be 8 or 9 percent higher than those of a year ago. Most believe sales will have risen around 5 percent. **********\"We couldn't ask for much better this season,\" said Myron E. Ullman 3d, co-chairman and chief executive of R. H. Macy & Company. Sales have exceeded expectations at stores like Bloomingdale's, Sears and Tiffany & Company, that were punished for the last three years by penurious shoppers. Macy expects sales to be 2 to 3 percent ahead for the season; although its sales were much stronger in New York City and Washington as well as Georgia and Florida, that success was tempered by weak sales in California. **********Discount stores were less of a destination for shoppers this year. Kmart struggled the last few days before Christmas to meet its projections for the season, and analysts expected Target to match its sales performance last year but not exceed it. And even though Wal-Mart raised its estimates for sales growth in December by 2 percent, it still did not plan to post its usual monthly double-digit sales gain. **********Strict inventory controls at several big chains virtually guaranteed a more profitable season even if sales did not notch up. **********Mr. Schultz noted that the calendar this year was almost ideal for retailers. He estimated that the two more days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year could mean as much as 4 percent more sales for some merchants. **********What is more, Christmas fell on a Friday this year, which gave people today and Sunday to go back to stores to return gifts and clear out leftover merchandise. **********Retailers are trying to squeeze as much out of Christmas 1992 as possible, since they do not expect the windfall to persist into the new year. Many merchants and analysts believe the first quarter of 1993 will be weak, because consumer spending has recently outpaced income growth. Credit-card companies have reported strong increases in transactions, and some shoppers may be shocked when they get their bills next month. Also, this year had a strong start, which will make it tougher to squeeze out gains in the start of 1993. **********\"The fear a little bit is that a lot of the energy is being sucked out of the quarter by the strength of Christmas,\" said Carol Sanger, a spokeswoman for Federated Department Stores, which operates Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus, Burdines and several other chains. **********For the holidays, Federated's sales exceeded its cautious expectations. Analysts expect its sales in stores open at least one year, the best measure of a retailer's performance, to increase somewhere between 4 and 6 percent. **********For Federated and several other chains, improvement was achieved in fits and starts as the holiday season progressed. Inclement weather kept shoppers in some regions of the country at home, and Californians, in the midst of a statewide recession, were stingy spenders. A few retailers said news of corporate layoffs at I.B.M., General Motors and other companies also might have dampened the giddiness produced by the election of Bill Clinton and speculation about the impact of his Administration. Up, Down, Up Again **********The Christmas and Hanukkah selling season started with a frenzy resembling the heady holidays of the 1980's, as shoppers jammed stores in the week after Thanksgiving. Intoxicated by the excitement, some analysts and retailers rushed to revise their sales forecasts and began predicting sales that would soar 9 percent beyond those registered in the same period last year. **********Then sales trailed off in the second week of the season and in some cases nearly died as vicious storms pummeled the Atlantic Coast and froze parts of the Midwest. The two extra days of selling time between Thanksgiving and Christmas also allowed shoppers to postpone spending they would have done in the third week until the fourth week, leaving retailers to gnaw their nails and hope. **********Analysts returned to their original estimates of sales growth around 5 or 6 percent, a moderate improvement but sparkling when compared with last year's sales growth of less than 2 percent. **********The Johnson Redbook Service, the retail industry monitor published by Lynch, Jones & Ryan, calculated that sales grew 6.9 percent in the first week, rose just 1.4 percent the second week, then picked up their pace to increase 5.9 percent in the third week, largely because of accelerated momentum last Saturday. **********Hermes, the exclusive luxury goods chain that sells ties for $110, silk scarves for $225 and handbags for as much as $14,000, sold more than $500,000 worth of merchandise that Saturday in its New York store alone. **********Customers lined up outside Toys \"R\" Us in Herald Square in Manhattan and fought for position in check-out lines at Macy's flagship store there. Cars cruised the jammed parking lots outside Wal-Mart stores across the country, searching for available space. **********Retailers reported that the fast pace continued through Wednesday, though last Saturday will probably stand out as the biggest day of Christmas sales 1992. Tactical Retail Solutions Inc., a retail consulting firm in New York, estimates that merchants took in $4 billion that day, or roughly 4 percent of total estimated sales of $71 billion for the holiday season. **********\"Now we're hearing guesses that they'll see 25 to 50 percent increases in the fourth week,\" said Edward Johnson, the analyst who compiles the Johnson Redbook. Based on that, he is sticking to his estimate of 8 to 9 percent sales growth this month. Last-Minute Shopping Grows **********A sales explosion in the final week -- which may not be retailing hyperbole given that sales surged 20 percent in the last week of the weak 1991 holiday season -- would support what is becoming a new tenet in the retail handbook. Consumers are last-minute shoppers, making the holiday sales season a perennial cliffhanger. **********\"The unfortunate part of the Christmas season is that we don't know so much about how it's going until after it's over,\" said Orren F. Knauer, director of investor relations for the Kmart Corporation. **********\"The election was over, and suddenly the media is making it out to be the best Christmas in four years,\" he added. \"Maybe it will; maybe it won't. We just don't know until Christmas Eve.\" **********Clark A. Johnson, chairman of Pier 1 Imports Inc., a specialty-store chain that sells home furnishings, decorations and gift items, said that for merchants this season was something like riding a roller coaster, although he expected his stores would exceed his projections of 5 to 6 percent comparable-store sales growth. **********\"It's been tricky,\" he said Wednesday. \"But this last week will be the largest week of sales in the history of the company.\" **********Retailers were also heartened by unexpectedly strong sales of big-ticket merchandise like furniture and appliances. Sears in particular benefited from its selection of home and office furniture, computers, fax machines and appliances. \"What it's telling us is that customers are finally willing to make longer-term commitments,\" said Matthew A.

Mr. Braddock was the banking giant's second-ranking officer. **********The company said its quarterly earnings would be lower than expected, which came as a shock because Citicorp officials had informally led Wall Street analysts to believe that its foreign currency trading had been highly profitable during the recent turmoil. **********The combination of high foreign exchange profits and low overall profits is a reminder, analysts said, that Citicorp is still burdened by a high level of delinquent loans, which requires the company to increase its reserves or write off the loans as a loss.  Analysts Reduce Estimates **********Analysts at several firms reduced their earnings estimates, but did not withdraw their recommendations to buy or hold the company's stock. Because Citicorp is preparing for a $650 million offering of preferred stock that must be converted to common stock, analysts at large securities firms handling that offering were not willing to discuss recent events at the company. **********At the First Boston Corporation, analysts reduced their forecast for Citicorp's earnings this year to 20 cents a share from 60 cents, while the 1993 earnings estimate was cut to $1.50 a share from $2.00. Merrill Lynch reduced its estimate for 1993 profits to $2 a share from $2.20.

Citicorp traded as low as 14.375 yesterday, its lowest level since April 8. **********Mr. Braddock's sudden resignation continues to baffle investors and analysts. One official at a Wall Street firm who declined to be identified because his firm was among those offering new Citicorp securities said the departure could open the doors for more radical changes in the consumer businesses that Mr. Braddock ran for many years. It might be easier, he said, for Citicorp to abandon its dream of a nationwide branch network and shed its low-profit network of savings and loans in California, Illinois, Florida, Arizona and Virginia if one of the architects of that plan is no longer with the company. Another possibility, he said, is that Citicorp could again consider a partial sale of its credit card business. **********Citicorp said its profit of $80 million to $100 million for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 would have been greater except for a special $65 million charge related to a program to cut expenses. It also noted that the decline in the dollar had caused its expenses outside the United States to rise by $30 million. Profits were further reduced, the company said, by an increase of undisclosed size in its tax bill. **********Although Citicorp has largely achieved its goal of reducing expenses, that progress has not yet resulted in a significant rise in profits. **********With nearly 7 percent of its loans either delinquent or so troubled that full payment is not expected, the eighth-worst record among the nation's 50 largest banking companies, Citicorp faces several quarters in which its profits will be hurt by writing off loans as a loss or setting aside reserves to cover expected losses. Its reserves at the end of the second quarter equaled only 57 percent of its badly delinquent or troubled loans, well below the 100 percent or greater of most large banking companies. **********\"The company has more problems still to be recognized,\" said Charles Peabody, a partner at East Shore Partners, an investment advisory and securities firm. He said that a large increase in reserves to cover loan losses was likely in the current quarter, and that heavy losses could be posted in the credit card and private banking businesses. **********In the third quarter, Citicorp said its earnings had been cut by $90 million before taxes because of a decline in the value of its mortgage servicing business. Elsewhere in its troubled mortgage lending business, Citicorp wrote off as a loss $90 million from a pool of $1.1 billion of mortgage loans that were more than 360 days past due but not labeled as foreclosed. Banking regulators have criticized Citicorp for failing to recognize the losses likely on those loans. **********Write-offs of consumer loans, excluding the $1.1 billion of mortgages critcized by regulators earlier in the year, totaled about $780 million in the third quarter, not much changed from $784 million in the previous quarter. **********In its commercial lending business, Citicorp said the costs of bad loans, primarily from write-offs or reserves to cover expected losses, would be $175 million to $200 million less than the $705 million of the second quarter. Its holdings of badly delinquent loans fell $200 million, but holdings of real estate acquired through foreclosure rose $400 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/business/us-warns-on-threats-to-wiretaps.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1992-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 754, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Warns On Threats To Wiretaps", "print_headline": "U.S. Warns On Threats To Wiretaps", "body_text": " **********Sophisticated defenses against wiretapping are outpacing the Government's ability to monitor telephone communications for intelligence gathering and law enforcement purposes, senior Administration officials told a Congressional panel today. **********The warning came at a hearing on foreign espionage against American companies. The Federal Bureau of Investigation relies heavily on court-ordered wiretaps in its pursuit of mob leaders and drug traffickers, while the highly secretive National Security Agency gathers military, political and economic intelligence by monitoring international calls. **********The Administration officials never detailed why widespread eavesdropping might still be needed, now that the cold war is over. The most obvious possible explanation, keeping tabs on terrorist groups, was not mentioned, although the Justice Department has expressed this concern in recent weeks. 'We Will Be Denied Access' **********The Federal Government's biggest problem lies in the use of computers to transmit many calls simultaneously on a single line and to scramble individual calls for extra security. \"Digital telephony has advanced to such a point that we are nearing the point that we will be denied access on a routine basis,\" William S. Sessions, the F.B.I. Director, told members of a House Judiciary subcommittee. **********The Justice Department began pressing Congress last month for legislation that would require telephone companies to install equipment making it easier to conduct court-ordered wiretaps.

Opposition by Phone Companies **********Yet telephone companies around the world are using computers to encode and consolidate calls on fewer and fewer lines to save money. And companies in many countries are responding to reports of increased economic espionage by using more and more encryption devices to scramble the voices and data they send on telephone lines. **********Telephone companies, including the Nynex Corporation and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, have joined the American Civil Liberties Union in opposing the Justice Department's plans, which they see as an expensive obstacle to deploying the most advanced, cost-saving technologies available. **********Philip S. Gutis, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union, said that requiring telephone companies to make their equipment more compatible with eavesdropping gear was like forcing household appliance makers to install special microphones in all their products to save Federal agents the trouble. \"It's just a question of how far our Government goes in making it easier for them to invade our privacy,\" he said. Why Businesses Are Worried **********Computer and telecommunications industry officials and House Democrats said today that the Administration was avoiding a public-policy decision on high-technology communications in the United States. By insisting on the ability to eavesdrop on any call, they said, the Administration may delay the installation of advanced equipment necessary for reducing costs for industry, preventing the loss of trade secrets and preserving American competitiveness. **********\"Our Government is impeding the private sector in developing modern cryptographic technologies because they don't want those technologies to get too sophisticated -- whether it's the intelligence agencies or whether it's the bureau, or whether it's other law enforcement people,\" said Representative Dan Glickman, Democrat of Kansas. **********But Mr. Sessions strongly disagreed. \"If you woke me up in the middle of the night and threatened me with the most dire of consequences, I would say that is not so,\" he said. **********\"I would say that the F.B.I. wants very much to see advancing technology, greater capabilities, greater implementation throughout the world,\" Mr. Sessions said. \"All we're asking is what the Congress has already given. That is, the continued lawful access.\" **********The dilemma for American policymakers was best illustrated when Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, warned that American business executives should avoid leaving sensitive documents unattended in foreign hotel rooms. **********James E.

But by staying away from stocks, they risk missing further gains. **********One familiar piece of advice in such situations is to put money into stocks or mutual funds a little at a time through dollar-cost averaging. Now a finance professor at Harvard Business School has come up with an innovation he calls \"value averaging,\" which he says promises even higher payoffs. **********\"Averaging techniques help you avoid the 'buy high, sell low' habit of investors who get caught up in the market's emotional peaks and valleys,\" said Michael E. Edleson, the Harvard professor, who lays out his system in \"Value Averaging\" ($22.95, the International Publishing Corporation, Chicago). **********With dollar-cost averaging, you invest the same amount of money monthly or quarterly in the same fund. So when the price is low, you receive more shares than when the price is high. This strategy reduces the average cost of your shares and increases your return over the long haul if the stock market keeps climbing, as it has historically. **********For example, say you invested $1,000 quarterly in the Vanguard Index Trust 500, which mirrors Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, for 10 years beginning December 1981. At year-end 1991, you would have owned 1,476.5 shares worth $97,352. The average cost -- total money invested divided by shares owned -- would have been $16.15. That compares with an average quarterly share price of $25.28 for the 10 years, Mr. Edleson said. **********Value averaging takes dollar-cost averaging one step further. Besides buying low, you sell shares when the markets soar. **********With value averaging, you invest the amount needed to increase the value of your account by a fixed amount. As an illustration, say you want your mutual fund account to grow $500 each quarter. You begin by buying 50 shares at $10 each. In the second quarter, the share price drops to $9. To make your account worth $1,000, you have to own 111.111 shares; because you already own 50 shares, you must buy 61.111 shares and you need to invest $550. **********So far, value averaging is very similar to dollar-cost averaging, but eventually one key difference appears: When share prices rise, you may have to sell shares instead of buying them. Continuing the example, let's say the fund's price jumps to $20 in the third quarter. To make your account worth your $1,500 goal, you must have 75 shares. You already own 111.111. So you would sell 36.111 shares. **********Value averaging forces you to buy more than you would with dollar-cost averaging when the share price drops exceptionally low and to sell shares when the share price is high. The more extreme the moves in share prices, the better value averaging performs in comparison with dollar-cost averaging. **********Going back to Mr. Edleson's example involving the Vanguard Index Trust 500, dollar-cost averaging yields an average share price of $16.15 and an average annual return of 16.7 percent. But value averaging produces an average net share price of $13.91 for the shares that remain and an annual average return of 18.4 percent. **********Value averaging is trickier than dollar-cost averaging, which is maintenance free if you do business with fund groups that will automatically transfer money from your bank account on a regular basis. To encourage regular investments, some fund groups reduce the minimum initial investment for people who sign up for automatic investment plans. Value averaging requires more time and effort. You have to calculate and invest the correct amount each period. **********When you sell shares, you may incur brokerage charges and capital-gains taxes, both of which reduce your return. To avoid these costs, the value-averaging strategy is ideal to use with no-load funds in tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) plans, Keoghs or I.R.A.'s. **********Another alternative is not to sell. This gives you about three-quarters of the benefit of value averaging, Mr. Edleson figures. Using the Vanguard example, the average cost per share using the no-sell variation would be $15.64, compared with $16.15 for dollar-cost averaging and $13.91 for regular value averaging. The rate of return for the no-sell investment would be 17.8 percent, a full percentage point more than dollar-cost averaging but less than regular value averaging. **********Investors who use value averaging should account for ongoing stock market growth as they calculate how big their accounts should grow each period. Mr. Edleson used a growth adjustment of 3 percent quarterly in the Vanguard example, or 12 percent annually. In other words, instead of making the account grow by $1,000, to a total of $2,000 in the second quarter, a more realistic goal is to have the account grow to $2,030. **********A few final points: To do value averaging you must monitor your investment at least once in each period, to calculate the share purchase or sale. If this is difficult, dollar-cost averaging is easier and automatic. For value averaging you can average monthly, but quarterly is simpler and just as effective. If you sell shares, set the money aside -- preferably in a money market fund -- where you can use it to buy the extra shares needed when prices tumble."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/08/business/the-media-business-a-new-bill-on-baby-bells.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 264, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A New Bill on 'Baby Bells'", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; A New Bill on 'Baby Bells'", "body_text": " **********The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Jack Brooks of Texas, introduced legislation today that would bar the seven regional Bell telephone companies from owning information services and manufacturing equipment for years to come. **********Though prospects are virtually nil that an election-year Congress will pass such a divisive measure, the bill marks a starting point for political bargaining in the session that begins in January. **********In the battle over lifting restrictions imposed in the antitrust consent decree that broke up A.T.& T. in 1984, the new bill takes a hard line against the Bell companies and strongly favors newspaper publishers and other information companies, which fear that the Bell companies will use their dominance of local telephone service to stifle competition in electronic information services. **********But the bill conflicts directly with one passed by the Senate in June.

Do not bet on it. **********Last week's compromise over subsidies for France's cosseted grain farmers apparently broke the stalemate on world trade negotiations. And the momentum behind the North American Free Trade Agreement now seems almost unstoppable. **********But conflict still lurks on the horizon, and in no small measure because this Administration is likely to be the first since World War II that is less than committed to freer trade. Indeed, trade policy sits on a natural fault running through the new Democratic coalition. **********On one side is the economics and foreign policy establishment, upscale academics and Wall Street power brokers who are convinced that open trade is the best defense against stagnation and political conflict in the industrialized world. On the other are assorted economists, lawyers and lobbyists who see trade -- especially trade in high-technology goods -- as a prime battleground in the post-cold-war era. Their badge of intellectual respectability is the \"new trade theory,\" a modern critique of the century-old logic of free trade. **********While the ranks of these trade \"activists\" -- they do not cotton to the \"protectionist\" label -- may be small, their influence with Congressional Democrats, Silicon Valley industrialists and the Clinton inner circle is large. One of the rank, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, holds a key position on the Clinton transition team. And it is perhaps no coincidence that her new book, \"Who's Bashing Whom?\" was published by the Institute for International Economics, a Washington policy research group that rarely strays far from the corridors of Democratic power. **********Both sides agree that the classic rationale for protecting domestic industry -- the \"we can't compete with workers who live on a bowl of rice a day\" argument -- is passe. Both sides also agree that America's chronic trade deficit is driven by differences in national savings and investment rates, and is thus no indicator of foreign perfidy. But the activists part company with traditional free traders on whether the composition of trade should be a critical government concern. **********The activists argue that the big winners in trade are the countries that export goods from industries that generate fat profit margins, high wages and valuable technological spinoffs. And the way to end up a winner is to use the trade laws to assure that American companies get an even break (or better) when it comes to selling high-technology products in world markets. **********Japan and, more egregiously, Europe often behave as if they agree, subsidizing high-technology research, organizing joint corporate product development and fencing out foreign competition. Where the foreigners will not play by the rules, the activists say, the proper response is tit-for-tat. And that means micromanaging trade -- everything from imposing countervailing duties to negotiating \"voluntary import expansion\" agreements under threat of retaliation. **********Paul Krugman, an economist at M.I.T. who wrote much of the book on the new trade theory, is nonetheless skeptical of its relevance. \"I can always get one of my graduate students to build a model\" showing how intervention might improve Americans' welfare, he said; the tricky part is preventing it from becoming a tool of special interests. **********Gary Saxonhouse, a University of Michigan specialist on the Japanese economy, is less judicious in his critique of the activists. If the idea is to promote wealth-producing export industries, he says, high technology is an odd place to begin. Investments in high tech have not, on average, been particularly lucrative. And most of the jobs created by high-tech companies are assembly line drudgery -- the $7-an-hour work that Bill Clinton is pledged to replace with good jobs. **********Of course, these industries also employ engineers and managers. But Mr. Saxonhouse points out that there is no particular scarcity of jobs for the highly skilled. And, ironically, by intervening to increase the demand for these skills without increasing the supply, Washington would only widen the wage divide between the skilled and unskilled. **********Mr. Krugman offers a bridge for the gap that divides the free traders from the activists. The one area where the activist trade argument holds most intuitively, he suggests, is in technological spinoffs -- the extra kick other businesses get from breakthroughs in technology. But one could promote such industries with subsidies that, unlike overt protection, would be under the eye of the taxpayers and perhaps less likely than tariffs or quotas to incite foreign retaliation. **********This is hardly a panacea, warns Richard Cooper, a Harvard economist. Selective subsidies, he said, require picking winners, \"the classic problem of industrial policy.\" **********Problem or not, it seems the path of least resistance for a President who seems eager -- but not too eager -- to break with past trade orthodoxies. Mr. Clinton may have gotten elected by reinventing a Democratic majority party. However, governing with the new coalition may prove to be harder than getting elected by it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/15/business/economic-scene-the-right-jolt-a-fiscal-menu.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Passell", "pub_date": "1992-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 802, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; The Right Jolt: A Fiscal Menu", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; The Right Jolt: A Fiscal Menu", "body_text": " **********UNLESS unemployment falls very fast, very soon -- a prospect only slightly more likely than a Nobel Peace Prize for Pat Buchanan -- the next President will be under enormous pressure to give the economy a fiscal lift. But how? **********That old favorite, public works spending, conjures images of gents in sharkskin suits swapping Cadillacs for contracts to build highways to nowhere. Even if these images of waste and corruption are dated, the economists' critique of creating jobs by pouring concrete still stands: \"It just takes too long to turn them on,\" said George Perry of the Brookings Institution. **********An across-the-board income tax cut, by contrast, could put money in people's pockets as fast as payroll deductions can be reprogrammed. But with the Federal budget hopelessly out of balance and Wall Street sniffing the wind for signs of inflation, Washington would be at pains to set a tight time limit on the largess -- say, 18 months. And the evidence suggests that a relatively small portion of any temporary windfall in take-home pay would be spent. **********What is left? Plenty, in the view of economists itching to prove that an active fiscal policy still has a place in an era of $300 billion-plus budget deficits. **********Grants to states and localities. No-strings Federal revenue sharing got a bad name in the 1970's because some governments used the cash for frills, or simply passed it through to residents as tax cuts. But the worm has turned. In the 1980's, Washington began demanding that localities provide expensive new services, notably health care, from their own resources. And these Federal mandates are proving particularly unwelcome in a recession that has drained local treasuries, forcing cutbacks in everything from library hours to pothole repair. **********This largely explains why Robert Solow of M.I.T. and James Tobin of Yale have been pressing for across-the-board increases in aid to states and cities. Much of the money would be spent promptly, they believe -- and, most likely, on services that had earlier met the test of local taxpayer approval. **********Investment tax credits. While the temporary nature of an income tax cut would no doubt undermine its efficacy as fiscal stimulus, a fixed expiration date for investment incentives would have the opposite effect. **********Uncle Sam might, for example, offer a fat tax credit -- say 20 cents off next year's tax bill for every dollar invested in machinery. This would be equivalent to a 20 percent-off sale on new capital equipment, good only during the recession. And while most companies would have trouble planning and building new capacity on such short notice, many would happily accelerate plans already on the drawing board. **********This is trickle-down economics -- albeit trickle-down at its best. And while the investment tax credit has loyal fans in both the Clinton and Bush camps, a tax break for which the immediate beneficiaries would be corporations would probably be resisted by some Congressional Democrats. Francis Bator, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, has a very different qualm. He believes tax subsidies that enhanced productivity are such a good idea for the slow-growth American economy that he is reluctant to offer them merely as a temporary antidote for recession. **********Employment subsidies. If the main purpose of temporary tax breaks and increased spending in a recession is to create jobs, why not skip the middleman? Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at Michigan State University, wants to give tax credits to employers who hire additional workers -- say $2,000 for the first year. And the idea is reportedly receiving a good reception in Little Rock. **********So modest a wage subsidy would really only make a difference for employers thinking about hiring low-wage workers. But that does not bother Mr. Hamermesh. Workers at the bottom, after all, have suffered the most during the recession. **********Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, does not quarrel with this logic. But he is not convinced that the tax break would make much difference. In America's one brief experiment with temporary employment subsidies during the Carter Administration, he notes that roughly half the eligible employers did not even bother to claim the credit. **********First-time home buyer's credit. Few economists get excited about this one, in part because plunging mortgage rates have already made houses more affordable, in part because they think there are higher-priority uses for deficit-busting tax benefits. But the idea of creating jobs for home builders by giving first-time buyers a leg up on the down payment is already part of the Bush Administration's recovery plan. **********And with more than a little help from the housing lobby it could end up as part of the stimulus package next January, no matter who gains the lease on the White House."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/22/world/government-in-india-wins-a-crucial-vote-on-reaction-to-riots.html": {"writer_name": "Sanjoy Hazarika", "pub_date": "1992-12-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 378, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Government in India Wins a Crucial Vote On Reaction to Riots", "print_headline": "Government in India Wins a Crucial Vote On Reaction to Riots", "body_text": " **********The 18-month-old Government crushed a right-wing challenge tonight from the pro-Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party in Parliament.

In a brief conversation with Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican, during a break in the hearings, he put his hand over his microphone and said: \"Jim, I'm here to defend the policy.

When you've got a policy that didn't work, it's not easy to defend.\" Focus on Credits for Iraq **********The main focus of today's hearing was an examination of the Administration's decision in the fall of 1990 to approve $1 billion in new Commercial Credit Corporation credits for Iraq, despite evidence that Iraq had misused previous funding, was demanding bribes from American agricicultural businesses selling food to Iraq, and may have exchanged some of the food for money and arms in the Soviet bloc and other countries. **********Classified documents released by Mr. Gonzalez indicate that the State Department and the Ambassador to Iraq at the time, April C.

Workers in several cities have attacked factory directors who have tried to introduce market-oriented changes, and there are growing reports of strikes and acts of sabotage. **********Those incidents suggest that opposition to fundamental change is increasingly coming not only from octogenarian Communist hard-liners but also from many ordinary blue-collar workers. Fear and Fury? **********Similar tensions have erupted throughout the former Communist bloc. While China has been able to avoid deep social upheavals associated with \"shock therapy\" in other countries, the experience here suggests that even a gradual weaning away from central planning can lead to widespread fear and sometimes fury. **********\"There's enormous frustration out there with the reforms,\" a Chinese economic official said. \"The leaders are running scared.\" **********What alarms the leadership is cases like that of Huang Chuanying, a bank director whom the official Chinese press hailed as \"a daring reformer.\" Mr. Huang tried to curb the Maoist-style labor practices that have crippled state-owned enterprises all over China, and he began dismissing bank employees considered incompetent and unproductive. **********One dismissed staff member, Cao Weihua, responded by firebombing Mr. Huang's house, severely wounding Mr. Huang, his wife and their two children. Mr. Cao was sentenced to death recently, but the incident seemed to reflect a broad concern among many Chinese that while a market economy may be more prosperous and efficient than a Communist one, it may also be less cozy. **********The contrast is profound with the mood in most of the last dozen years, when ordinary Chinese were ardent backers of change. In those years, they often took the initiative and pushed liberalization more quickly than the Politburo intended. **********\"Reform used to be very easy and rewarding,\" a Chinese journalist said. \"In the 1980's, it meant dividing up the land, and starting up free markets, and opening new businesses, and everybody loved it.\" **********But in the 1990's, the agenda is different. While virtually all Chinese endorse \"reform\" as a general slogan, many workers worry about what it will mean: higher rents, rising rice prices, and destroying the \"iron rice bowl\" system that guarantees workers stable employment and steady incomes. The Changing Rice Bowl **********According to a folk ditty now making the rounds among workers: Before liberation, we had a clay rice bowl. Then Chairman Mao gave us an iron rice bowl. Deng Xiaoping poked a hole in it. Since reform, we've had a porcelain rice bowl. **********\"A porcelain rice bowl looks rather elegant,\" a manual laborer in her 40's explained dryly. \"But it's no more sturdy than one made of clay.\" **********A 26-year-old woman who works in a factory said that when she was in the university, she believed that most Chinese wanted more economic liberalization. But now she figures that aside from intellectuals, many people are against fundamental changes. **********\"We need housing reform and price reform, but nobody wants them,\" she said. \"Who wants to pay more? I figure that in my factory, 80 percent of the workers believe in the iron rice bowl system.\" **********That may well be exaggeration, for most workers interviewed seem to be not so much hostile to change as worried by it. And while some are openly opposed, there also is a significant proportion that favors dog-eat-dog capitalism and believes that economic liberalization should be speeded up. Weaning From Subsidies **********Many of the problems arose because China's leaders have finally taken Western advice and moved to impose a market discipline on state-owned enterprises, one-third of which lose money. Exasperated by continuing inefficiency in those enterprises, China's leadership has waged a campaign since last year to wean factories from subsidies and expose them to market pressures. **********As a result, a few factories began to dismiss workers considered unproductive, a practice that almost never occurred in the past. There is also talk of layoffs to trim the 26 percent overstaffing that the Government admits exists in state enterprises. **********While many Chinese, particularly the university educated, say that such changes are essential, blue-collar workers are less enthusiastic. For the first time, a significant sector of the population, though probably not a majority, seems to be siding with Communist hard-liners in discouraging rapid market-style changes. **********Early this year, a laid-off driver at a toothpaste factory drove his truck over his boss, a pioneering manager who had shaken up his factory by adopting Western-style management practices. The central Government suggested that the factory manager be hailed as a \"martyr\" for reform, but the factory workers refused to nominate the manager for the honor, said the official who related the incident. **********In another case, reported in the official press, a 27-year-old factory worker was sentenced several weeks ago to 15 years in prison for shooting at his boss at a factory in Shanxi Province. The worker, who failed to wound the manager, had been dismissed last year. Machinery Smashed **********Factories in Xian, Tianjin and Dalian were reportedly also disrupted by angry workers, and in some cases machinery was smashed. After a watch factory in Tianjin temporarily laid off 2,400 workers early this year, rumors of suicides, sabotage and military intervention rapidly spread throughout Beijing. The official Economic Daily recently denied the allegations, and said the factory had retooled and reopened, providing jobs for all but 300 of the previous workers. **********\"The Government's talking about smashing our iron rice bowls, and making us pay for our own medical care,\" said a 29-year-old worker in Beijing. \"Companies are even beginning to lay off workers! Of course folks are angry.\" **********To be sure, apprehension of market-style changes is common around the world, from Russians who fear rising bread prices to New Yorkers who worry about lifting controls on rent. **********\"We're very different from the former Soviet Union,\" said a Chinese Government economist who has studied former Communist economies. \"We already have a foundation of a market, and people can get jobs on their own if they have to.

Losing a job doesn't have to be an unpleasant experience -- particularly for a former employee who used to work in an executive suite. **********Take the recently announced management changes at the Concord Camera Corporation, a maker of inexpensive cameras that has long reported strong growth in sales and profits. Jack C. Benun, longtime chairman and chief executive of the Avenel, N.J., company, announced earlier this month that he would be leaving as soon as a planned acquisition was completed. **********But don't cry for Mr. Benun. Because of a recent revision in his employment contract, he could walk away with a larger annual compensation than he had been making for the last few years. **********Mr. Benun's decision didn't shake investors. Since the day he said he planned to leave, Concord's stock has gained about 22 percent in value, climbing from $5.625 to close yesterday at $6.875 in over-the-counter trading. **********Why has Wall Street directed a raspberry at Mr. Benun? Well, the chairman has been something of a lightning rod for criticism among investors, particularly for his penchant for taking his annual salary of $375,000 in one lump sum each year -- something that certainly didn't help Concord's cash flow. **********But the criticism of the chief executive has heightened since 1991, when Concord's former chief financial officer accused Mr. Benun, who at the time was also president of Concord, of embezzling company funds. **********The financial officer, Michael Rea, sued the company, contending that he had been let go for making the accusations, and Concord made an out-of-court payment in settlement. **********Mr. Benun denied the embezzlement charges and the company's board exonerated him, but the allegations are still under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********As the potential troubles with the S.E.C. were brewing, Concord's relationship with the Midlantic National Bank, a primary lender, were growing rocky, as extension after extension had to be offered for repayment of a loan. **********By May, the troubles seemed to be clearing up. That month, the company announced that it had agreed to obtain up to $3 million in loans from Ira J. Hechler, a New York investor. At the same time, Mr. Benun's power at Concord seemed to be waning, as he announced that he would relinquish the title of president. **********Within two months, Mr. Benun's employment contract was up. But the directors of Concord did not take advantage of this opportunity to ease Mr. Benun out, clean up the mess and start anew. **********Instead, according to a filing made with the S.E.C. on Tuesday, Concord went the other way: Mr. Benun was given a new contract that almost doubled his salary, to $600,000 a year -- this time payable in biweekly installments -- although provisions in his previous contract for commissions and bonuses presumably based on performance were eliminated. The new agreement also deleted some provisions that would have terminated his compensation under certain circumstances. **********Now, under his new four-month old contract, if Mr. Benun is asked to leave his job without cause, he gets his full salary and benefits for the agreement's full three-year term. His rights under the company's stock option plan are not so clear, but the document leaves open the possibility that he would get to continue to participate. **********Was Mr. Benun worth this new amount? It would be hard to argue that he was, particularly since a new lender to the company, which was not identified in the filings by name, would not give a loan commitment to Concord without a guarantee that Mr. Benun would no longer hold the top posts. Mr. Benun did not return a telephone call seeking comment. **********The guarantee might increase the possibility that Mr. Benun will continue to pull down his hefty salary after he steps down. The chief executive agreed to resign once he learned of the provision, which some investors worry could technically be interpreted as meaning that Mr. Benun was dismissed without cause -- the very circumstance that allows for him to continue being paid. **********Michael Katzenstein, a lawyer with Cronish, Lieb, Weiner, & Hellman, which represents Concord, said that the resignation would have no impact on Mr. Benun's salary unless the employment agreement was revised. \"He is simply stepping down as chairman and chief executive of the company,\" Mr. Katzenstein said. \"That is without prejudice to any rights he might have under the contract.\" **********In the long run, this resignation could prove more financially rewarding to Mr. Benun than if he had stayed in his post. Concord's financial situation has been so tenuous that Mr. Benun had to lend it almost $735,000. That loan, which earns a rate of 2 percent over the prime rate, was subordinate to the Midlantic bank loan. And the bank loan would not get repaid without some fresh cash -- in this case, from the unidentified lender. **********In other words, for Mr. Benun to stand a chance at getting his money back, Midlantic would have to be paid. And the only way that could happen would be if he resigned.

The reductions will be made over the next two years through layoffs, early retirement programs and sales of parts of the company. **********Like other big steelmakers whose main customers include the depressed auto, construction and machinery industries, Bethlehem has been buffeted anew by recession, low prices and competition from smaller, more efficient steel mills. The USX Corporation, which owns the nation's largest steelmaker, said on Tuesday that its steel group lost $165 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $51 million a year ago. **********Bethlehem's jarring cutbacks will sever the company's historic link to workers and steel products made under the Bethlehem banner in Johnstown, Pa., since 1908. **********The 1991 quarterly loss exceeded the loss of $516.8 million for the comparable 1990 quarter. Sales fell 14.2 percent, to $1.03 billion, from $1.2 billion in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. The latest loss included a one-time charge of $575 million for anticipated costs in the restructuring. Analysts said most of the costs were associated with severance, pension and health-care plans for the large number of workers who will leave the company by the end of 1993. **********For the year, Bethlehem lost $767 million, compared with a loss of $463.5 million in 1990. Sales fell nearly 12 percent, to $4.32 billion from $4.9 billion. **********The company said it would stop paying the annual dividend of 40 cents a share on its common stock to conserve cash. Bethlehem shares fell $2.25 yesterday, closing at $13.75 on the Big Board. **********The company said it would search for buyers for the bar, rod and wire division based in Johnstown, but would close any plants in the unit that it did not sell. The unit includes 2,600 workers, with 1,900 in Johnstown and another 700 at plants in Lackawanna, N.Y., and near Baltimore in Sparrows Point, Md. **********It also plans to sell a plant in Steelton, Pa., with 400 jobs, and several coal mines in West Virginia, which employ 800. Another 400 jobs will be lost from the shutdown of coke oven batteries at Sparrows Point. The rest of the job reductions will be throughout the company. **********\"We have been experiencing losses at these facilities for some time, and there is no reasonable prospect for their return to profitability,\" said Walter F. Williams, chairman and chief executive. He blamed environmental regulations, high labor costs, competition and imports for the decision. **********But analysts said the steelmaker, based in Bethlehem, Pa., had dragged its feet, hoping to survive in a niche of the domestic steel business now dominated by smaller, lower-cost mini-mills. The smaller mills typically have lower cost advantages from newer equipment and nonunion work forces.  Once Employed 289,000 **********The cutbacks will reduce Bethlehem's work force to 20,000, a staggering decline from 157,000 workers in 1953, when the steel industry was one of the most powerful forces on the nation's industrial landscape. Bethlehem's peak employment was 289,000 in 1943, during a wartime campaign to build 1,110 warships. Bethlehem acquired the Johnstown works some 56 years after it opened in 1852 as the Cambria Iron Company to make steel rails for the Pennsylvania Railroad. **********Analysts said workers at the plants Bethlehem wants to sell probably would lose their jobs, at least for a while. That steel is sold mainly to auto makers and machinery manufacturers, who have increasingly turned to mini-mills like Nucor and Chaparral Steel for shipments since the early 1980's. **********\"The problem is that people working there are not interested in accepting concessions, having jobs or wages cut,\" said John E. Jacobson, an analyst at AUS Consultants in Philadelphia. \"Once plants are closed for a few years, workers often lower their expectations\" and buyers move in, he said. **********But leaders of the United Steelworkers of America said Bethlehem rejected the union's cost-cutting proposals for the Johnstown division last year. \"The union did everything it could to keep the division alive,\" said Andrew V. Palm, head of the union's District 15, which includes the Johnstown plant. **********\"We believed we had a handshake deal last summer\" to change the labor agreement, he said. And Bethlehem intended to invest $140 million to $180 million for a new continuous caster and other equipment. But Bethlehem's directors rejected the agreement, he said. **********Analysts said losses in the steel industry for 1991 would exceed $1 billion, partly because of slumping demand and prices that fell last summer to the lowest level in 10 years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/29/business/credit-markets-us-bonds-fall-in-light-trading.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1992-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 835, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Bonds Fall in Light Trading", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; U.S. Bonds Fall in Light Trading", "body_text": " **********Treasury bond and note prices declined yesterday in very light trading. **********Combined with smaller falls at the end of last week, investors have given up most of the gains that drove the yield on the 30-year bond down to 7.34 percent last Tuesday. **********These kinds of volatile moves are not unusual at the end of the year or in other periods when trading volume is below normal and investors are waiting for some more definitive news so they can decide what direction interest rates should take. **********There was no economic news yesterday to guide the market, and analysts said there was no point trying to read anything into the day's decline. **********\"It is hard to read this as bearish,\" said Peter McTeague, a fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, referring to the price decline in the market yesterday. \"So maybe we should dismiss all the bullish talk of last week,\" when prices were rising with little apparent reason, he added. **********But as Bill Clinton's inauguration approaches and the President-elect puts his economic proposals on the table, investors and traders will begin to get the kind of information they need to decide whether long-term interest rates should be moving down or up. **********In late trading in the secondary market, the price of the 7.625 percent 30-year bond was off 15/32 , to yield 7.40, up from 7.36 percent on Thursday.

This raised the fear that there might be such a demand for funds over the four days -- or \"the turn\" -- that short-term interest rates would skyrocket. Such a squeeze on borrowers helped send the Federal funds rate on overnight borrowing to 100 percent near the end of December in 1990. **********But yesterday the Federal Reserve helped calm fears by doing a seven-day repurchase agreement with bond dealers, which was a way for the central bank to assure managers that plently of funds would be available for the four-day weekend. **********Louis Crandall, chief economist for R. H. Wrightson & Associates, said he and many other analysts had expected the Fed to do a three-day repurchase, which would not have bridged the year-end turn. **********Mr. Crandal also said that \"a lot of people seemed to have done their financing well in advance\" because of the concern about getting caught. **********Although he warned that the year-end market could still be a little tight, he said, \"the risks of a really bad year-end have been subsiding.\" **********Following are the results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills: (000 omitted in dollar figures)                 3-Mo.

A major problem with this process, called internetworking, is controlling the volume -- and cost -- of traffic over expensive long distance phone lines. **********In most LAN operating systems, packets of data are sent along the network until they reach their intended destinations. Much of that data involves requests for access to expensive shared resources, such tasks as producing something on a color laser printer. **********In some cases, the data might travel quite a distance before getting to the right place. A print request might originate with a user in Chicago, but the only color printer is in New York. If there are three other offices on the network between Chicago and New York, each would get the print request, reject it and send it on. A solution is a device called a router attached to the network. It acts as a traffic cop and sends data to the proper destination via the most efficient route. **********Even with a traditional router, the amount of network traffic can still swamp a remote LAN connected via a regular phone line, since the phone line can handle only a small amount of data at any one moment. A T1 line, a dedicated high-speed phone service, eases the problem, but it can add significantly to the cost of servicing the remote LAN. One solution is to put additional routing power within the LAN itself by installing a router circuit board and software on the network's server computer. The local router decides what to do with outward bound data before it leaves the local network. **********\"For those companies committed to internetworking and running a single network operating system, like Novell's Netware, router cards are the way to go,\" said Paul Callahan of Forrester Research Inc., a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass. **********Eicon Technology of Montreal goes beyond the traditional with Router for Netware and its accompanying software and circuit board, known as the Eiconcard, to speed data to and from the remote LAN.

It then passes the request to the appropriate router, using the most efficient, or cheapest, connection on the network. **********Router for Netware comes in two versions. One is for packet switched commercial data networks that use a communications protocol known as X.25. (Packet switched networks are akin to long distance lines for computer data.) The other version is for point-to-point connections using private phone lines. Both models retail for $995.

More than 9,000 police officers are on duty here, including units sent from every German state. **********\"Bavaria is the most conservative region of Germany,\" a local man said as he watched police officers deployed in front of the boutiques that line Munich's downtown streets. \"The authorities here consider every protester a radical, and every radical a potential terrorist. People are going to leave here thinking that Germany is a police state, which is really not true.\" **********Some demonstrators carried ear-splitting whistles, which they blew in unison in the faces of police officers. **********Other protesters tried to dramatize issues they say are being ignored by the Group of Seven. Environmentalists staged theater performances on an improvised stage in front of City Hall, dressing themselves as birds and animals they said were threatened by logging in tropical forests. **********Among the performers was Bruno Manser, a Swiss anti-logging campaigner who lived among native tribes in Borneo for six years and has emerged as a hero of the European environmental movement. Mr. Manser won worldwide publicity for his cause at the summit meeting in London last year by climbing a lamppost, chaining himself to the top and hanging a banner urging protection for the tribes among which he lived. **********\"That won't be possible this year,\" he said. \"There are just too many police around.\"  Taunting the Police **********Street theater performances like the ones staged by Mr. Manser and his supporters were allowed to proceed peacefully, but violence flared repeatedly on nearby streets. Thousands of protesters, among them a handful seemingly bent on confrontation, taunted the police with chants comparing them to the Gestapo and the Stasi, the hated secret police that once dominated life in East Germany. **********A member of Parliament from eastern Germany, Christoph Matschie, said he had seen officers clubbing innocent bystanders and stomping on at least one handcuffed demonstrator. **********\"When I see the militaristic police presence here,\" Mr. Matschie told reporters, \"I am reminded of old times.\" **********Police officials acknowledge that they are still haunted by memories of the deadly Palestinian terrorist attack on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games in 1972, which left 11 Israelis, 5 Palestinians and a German dead. The head of the city's police union, Hermann Lutz, said that because of security concerns, visiting leaders would have to be \"virtually imprisoned\" during the conference. **********\"Downtown Munich is the wrong place for a giant event like this,\" Mr. Lutz said. \"There are plenty of other places, like Bonn, where security would have been much simpler and much less expensive.\"  'Anti-Summit' in Movie Theater **********As a counterpart to the street protests, environmentalists, feminists, human rights advocates and disarmament campaigners are holding conferences and seminars at a local cinema. Speakers today denounced \"the democracy of the rich and powerful,\" which they said was forcing the world to accept \"more cars, nuclear power plants, genetic technology, sex tourism and police repression.\" **********Organizers of the \"anti-summit\" were cheered by news that Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary General of the United Nations, had urged the Group of 7 to remember \"the great threat posed to international security by poverty, underdevelopment and lack of basic human rights.\" Remembering the Jews **********The most solemn of the protests was staged in a steady rain on Sunday by a small group of German and American Jews. The demonstrators, among them the Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Benjamin Navon, laid wreaths near the site where the Israeli athletes were killed in 1972, then marched to the site of the Dachau concentration camp, a few miles outside the city. **********Organizers of the service were disappointed that no representative of a world leader turned up. The only elected official present was Renate Schmidt, chairman of Bavaria's Social Democratic Party, who said Germany had a \"very special responsibility\" to condemn violence and racism. **********Heads of government who arrived this morning were brought to the city center by helicopter to spare them the 20-mile ride from Munich's new airport. Mr. Bush was the only leader to bring his own helicopter, and his security agents insisted that the pad where the copter was to land be moved away from the spot chosen by German planners; hedges and trees near the planned site made it insecure, they said.  No Broccoli for Bush **********Mr. Bush, labeled \"the broccoli-hater\" by several German newspapers, is being offered meals planned around white asparagus, a local favorite. The season is over, but planners arranged a special late harvest of a few stalks for the occasion. **********\"The President was so pleased with the asparagus that he came down to the kitchen and personally thanked the chef,\" said an official at the Sheraton Hotel, where Mr. Bush is staying. **********At his own request, Mr. Bush was also served Bavarian cheeses, platters of fruit and chocolate. **********Diplomatic eyebrows were raised this morning when President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia announced that he would arrive in Munich on Tuesday, although he had been invited only to Wednesday's session. After hurried consultations, aides to Chancellor Kohl said Mr. Yeltsin would be welcome at the state dinner on Tuesday. **********\"The G-7 is a group of gentlemen,\" Dieter Vogel, the German spokesman, said. \"If a guest arrives early, naturally he gets something to eat.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/15/business/company-news-beazer-holdings-sold-by-hanson.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Beazer Holdings Sold by Hanson", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Beazer Holdings Sold by Hanson", "body_text": " **********Hanson P.L.C., the British conglomerate, said it had sold the Australian construction and property interests of its Beazer P.L.C. subsidiary for $24.8 million to B. & B.

Most of the executives, bankers and inventors chose their offices or living rooms. Jerry Sanders of Advanced Micro Devices, famed for his flamboyance, sat in a giant carved bed wearing silk pajamas. **********But one of the most telling of the portraits was that of James G. (Jimmy T) Treybig, who posed in an open-collar shirt, headphones engaged, surrounded by electronic gear and walls covered with ham-radio caller ID cards -- looking exactly like every other middle-aged ham radio operator in the world. **********What makes all this unusual is that Mr. Treybig, 51, is chief executive of Tandem Computers, a $1.9 billion computer maker that employs 11,000 people and for a time in the early 1980's was among the fastest-growing companies in America. **********That Mr. Treybig is a Fortune 500 C.E.O. is unknown to most of the hundreds of other ham operators with whom he speaks each year. To them, he is W6JKB, well known for attempting the most difficult transmissions from the most out-of-the-way places. His are the call letters they hope to hear when struggling to reach the ultimate ham goal of talking to someone in 100 different countries. Mr. Treybig's status as Big Business Brahmin is fully appreciated only by a select group of hams, including a 60-year-old woman truck driver, who attend the annual two-day barbecue at Mr. Treybig's mountaintop home overlooking the San Francisco Bay. **********Chuck Smallhouse, a fellow Silicon Valley ham operator, enjoys Mr. Treybig's relative anonymity in the ham world. \"Jim is very low key when he's away from work. Except for newspaper and magazine photos, I've never seen him wear anything other than a T-shirt and a pair of Levis.\" **********Mr. Treybig has been a ham radio buff for most of his life, but he became an adventurer only after he founded Tandem. \"You see,\" he said in his Texas accent, \"I travel so much on business that going to someplace like Paris is no more special than going to Chicago. So to me a real vacation is to go to some unusual place, sit in the jungle and relax.\" **********Well, not exactly relax. The gear taken by Mr. Treybig and his companion, Drew Ritter, is formidable. So are the sites. Jimmy T's transmitter vacation choices -- at least once a year since 1980 -- have included places like Isla Desechio, an uninhabited Caribbean island populated with crabs and rats that ate all unsealed food the first night. Or the frozen coast of Greenland, or Easter Island, or Tovalu, one of the Gilbert Islands. **********Mr. Treybig and Ms. Ritter, often with the help of another couple, may set up a sophisticated dual radio station, complete with generator and 40-foot antenna, then spend most of the four or five days of transmitting time fielding voice or Morse code messages from hams worldwide. \"I find you can't think about business when you're working a telegraph key,\" says Mr. Treybig. **********It all demands the logistics of a small military campaign. First, the destination must be reachable by sea or air within the limited time span of Mr. Treybig's vacation.  Visas and clearances must must be obtained months ahead of time, since many host countries are suspicious of people setting up radio transmitters on offshore islands. There is the risk of tropical disease; and, Mr. Treybig said, when the site is an uninhabited island, guns are usually taken along in case of an unexpected encounter with drug smugglers. **********\"The places you want to go are either dangerous, you can't get a radio license for, or impossible to get to,\" he said. **********Still, some of the sojourns can be wonderful. Costa Rica's Isla Cocos turned out to be a place of jungle waterfalls, where lobsters could be picked right out of the water. On Tovalu, when word got out that Mr. Treybig knew something about technology, he was enlisted to fix the local church computer. **********As if getting to these offbeat locations isn't sufficiently challenging, Mr. Treybig tries to make each trip as technically impossible as possible. Each day he sets up a new antenna and tries to transmit at the very high, very difficult 50 megahertz level. Because 50 MHz usually has a range of just 50 miles, Mr. Treybig must draw upon a bag of tricks, skipping the signal off everything from local weather patterns to meteor trails -- even the moon -- to reach faraway operators. **********Mr. Smallhouse has received several of the Treybig moon bounces. \"Jim's skill level is very, very good,\" he said. \"He studies up on this stuff, makes his own predictions about propagations at different times of year and at different locations.\" **********Though the non-technologist may see the two as indistinguishably arcane, Jimmy T finds the unpredictability of ham radio a refreshing change from the logic of computers. And it goes deeper. \"It's different from business,\" he said. \"In business when you're successful there's always the dilemma: Is this recognition for my own work, or for the work of others? In the ham world I'm recognized for myself.\" **********It is also therapeutic. \"If it hadn't been for these trips,\" Mr. Treybig said, \"I think the tensions of the business world would have destroyed me long ago.\" **********The lesson hasn't been lost at Tandem; the company has an extensive ham radio club. As for Jim Treybig, when he isn't running his company, he is answering the hundreds of confirmation postcards (\"Yes, I talked to so-and-so on such-and-such a date from a temporary transmitting site on Tovalu\"). And planning next year's trip."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/02/business/a-wall-street-parable-with-no-heroes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3756, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Wall Street Parable With No Heroes", "print_headline": "A Wall Street Parable With No Heroes", "body_text": " **********Anyone trying to understand the flaws in the way American corporations are governed should take a long look at the Cooper Companies. Less than a decade ago, Cooper was a prosperous maker of contact lenses and medical products with $1.3 billion in assets and more than $600 million in sales. Today, it is a shrunken, unprofitable company at risk of indictment for insider trading violations. **********What happened? The glib explanation is that like many companies Cooper fell prey to the debt addiction of the 80's and was forced to go cold turkey when the credit tap ran dry. But a closer look reveals more than that: a tale of selfish executives, compliant directors and inattentive investors that could serve as a warning to anyone who trusts boardroom democracy to protect shareholders and employees. **********For this was not a case in which the American system of corporate government was abandoned. Indeed, all the reassuring elements of genuine shareholder control were in place: outside directors, executives with a stake in the company's common stock, influential institutional investors who seemed to hold the balance of power in proxy votes. Add to that lawyers able to litigate investor grievances and Federal rules requiring that shareholders be kept informed about the company's affairs. **********No, Cooper was governed like thousands of public companies. But, also like many companies, it lacked people with the ability and courage to make the system work as intended. Lacking them, no process of boardroom democracy could halt Cooper's slide into scandal. **********\"Listen, there are no heroes in this thing,\" said Frederick R. Adler, the venture capitalist and one of the new directors who are supposed to rescue the company. \"I've always been a non-believer in government regulations. But there is the other side: How    do    you protect against this kind of thing?\" Two Families Move In **********The situation to which Mr. Adler referred began in 1988, when members of two wealthy families gained board seats at Cooper by buying a small fraction of the company's shares. Largely unchallenged by outside directors or other investors, they awarded jobs to their relatives, regardless of qualifications; granted themselves lush salaries and perquisites, and ran their private interests in a way that raised doubts about their fitness to run a public corporation. **********One of the company's two young co-chairmen, Gary Singer, is now under investigation by Federal prosecutors for allegedly enlisting the company in an illegal junk-bond trading scheme, an accusation he has denied. Mr. Singer is on a leave of absence and declined to be interviewed about Cooper's problems. His former boardroom ally and co-chairman, Bruce Sturman, has been dismissed, and said in an interview last week that he was being punished for blowing the whistle on the bond trading scheme. And the company itself, while insisting it has done nothing wrong, has been notified that it is a target of the Federal grand jury handling the junk-bond case, raising the possibility that Cooper itself will soon face criminal charges and fines. **********The people who might have rescued the company, but did not, are typical specimens of boardroom life. There is Parker G. Montgomery, the company founder who lost control when he lost credibility with a deal-hungry Wall Street. There is Fred Adler, the Wall Street veteran who was hired as a consultant to woo institutional investors but who soon became distracted from Cooper's affairs. There is Arthur C. Bass, the \"can do\" manager from Federal Express who never really grasped the levers of power at Cooper. And there are money managers like Ralph Wanger of the Acorn Fund, who relied too much on Mr. Adler and ignored the other people involved. **********In 1958, Parker Montgomery, a lawyer, bought a tiny drug company called Cooper Laboratories and transformed it into a public incubator for new companies with products from toothbrushes to surgical lasers. In 1983, he spun off part of that business as Coopervision, a leading contact-lens company based in Palo Alto, Calif. Buyout Is Squashed **********That was in the springtime of the 1980's bull market, when \"M.& A.\" was becoming Wall Street's favorite candy. In 1984, Coopervision received a $25-a-share offer from Alcon Laboratories, the eye-care unit of Nestle. Arbitragers bought into Coopervision, but the Federal Trade Commission blocked the sale on antitrust grounds. **********After the aborted buyout, three things happened. First, Coooper revised its vision: moving beyond eye care into drugs and diagnostic lines, changing its name to the Cooper Companies in 1987 to reflect this, and financing its deals through the fund-raising prowess of Drexel Burnham Lambert. Its long-term debt jumped from $60 million in 1984 to $371 million in 1987. Wall Street was baffled by these changes, and the stock suffered. **********The second effect, Mr. Montgomery said, was that arbitragers were stuck when the antitrust ruling sent Cooper's stock tumbling from the mid-20's to the teens. These impatient investors, he said, began to preach what soon became an article of faith: Cooper was worth more dead than alive. \"They thought the only thing standing between them and $30 to $35 a share in liquidation value was Parker Montgomery,\" he said. **********The third consequence, Mr. Montgomery said, was that it divided Cooper executives and employees. \"There was never the same feeling from the employees back to us after they realized that we were prepared to sell this dream company for cash,\" he said. Unexpected losses hurt cash flow. Plans to raise cash by selling assets faltered. **********It was a time when a company needed a patient banker. But in March 1988, Security Pacific Bank -- overseeing about $127 million worth of company credit lines at various banks, and backing up a small commercial paper issue -- transferred Cooper's loans to the bank's \"workout\" operation. Other lenders followed, and Cooper had to pay down some debt. \"After 30 years of dealing with delightful human beings,\" Mr. Montgomery said, \"I found myself in the United States equivalent of a bank concentration camp.\" **********While these changes were occurring within Cooper, the takeover game had moved into high gear on Wall Street. By 1988, Mr. Montgomery said, a broker at L. F. Rothschild named Marvin P. Brown, now at Tucker, Anthony & R.L. Day, had sold the Cooper dismemberment theory to the Singer family, clients who owned a New Rochelle, N.Y., construction business. Separately, one of Mr. Brown's friends had mentioned the thesis to another family: the Sturman brothers (Howard, then 38 years old, Bruce, 32, and Wayne, 31), who owned real estate interests in Westchester County and New York City. **********The Sturmans, who owned about 10 percent of the company's shares, confronted the company first, in early 1988. The Singers, with just under 5 percent, arrived a few months later. Mr. Montgomery recalled that he met with both sets of new investors. He joined the Sturmans around a conference table at their law firm. And he invited the Singers -- brothers Gary, then 32, Brad, 31, and Steven, 27, and their father, Martin -- to a lunch at a Cooper facility in Tarrytown, N.Y. **********Mr. Montgomery said he liked Howard Sturman, the family spokesman, although the Sturmans wanted a faster retrenchment. As for the Singers, he said, \"I felt that, even though they might not have been my kind of guys, they were sincere. They were trying to diversify out of an industry which even they described as corrupt at best.\" **********In fact, any thorough research into the background of the Sturmans and the Singers would have quickly uncovered scandal. The Sturman family had been involved in a Medicaid fraud case in the mid-1970's and the Singers in a New York City fraud investigation that involved an associate of the Genovese crime family. **********Mr. Montgomery says today that he knew nothing of these worrisome associations. \"Marty Singer approached me as a contemporary, saying he was interested in establishing his kids as sort of like the Bass family,\" he said. \"He said he had hundreds of millions in cash available, and was intrigued by what he'd heard about the company.\" He expected the Singers to be passive investors. **********The Sturmans were a different story. They soon threatened a proxy fight, which Mr. Montgomery defused by offering board seats to the three Sturmans. Believing the Singers would support him, he offered a fourth seat to Steven Singer, just three years out of Harvard Law School. Martin Singer \"invited himself\" to board meetings, he added. **********But Cooper's creditors were not mollified -- and in July 1988, the Singers and Sturmans, who together held four of six board seats, forced Mr. Montgomery to resign. **********Parker Montgomery's departure ushered in three years of boardroom turmoil. **********Initially, Howard Sturman and Gary Singer shared the chairman's post, an arrangement that lasted less than a year. In November 1988, Martin Singer was hired as a \"senior consultant\" at an annual salary of $200,000, although the terms of his contract were often revised over the next three years. **********In March 1989, Arthur C. Bass, the former chief operating officer at Federal Express, was hired as chief executive, taking a seat on the board. \"He had a great resume,\" one former director said privately. \"But I'm not sure it was ever intended that he would have any power.\" Mr. Bass said neither he nor other company executives, including Steven and Brad Singer, could comment on Cooper \"until the dust has settled.\" **********By summer, the company was again battling Mr. Montgomery, who had begun a proxy fight, he said, because Cooper's preferred stock was the chief asset of the Cooper Development Company, the only piece of his former realm he still controlled. **********Cooper preferred stock was also the main asset of Cooper Life Sciences, a Cooper Labs spinoff that was now controlled by two New York investors: a commodity trader, named Mel Schnell and a brokerage house owner named Moses Marx. **********During this battle, the Sturman bloc on the board split. Howard and Wayne Sturman left the board. Neither would comment publicly about Cooper, but they claimed in subsequent lawsuits that they were forced out for supporting the Montgomery-Marx slate. Bruce Sturman threw his lot in with the Singers. **********So did the company's largest institutional investors -- who have always held a larger combined stake in the company than either the Singers or the Sturmans. These professional money managers apparently were attracted to Cooper by its cash and the presence of Mr. Adler, a paid consultant and one of the management nominees for the board in 1989. A partner in the law firm Fulbright & Jaworski, Mr. Adler ran a venture capital firm, Adler & Company, and Adler & Shaykin, the leveraged buyout firm. **********\"I didn't know the Singers at that point,\" said Mr. Wanger, portfolio manager of the Acorn Fund in Chicago, which became a large stakeholder in Cooper in May 1989. \"But I'd known Fred Adler for 20 years. He is one of the reasons I bought the stock.\" **********Other large investors in Cooper include Kemper Financial Services, First Pacific Advisors and Equitable Life. **********With victory unlikely, the Montgomery forces dropped their fight when the company agreed to put Mr. Marx on the board in August 1989. Joining him and Mr. Adler were Bruce Sturman and Gary Singer, the co-chairmen; Mr. Bass, the chief executive; Steven Singer, who is now chief operating officer; his brother Brad Singer, who later became president of a new Cooper real estate subsidiary; and two outside directors, Warren J. Keegan, a Pace University professor, and Ralph H. Thurman, a vice president of the Rorer Pharmaceutical Corporation. **********Mr. Marx said he can't remember much about his boardroom experiences. His primary goal, he said, was to see that the preferred shareholders got a fair shake. Besides, he said, he was \"just one voice\" on the board. **********Nor was Mr. Adler able to ride herd on the young men at Cooper. In early 1990, severe hepatitis curtailed his activities, he said, and he later began medical treatments that caused \"a certain malaise.\" Although he remained on the board through October 1991 -- a comfort to institutional investors -- he said in a recent interview that \"by early 1990, Cooper just didn't loom very large in my life. It didn't loom at all, in fact.\" **********By October 1990, Mr. Bass had resigned as chief executive, although he remained as a director, and no replacement was hired. Instead, Bruce Sturman and Gary Singer began to run the company themselves, with the approval of their generally compliant board. **********Investors might have found these developments relevant -- especially those who relied on Mr. Adler or who expected professional management. But Cooper's labyrinthine public reports omitted such details, or disclosed them sketchily or belatedly. Unfazed by Lawsuits **********That is not to say that investors did not have complaints. Lawsuits were piling up against the company, many by investors arguing that company assets were being wasted and that the company had failed to disclose important information in the past. Some of those cases have since been settled, but the company has made few changes in response to the suits. **********Meanwhile, Martin Singer remained as a consultant, collecting compensation estimated at $1.6 million over the years. In late 1990, Joseph C. Feghali, Steven Singer's father-in-law, was named to the board, replacing an outside director, Mr. Thurman. **********As board members came and went, so did senior executives in the contact-lens and medical-products units that remain today (Coopervision in Rochester and Cooper Surgical in Shelton, Conn.). Sales fell to just $48 million in fiscal 1990 -- and not just because major units were being sold. The company's stock price had shrunk below $6 -- it closed Friday at $2.625 -- and profits had vanished. **********Meanwhile, the \"selling, general and administrative expenses,\" which include salaries, rents, legal fees and perquisites, skyrocketed. In the fiscal year ended October 1987, the last year of Mr. Montgomery's tenure, these costs were an unseemly 65 percent of net sales. As sales fell, the ratio rose to 94 percent by fiscal 1989, and to 129 percent in the year that ended last October. Enter Junk Bonds **********Even with its high overhead and chronic unprofitability, Cooper continued to sell assets, generating a steady river of cash. What Cooper did with that cash is at the heart of the current scandal. Between 1988 and 1990, nearly $630 million in cash flowed into the company's pockets. To be sure, much of that money was used to repay the debts inherited from Mr. Montgomery's era. But that left millions to spare -- and by October 1991, about $54 million of it had been invested in junk bonds, up from just $9 million in October 1989. The amount continued to climb, reaching $72 million by last January. **********Under Gary Singer's direction, Cooper soon became known on Wall Street as a significant player in the junk-bond market. That is how Mr. Singer and the Cooper Companies crossed the path of G. Albert Griggs, a young assistant portfolio manager at the Keystone Group junk bond fund in Boston. **********Mr. Griggs pleaded guilty on May 21 to two criminal securities-law violations. In Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Griggs explained what he had done wrong. \"In early 1991,\" he said, \"I entered into a secret agreement with Gary Singer of the Cooper Companies Inc., a publicly traded company with executive offices in New York City, N.Y.\" **********The deal, he said, called for him to tip Mr. Singer to the bond fund's purchase plans, so that Cooper could buy those bonds first. Then Mr. Griggs would try to arrange for the fund to buy the bonds from Cooper. In exchange, he was to get a share of the company's profits, funneled to him through a phony firm called Back Bay Capital. **********Federal prosecutors contend that Cooper and unidentified relatives of its \"senior executive\" made about $2.3 million by trading on Mr. Griggs's inside information. (The Government filings do not name Mr. Singer, although Mr. Griggs did.) Both Mr. Griggs and a confederate in the scheme are cooperating with the Government, according to lawyers familiar with their case. **********Cooper has acknowledged in court documents that it paid money to Back Bay, but said the payments were for investment advice. It has denied wrongdoing. **********After Mr. Griggs's courtroom revelations, Cooper called an emergency board meeting on May 28. With Martin Singer in attendance, the board voted to grant Gary Singer a paid leave. It also suspended Bruce Sturman -- because, Mr. Sturman says, of a well-founded suspicion that he had \"turned Gary in.\" The company's explanation was that Mr. Sturman had violated his employment contract and engaged in disruptive behavior. **********In addition to suing to regain his job, Mr. Sturman has sued the company on the shareholders' behalf. Mr. Adler initiated a proxy contest to replace what he calls a Singer-dominated board. He dropped his fight when Cooper agreed to include him in a new nine-person board -- albeit one that is not a clean break with the past, since it still includes Mr. Feghali, Mr. Bass, Louis A. Craco, a lawyer whose firm represents the Singers, and Robert S. Weiss, a Cooper executive. **********After that slate was approved last week at Cooper's shareholder meeting in New York, Mr. Montgomery rose to speak. \"I would like to apologize,\" he said, \"to the thousands of Coopervision employees and 10,000 shareholders for the loss of dignity and dollars that resulted from the destruction of a once-great company.\" Why did the System Fail? **********Others involved in the Cooper saga express immense frustrations. \"I will admit,\" one large investor said privately, \"it has turned me a little sour toward the corporate world. The process should work for the shareholders, but there are too many easy ways for it    not    to work.\" **********Indeed, as this sad story shows, \"the corporate democracy paradigm -- that you have elections and people are accountable by elections -- has a fundamental flaw,\" said John Pound, a finance professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School specializing in corporate government. \"Usually, there is no opposition party.\" **********Regulators and scholars like Professor Pound are hoping that activist institutional investors will be more influential in boardrooms once formal S.E.C. rules are approved to permit them to consult on issues more freely. But no amount of regulatory change can give institutions the will to exercise the power they've already got, said Mr. Adler.  \"The institutions worry about liability if they come in and take a more active role. They're scared stiff of doing that now.\" **********Mr. Montgomery argued that a lack of standards for corporate officers is the problem. \"People should not be allowed to walk in off the street with no experience, as well meaning as they may be, and gain that experience at the expense of shareholders or employees,\" he said. The current \"swashbuckling approach,\" he added, \"is just wide open for abuse.\" **********Mr. Adler, too, has come to wonder whether his lifelong confidence in unfettered free enterprise is misplaced. \"As an investor, I have the bulk of my worth tied up in the capitalist system,\" he said. \"But for crying out loud, there is a line! And there are, in American corporate life, a multitude of cases where the overreaching or dishonest have crossed that line, but where there is no effective mechanism for cutting it off before the company is ruined. When that happens, who is going to act?\" **********He favors empowering the S.E.C. \"to impose some sort of receivership -- some sort of trustee\" to protect shareholders. **********Professor Pound, while sympathetic, argues that government cannot be a corporate nanny; ultimately, the job must be left to individuals in the marketplace. \"You just have to depend on people with guts and money and ingenuity spotting situations like this and shaking things up,\" he said. **********Unfortunately for Cooper, and many other troubled companies, the last few years have produced few such people, he said. \"But I just have to believe that, as institutional ownership grows, there's the potential for it all to work a little better in the future than it has in the past.\" THE SCANDALS HAUNTING COOPER **********When the Sturman and Singer families took control of the Cooper Companies in 1988, each was already acquainted with scandal. **********Muriel Sturman, the mother of the Cooper investors, was charged in 1975 with Medicaid fraud. She later pleaded guilty to a single count of making false government filings. **********And the three Singer brothers all worked at the construction business owned by their father, Martin, who was battling New York City school authorities -- and Federal prosecutors -- over allegedly fraudulent bills. **********The documents generated in the city's civil suit against the Singers shed light on the family's associations and business methods. A letter filed in Federal court in 1990 by the New York City Law Department noted that Martin Singer had regularly used a subcontractor named Barclay Farenga, who had been arrested in a major drug raid in 1987. Mr. Farenga -- who described himself as an associate of the Genovese crime family -- later admitted to his role in the drug deal and began cooperating with authorities. **********Mr. Farenga owned several companies that had worked on Mr. Singer's projects, and told city lawyers he routinely submitted phony invoices on a city school project and kicked back part of the profits to Mr. Singer -- an accusation the Singer family denied. City lawyers said the two men were close friends and that Mr. Singer was the godfather to Mr. Farenga's son. **********Moreover, over the years, several local governments have barred the Singer construction companies from bidding on public projects, citing their less-than-candid accounts of the school fraud investigation. Martin Singer declined an interview, on the advice of his attorney. \"I'd love to talk to you,\" he said, \"but every time I open my mouth, the lawyers scream at me.\" **********In December, his companies settled the city lawsuit by agreeing to pay the school board $5.2 million to cover, among other things, \"defective work and fraud at La Guardia High School.\" Federal prosecutors refused to comment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/26/business/making-a-difference-bombardier-snares-de-havilland.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1992-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 443, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Making a Difference; Bombardier Snares de Havilland . . .", "print_headline": "Making a Difference; Bombardier Snares de Havilland . . .", "body_text": " **********LAURENT BEAUDOIN, chairman and chief executive of Bombardier Inc. of Montreal, is a former chartered accountant who apparently knows a bargain when he sees one. He's also a committed federalist, not at all averse to giving French and English Canada bigger commercial stakes in each other to further the cause of national unity. **********These two traits were evident last week when Bombardier, which Mr. Beaudoin has built into a $3 billion-a-year transportation giant over the past decade and a half, acquired the Boeing Company's ailing de Havilland division, Ontario's largest industrial employer. **********The deal gives the 53-year-old Mr. Beaudoin (pronounced bo-DWAHN) nearly $500 million of provincial and federal financial support to help turn de Havilland around and try to secure the jobs of more than 3,700 workers. Bombardier's immediate out-of-pocket cost will be just $51 million, for 51 percent of de Havilland's shares. The Ontario government will pay $49 million for the rest of the stock, which Bombardier can buy after four years. **********Although there is intense international competition in the commuter jet market from such companies as Embraer of Brazil, Casa of Spain, British Aerospace P.L.C., Saab-Scania A.B. of Sweden and Fokker N.V. of the Netherlands, the deal made sense to Mr. Beaudoin in hard business terms. **********De Havilland makes turboprop commuter jets known as the Dash 8 series. It will be absorbed by Bombardier's Canadair division, which produces somewhat larger Regional Jets that transport up to 56 passengers over longer distances. **********\"Basically, we're looking at the same type of market,\" said Mr. Beaudoin. \"Their customers are airlines. Our customers are airlines, too. We feel the products are complementary. We're dealing with the same customer, but for a different line.\" **********De Havilland could also make spare parts for the Regional Jets and other Canadair planes, like the Challenger or Learjet business jets. The Cessna Aircraft Company, a competitor in executive jets, was sold last week by General Dynamics to Textron Inc. **********Yet while Canada's political future is uncertain, the Bombardier move into Ontario is also an act of good corporate citizenship. Tensions between French- and English-speakers are \"outdated, a throwback to another age and time,\" said Mr. Beaudoin, who argues that if politicians can't hold the country together, then business must try. **********It is Bombardier's second recent acquisition in Ontario. Late last year it acquired UTDC Inc., which makes subway cars. **********Bombardier is also in the high-speed train business.

In recent days, Olympia & York Developments Ltd., New York's largest commercial landlord and a financial powerhouse in its Canadian homeland and abroad, turned to its banks to ease a cash crisis and began negotiating to reorganize billions of dollars of debt in an attempt to retain its vast holdings. **********Now, Paul Reichmann, the highly regarded head of Olympia, will negotiate with scores of bankers to get easier payment terms, forgiveness of debt and a capital structure that will allow the company the latitude to finish its huge Canary Wharf project in London and meet its debt obligations in North America. **********The troubles of this huge conglomerate, which owns the World Financial Center in New York and many other Manhattan office towers, underscore how heavy bank borrowing and falling commercial real estate values in the United States and London have devastated even the strongest property companies. **********In London last week, Citibank foreclosed on Randsworth, a $425 million property investment by a group of pension funds in more than a million square feet of London office and retail space. And developers on both sides of the Atlantic have faced cash squeezes as rents and property values have fallen. **********Besides its real estate holdings, Olympia & York owns most of the Gulf Canada oil company, most of Abitibi-Price, the world's largest maker of newsprint, and enormous property holdings in the United States and Europe. It is one of the world's largest private companies and its losses in property investments could yet have a devastating impact on many of the biggest banks in Canada, the United States, Europe and Japan that have lent more than $12 billion to the company. Rumors of the company's troubles have roiled the commercial paper markets for the last few weeks. **********News of the Olympia cash crisis shook the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, causing real estate and banking issues to fall sharply and the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 to fall 26.28 points, to 3,443.67. The Financial Services Index plunged 67.97, to 2,689.18 as investors speculated on what effect Olympia's troubles may have on Canadian banks. **********The exchange's real estate and construction index plunged 83.21, to 6,149.04. And the news brought swift Government action. Finance Minister Donald Mazankowski of Canada said that Ottawa was negotiating with banks to stabilize the company, but he said no bailout was being considered. **********For Olympia, the task ahead is to reorganize its debt and try to wring as many concessions from its lenders as possible to protect the company's assets from foreclosure. The company raised more than $170 million in emergency cash last week to ease the crunch. \"This will be an exercise in re-establishing the base in all his properties,\" a prominent real estate executive said. **********\"The banks are going to accept different terms and lesser debt in exchange for equity in the properties. And that is the game of convincing them that the equity is worth more than it is,\" the real estate executive said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"If you do that right, what you get is usually much more than you give.\" Referring to Mr. Reichmann, the executive said: \"He gets lower debt and better cash flow and they get a future on the value of the equity. The only way he can lose is if they take the properties.\" **********The restructuring of the Olympia & York empire is likely to prove one of the largest in history and will bring into the center of public attention the Reichmann family, the secretive Toronto billionaires who own the company, and the banks that lent them billions. Since 1990, when the family began quietly looking for a a buyer for 20 percent of its portfolio of American real estate, speculation has swirled that Olympia was squeezed for cash. **********Some Wall Street real estate professionals estimated that Olympia had more than $12 billion of bank debt on its books. The company's cash problems have limited its ability to refinance the hundreds of millions of dollars of debt that matured regularly and to do other necessary things like pay for needed property improvements. Huge Cash Drain **********Its 71-acre London project, known as Canary Wharf, is still an enormous cash drain and Olympia has had a hard time taking out the money it invested in development and construction of the project through bank refinancing and issuing public securities. The company's cash flow has shrunk as its non-real estate investments have suffered in the worldwide recession. The Reichmanns have been unable to sell off property to raise cash quickly because the real estate markets have been virtually frozen for more than a year now. **********Olympia's troubles harbor huge potential losses for some banks. But because many of the loans are collateralized by individual properties, some banks may suffer only small losses. It is widely expected in the New York real estate market that the banks will take equity positions in some of the Olympia properties in exchanging for writing down the company's debt, reducing interest rates and extending loan maturities. **********\"The banks have few options in dealing with them now,\" said another real estate executive who also declined to be identified. \"The banks have to provide liquidity or they have a huge problem. Reichmann can use this to his advantage because the banks' alternatives are limited and so they have to be very understanding and work this out.\" **********But even if the banks are very cooperative with the Olympia executives, the restructuring of the company's billions in debt will likely be protracted because of the scale of the debt and the complexity of the company's capital structure. **********J. P. Morgan & Company, which has about $50 million in unsecured loans to the company, is expected to serve as its adviser in the negotiations. **********Yesterday, a spokesman for Olympia declined to comment on the focus of the talks with the company's banks and would say only that the current cash crisis was brought about because the speculation in the commercial-paper markets made it difficult for the company to raise money for the enormous refinancing needs it has each quarter and to refinance commercial paper debt. **********\"Speculation surrounding the commercial-paper program created a liquidity crisis, which delayed arrangements for other sources of finance,\" Peter Rosenthal, a spokesman for Olympia, said yesterday. **********Commercial paper has long been one of Olympia's main source of financing because the rates are low. But few companies are able to retire all their commercial paper outstanding on short notice. Typically, Olympia would borrow short-term money that would mature every 30 to 90 days and would refinance that debt as it matured with more commercial-paper issues. **********Although the recent market rumors and rating agency downgrades of Olympia & York commercial paper over the last several weeks forced the company to reduce its commercial-paper programs from about $800 million to $400 million in Canadian dollars recently, Olympia's problems are more fundamental to problems in the real estate industry."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/18/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-736692.html": {"writer_name": "Eben Shapiro", "pub_date": "1992-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Red Lobster, Minneapolis, to Saatchi & Saatchi, New York for network and syndication television buying.

Members of the commission, an organization of 199 party elders who look over the shoulders of younger leaders, played a central role in a purge in 1987 of moderates and in the crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen democracy movement. **********Today's announcement was another indication that the party congress, the first in five years, will probably go badly for the hard-liners. The congress is charged with selecting a new Central Committee and approving the party line for the next five years. Recommending Its Own Demise **********Liu Zhongde, a spokesman for the congress, said at a news conference this evening that the Central Advisory Commission had itself recommended that it should be abolished. He also said the congress's agenda did not include the selection of a new commission. **********The official New China News Agency went further, quoting Mr. Liu as stating unequivocally that the advisory commission will be abolished and references to it removed from the Communist Party constitution. **********Deng Xiaoping, the 88-year-old paramount leader, has urged for several years that the advisory commission be scrapped. But he had been blocked by his chief rival, the 87-year-old Chen Yun, who is also the chairman of the advisory group. **********To give the impression of unity, the commission was apparently instructed to recommend its own demise. The nearly 2,000 delegates to the party congress are entrusted only with approving decisions already made, and so the recommendation is virtually certain to be accepted. Don't Count Old Guard Out **********The abolition of the advisory commission carries great symbolism as an attempt by China to shed the image of a nation ruled by geriatrics. But at a practical level the octogenarians may still be able to exert influence informally through their webs of connections. **********Mr. Deng, for example, holds no official post whatsoever, and yet he remains overwhelmingly the most powerful leader in China. **********The paradoxes seemed particularly evident today, for at the same time that the party announced the expected abolition of the advisory commission, it declared that special invitations to attend the congress had been issued to Mr. Deng and 45 other elders who joined the party before 1927 and are now retired from high office. **********Pressed by reporters about whether Mr. Deng would attend the congress, Mr. Liu did not answer directly. But he said that Mr. Deng had accepted the invitation, and he gave the impression that Mr. Deng was likely to participate. **********The party today named Qiao Shi, a moderate Politburo member, as the secretary general of the congress.

Takes On the Supermarkets With Uniform Pricing", "body_text": " **********Using its enormous clout in the marketplace, the Procter & Gamble Company is taking a bold step to simplify the Byzantine system of American grocery pricing. Though the move could reduce the wild swings in consumer food prices, replacing them with what the industry calls \"everyday low prices,\" it could also squeeze supermarket profit margins. **********Throwing out its old price list on nearly half of its products over the last few months, Procter & Gamble has set lower wholesale prices on goods ranging from Jif peanut butter to Cascade dishwashing soap. But the savings have not made supermarkets happy. Procter & Gamble has also slashed the generous discounts it used to persuade grocers to stock up on its goods. **********In the view of Procter & Gamble and many other packaged goods manufacturers, grocers have abused these so-called promotional allowances by stockpiling products on special -- wreaking havoc with manufacturers' production schedules in the process. Over the last 10 years, grocers have spent millions of dollars to build warehouses solely to stock excess inventories of goods bought on special. Such buying practices have allowed them to go perhaps six months or more before reordering a product. **********By removing the incentive for grocers to overstock, Procter & Gamble hopes to even out the retailers' order flow and its own production cycles. And it hopes that giving shoppers consistently lower prices will breed brand loyalty, making consumers less sensitive to the recurrent sales that have diluted such loyalties in recent years. **********Not surprisingly, the program is being closely watched and quietly tested by many of Procter's rivals, including Kraft General Foods, the nation's largest food company. And the advertising industry is giddy over the prospect that a reduction in promotional spending might bring more money its way. **********But the move could hurt supermarket chains, which have come to rely on promotional payments from manufacturers for profits. Though trade allowances were originally devised to give grocers flexibility in marketing a product, allowing them to decide, for instance, whether to discount or to spend on advertising to help move more product, many have simply pocketed the money. Analysts believe that some chains make up to a third of their profits from trade payments meant for marketing. **********\"There is growing public discussion of the fact that the manufacturer sees very little of its promotional dollar reach the hands of the consumer,\" said Patrick L. Kiernan, senior vice president of the Grocery Manufacturers of America Inc., a group of large food processors. The trade allowance is \"the drug of choice in our industry,\" he added. \"It has not helped the efficiency of the system.\" **********THE risky move by P.&G. is a bid to seize back a degree of control in the seesawing power struggle between supermarket chains and food companies. Supermarkets, the guardians of shelf space, have dominated the relationship in recent years. But P.&G. has a greater chance than perhaps any retailer in America to regain the upper hand because few supermarkets could afford to drop its brands. The company sells products in 44 categories, from diapers and toilet paper to shampoo and shortening, with the No. 1 or No. 2 product in an incredible 32 of those categories. **********P.&G.'s new approach seems directly inspired by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Wal-Mart's promise of \"Always the low price on the brands you trust\" has made it the nation's largest retailer. It has been able to deliver on the promise in part by forcing suppliers like P.&G. to be more efficient. **********\"Wal-Mart has kind of forced the issue,\" said Gary Giblen, a supermarket analyst with Paine Webber. **********Frank E. Blod, a principal with New England Consulting Group, a consulting firm in Westport, said, \"Wal-Mart and other retailers are sitting down with suppliers and saying, 'We have cleaned up our operations, we want you to become low-cost suppliers.' \" **********P.&G. has experienced Wal-Mart's potent market presence first hand. Retailing experts estimate that it does more than $1 billion of business a year with Wal-Mart, more than 10 percent of its domestic volume. P.&G. even has a team of executives living in Wal-Mart's home town of Bentonville, Ark., to manage the important account. **********But some supermarkets argue that Procter & Gamble's new prices are expressly designed to benefit low-margin, high-volume discount operators like Wal-Mart. Supermarket operators have long harbored suspicions that the packaged goods giants secretly give special prices to discounters and warehouse clubs and P.&G.'s move to a pricing system that seems to favor low-cost retailers only heightens such fears. **********Durk Jager, head of P.&G.'s United States operations, is considered the principal architect of the new strategy. But Edwin L. Artzt, P.&G.'s chairman since 1990, is credited with directing the company to fundamentally re-examine the way it does business and the industry's method of selling products. Last month, he announced plans to sell the company's pulp division, a move analysts cited as one more sign of Mr. Artzt's willingness to shake things up. **********\"They are going through a major restructuring of their total approach to marketing and selling products,\" said Mr. Blod, the consultant. **********P.&G. declined to make an executive available to discuss its new everyday low prices program. But Ann J. Smith, a company spokeswoman, said that building customer loyalty was an important consideration. \"This creates a better value for a brand's regular user,\" said Ms. Smith. **********Smoothing out production runs at Procter's factories is another goal, she said. To meet demand for a product on special, factories may run around the clock for four weeks, and then operate at less than capacity for several months, until supermarkets have depleted their inventories and are ready to reorder. \"This will allow us to improve our inventory management and lower our operating costs,\" Ms. Smith said. **********The benefits of the price strategy are being felt, P.&G. says. \"We have seen upturns in shipments over the last several months in the businesses that we have moved to this strategy,\" Ms. Smith said. **********The lower prices are in place for about 40 percent of P.&G. products. Jay H. Freedman, an analyst with Lincoln Capital Management in Chicago, estimates that the cuts range from 25 percent on Oxydol laundry detergent to 10 percent on toilet paper. **********Under the new system, Dawn, the liquid dishwashing soap, for example, might now regularly sell for $1.32 for the standard bottle. Under the old system, the price swung wildly, say from 99 cents to $1.89, perhaps averaging out at $1.37. **********Other manufacturers, while reluctant to discuss the issue, are at least considering similar pricing. Kraft General Foods told large customers that it would test a low-pricing strategy on some products. Dial and Colgate are also reported to be testing such a strategy. Grocery executives said Nabisco is testing just-in-time delivery systems with some of its large supermarket customers. **********But manufacturers without leading brands are more reluctant to embrace the shift.  Cutting out specials makes it harder to build market share or prop up a lagging product by throwing special deals at grocers. \"It's a risky move,\" said an executive at one medium-sized company. \"You reduce your options, you don't have a marketing war chest.\" **********Mr. Giblen, the supermarket analyst with Paine Webber, said other factors also will make it hard to do away with trade allowances. \"As long as you have Harvard M.B.A.'s out there as brand managers trying to increase volume share for one year\" to get promoted, he said, you will have advocates of trade allowances. **********MANY manufacturers applaud the logic behind Procter's new strategy, even while questioning whether they can make it stick. **********Cliff Larsen, vice president of marketing for Hershey's Pasta Group, said, \"I wish them well, but the likelihood of them being able to hold their breath long enough to make this work is pretty remote. I think they are going to get hurt pretty badly.\" **********The Vons Corporation, a supermarket chain based in Arcadia, Calif., was widely rumored in the trade to have threatened to drop some P.&G. products because of the new pricing systems. A spokeswoman for the company denies such rumors and said the company continues to stock P.&G. products. **********Some supermarket executives area concerned that P.&G. will not pass along to grocers all the savings from cutting the trade spending. \"We are going to be watching that very carefully,\" said Mike O'Rourke, a spokesman for the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company. \"If they're trying to drop promotional spending to improve profitability, then they will have problems.\" **********But even among grocers uneasy about giving up traditional trade practices, there is near universal agreement that the current system defies reason. A host of studies show that huge inefficiencies have developed because of the emphasis on special deals and trade allowances. **********The Harvard Business Review reported in 1990 that forward buying, the practice of buying many months' worth of a product on a special deal, and then selling most of it at a regular price, accounted for as much as 50 percent of the total stock of goods in distribution. Carrying that extra inventory added between $1.6 billion to $2.9 billion to food industry costs. **********In a 1991 study, the Grocery Manufacturers of America, the trade group, found $60 billion to $80 billion worth of excess inventory in the total food distribution system. \"The industry has allowed itself to become bloated,\" said Mr. Kiernan. THE PRESSURES ON ADLAND **********Among the most enthusiastic supporters of Procter & Gamble's move to cut trade spending are recession-battered advertising executives. In a recent survey, Nielsen Marketing Research found that the average large packaged goods company put 52 percent of its 1990 promotional budget into trade spending and only 27 percent in advertising. Manufacturers often pay close to $1 million simply to get a new product stocked nationally, according to the survey. **********With advertising spending having fallen last year for the first time in 30 years, agency heads are eager to win back a bigger piece of the marketing pie. In fact, they spent much of a recent convention in Florida bashing promotional spending. **********\"The pendulum must swing back,\" said Robert L. James, chairman and chief executive of McCann-Erickson Worldwide.

Only two changes, one thought up late Thursday afternoon by European officials, altered the broad framework of the American plan. **********The American plan was both strategic and cosmetic. **********Strategically, it severed the Gordian knot of international farm trade by dealing with virtually every question at the same time, including some issues that had festered since the Johnson Administration -- at a high cost to American economic and foreign policy interests. **********The cosmetics came in the fig leaf the American proposal offered the Europeans. The United States abandoned its most visible demand in farm trade policy: that the European Community commit to reduce the tonnage of its subsidized grain exports by 24 percent over six years. More Rigid Method Used for Calculation **********In its place, Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan and Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, called for only a 22 percent reduction -- but calculated by a new, more rigid method that made the 22 percent equivalent to a 24 percent cut under the previous system. The final compromise last week used the new method with a 21 percent cut. **********To sweeten the offer, the United States made two concessions on Europe's subsidized production on soybeans and other oilseeds. The seeds are used in protein-rich animal feed, cooking oil and paint. **********The change in the appearance, though not the substance, of the American position, gave the 12-nation European Community a politically palatable way to claim victory while retreating. **********Here is how the compromise on Friday seems to have been reached: *********** Mr. Madigan and Mrs. Hills met on Oct. 11, 12 and 13 with Frans Andriessen, the community's External Relations Commissioner, and Ray MacSharry, the community's Agriculture Commissioner, in Brussels, and an agreement was nearly reached, based on the United States proposal. *********** When American and European aides met again in Brussels on Oct. 19, 20, and 21, the deal fell apart, as community negotiators made new demands under pressure from the French Government. France is by far Europe's leading food producer and exporter, and French farmers are highly organized politically. *********** Mr. Madigan and Mr. MacSharry met in Chicago on Nov. 1, 2 and 3 and failed to find a common ground. The Americans were eager for a deal before Election Day, lest a Bush defeat erode their credibility, but could not win European support for their proposals. *********** The top trade officials met again last Wednesday and Thursday at Blair House, the White House's sumptuous residence for visiting dignitaries, and revived the original plan from a month earlier, making two changes. The Europeans flew home, consulted with colleagues and cinched the deal by phone on Friday morning. **********The meetings themselves involved hours of poring over production and trade statistics, inevitably punctuated with jibes about food. At Blair House last Wednesday, for instance, Mr. Madigan complained repeatedly when Mrs. Hills's office served a dinner of consomme, egg-salad finger sandwiches and sweets. **********\"We've just been treated to an evening repast by U.S.T.R. -- now we're going to get something to eat,\" said Mr. Madigan, a high school football player who played offensive and defensive line in central Illinois, as he stepped into his limousine after the meeting. \"U.S.T.R. is a very low-budget operation.\" Stickiest Issue In the Negotiations **********Farm subsidies had been the stickiest issue since the current round of 108-nation world trade talks began six years ago in Uruguay, under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based group that administers world trade. And until the farm issues were resolved, there was little hope of proceeding on other fronts, from telecommunications to shipping to manufactured products. The aim is to have freer trade in virtually all goods and services. **********When American officials began arriving in Brussels on Sunday morning, Oct. 11, they were optimistic that a deal on agriculture might finally be struck. **********The most implacable foe of compromise, the French Government, had survived a national referendum on European economic integration three weeks earlier and did not face another national vote until parliamentary elections in March. And the near-collapse of the European Monetary System at the end of September had left European countries, especially Germany, convinced that a trade deal was needed to stimulate their faltering economies. **********Mrs. Hills and her senior deputy, Julius Katz, quickly reached common ground with their counterparts on banking, insurance and other long-standing disputes. **********But when Mr. Madigan arrived that evening for talks on farm subsidies, the impasse reasserted itself. **********European officials are confronted with a larger percentage of their population who are farmers than in the United States. As in Japan, they have an emotional reluctance to let markets rule their agriculture, and an emotional attachment to food self-sufficiency, because of memories of widespread hunger during and after World War II. **********The Europeans had steadfastly resisted American efforts to reduce subsidies, even though subsidies inflate European farm production, artificially depress European demand for American exports and result in huge and inefficient European exports that take markets away from American farmers. **********Because the rest of the talks had progressed well, the two sides had already drafted a joint communique proclaiming success. (That same communique, with a revised paragraph on agriculture and an extra sentence on production of soybeans and other oilseeds, was finally issued last Friday, an American official said.) **********Mr. Madigan and Mrs. Hills had been insisting that the United States would accept nothing less than a 24 percent cut over six years in European subsidized grain exports, because European officials had mentioned this figure in November of last year before later refusing to accept it. **********In desperation, the American officials agreed to propose a seemingly lower percentage -- the so-called clean 22 -- along with a new method of calculating how much should be cut each year. In specifying stricter levels for each year, the new method operates like annually compounded interest at a bank, and the end result over the six years would be as deep a cut as the 24 percent. **********The American team put the new offer on the table, and headed for the airport Tuesday morning. Tactic Was Gamble With Political Risks **********Coming less than a month before Election Day, the tactic was a gamble, with political risks. By going below 24 percent, the Administration might be accused of sacrificing American economic interests for the sake of political gain. Two lower-level American officials even said privately in late October that they were appalled by the decision to go below 24 percent. **********They feared that the Europeans would insist that the United States had lowered its offer to 22 percent but would not accept the new method of calculation that went with it. **********The Europeans' initial response to the American offer was favorable. But a week later, when aides from both sides met in Brussels, the Europeans were intransigent. **********The virtual collapse of the talks in Brussels on Oct. 19 and 20 appears to have had its roots in a meeting of heads of government of the European Community's 12 member nations in Birmingham, England, on Oct. 16. President Francois Mitterrand of France criticized the American plan then as going beyond the community's overhaul last May of it so-called Common Agricultural Policy. And Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Prime Minister John Major of Britain were unable to override Mr. Mitterrand's objections. **********On Oct. 22, C. Joseph O'Mara, the Agriculture Department's chief staff negotiator and resident statistical guru, flew home from Brussels in disgust. His community counterparts had insisted that they could not go above 18 percent under the old system of calculation. **********That evening, Mr. Katz, Mr. Madigan, Mrs. Hills, Acting Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and Robert B. Zoellick, the deputy White House chief of staff, gathered at the White House and decided the time had come to threaten a trade war. **********They assembled a list of $300 million of annual imports from the European Community, including white wine, rapeseed oil and wheat gluten used in animal feed (much of Europe's white wine comes from Burgundy, the home of France's Agriculture Minister). And they decided to announce a 200 percent punitive tax on these goods after the Presidential election if a settlement could not be reached. **********The decision to delay the tax until after the election was made for two reasons, American officials said. They thought the Europeans would ignore any earlier move as election-year politics. They also thought the action would not help or hurt them on Election Day. Indeed, a report of the American shift to 22 percent from 24 percent appeared in print on Oct. 29, and did not become a campaign issue. The change was hard to explain and was lost in the heat of the final days before the election. **********Under pressure from Prime Minister Major of Britain, President Bush agreed to another round of talks in Chicago, on Nov. 1-3, right before the Presidential election. Nervous about being accused of hatching a last-minute deal, the Agriculture Department tried to keep the location of the talks -- the Mayfair Hotel -- a secret. When that failed, Mr. Madigan insisted on standing so far apart from Mr. MacSharry at a brief news conference that television crews could not capture them in the same image. **********Mr. Madigan and Mr. MacSharry explored new ways to strike an oilseeds deal, including the use of tonnage limits instead of acreage limits. But the talks collapsed late on Nov. 3, partly because Jacques Delors, the President of the European Community, called Mr. MacSharry and objected to the tonnage limits as inconsistent with the community's May 21 position on cuts . **********On the flight home, Mr. MacSharry wrote Mr. Delors, furiously resigning as the community's farm negotiator. In Washington, Mrs. Hills announced on Nov. 5 that the United States would start collecting the 200 percent import taxes on Dec. 5. **********The American announcement led to a series of angry meetings in European capitals, as Britain and the Netherlands strong-armed France into allowing the negotiations to resume, in Washington on Nov. 18-19. **********Mr. MacSharry agreed to return and was given a free hand. Talks were set for Blair House, diagonally across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. On Wednesday evening, European officials said they wanted to go back to the formula offered in Brussels on Oct. 13. **********Two changes were made on Thursday, each an American concession. Having taken the gamble of the clean 22 and survived, the Americans pulled back to 21 percent on the tonnage of grain exports the Europeans could subsidize. The Europeans then made a last-minute proposal: they asked to be able to plant an additional small quantity of oilseeds that could be used for paint production and other industrial uses, using land taken out of general oilseed production. Mr. Madigan and Mrs. Hills agreed. . **********The Blair House deal also accepted the community's decision, on May 21, to reduce its oilseed acreage next year by 15 percent, provided the community agreed to a permanent 10 percent reduction and agreed to binding arbitration if either figure were exceeded. Late Thursday night, American farm lobbyists grudgingly agreed to go along. Word Received Of Deal's Approval **********Friday morning, Mr. Madigan climbed out of bed at his home in Falls Church, Va., picked up the phone and called Mr. MacSharry, who assured him the deal had passed muster at the community's headquarters in Brussels. **********Mr. Madigan began trying to disguise the American accomplishment to make it easier for European leaders to promote the deal at home. **********Asked then whether the change in method made the 21 percent actually equal to 23 percent, Mr. Madigan was guarded. \"If somebody else wants to make that observation they can, but I'm not going to say that.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/04/business/us-and-france-fight-over-piece-of-airline-market.html": {"writer_name": "John Cushman", "pub_date": "1992-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 848, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. and France Fight Over Piece of Airline Market", "print_headline": "U.S. and France Fight Over Piece of Airline Market", "body_text": " **********Just as the summer season for trans-Atlantic travel begins, a dispute between the United States and France over how many passengers United States airlines may carry between the two countries is threatening to disrupt flights and increase ticket prices. **********After the latest round of negotiations in Washington ended fruitlessly on Tuesday, France warned that it intended to act unilaterally to restrict the capacity of the American carriers, which have made strong gains recently, perhaps as early as this weekend. **********But by this evening it was uncertain what steps, if any, the French Government would take immediately. It appears that the uncertainty might last for a few days, if not longer, as the brinkmanship that typifies such negotiations takes over. **********The dispute could have implications for Americans flying to other countries as well. The Bush Administration is reluctant to accede to the French demand out of fears that Germany, Japan or other nations might follow suit. Eventually, airline and Administration officials warned, the dispute may severely disrupt air travel. **********France wants the eight American carriers that fly to France to cut their available seats by 500,000, or nearly 20 percent, in the coming six months. Then, Air France, which is heavily subsidized by the French Government, would face less pressure to compete for passengers by cutting fares. Passengers from both nations would end up paying higher fares regardless of which airline they chose. **********Although the United States has been pressing its trading partners for more free trade in airline flights, this dispute shows how far from a free market the situation remains. Although domestic air travel was deregulated in the 1970's, for international routes the airlines and the governments in effect negotiate cartel-like marketing agreements that vary in the kinds of restrictions they impose. **********The dispute comes as travel between the two countries is recovering strongly from the recession -- mainly to the benefit of the United States airlines, which have captured at least two-thirds of the market. **********Most of the eight American carriers that fly to France resubmitted their schedules today, ignoring the French demand. Some made modest reductions, but without eliminating anything near the 20 percent, 500,000-seat cut that the French have demanded, representatives of several airlines said. **********\"We are planning to fly our schedules as announced,\" said a spokewoman for United Airlines, Lynn Martenstein. \"We remain confident that the U.S. Government will be able to resolve outstanding issues with the French Government.\" **********On Tuesday, Transportation Secretary Andrew Card signaled a tough negotiating stand in a speech before a large gathering of aviation industry executives in Washington. He said he had spoken to his French counterpart, Paul Quiles, and had insisted that the Americans be allowed to fly their full schedules. **********\"Let me be clear about this issue: the United States places a very high value on its bilateral agreements,\" Mr. Card said, referring to a 1990 agreement between the two countries. \"We respect those agreements, and we honor them faithfully. And we do expect the same from our trading partners.\" **********Laurent Aublin, the spokesman for the French Embassy, replied that in the French view the 1990 agreement, which would have accommodated the increase in service sought by the Americans, was superseded by the original 1946 aviation treaty between the two nations and could be revised at will. **********In any event, he said, the French are willing to allow an increase in seats, but not as many as the Americans have sought. **********The Americans hope to sell 2.7 million tickets between the two countries for April through October flights, better than a 40 percent increase from the 1.9 million tickets sold in 1991. The French have insisted that the total come to no more than 2.2 million seats this summer. Many Different Air Fares **********Thousands of different air fares are in effect between various American and French airports, depending on when a flight is, how far in advance it is reserved, special promotions and other factors, but as one airline executive said, if the number of seats is cut back, the lowest fares will be the ones to go. **********The United States carriers flying to France are American, Continental, Delta Air Lines, Northwest, Tower Airlines, Trans World Airlines, United Airlines and USAir. None are heavily dependent on flights to France, but several are planning to add to their service between the two countries this month. **********For example, United Airlines will begin using a Boeing 747 instead of a smaller plane from Washington's Dulles International Airport on Saturday, and will inaugurate nonstop 767 service from San Francisco on Sunday. **********If France turns down increases in service, Washington can retaliate immediately by restricting Air France flights to the United States. **********The only reductions that the United States is willing to offer would be those proposed voluntarily by American airlines. During the negotiations, the airlines volunteered to cut between 100,000 and 150,000 seats, but the French rejected the offer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/19/business/economic-memo-administration-is-playing-blame-game-on-recession.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1992-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1448, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Memo; Administration Is Playing Blame Game on Recession", "print_headline": "Economic Memo; Administration Is Playing Blame Game on Recession", "body_text": " **********In unceremoniously announcing last week that it would dump its three top economic policy makers, the White House tried to lay the blame for the worst four years of growth since the Great Depression on the President's lieutenants. **********But economists, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, pin a large chunk of responsibility for the prolonged slump on President Bush and on another set of advisers, his political team, for ducking the tough, politically unpopular decisions that would help restore the economy's health. **********The three economic officials -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers -- have long insisted that the blame lies elsewhere. They point the finger at Congress, the Federal Reserve, the global slowdown, the debt-plagued consumer, banks refusing to lend and corporations laying off workers. **********Despite their protestations that they worked hard to create incentives for growth and to slash the budget deficit, growth has averaged an anemic seven-tenths of 1 percent over the last four years and the deficit soared to a record $320 billion in fiscal 1992. **********To be sure, there is no scientific way to assess who deserves how much of the blame for the economy's woes. Certainly there were external factors, like the worldwide slowdown, but, most economists agree, the President, his political team and his economic troika share in the blame. Dropped the Ball **********At many times and in many ways, it is generally agreed, the Bush Administration dropped the ball on the economy. While Secretary Brady, Mr. Darman and Mr. Boskin are awarded high marks in several areas, the Administration often receives low marks for not attacking the deficit as soon as Mr. Bush took office, for never getting an anti-recession plan enacted this year and for not developing and articulating an overall growth strategy until the re-election campaign. **********\"They could have protected themselves from some of the worst consequences of things happening in the economy, if they had a growth strategy of their own,\" William Niskanen, president of the conservative Cato Institute and a member of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, said. \"But they never put together an overall strategy until the President's speech last month in Detroit.\" **********In essence, Mr. Bush and his economic and political teams are proving victims of their own ideology -- they believe in a hands-off approach to economics. **********To all the pleas, advice and recommendations from voters and experts that the Administration needs to take a hands-on approach, Administration officials often respond, \"Just what are we supposed to do that won't make matters worse?\" **********Sometimes it seems Administration officials are so convinced that economic activism will have ill effects that their conviction paralyzes them. Early this year, for example, dozens of prominent economists called on President Bush to embrace a multibillion-dollar pump-priming plan to create jobs and speed growth. **********But Administration officials reflexively shudder at such a Keynesian notion, insisting that fiscal stimulus will aggravate the deficit, push up long-term interest rates and be squandered on pork-barrel projects. **********In January 1989, the month President Bush took office, he clearly made a big mistake by not attacking the budget deficit with gusto, most economists agree. If he had, they say, then the economy would not be in deep mud today. **********Administration officials say Mr. Darman, who was willing to swallow higher taxes, and Mr. Boskin, who backed a flexible freeze on spending, were eager to tackle the deficit early on. But the President, his former chief of staff, John Sununu, and his political advisers quashed the idea. 'Great Opportunity' **********\"When he came into office he was faced with a great opportunity,\" Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution and an official in the Carter Administration, said. \"He had a very strong economy, which is the right time to attack the budget deficit. I fundamentally hold Bush guilty for passing up that opportunity. The game was lost when he made his 'no new taxes' pledge.\" **********Tackling the deficit early on might have prevented the recession that began in the summer of 1990 and at worst would have cushioned it. And that would have enabled the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in 1989 rather than raising them out of fears of economic overheating. **********But Mr. Bush did not get serious about the deficit until the middle of 1990, when he was forced into it. But then, the 1990 budget agreement, which cut spending and increased taxes, helped pull down the economy when it was already sliding toward recession. **********Droll is the word some critics use when they hear Bush Administration officials say that if only they had not inherited a huge deficit from President Reagan, the economy would be in infinitely better shape today. Such an excuse seems to forget that Mr. Bush signed on to Reaganomics when he was Vice President and ran on a Reaganomics platform in 1988. \"He was Vice President back then, and he has to take some responsibility for the terrible mistakes made during the early 1980's,\" Isabel Sawhill, an economist with the Urban Institute, said. Democratic Flak **********Now, in the heat of the campaign, the Administration faces heavy Democratic flak for hardly lifting a finger to fight the recession, and even some conservatives agree. \"I think they deserve some blame for not taking more action to help the economy in 1992,\" Herbert Stein, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Nixon, said. **********Administration officials insist that they worked vigorously for a growth package, pointing to the plan the President trumpeted in January. That package included a cut in the capital gains tax, an investment tax credit and a tax credit for first-time home buyers. **********\"We have put forward a growth package that we think will stimulate savings and investment and help entrepreneurial capitalism and small business, but that plan has been stopped by Congress,\" one senior Treasury official said. **********Many critics of the Administration say that package foundered because of the Administration's fixation on a capital gains tax cut. Many Democrats embraced the proposed investment tax credit and home buyers' credit, but they enacted higher taxes on the wealthy to offset the gains a capital gains tax cut would mean for the well-off. The President vetoed the anti-recession package because of that tax increase. **********In effect, the Administration's insistence on capital gains tax cuts torpedoed the growth package. But Mr. Bush's political advisers warned him not to jettison the capital gains measure to rescue the package, saying hard-right conservatives, like Representative Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia and the minority whip, might mutiny. **********Still, Mr. Bush's allegiance to capital gains tax cuts was not enough to prevent many conservatives from castigating his economic policies. Conservative think tanks often said the President talked a good ball game about cutting spending, but acted like a Democrat in letting spending scamper upward. For this, they pin much of the blame on Mr. Darman. 'He Hired Them' **********\"The only individual more responsible for the economic mess than his three top economic officials was George Bush himself,\" Edward L. Hudgins, deputy director of economic policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization, said. \"He hired them in the first place, and he kept them on.\" **********Traditionally, the maestro of economic policy is the Treasury Secretary. As a result, many critics say Mr. Brady, more than other economic officials, deserves blame for sins of omission and commission. **********One big strike against Mr. Brady was that lacked the charisma of his predecessor, James A. Baker 3d, who became Secretary of State and is now the President's chief of staff. Still, Mr. Brady is widely praised for forging the legislative package to clean up the savings-and-loan mess and for helping bring the third world debt crisis under control. **********As for Mr. Boskin, he was the junior member of the policy-making trio. Many economists note that he never had the power of Mr. Sununu or Mr. Darman; Mr. Boskin threatened to resign last year when the President and his political advisers ignored his downbeat readings on the economy, worrying that the President's happy talk made him sound out of touch with Main Street. **********Yet however much economists criticize Mr. Brady, Mr. Darman and Mr. Boskin, they sympathize with them, too. \"The way these three economic leaders were tossed over the side of the ship was really shameful,\" Mr. Stein, the Nixon Administration official, said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/15/world/you-can-go-home-again-even-to-china.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1992-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 770, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "You Can Go Home Again, Even to China", "print_headline": "You Can Go Home Again, Even to China", "body_text": " **********\"My son, are you from this village?\" Liu Jiuyou asked Henry Doong as he walked toward the village's ancestral hall. \"Come.

And if they do not come back in person, they send money. **********In the village of Pan Shi, about an hour's car ride down the narrow bumpy roads from the nearest city, about three-quarters of the 440 residents have relatives overseas, and some of them seem more familiar with the streets of Queens than with those in Guangzhou. **********Jiang Xiaomei, a 58-year-old woman whose blue-black sweater, high heels and lipstick make her look like a movie star in a mock run-down rural set, says her daughter is studying in New York. Other relatives overseas sent money to help build her a two-story tiled-wall home, which she locks up every time she leaves, unlike most villagers. **********Many schools, factories, roads and homes here are built with money from overseas Chinese, and although Taishan people earn on average about $550 a year, officials say they spend more than that because of money sent from relatives. Overseas Chinese frequently return for vacations, and their sheer numbers fuel the local industries and drive up the prices of taxis and restaurant meals. **********To encourage these contacts, the local government has established a special office that helps make arrangements for visiting overseas Chinese. Government officials also offer advice to the local people on American immigration law and explain procedures for emigrating to North America. **********As a result, the outflow of Taishanese keeps growing as people here emigrate to join their parents, siblings or children in \"the beautiful country,\" as the United States is known. **********According to Chinese statistics, up to 6,000 of the more than 26,000 Chinese who immigrate to America each year come from Taishan. On top of that, a fair number of Taishanese living in other parts of China also obtain permission to emigrate. Luxuries at Age 100 **********Those who stay reap the benefits, though they may be decades in coming. For more than 60 years, Liang Jingzhen strapped her children to her back and headed to the fields alone to pluck rice from the paddies while her husband struggled to make a living abroad. Though he sent her money every once in a while, it is only now, at the age of 100, that Mrs. Liang can afford the luxuries of silk and a refrigerator and a color television, thanks to her 80-year-old daughter, now retired in Canada. **********The overseas connection has helped broaden the attitudes of peasants here, although not always for the right reasons. Boys are still favored, but girls are increasingly valuable -- in part because they can marry Taishanese men who live abroad but come back to get married. **********Mr. Doong, a retired engineer who lives in Washington,plans to spend next year teaching engineering at a nearby university here. **********\"I could have bought a home in Fort Myers and taken it easy for the rest of my life,\" he said. \"But I'm coming back here to teach for a year. Why would I want to do that? It's the attachment.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/13/world/chinese-bite-back-at-beijing-with-lawsuits.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1992-09-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 698, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chinese Bite Back at Beijing With Lawsuits", "print_headline": "Chinese Bite Back at Beijing With Lawsuits", "body_text": " **********Just days after 30,000 copies of the unorthodox political essays that he edited were packed on trucks and shipped all over China, Yuan Hongbing found out that the authorities had banned his book. **********Mr. Yuan, a 40-year-old law teacher at Beijing University, then did what more and more Chinese are doing when they feel unjustly harassed by the authorities: he sued. The Government, which is accustomed to using the law as a mechanism to send its critics to prison for long terms, is suddenly finding itself the target of lawsuits by dissidents and others all over China. **********To be sure, the Government controls the process well enough that it is unlikely to lose a politically sensitive lawsuit. But the suits sometimes attract publicity abroad, especially in Hong Kong, and news about them filters back into China to embolden others who in the past would have meekly accepted their lot and kept quiet. **********\"China has a long way to go before it has a decent legal system,\" said a Chinese university law lecturer in Beijing. \"But more and more ordinary people are coming to realize the importance of law and of a legal system. The leaders themselves may have no sense of legality, so they can't teach the people. Rather, the people will have to force it upon them.\" **********In one celebrated case, Wang Meng, a former Minister of Culture, sued a newspaper last fall, saying it had libeled him in a critique of one of his short stories. The courts never accepted his case, nor his appeal. **********This year Guo Luoji, a philosophy professor at Nanjing University, filed two suits (unsuccessfully) against the State Education Commission and university officials, accusing them of mistreating him. Professor Guo has not been allowed to teach or travel abroad because of his participation in the Tiananmen Square democracy movement in 1989. **********Wang Juntao, a dissident serving a 13-year sentence, is trying to sue the prison where he contracted hepatitis. He is also trying to sue the courts for confiscating some of his possessions. **********China is fundamentally ruled by individuals and their whims, rather than by law, and many Chinese do not trust the legal system because they see it simply as a means to enforce the leadership's dictums. **********But China has made considerable strides in the last decade in developing the system, and now enterprises and even foreign companies here are using the law to settle economic and civil disputes. At least 22 major new laws are being drafted, apparently with the aim of easing foreign investment and economic growth. **********The crackdown in the last few years against pro-democracy figures has not entirely followed the legal code, but in general the rule of law has survived better than most people expected when the tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square in 1989. **********\"The political atmosphere has not caused the law to crumble as other movements have,\" said Timothy A. Gelatt, a professor of law at New York University. \"It has had enough resilience because of the function that law has begun to play over the last 10 years.\" **********Mr. Yuan's suit is fairly typical of the new breed of politically sensitive cases that are coming before the courts. Mr. Yuan's book, \"The Trends of History,\" included essays by a number of prominent Chinese who have been in trouble since the 1989 crackdown, and its overall tone was strongly critical of the Communist hard-liners. The surprise was less that the book was banned than that it was published in the first place. **********Indeed, a confidential criticism of the book published for Communist Party officials in July suggested that Mr. Yuan should be imprisoned for his effrontery. This has not happened so far. **********After the books were seized, Mr. Yuan sued People's University Publishing House and the university's Communist Party Committee, which apparently issued the ban. The court rejected the case, and Mr. Yuan appealed in July. **********In any case, the suit embarrassed the Government, which prefers to ban books without anyone's noticing, and was the subject of delighted whispers among intellectuals in the capital."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/06/business/your-money-should-children-collect-insurance.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 868, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Your Money; Should Children Collect Insurance?", "print_headline": "Your Money; Should Children Collect Insurance?", "body_text": " **********MANY people who would not think of handing over hundreds of thousands of dollars, or a million or more, to their college-age children have inadvertently paved the way for doing just that. What's more, if it happens, they will not be in a position to correct it. **********The issue is life insurance. It is quite common for people who have life insurance to name their spouse as primary beneficiary and their children as contingent beneficiaries. Stuart Kessler, a partner in Goldstein, Golub, Kessler & Company and head of personal financial planning for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, said last week that that was the case with participants in seminars he has conducted for corporate and professional groups. **********That means that should the insured die, his or her spouse should get the proceeds of the policy. But if husband and wife were killed in the same car or plane crash, for example, the proceeds would go to the children as contingent beneficiaries. **********When people have wills written, care is taken not to give young children large amounts of money, Mr. Kessler said. \"No one gives substantial amounts to children outright at age 18. But here the children would receive the funds without guardians, trusts or attachments at age 18. This is not what they want.\" **********The simplest solution is to make one's estate the contingent beneficiary, he said, so that the executor can distribute the proceeds of insurance policies in accordance with the terms of the will, perhaps giving children half the assets at age 20 and half at age 30. **********There is a potential drawback: If the estate exceeds $600,000, the insurance would be subject to estate tax, which is as high as 55 percent. But Mr. Kessler said this could be avoided by putting the insurance into a trust. \"But if it is basically for a spouse, why have it encumbered?\" he asked. \"Why have a trustee doling it out to a widow?\" **********His recommendation for people whose estates will clearly be under $600,000 is to make the estate the contingent beneficiary. For those who have more -- or will be likely to after a few years' growth in assets -- more planning is needed. **********Part of the insurance coverage will probably be for the spouse, and in that case making the estate the contingent beneficiary is probably preferable to encumbering the policy for the spouse. And part will be for the children, and it could be put into a trust to escape estate taxes. **********Second-to-die insurance should always be in trust, Mr. Kessler said, because its purpose is to pay estate taxes when assets are not liquid, perhaps because they are in real estate or a family business. \"The trust indenture has to be drawn before the policy is taken out,\" he said.  June 15 Estimates **********Tax professionals are howling that Congress is demanding an impossible-to-achieve pinpoint accuracy with estimated tax payments due June 15. **********People whose income is not subject to withholding, or who would have too great a shortfall between withholding and taxes, must pay estimated taxes each quarter. In recent years, there have been two safe harbors for the estimates -- 90 percent of the current year's taxes or 100 percent of the previous year's, a readily available figure. **********But in November, to provide money for extended unemployment benefits, Congress decided to deny certain upper-income taxpayers the second test. Those whose adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000, and whose income exceeds the previous year's by $40,000 or more and who owed estimated payments in each of the last three years are denied what Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., calls \"the 100 percent escape hatch.\" **********If they fail to pay 90 percent of this year's liability, they will be subject to a penalty linked to the interest rate on Treasury bills, which will be about 7 percent for 1992. **********The problem, said Jack Porter, head of BDO Seidman's national tax office in Washington is that \"the tax computation can be more complicated than doing an actual return because you have to annualize.\" **********What's more, many small businesses and partnerships cannot do all their own calculations in time to make accurate estimates. If they underestimate their liability, they will have to pay the penalty. But if they overestimate, they are effectively extending to the Government an interest-free loan. **********\"It's outrageous,\" Mr. Porter said. But, since the penalty is often less than the accounting fees for calculating an accurate estimate, he advises making a best guess and paying the penalty if need be. \"I tell clients who are having a hard time that it's a bona fide borrowing,\" he said. **********Donald H. Skadden, vice president-taxation of the accountants' institute, said the institute had issued a 25-page practice guide to members and advised them to \"try to calculate as accurately as you can.\" **********The institute has asked Congress to create a second safe harbor, set at 115 percent of last year's liability. \"But sadly it is not available for this period,\" Mr. Skadden said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/12/business/kidder-is-settling-maxus-suit.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1992-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 950, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kidder Is Settling Maxus Suit", "print_headline": "Kidder Is Settling Maxus Suit", "body_text": " **********Closing another chapter from the Wall Street scandals of the 1980's, Kidder, Peabody & Company has agreed to pay $165 million to the Maxus Energy Corporation to settle a lawsuit in which the Texas oil company contended that it was damaged by the insider trading of a former Kidder executive. **********The civil settlement, announced Saturday night by Maxus, is the highest reached with a single company claiming to have been financially injured by illegal trading on Wall Street. It is more than six times the $25.3 million that Kidder agreed to pay the Government in 1987 to settle charges related to the insider trading of the former executive, Martin A. Siegel, once Kidder's top takeover star. **********With the Maxus settlement, Kidder tentatively has put all of the lawsuits stemming from its employment of Mr. Siegel behind it. Several months ago, the securities firm reached an agreement in principle to settle all claims against it in a consolidated class-action suit in Federal court. That settlement, which still must be approved by the court, would cost the firm a maximum of $5 million, a Kidder spokeswoman said. Other Defendants **********The resolution of the Maxus case, which has been slowly moving through the courts for some five years, came on the eve of the first day of jury selection, which is scheduled for today before Texas District Judge Adolph Canales in Dallas. The case against other defendants named by Maxus, including Mr. Siegel and Ivan F. Boesky, the former arbitrager who settled insider trading charges in 1986, is expected to proceed. **********Maxus Energy, a successor of the Diamond Shamrock Corporation and a former Kidder client, had sought $2.25 billion in damages. In its suit, Maxus contended that insider trading by Mr. Siegel and Mr. Boesky drove up the price of the stock of the Natomas Company, forcing Maxus to pay far too much in its 1983 acquisition of the San Francisco-based company. **********The basic argument of the case was that Diamond Shamrock trusted Mr. Siegel as an adviser based on Kidder's recommendation of him. As a result, the oil company provided Mr. Siegel with confidential information, which he then turned over to Mr. Boesky in exchange for a promise of cash. **********The huge claim had raised concern on Wall Street about Kidder and its parent, the General Electric Company, largely because of the reputation of Texas juries for awarding large damages in big business cases. Reserves in Place **********In a statement yesterday, Kidder said the settlement would have no impact on its business because reserves for the situation had already been put in place. The firm said the settlement did not change its expectation that it would have a record year in 1992. General Electric said in a statement yesterday that the settlement by its brokerage subsidiary would have no impact on overall earnings. **********But the settlement will have an enormous impact on Maxus, which has been struggling with financial difficulties. Since 1985, the Dallas-based company has posted losses in every year except one, and it is under enormous pressure from trying to pay down $796 million in debt as well as finance its aggressive oil and gas exploration in Latin America. **********\"This is a fair settlement for Maxus and its stockholders,\" Charles E. Blackburn, chairman and chief executive of Maxus, said in a statement. \"The new capital we get in this transaction will enhance our ability to fund aggressive oil and gas exploration and development programs.\" **********With the lawsuit out of the way, he added that Maxus would consider Kidder for future investment banking assignments. **********Under the terms of the deal, Maxus will receive $165 million in cash almost immediately. Kidder will pay $125 million to Maxus; Kidder's holding company -- the Kidder, Peabody Group -- will pay Maxus $40 million, in exchange for five year warrants to purchase eight million common shares of Maxus at $13 a share. **********Maxus closed Friday at $7 a share, down 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. With a cost for the warrant equivalent to about $5 a share, Kidder's holding company, which would own 6 percent of Maxus if it exercised its warrants, would be able to recoup its $40 million payment and realize the full value of its Maxus shares if the stock hit $18 a share. Effect on Stock's Price **********Such terms may actually restrain upward movement in Maxus shares in the future. With the market fully aware that one of the largest holders of the stock has a financial incentive to dump it at between $13 and $18, few investors would be enthusiastic about buying shares at that price if Kidder has exercised its warrants. **********In a statement, Kidder said it continued to believe it would have been vindicated in court, but chose to settle to avoid the uncertainties and potential cost of protracted litigation. **********\"Our motivation for settling was to close the books on a lawsuit that has existed for more than five years and to avoid the costs and distractions of protracted litigation,\" said Michael A. Carpenter, chairman and chief executive of Kidder. \"Resolving this case permits us to continue to focus our complete resources and attention on serving our clients and is in the best interest of Kidder, Peabody.\" **********The settlement of the case came after a week of pretrial hearings in which little was going Kidder's way. Judge Canales rejected Kidder's motion for summary judgment in its favor, and also said he would not tell the jury that Mr. Siegel's actions should be considered those of a \"renegade,\" saying instead that such a determination would rest with the jurors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/09/business/company-news-cooper-industries-is-looking-for-a-new-conquest.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1992-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1323, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cooper Industries Is Looking for a New Conquest", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Cooper Industries Is Looking for a New Conquest", "body_text": " **********Cooper Industries rose into America's manufacturing elite over the last 30 years by buying businesses like Champion Spark Plug, McGraw-Edison and Crouse-Hinds and sharpening their operations. **********The list includes more than 60 companies and product lines, which raised Cooper's revenues to $6.2 billion from $62 million. **********The Cooper pattern has been to squeeze costs, spend freely on more efficient production equipment, then wait patiently for growing market share and profits that help bankroll new conquests. Family-controlled companies with solid industrial brands but groggy leadership are the main quarry. Major Acquisition in the Offing **********Now, after two years of record earnings, pruning costs at Champion and at Cameron Iron Works since both companies were acquired in 1989 and huge savings from a reduced debt load, Cooper has the financial muscle for a bid approaching $1 billion, analysts say. Robert Cizik, Cooper's chief executive, says he hopes to sign a \"substantial\" deal by autumn. The only hint he has given is that his shopping list might include a hand tool maker or an auto parts manufacturer. **********A sudden sharp drop in Cooper's stock price at the end of April drained away some buying power, but Mr. Cizik is undaunted and remains in the hunt for another company. The decline, in which the stock fell nearly 20 percent in more than two weeks, came after Mr. Cizik forecast a drop in profits in its biggest business segement, petroleum products. **********Investors apparently concluded that the company's earnings growth -- 35 consecutive quarters of rising profits -- might end in the second quarter, a prospect Mr. Cisik concedes. **********With market leaders like Lufkin measuring tapes, Crescent wrenches and Wagner headlights under its tent, Cooper has managed to withstand the battering its energy products suffered during the 1980's thanks to its savvy acquisitions. **********Andrew Campbell, director of the Ashridge Strategic Management Center, a management research and education school in London, said Cooper deftly limited acquisitions to basic manufacturers with established products, distribution channels and plant operations similar to what Cooper already knows. **********A team of manufacturing experts that Mr. Cizik assembled nearly 20 years ago at Cooper combs through newly added companies for grist to combine operations with ones Cooper already has and close plants, trim labor costs and install modern equipment to improve productivity. **********The formula has rarely faltered, said Mr. Campbell, who has studied dozens of global corporations that stumbled when acquisitions took them into unfamiliar products and markets. The Cooper playbook also includes auctioning off laggards; Mr. Cizik has sold 40 companies and product lines. **********\"In the last 10 years, manufacturing know-how has changed very dramatically, led by the Japanese,\" Mr. Campbell said. \"A company that knows a lot about a certain manufacturing process has had an opportunity to buy those left behind and sort them out.\" **********Mr. Cizik, who sees a resurgence among basic manufacturers in America, has had a hand in every Cooper deal since joining the company in 1961. The Pennsylvania coal miner's son, who is 61 years old, ranked in the top 2 percent of his 1958 graduating class at Harvard Business School and was a takeover specialist of a relatively rare breed in the 1980's. He never filled a war chest for a surprise raid on another company. **********Cooper was either a friendly acquirer of companies under siege from hostile suitors or high bidder for companies on the auction block. In its biggest deal, Cooper bought McGraw-Edison Inc., a maker of electrical power distribution equipment, for $1.1 billion in 1985. **********Four years later it borrowed heavily and issued preferred stock to raise $1.5 billion to acquire Champion Spark Plug and Cameron Iron Works, a Houston-based rival in drilling equipment. Courting Owners of Prospects **********Paul Mecray, a partner at the Wellington Management Company, an investment concern in suburban Philadelphia, who has followed Cooper since the 1960's, said Cooper often courted aging family members who owned companies that were ripe for consolidation. **********\"They have a file thicker than you realize on prospective acquisitions,\" Mr. Mecray said. \"Cizik knows all these old families, and he's done his missionary work ahead of time.\" **********Some consultants and scholars consider Cooper a classic model of a diverse and capably managed American manufacturer that zealously improved productivity during the 1980's and has shaped up to compete for and win its share of global battles. **********From 1979 to 1990, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturers in the United States improved their output for every hour of labor by an average of 3.1 percent, compared with a sluggish 1.4 percent increase from 1973 to 1979 and 2.9 percent from 1948 to 1973. **********And the dollar value of manufacturing exports, which accounted for 4 percent of the nation's gross output last year, has increased by an average of 11 percent a year since 1988, a surge aided by a 1987 decline in the dollar's value that made American goods cheaper to buy in other countries. Cooper itself has had five years of rising foreign sales, which accounted for 34.9 percent of its total revenue last year. Seventy of its 180 plants are outside the United States. **********Through the 1950's the company, known then as the Cooper-Bessemer Corporation, was mainly a maker of compressors for moving natural gas through pipelines. Founded in 1833, it is still close to the oil patch. Petroleum-related products contributed 33 percent of sales and 35 percent of operating income last year as drilling accelerated abroad. Four Nonpetroleum Divisions **********It has four other industrial divisions, which Mr. Cizik wants to expand, turning out products like fuses, voltage regulators and spark plugs. The units are divided among suppliers of electrical products, electrical power equipment, hand tools and hardware, and automotive products. **********Although profits in petroleum markets are heading lower, they should rise in Cooper's four other segments and give the company another year of record earnings, Mr. Cizik said. Last year, when energy-related profits prospered, earnings in the nonpetroleum segments were down. **********It was a downturn in compressor orders in the late 1950's that persuaded Mr. Cizik's predecessor at Cooper, Gene Miller, to seek acquisitions. He wanted to buffer yearly earnings against the fluctuations of the petroleum markets while remaining in basic manufacturing businesses. **********Mr. Cizik has held the same view. Even before drilling activity plunged in 1982, and oil prices collapsed in 1986, he took Cooper into other fields to cushion the company's profits against an oil-patch downturn. **********He sees Cooper as similar to General Electric in the United States, and Germany's Siemens, Japan's Mitsubishi and Britain's Hanson Industries. Those companies have proved resilient to recession because of their financial strength, varied products and global operations, he said. They also have \"the resources to subsidize business during economic downturns so they can be thriving and healthy when the cycle turns up,\" he added. Increasing Capital Spending **********Cooper's first-quarter profits rose 10 percent, to $71 million, or 51 cents a share, from $64.7 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues were flat at $1.5 billion. **********Mr. Cizik said he increased capital spending to $300 million this year from $266 million a year ago, to further sharpen Cooper's productivity. He probably could extend the record of 35 quarters of rising profits by shaving millions from the capital budget this quarter, but he says that might hurt quality improvements now and profits in the future. **********\"If you nick away muscle for that reason, then you are nicking it for the wrong reason,\" he said. \"Where we fail in most cases to be successful at Cooper is where our quality isn't up to snuff in some cases.\" Last year, Mr. Cizik and his wife, Jane, shared equally with Cooper a $2.5 million gift to endow a professorship in manufacturing quality at Harvard."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/29/business/company-news-santa-fe-pacific-signs-new-union-contract.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SANTA FE PACIFIC SIGNS NEW UNION CONTRACT", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SANTA FE PACIFIC SIGNS NEW UNION CONTRACT", "body_text": " **********The Santa Fe Pacific Corporation's railway unit said yesterday that it had signed a new contract with the United Transportation Union to allow two-man crews to operate trains on the eastern half of the Santa Fe system.

An ethnic Hungarian, he is a favorite target of Romanian nationalist attacks, and these attacks often include the opposition as a whole. **********When Bishop Tokes (pronounced TOE-kesh) announced last week he would go on hunger strike, many religious and political leaders from Timisoara rallied around him, up to a point. **********They supported him in his protest that many people had gone unpunished for crimes committed during and after the violent and chaotic revolution that ousted Ceausescu. They also supported Bishop Tokes's criticism of President Iliescu's Government for failing to bring accused criminals of the revolution to court, and of complicity in attacks on ethnic Hungarians in Tirgu Mures in March 1990 and the brutal beating of opposition representatives by miners in Bucharest in June 1990. **********But opposition leaders also saw Bishop Tokes putting himself in the public eye at a sensitive moment in Romanian political life. They feared that his hunger strike could provoke a nationalist backlash and thereby damage the opposition's chances for victory in parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for Sept. 27. Many nationalists support President Iliescu. **********[ Bishop Tokes called off his hunger strike Friday after nine days without food, saying that he had achieved his aim of making public opinion aware of continuing injustices, and conceding that the continuation of his fast might benefit \"nationalist and Communist forces\" in the elections. ] **********Mr. Iliescu, himself a former Communist official who emerged during the 1989 revolution at the head of the National Salvation Front, was elected with a sweeping majority in the May 1990 elections. He has rejected the accusations of Bishop Tokes and others in the opposition, but he has acknowledged rehiring thousands of Mr. Ceausescu's former secret police, the dreaded Securitate. **********Romanians still debate just what role Mr. Iliescu played in the revolution that overthrew Ceausescu.

He was well enough to leave the hospital in mid-June. But Mr. Mwanda, who earned about $15 a month as a taxi driver, had no money, and hospital officials are holding him under armed guard until he pays his medical bills, which now total about $450 and are mounting daily. Behind the Desperation **********Since the hospital is not feeding Mr. Mwanda and he has no money to buy food, he depends on the charity of other patients. But that is not nearly enough, and now, suffering from severe malnutrition, he is too weak even to sit up. **********If Mr. Mwanda is a symbol of Zaire's desperation, Mr. Andrew is a symbol of its cause: the corruption and mismanagement of the Government. While its impressive natural resources sit largely undeveloped, this sprawling Central African country of nearly 40 million people is one of the world's poorest, and getting poorer at a rate that has been gathering ominous speed since September 1991, when a paroxysm of looting and arson wiped out much of its modern industry. **********\"The vast majority of Zaire is now back to subsistence levels,\" said Herman Cohen, the American Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, who came here early this month on a fact-finding mission. \"And for the first time we're seeing cases of malnutrition.\" **********\"It has always been serious,\" he added, \"but now it's getting dangerous.\" So Rich, and Yet So Poor **********Mbongo Nguodja Harouna, a human rights campaigner whose group, the Voice of the Voiceless, has been trying to win the release of Mr. Mwanda and others in his predicament, said: \"People have never suffered like this before.  A lot of them have simply given up hope.\" **********Called the Belgian Congo until independence in 1960, Zaire is as big as the United States east of the Mississippi. It is sub-Saharan Africa's second most populous nation, after Nigeria. It is one of the world's major producers of copper and cobalt. It has climatic and soil conditions suitable for growing a wide range of tropical crops, including cotton, rubber, coffee, palm oil and sugar. **********This potential has long been frittered away by corruption, brutality and random violence. But the notion persisted that if only the \"bad Zairians\" who surrounded and ill served Mr. Mobutu were reined, in the country would right itself. Few here dared openly blame the President himself. **********There was also a widespread belief among Zairians that the country was too valuable to the West for it to let the misery continue and that if only the Western powers would turn their attention to solving the crisis Zaire would become the great power it was destined to be. **********Those days are over. With the end of the cold war, many here have come to realize that the West, and especially the United States, has no intention of rescuing the Zairians from themselves. Repression Is His Weapon **********\"We've supported them, yes, and we supported Mobutu,\" said a Western diplomat with long experience in Africa. \"But those days are long over. It's a painful thing for many of them to realize, but Zaire is no longer of great strategic interest.\" **********Even without Western help, Mr. Mobutu hangs on despite a rising public clamor for his removal from the autocratic power he has exercised for 27 years. **********The President retains his grip through old-fashioned repression. Virtually every night, unmarked vehicles roar through Kinshasa's dusty streets, bearing grim-faced men in khaki uniforms without insignia. A recent report by the Zairian Human Rights League said these men -- known to Kinshasa residents as the \"owls\" -- were members of Mr. Mobutu's Special Presidential Guard, and had made numerous assaults against those perceived as political threats to the Government. **********\"So many people have been attacked and killed by the owls that we can no longer keep track of them,\" said Mr. Harouna of the Voice of the Voiceless. **********But Mr. Mobutu's power has been eroded. He spends most of his time aboard his yacht in the Congo River, and has entered Kinshasa, Zaire's capital, only twice this year, both times briefly and without advance notice, under the cover of night and with a squadron of heavily armed guards. People say that if he were to enter Kinshasa openly and move among this city's five million citizens it is doubtful that he would get out alive, given his tenuous control over the country's security forces. New Constitution Planned **********Bending to public outrage, Mr. Mobutu's representatives have been meeting with opposition leaders since July 1991 in a national political conference intended to draft a new constitution and set a schedule for multiparty elections. This month the delegates began drafting a new constitution enshrining a multiparty system and elected Etienne Tschisekedi, Mr. Mobutu's most prominent opponent, as Prime Minister of a transitional government. **********Mr. Mobutu has recognized these changes, but balked at the delegates' symbolic move to change the country's name back to the Congo, nullifying a name change made by Mr. Mobutu in 1971 as part of his policy of ridding the country of vestiges of its colonial legacy. Critics have seized on the name Zaire as a symbol of the President's autocratic rule. **********The political conference has deferred the name change. It also appears to have fallen short of the opposition's main objective, namely to force Mr. Mobutu from office, or at least strip him of most of his presidential powers. **********\"The one thing that everyone agrees on is that we're a long way from getting rid of Mobutu,\" an opposition leader said. \"He's incredibly tenacious, and appears determined to hold onto power at any cost.\" **********Buana Kabwe, chairman of the Zaire League of Human Rights, said: \"Everything else in the country may be falling apart, but nothing has changed for Mobutu. He still treats the treasury as if it's his private purse. And he couldn't care less about our suffering.\" Unpaid Soldiers Mutiny **********Mr. Mobutu's penchant for conspicuous consumption appears unabated. Among his overseas real-estate holdings, for example, are chateaus in Spain and Belgium, a town house in Paris, a villa near Monte Carlo, an estate in Switzerland, a horse ranch in Portugal and a villa in the Ivory Coast. **********Last September, Mr. Mobutu's rule seemed about to end. Mutinous soldiers, angered because they had not been paid, began a week of looting and violence. **********According to a report in July by Africa Watch, a New York-based human rights advocacy group, as the rioting spread throughout the country, it eliminated most of what remained of the modern productive sector, outside of mining. In the Kinshasa area alone, 90,000 jobs were lost, and in the course of the looting at least 240 people were killed. Today, whole sections of the country are under the control of local commanders who routinely ignore orders from Kinshasa. **********The rioting also led to the evacuation of virtually all expatriate workers -- about 20,000 people, mostly from France, Belgium and the United States. They included most of the country's university professors, teaching hospital staff members, and geologists in the mining industry, as well as a host of Belgian development assistance workers who provided a wide range of services to villages in the interior. Many Seek to Leave **********The economic collapse since the September riots has been staggering. The annual inflation rate is more than 5,000 percent, largely because the Government abandoned an economic recovery program devised by the International Monetary Fund in early 1990 and increased spending. In January 1990, the national currency traded at about 300 to the dollar; today the rate is about 650,000 to the dollar. **********The September rioting also prompted many Zairians to join the long lines for visas outside every Western embassy. They include many of this country's best-trained and best-educated citizens. **********Antoine Beltchira Kalubye, a neurosurgeon at the University of Kinshasa's teaching hospital here, said he knew of at least 100 physicians who had left the country in recent months, most for better paying jobs in South Africa. Senior physicians here make about $75 a month; in South Africa, they can earn about the same amount in a day. **********Consequently, the quality of medical services has declined, hardly reassuring patients who are already leery of the system after the wide publicity given to cases of patients held hostage for their medical bills. **********\"It has become very bizarre,\" Dr. Kalubye said. \"Nowadays the last place people want to come if they fall sick is the hospital.\" 'A Long Way to Go' **********George Nzongola, a Zairian and a professor of African studies at Howard University in Washington who recently returned here after living 18 years abroad, said conditions were worse now than they were before independence. **********\"Under colonialism, the decade of the 50's was a period of prosperity in the Belgian Congo,\" said Mr. Nzongola, who is a delegate at the national conference. \"The colonialists invested in economic and social services. So most people had access to very good schools and ate three meals a day.\" **********\"One person recently told me that we've gone backward 250 years,\" Mr. Nzongola added, \"I hope he's not right.\" **********Asked whether he expected conditions to change, even if Mr. Mobutu were suddenly to disappear from the political scene, Mr. Nzongola shrugged his shoulders. **********\"We've got a long way to go,\" he said, \"and I hope it's not too late.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/27/world/iraqi-kurds-report-capturing-big-base-of-turkish-kinsmen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 381, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iraqi Kurds Report Capturing Big Base Of Turkish Kinsmen", "print_headline": "Iraqi Kurds Report Capturing Big Base Of Turkish Kinsmen", "body_text": " **********A senior Kurdish official said today that Iraqi Kurds had captured the main base of Turkish Kurdish separatists in Iraq after fighting for three weeks to oust them from strongholds along Iraq's border with Turkey. **********\"We received a telegram this afternoon saying their resistance has collapsed in the Khwakurk valley,\" said Hoshyar Zebari, spokesman for one of the Kurds' two main parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party.

No. A working prototype has already been built and will be launched on a test flight some time in the next few months by the Air Force at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.  Platform for Telescopes **********If the monster balloon is successful, it could give scientists a valuable new approach for studying atmospheric trends like global warming, depletion of the ozone layer and the spread of pollutants that cause acid rain. In addition, because the balloon can climb above 99 percent of the earth's murky atmosphere, the inventors say it can serve as a platform for telescopes and provide a view of the stars that is almost as clear as one obtained by telescopes launched by rockets into orbit. **********The balloon was invented by researchers at Winzen International Inc. of San Antonio, a company that has been building and selling advanced balloons for scientific purposes since the 1940's. The invention was developed in part with financing from the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. **********High-altitude balloons are not in themselves new, said James L. Rand, president of Winzen and the lead inventor. The key breakthrough here, he said, was in developing a balloon that could be both big enough to carrylarge amounts of heavy equipment and could stay up for more than about five days at a time. **********The advantage of prolonged explorations, Mr. Rand said, is that they allow a balloon to track atmospheric currents around the globe and to watch for events that occur only at erratic and infrequent intervals, like solar flares. **********Most conventional balloons, he said, can fly for a limited duration because they must gradually vent their gas in response to daily temperature cycles of heating and cooling. The problem is that the gas inside the balloon expands during the heat of the day, and some must be released to keep the balloon from rupturing. For a few days, the balloon can maintain altitude by dropping ballast when it vents. But after a while, it runs out of gas, ballast, or both. **********Using double-layered polyester fabric, it has long been possible to build smaller balloons that can endure the expansions and contractions without needing to vent. But when the Government tried to scale up these balloons during the 1970's, they developed tears and ripped apart. **********The new balloon uses a form of nylon that stretches uniformly in all directions. Mr. Rand said most experts had considered nylon unworkable because extended stress caused it to \"creep,\" or lose shape over time. What the researchers at Winzen discovered, however, is that this is not a problem in cold air at high altitudes. **********Patent 5,104,059 was issued to Mr. Rand; Loren G.

The most recent commercials, which carry the theme \"Everybody loves a little squeeze,\" feature vignettes of playful children. **********Consumers may have winced during the 21 years that Mr. Whipple, a supermarket manager portrayed by the actor Dick Wilson, accosted unsuspecting shoppers who were fondling his favorite product and beseeched them: \"Please, don't squeeze the Charmin.\" But the mnemonic device helped created an identity for the brand as \"squeezably soft,\" an attribute highly prized in the intensely competitive battle for supremacy among bathroom-tissue makers. **********\"The quest of any client/agency partnership in selling a product is for a 'big idea,' \" said Barnet Silver, a senior vice president and associate creative director at D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, the longtime Charmin agency in New York. \"You have a big idea that lasts for a period of time, and when the consensus is that it's worn out, you search for another. **********\"Sometimes you're lucky, and you hit it, one, two,\" he added. \"Sometimes you have to flounder a little while.\" **********The new national Charmin campaign comes as the Procter & Gamble Company is struggling to overcome a slowdown in consumer spending for its pantry staples, like paper products, toothpastes, detergents and soaps, as shoppers defect to lower-priced brands. **********Charmin continues to outsell the brands of rivals like the Scott Paper Company, with its Scott brand, and the James River Corporation, with Northern. But data from Information Resources Inc. in Chicago, which tracks product sales in supermarkets, suggest that Charmin's lead in the estimated $3 billion bathroom tissue market is being fueled primarily by sharp cuts in prices. **********In the first quarter of this year, Information Resources reported, the number of rolls of Charmin sold climbed 30 percent, to 311 million, but revenues rose a much less robust 11.6 percent, to $76 million. So if the new ads find favor, they could help bolster Charmin's brand image, leading consumers to buy it at regular -- more profitable -- prices. **********The three commercials in the campaign, which carry the theme \"Charmin's so pleasable because it's so squeezable,\" are set in a factory that manufactures Charmin. The location is based on an actual plant in Mehoopany, Pa., near Scranton, which D.M.B.& B. executives visited. **********\"It was very motivating,\" said Eddie Binder, a vice president and management supervisor at the agency. \"We came back here and started to think, 'Maybe there's an idea there.' \" **********Of course, the spots present no grimy, untelegenic factory. They take place in \"Charmin Land,\" an impossibly enchanting place found only in ads, where an animated smokestack emits cute puffs of white, cloud-like smoke and the production line is run by babies who speak in squeaky voices.

Five bodyguards also died. **********The victim, Paolo Borsellino, 54 years old, the chief prosecutor in the Sicilian capital, had reportedly just left the car and was walking with his bodyguards to his mother's apartment house when the remote-controlled bomb exploded. One report said he was ringing his mother's doorbell at the moment of the explosion. **********Possibly more than the slaying on May 23 of Giovanni Falcone, who had been chosen to head a new police agency dedicated to fighting the Mafia, today's killing, foreshadowed by reports of a Mafia hit list, brought home the reality of the mob's disregard both for the authorities and for popular sentiment against the gangsters. Appearance of Omniscience **********\"These agonizing deaths fill us with pain but also with firmness,\" said Prime Minister Giuliani Amato, \"I am certain that the Government, Parliament and the judiciary will respond with the necessary unity of intention and strength.\" **********Like the Falcone killing, the bombing today raised anew the question of just how the Mafia knew of the movements of a closely guarded public prosecutor who had said, in one of his last interviews, that it was his \"moral duty\" to be in Sicily to fight the mob. **********The explosion blew Mr. Borsellino's right arm off and shattered windows five stories above the suburban street, scattering tangled wreckage and engulfing the street with flame and smoke, the police and witnesses said. **********\"There was a terrifying explosion which threw us to the ground,\" said Mauro Bartolotta, who had been in a nearby apartment when the bomb went off. \"It looked like a really strong earthquake. There was thick smoke, confusion, shouts, wounded and dead people.\" **********The dead included the woman and four men guarding Mr. Borsellino. A Grisly Message **********Staging the killing at the home of Mr. Borsellino's mother seemed intended to reinforce the message that the Mafia would resist any attempt to step up the campaign against it. **********\"If they have decided to kill somebody, nothing will stop them,\" said Giuseppe Ayala, a former judge who has an apartment near the house at Via d'Amelio 21 where the bomb exploded in a sub-compact Fiat 600. **********After the attack on Mr. Falcone, when a bomb hidden under a highway killed the him, his wife and three bodyguards, Mr. Borsellino had been been endorsed by Justice Minister Claudio Martelli to lead the new police agency. But, according to police officials, Mafia turncoats told the authorities that he was also next on a Mafia hit list. **********Mr. Borsellino worked with Mr. Falcone in anti-Mafia investigations in the 1980's that brought more than 300 mobsters to trial in 1987, and thus he had been marked for vengeance, he said in an interview in May. **********When he learned his name was on the hit list, he said in the interview, \"it did not inspire any particular emotion, as if they were talking about someone else.\" **********\"But my feelings were different,\" he said, \"fear and anguish, when I was told that they had decided to kill the first judge who presented them with any obstacles.\" Rebuilding Regime of Fear **********After the 1987 trial, Mr. Borsellino, who was born in Sicily, was posted away from the island in 1988 and returned only early this year. As head of the proposed agency, he would have led an elite force drawn from all of Italy's three competing police forces and committed solely to fighting the organized crime gangs of the Mafia and of its allies elsewhere in Italy. **********Italian experts on the Mafia said tonight that the mob seemed to be set on spreading so much fear that the agency would never come into being. **********After the Falcone killing, which also drew the F.B.I. into the investigation, Italian officials said they were probing whether links between the Mafia and Colombian cocaine traffickers had played a part in the assassination. **********Mr. Borsellino, who was married and had three children, was said to have an intimate, personal knowledge of the Mafia's doings and personalities, making him a prime target. **********\"What this assassination means is that the strategy of Cosa Nostra consists in killing those who understand Cosa Nostra,\" said Pino Arlacchi, a sociologist and author specializing in the Mafia. **********He said that two days ago, he had told Mr. Borsellino: \"Leave Palermo. It is untenable for those who fight the Mafia.\" Prime Minister Amato said Mr. Borsellino had told a friend two days ago: \"I am fighting against time.\" **********Mr. Borsellino's last investigation before his death involved the interrogation of a Mafia informer, but it was not clear if this was related to the killing. **********Last month, 40,000 Italians staged an unprecedented demonstration in central Palermo, reflecting the deep sense of revulsion and anger that has seized many Italians as they contemplate both the Mafia's power and the authorities' inability to curb it. **********\"We are at war,\" Mayor Aldo Rizzo of Palermo said. \"It's a war with no limits, and we must prepare ourselves to resist. We cannot dupe ourselves into believing this is the end.\" **********At the same time, the Government decreed new measures to give the police and magistrates broader powers to fight organized crime.

This has occurred especially when a Congressional committee has investigated possible wrongdoing on the part of an Administration. **********But such a rebuff would almost certainly lead the committee to request an independent counsel, formerly called a special prosecutor, something the Administration strongly opposes. The Administration contends that Democrats are exploiting the investigation for election-year purposes, but Democrats note that their investigation began more than two years ago and say it would have ended long ago had the Administration cooperated. **********In a letter to Mr. Bush today, the committee chairman, Representative Jack Brooks, a Texas Democrat, also asked for Administration documents \"that would be pertinent and useful to the lines of inquiry now under review by the committee.\" The areas of inquiry include allegations that the Administration delayed prosecution of officials of the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, which made illegal loans of $5 billion to Iraq.  Document Tampering Charged **********Another area of inquiry by an independent counsel would be allegations that the Commerce Department tampered with documents submitted to Congress. **********In addition, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee, has accused Administration officials of making false and misleading statements to Congress. He has also charged conflicts of interest, and failure to pursue diligently the circumstances of loan guarantees to Iraq by both the Export-Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corporation. **********Asked to comment on the letter to the President, Judy Smith, a White House spokeswoman, said today, \"We just received the request, and we are examining it.\" **********The letter from Mr. Brooks said, \"I am well aware that similar requests for documents involving the matter of U.S. assistance to the Government of Iraq by other Committees of Congress have run into serious difficulties resulting in protracted and often strained negotiations, if not outright refusals to comply.\" Inquiry Would Continue **********But he warned that if the documents were not produced, the committee would continue its inquiry. \"Should noncompliance result, then it may well be the case for an independent counsel -- with full subpoena and prosecutorial powers -- would be bolstered for that reason alone,\" Mr. Brooks wrote. **********The committee would not reveal exactly what documents it had requested, but the request is believed to relate to altered documents that the Commerce Department gave to a subcommittee of the Government Operations Committee. Mr. Brooks requested that the documents be produced by June 18, five days before the committee is scheduled to hear the Administration witnesses. **********Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, the chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice, said, \"The documents that are requested, if produced, will really point in the direction of whether there was a cover-up in the Commerce Department.\" **********The committee seeks testimony from Robert A. Mosbacher, the Secretary of Commerce; C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the President; Nicholas Rostow, Special Assistant to the President and director of legal affairs of the National Security Council; Frank Lemay, the State Department's legislative management officer, and Frank DeGeorge, the Commerce Department's Inspector General. Mr. Brooks also invited the President to send any other Administration officials he might deem appropriate to testify before the committee. **********Under the Ethics in Government Act, if a majority of the Judiciary Committee's 21 Democrats requests the appointment of an independent counsel, the Attorney General is required to conduct a \"threshold inquiry\" and report back to Congress in 30 days. If the Attorney General finds reasonable grounds for further investigation, then he must apply to a special three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for appointment of an independent counsel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/06/world/okata-journal-a-whale-food-for-deep-thought-or-just-food.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1992-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 914, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Okata Journal; A Whale: Food for Deep Thought, or Just Food?", "print_headline": "Okata Journal; A Whale: Food for Deep Thought, or Just Food?", "body_text": " **********Weather permitting, fishing boats cast off from the tiny harbors here with tourists to see herds of humpback whales surge majestically through the choppy waters of the Pacific Ocean. Some people rhapsodize that sighting a whale can be a quasi-religious experience. **********\"I was so moved by it,\" said Tomoe Miyazaki, a 22-year-old agriculture student from Tokyo, describing a recent expedition with a colleague. \"My friend couldn't speak. She just kept saying: 'Fantastic! Fantastic!' The experience completely transformed my sense of values.\" **********Maybe so. But as Miss Miyazaki hastened to add, she had no quarrel in principle with fellow Japanese who favor the hunting of these magnificent creatures for food. \"I doubt if we should just let the culture of eating whale meat disappear,\" she said. **********Can the Japanese learn to love whales enough not to kill them?  The Hunters Are Restless **********The creatures killed by Japanese are minke whales in Antarctica, where fishermen face the harassment of the environmental group Greenpeace and criticism from around the world. The whales around here are humpbacks and not prized by hunters as the minke whales are, but advocacy groups hope that Japanese will come to see that all whales should be protected. **********The issue is heating up once again, and may come to a boil in the next couple of years because Japan has been gearing up once more to repeal the almost total ban on the hunting of minke whales imposed in 1985. **********Since it was imposed, Japanese fishermen have been allowed to kill up to 330 minke whales a year, justified as necessary for scientific research. Somehow, the whale meat continues to turn up mysteriously in a handful of restaurants in western Japan and Tokyo, where it is prized as a delicacy. **********Now Japanese officials say that even if minke whales were once endangered, they are no longer. The International Whaling Commission estimates that their population has grown to 760,000 in the Antarctic, more than enough to sustain the species. **********\"The stocks are recovering,\" acknowledged Michael Sutton, a senior program officer at the World Wildlife Fund and an American delegate to the International Whale Commission. \"Now that the numbers are relatively healthy, the Japanese are quietly building their case to go after those whales.\" **********With thousands of Japanese now lining up to go whale watching here in Shikoku, a southern island, and other remote parts of Japan like the Bonin Islands, whale watching has thus become a weapon in the battle to save the whales. **********Some polls show that sympathy for whales is increasing and that most Japanese now oppose commercial whaling. In the surge of press coverage on endangered species, whales are often singled out. Even big companies use cute little whales to advertise or promote their products. **********\"People are beginning to realize that whales don't belong to any one nation, they belong to everyone,\" said Shigeki Komori, director of whale surveys at the Japan World Wildlife Fund. **********Government officials say they too recognize that the habit of eating whale meat is dying out in Japan and that sympathy for whales is on the rise. But to these specialists, that is no reason to prevent a few hundred remaining whalers from earning a living or to prevent Japanese from eating whale meat. **********\"There is no scientific argument against eating whale meat, only a matter of culture and customs,\" said Kazuo Shima, deputy director general of the Japanese Fisheries Agency and Japan's delegate to the Whaling Commission. **********\"I understand the pattern,\" he added. \"Western standards dominate in the world. But Western countries kill baby sheep, baby cows, baby oxen.\"  Saying No to Protection **********Mindful of the latest global environmental concerns, Mr. Shima and other Japanese officials and scientists make their own scientific arguments as well. Eating whale meat, they say, may mean eating that much less beef -- thereby saving tropical rain forests being cleared for cattle grazing. **********There is plenty of other evidence that Japanese have an ambivalent attitude toward endangered species generally. Tokyo has been slow to respond to global calls for protection of elephants and hawksbill turtles because of its many craftsmen who depend on ivory from Africa and tortoise shells from tropical regions. **********A few weeks ago, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species met in Kyoto. Japanese officials boasted that playing host to such a meeting was a signal of its environmental concerns. But when it came to certain species, Japan opposed stronger protections. Are Whales Almost Sacred? **********Here on Shikoku, the issue is less passionate, but it is debated among people involved in what has become the town's No. 1 tourist draw. Okata, for instance, earns thousands from the whale watchers who visit the area and frequent local restaurants and hotels. **********Whales have always been regarded as a kind of divine omen in this area, said Tsuneka Matsuda, a 58-year-old fishermen who takes people out for whale watching when he is not catching bonito or baby sardines. **********In times past, he said, fishermen would get excited at seeing whales because they would often be surrounded by schools of fish. The fishermen even offered rice wine to the water whenever a whale was seen. **********\"I myself feel it is an atrocious thing to kill whales,\" said Mr. Matsuda. \"We Japanese do not have to eat whales anymore.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/14/world/as-fighting-widens-un-orders-buildup-of-troops-in-bosnia.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Faison", "pub_date": "1992-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 252, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "As Fighting Widens, U.N.

At first, the joint shareholder meeting that Fidelity Investments held on Wednesday for nine of its international mutual funds seemed to fit that mold. Then the fireworks started. **********Only about a dozen investors gathered in the long beige conference room on the fifth floor of Fidelity's headquarters here. The meeting opened smoothly under the direction of J. Gary Burkhead, the company's president, as a bevy of staffers looked on. **********For all the initial serenity, however, there was important business at hand, evidenced by the unusual length of the proxy statement. It sought removal from the funds' bylaws of a host of longstanding restrictions on fund managers -- prohibitions against speculative activities like short-selling, buying stocks on margin, investing in unseasoned companies, buying securities not registered for public resale and investing in other mutual funds. Similar revisions have been made at other Fidelity funds over the last two years, with barely a murmur from investors. **********This time was different. Several testy shareholders protested the sweeping revisions, which nevertheless passed on the basis of votes cast earlier by mail. But the shareholders did raise some important issues of fund governance that the proxy statement, for all its length, had not explored. **********Targeted for the changes were the Overseas Fund, the Europe Fund, the Pacific Basin Fund, the Global Bond Fund, the International Growth and Income Fund, the Canada Fund, the Worldwide Fund, the International Opportunities Fund and the Short-Term World Income Fund. The Pacific Basin Fund lacked a quorum, however, because too few shareholders had returned their proxies. Its meeting was adjourned until Tuesday.  The funds share a common board of trustees, an 11-member panel headed by Edward C. Johnson 3d, the chairman of Fidelity Investments and the chief executive of its parent, the FMR Corporation. **********In the past, rules on investment practices were part of the funds' bylaws, which could be changed only by shareholder vote. The proposals considered last week removed these so-called \"fundamental limitations\" and gave trustees the power to approve rule changes without shareholder approval. **********Shifting decision-making power to the trustees would enable the funds to adapt more quickly to changes in securities laws and regulations and to developments in the markets, the fund officials explained. It would also aid Fidelity's effort to standardize the rules governing its funds, a move it says will reduce its administrative burdens. **********\"But all of these limitations have historical reasons for being here,\" said one investor, Joe Bredwell. \"They were set up to try to limit the opportunity for the abuses that occurred in the 1920's.\" He noted that many of the practices covered in the bylaw changes are illegal and could not be employed unless securities laws were changed. \"So why do you need this freedom?\" he asked. **********Lawrence G. Franko, a finance professor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, also opposed the changes. \"These proposals seem a further sign of the diffusion of mission of the funds,\" he said. **********Mr. Burkhead explained that the regulatory structures that govern the mutual fund industry are changing at the state and Federal level. \"We are trying to catch up with those regulatory changes, and anticipate future changes where we can,\" he said. **********These changes include the growing market for \"Rule 144a\" shares, foreign equities that are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission but that may be sold privately among institutional investors. In addition, some bankrupt corporations are giving restricted shares to former creditors as part of their reorganization plans; these shares may be traded privately but may not be sold in the public market. And the S.E.C. is considering changing its rules to allow funds to invest in other mutual funds, under certain conditions, explained Arthur S. Loring, a Fidelity lawyer. If regulators approve the changes, he added, \"we would need this authority to do that.\" **********But in no case would any of these steps be taken without the approval of the trustees, Mr. Burkhead said. \"There is a reliance on the board of trustees to look after the interests of the shareholders,\" he said. \"That is their solemn responsibility.\" **********But giving the trustees that much power over what the fund managers can and cannot do with shareholder assets puts a spotlight on the trustees' independence, said another investor, David Chase of Chelsea, Mass. Three of the 11 trustees -- Mr. Johnson, Mr. Burkhead, and Peter S. Lynch, the retired manager of the giant Magellan Fund and still an executive with a Fidelity subsidiary -- are affiliated with Fidelity. While the board has its own legal counsel, all of its administrative work is handled by Fidelity. Moreover, the eight non-affiliated trustees were paid nearly $1.2 million in fees and expenses last year, or about $150,000 each, Mr. Chase noted. And they are also entitled to a pension. **********\"With this much salary, and a pension plan, I have to ask whether they are really disinterested, or whether they are beholden to the people who pay them -- namely, you,\" he said to Mr. Burkhead. **********Mr. Burkhead defended the salary levels as essential for getting the most qualified people. \"There is a level of compensation they expect,\" he said. For that level of compensation, trustees meet about 10 times a year. **********A few months ago, Fidelity stopped requiring fund trustees to also show up at the shareholder gatherings, which are held on an irregular basis every few years. As a result, Mr. Burkhead was the only trustee at Wednesday's meeting and the only one who heard the arguments raised by shareholders. \"But their comments will be passed on,\" Mr. Loring explained on Friday. \"Not in specifics, perhaps, but in the general sense, that shareholders expressed concern.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/10/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-mcelligott-departees-taking-big-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 187, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "McElligott Departees Taking Big Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; McElligott Departees Taking Big Accounts", "body_text": " **********Two partners at McElligott Wright Morrison White, the Minneapolis agency splitting up over intense squabbling among its top executives, will, as was anticipated, leave to join DDB Needham New York.

In Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, writers forsook their garrets to become heads of state. **********For Arpad Goncz, the writer-turned-President of Hungary, the change makes sense. **********\"If you take a good look at Eastern Europe, you'll see that the presidents are compelled to shout across the gap between politics and society in a language that society speaks, not in legal or economic language, but in plain Hungarian or German or whatever,\" he said in a conversation in his office. **********In Hungary, the President's role is secondary to the Prime Minister's. But Mr. Goncz's job, which could be merely ornamental in a more established democracy, has turned into a tough balancing act as public life is rent by feuding among politicians and their followers. **********\"If I have a single aim, it is to encourage a readiness to find consensus,\" he said. **********Mr. Goncz won a seat in Parliament in March 1990 in the country's first post-Communist elections. As the victorious, center-right Hungarian Democratic Forum negotiated the functioning of the new government with the largest opposition party, the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, Prime Minister Jozsef Antall nominated the little-known Mr. Goncz, an Alliance member, to be President. **********Popular among the opposition and the press, and scoring far higher in public opinion polls than Mr. Antall, Mr. Goncz has become a constant irritant to the Government. His detractors have accused him of blocking Government initiatives under the mask of forcing a rapprochement between the governing coalition and the opposition parties. **********The President has repeatedly refused to sign Mr. Antall's dismissal orders for the heads of state-financed radio and television. He insists, along with the opposition, that Parliament first should pass a law on the press that it has been debating for two years. **********Mr. Goncz has also become a target of the right. Istvan Csurka, until recently a vice president of Mr. Antall's Hungarian Democratic Forum and the spearhead of the party's truculent right wing, has accused the President of answering to \"Communist, reformed Communist and liberal nomenklaturists, Paris, New York and Tel Aviv.\" **********Others have echoed Mr. Csurka. On Oct. 23, at a ceremony commemorating Hungary's anti-Soviet uprising of 1956, a crowd including hundreds of skinheads booed Mr. Goncz, calling him a traitor, and prevented him from delivering his speech. **********\"I was angry,\" he said, recalling the long minute he stood on the platform, squinting through the drizzle and the spotlights' glare. \"I could not see anything, just dark heads. I just heard one massive shout. Let me just say that I don't consider myself a traitor.\" **********It was not the first time that this accusation had been made against him.  Yet Mr. Goncz's life has epitomized the Hungarian loyal to God and nation that the current Government idealizes. **********A Catholic, he was born in Budapest in 1922. He escaped from the Hungarian Army in World War II, fought in the resistance against Hitler, and was wounded.

But the Intel Corporation, the dominant producer of microprocessors for desktop computers, said yesterday that its next generation of chips would be designed to let computers snooze when no one was watching. **********Joining Intel in the announcement was the Environmental Protection Agency, which has negotiated agreements with leading manufacturers of disk drives, monitors and other computer components to make those parts accept \"sleep mode\" commands from the microprocessor. The machines would be in a standby state, drawing a much lower level of power. Some components would go into this resting mode after 10 minutes. But others, nodding off even faster than Dagwood Bumstead, could \"sleep\" in the time between keystrokes. **********According to Cathy Zoi, chief of energy productivity and pollution prevention at the E.P.A., the goal is to halve the energy consumption of personal computers, which already account for 5 percent of commercial energy use. The resultant savings, she said, would be $1 billion a year in electricity by the end of the decade. **********Once they're switched on, desktop computers typically draw 150 to 200 watts of power whether they are in use or not, she said, and 30 to 40 percent of the machines are left running overnight and on weekends. This means power plants burn more fuel than they have to, increasing air pollution. **********Changing the user's behavior might seem simpler than reconfiguring the machine. But computers do not simply turn on like light bulbs. Switching on the power causes wear and tear on some components -- a reason to leave the machines running. Moreover, each time a computer is switched on, a user might wait several finger-drumming minutes for the machine to reload its software and connect to a network. **********Intel says that the sleep circuitry will come first on the P5 chip, which is due early next year, and will then be added to new versions of the current generation of chips, the 80486 processors.

The change in tax rules, which is expected to raise corporate taxes by about 2 percent, would apply to companies that pay individual executives more than $1 million in any one year. **********Though it would not prohibit companies from paying whatever they felt appropriate, it would limit the amount they could deduct from their corporate taxes to $1 million an executive. **********Until Tuesday, when the House passed the bill by a strong margin, many people involved in the executive-pay debate, from academicians to compensation consultants, were quick to scoff at any attempt to dictate an arbitrary limit on what companies should pay top executives, and to use the tax code to back it up. **********And they were confident of their ability to convince Washington that such a proposal would be completely ineffective in curbing high pay, since companies would either find ways around the legislation or simply expect shareholders to shoulder the added cost. **********\"Will it make any difference?\" asked Michael H. Walsh, chief executive of Tenneco Inc., of the House initiative. \"No. Companies will still have to pay what the market requires.\" **********He, for one, said it would simply promote a \"new craft of consultants who can figure out compensation that's legal but not included\" for purposes of the bill. **********Even one of the more prominent critics of executive pay, Graef Crystal, predicts that the bill will be a \"dismal failure\" as an incentive for companies to curb high pay. He noted how little the Government's recent efforts to disallow lucrative severance agreements affected behavior: companies absorbed the costs on their own tax returns and even paid executives more to compensate for the extra taxes they would owe personally. **********Still the bill's defenders say the proposed changes would be far more fair than the system now in place, because, they say, it would shift the burden of those high salaries to the shareholders who employ those executives and away from taxpayers at large. **********Shareholders, who until now may have been complacent about policing those salaries, would suddenly have an incentive to pay more attention to the bottom line and complain when compensation deviates from performance. And if they still felt that this or that executive was worth millions, their companies would be free under the law to pay it. **********\"Shareholders are going to hold the company more accountable than the taxpayers are,\" said Isaac Shapiro, a senior research analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research center that supports the provision. \"In terms of general tax fairness, and who is bearing the brunt of the costs and who is receiving the benefits, it seems appropriate.\" **********The proposal is also often attacked as being inferior to several others making their way around Washington and corporate board rooms. They include improving the information that companies routinely disclose to their shareholders and to regulators in Washington and beefing up the powers of the Internal Revenue Service to more closely scrutinize executive compensation at specific companies. **********That said, there is nothing stopping lawmakers or Corporate America from adopting any other measures they think helpful, in addition to the one in the job bill.  Symbolism Called Valuable **********\"I tend to think the types of actions that others might characterize as purely symbolic, that they in fact do send important messages and do rein folks in over time,\" Mr. Shapiro said. And he added about the House measure, \"It doesn't mandate anything but suggests that the Government thinks this is a problem and does directly decrease the incentive for a company to pay that much.\" **********Whether the Senate agrees with that logic will become clear today, when the Senate Finance Committee considers its own unemployment bill. Because the latest version of that bill would provide $400 million less in unemployment benefits than the House bill, the Senate could decide to leave executive pay alone, though House aides say that asking the employers of some of the country's wealthiest citizens to help bear the cost of the jobless benefits is only fair."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/18/business/ford-and-chrysler-outpace-japanese-in-reducing-costs.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1992-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 865, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford and Chrysler Outpace Japanese in Reducing Costs", "print_headline": "Ford and Chrysler Outpace Japanese in Reducing Costs", "body_text": " **********Ford and Chrysler have increased the efficiency of their factories and workers so much in recent years that their basic cost of producing a car is now less than that of their Japanese rivals, according to a study published today. **********Auto analysts have long recognized the productivity improvements at the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation. But the assumption within the industry has been that a production-cost gap remains between Detroit's second- and third-largest auto makers and the Japanese car companies, especially the Toyota Motor Corporation, generally regarded as the low-cost producer worldwide. **********But that assumption is no longer true, according to the report by the Economic Strategy Institute, a research organization in Washington. Based on a yearlong study, conducted with the help of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transport, the private research group estimates that the direct cost of producing a small car at Ford is $5,415, Chrysler's cost is $5,841 and Toyota's $6,216. **********The comparable cost for the other three leading Japanese companies -- Nissan, Honda and Mazda -- are somewhat higher than Toyota, while General Motors is the high-cost producer, at $7,205 a car. **********\"The good performance of Ford and Chrysler is surprising,\" said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute. \"And the figures show that Ford and Chrysler really have become competitive with the Japanese.\" **********The glaring exception in the report's picture of the American industry as an efficient producer is the General Motors Corporation, the nation's largest auto maker. And its laggard position in terms of cost of production helps explain the urgency of its recent management changes, payroll cutbacks and plant closings. **********Other analysts agreed that Ford and possibly Chrysler were now quite competitive with the Japanese companies, but said that the Economic Strategy Institute report may have overstated the case. By stating the results in terms of United States dollars, they noted, the biggest single reason for the new-found cost advantage for Ford and Chrysler was the 85 percent decline in the value of the dollar against the yen since 1985. **********But more recent studies have tended to focus on the number of worker-hours, rather than dollars, required to make a car. **********\"Ford has done a terrific job and, in the past few years, Chrylser has made huge gains in its productivity,\" said James Harbour of Harbour & Associates in Troy, Mich. \"But I'd still rank Toyota No. 1 with Ford close behind.\" U.S. Lagged 10 Years Ago **********In 1981, Harbour & Associates published a landmark study that concluded that the Japanese industry could produce a small car for $1,500 less than Detroit. Some later studies were even more pessimistic about how far the American industry lagged, estimating that Japanese costs were $2,500 or more below Detroit's. **********Today, the Economic Strategy Institute report found that in terms of man-hours and total labor costs in each produced the Japanese still have an edge over all the Detroit companies. But the research group calculated that Ford and Chrysler more than made up that deficit by the lower prices in America for other costs like purchasing glass, rubber and industrial fuel. **********The report, \"The Future of the Auto Industry: It Can Compete, Can It Survive?,\" written by Mr. Prestowitz, Paul S. Willen and Larry Chimerine, separately figured the costs that are often beyond the direct control of managers and workers.  For example, they estimated that higher health care and pension expenses -- nearly half of which go to retirees and laid off workers -- meant an additional cost of $600 on each car Detroit makes, compared with the Japanese. Social Costs Added In **********And the fact that the American industry ran its plants at only 62 percent of capacity in 1991 versus 95 percent for the Japanese resulted in a cost penalty of $800 to $1,500 a car for the Detroit producers. When what the report calls these social costs, including a slightly higher cost of capital for investment in the United States, are added in, Toyota becomes the low-cost producer and Ford slips to No. 2. **********\"The U.S. industry does carry all these burdens compared with Japan, but they are part of the competitive environment,\" said Maryann Keller, an auto analyst at Furman Selz Inc. **********The Economic Strategy Institute's discussion of the social costs borne by the industry and its policy recommendations for reviving the auto industry will likely be the more controversial part of the report. Its recommendations include drafting an industrial policy for the American industry, putting more pressure on Japanese transplant factories in the United States to buy low-cost American parts, and attaching a \"North American content\" sticker on all cars sold in the United States. **********Mr. Prestowitz, a former Japan expert in the Commerce Department, is an advocate of an industrial policy for leading American industries and he has often been critical of Japan's trading practices. The Economic Strategy Institute is supported by some 200 donors including corporations, foundations, unions and individuals, with auto companies and suppliers accounting for roughly 15 percent of its financing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/03/business/credit-markets-prices-little-changed-in-slow-day.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1992-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 978, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prices Little Changed in Slow Day", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Prices Little Changed in Slow Day", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in slow trading yesterday, as market participants prepared for the release today of March employment data. **********\"We saw very good buying on Wednesday, and now the market is just evening out going into the numbers,\" one government securities trader said. **********Most economists expect the employment data to show that non-farm payroll employment rose by a modest 25,000 to 50,000 last month, and that the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 7.3 percent.

Smale, the 64-year-old former chairman of the Procter & Gamble Company and a marketing man who flattened that company's bureaucracy, led the drive by G.M.'s outside directors to pursue, as the board said, \"more aggressive management\" in trimming costs, winnowing bureaucracy and possibly closing more plants. **********G.M.'s board, long a docile rubber stamp for management, had not exercised its powers so forcefully over management since the early days of the auto industry when General Motors was in financial trouble. **********In taking control of the executive committee of the board of the No. 1 auto maker, Mr. Smale (rhymes with mail) replaces Robert C. Stempel, who remains chairman and chief executive.  In the shake-up, Mr. Stempel also lost his president and his chief financial officer; both men were demoted. **********The three outside directors who pushed hardest for the change were, according to a person familiar with the board's deliberations in Dallas, Mr. Smale; Dennis Weatherstone, 61, the soft-spoken chairman of the highly profitable J. P. Morgan & Company, one of the nation's premier banking companies, and Thomas H. Wyman, 62, the former chairman of CBS Inc., himself a veteran of board room intrigue. **********The G.M. move is but the most striking example of the growing role that outside directors, under pressure from important investors, are taking in deciding everything from how much executives are paid to the strategic direction of a company. **********\"General Motors is such a symbol because of its size and because it seemed as tough a place to change as you could find in corporate America,\" said Robert A. G. Monks, an adviser to large institutional shareholders. \"The board really exercised dominion over the company. G.M. will not be the same again.\" **********Other major companies, including I.B.M.; Citicorp; Sears, Roebuck & Company; American Express, and Eastman Kodak, have also been pressed by big investors to make more modest changes, typically trimming bureaucracy, naming more independent directors or closely linking executive pay to corporate performance. Frequently, the outside directors have listened to shareholders' complaints and made changes. **********The outside directors, who are 11 of the G.M. board's 15 members, also tightened their grasp on G.M.'s board by removing as directors Lloyd E. Reuss, the demoted president who became an executive vice president, and F. Alan Smith, an executive vice president. By reducing the board from 17 members, the 11 outside directors loom even larger. **********Pressure to address G.M.'s problems with a greater sense of urgency had been building for months. But the mounting losses, which reached a record $4.45 billion last year, including a stunning $7 billion loss in North America, forced the board to act as G.M.'s big institutional shareholders became increasingly dissatisfied and vocal. Representatives of big investment funds like the California Public Employees Retirement System, or Calpers, the nation's largest public pension fund, had met periodically with G.M. board members and management over the last two years. **********At first, G.M. did not respond, but gradually it cooperated. Still, \"we thought that things were going too slowly,\" said DeWitt Bowman, chief investment officer of Calpers, which holds more than 4.3 million G.M. shares. \"Stempel made a good-faith effort, but as a lifelong insider it was more difficult for him to do some things as quickly as the board felt necessary.\" **********Some experts say that management changes like the one at G.M., brought by a board's taking matters into its own hands, represent a healthy trend in the way companies are governed -- in contrast to the 1980's, when corporate raiders operated as the policemen of capitalism. **********\"The threat of being taken over was an extremely wasteful means of effecting change in corporations,\" said Robert Glauber, a fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. \"It resulted in resources being dissipated in the wrong ways, in companies being loaded with debt and going bankrupt instead of investing in their future.\" **********\"This is a very healthy sign,\" added Mr. Glauber, former Under Secretary of the Treasury for Finance. \"It shows the process of corporate governance working on its own, as it was meant to.\" **********Mr. Smale is no stranger to trying to make a big, stodgy company more nimble. During his tenure as chief executive of Procter & Gamble, from 1981 to 1990, Mr. Smale was known for replacing a pyramid-style management with business teams, including production-line workers as well as executives, for handling tasks like getting new detergents onto supermarket shelves more quickly and cutting costs. **********\"Smale really shook up P.&G.,\" said Andrew Shore, an analyst for Prudential Securities Research in New York. **********At Procter, Mr. Smale shifted the corporate emphasis from sales to profitability on the consumer product giant's many brands, and he assigned brand managers more responsibility for generating profits. \"Discipline is the cornerstone of the culture at Procter,\" said James J. Jordan, chairman of Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor, a New York advertising agency that handles many P.&G. brands. \"John Smale brought it back into focus, sharpened it and honed it.\" Lessons From Procter **********One of Mr. Smale's marketing strategies was to emphasize the differences between Proctor's brands and those of its rivals. G.M.'s car lines have been criticized for years as being too similar to each other and often undistinguished from some models offered by the Ford Motor Company or the Chrysler Corporation. To prop up car sales, G.M. has relied heavily on rebates. **********A G.M. marketing executive, who would speak only on condition that he not be identified, said that he expected Mr. Smale's appointment as head of G.M.'s management oversight committee might well mean a greater emphasis on marketing instead of the extensive use of rebates and dealer incentives.  \"Under Smale, P.&G. switched to that kind of focus,\" the G.M. marketing executive said. **********To be sure, two longtime G.M. executives were promoted in yesterday's reshuffle: John (Jack) F. Smith Jr., 54, who became president, and William E. Hoglund, 57, who became chief financial officer. And their promotions could scarcely be called going to outsiders, at least not in most companies. Yet both would qualify as what John Kotter, a professor at the Harvard Business School, termed \"unconventional insiders.\" Serving Outside Detroit **********Mr. Hoglund served as president of the Saturn division in Spring Hill, Tenn., G.M.'s innovative experiment in car making, while Mr. Smith is the former president of G.M.'s profitable European operations. \"To Detroit, G.M. Europe is a far-flung outpost,\" said Mr. Kotter, co-author of a new book \"Corporate Culture and Performance.\" **********Mr. Kotter's book is a study of the companies that adapted to change and those that floundered. Of the companies he studied that needed to change their corporate cultures, as G.M. does, and succeeded in doing so, \"none were done by pure insiders,\" Mr. Kotter said. **********Any verdict on the changes G.M. has made is months away, or longer. But investors were encouraged by the forceful, and public, steps taken by G.M.'s board. \"It's a large corporation that's been hidebound for years,\" said Mr. Bowman, the investment officer at Calpers. \"Moving it is a slow process, like turning a supertanker.

Talks on Self-Rule **********Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said this week that settlement restrictions should be seen in the context of forthcoming negotiations on an interim period of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********\"We are going to take a political step which demands obligations at least for a transitional period,\" Mr. Ben Eliezer told Israel television. **********Spokesmen for the 100,000 settlers in the occupied territories condemned the government's latest move and said it was done to curry favor with the Bush Administration, which has demanded a settlement freeze. \"This is a political, malicious and uneconomical decision,\" said Aharon Domb, spokesman for the Council of Jewish Communities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza, a settlement umbrella group. **********Since taking office a month ago, the Labor-led Government has taken a series of steps to reduce settlement construction and government spending in the occupied territories. Plans to build 5,713 housing units have been scrapped, and work has been halted on 1,855 units in preliminary building stages, according to Housing Ministry figures. Work continues on 9,633 homes in the West Bank, including areas around Jerusalem, in more advanced stages of construction.  Road Construction Halted **********The Government has also halted construction of 10 roads serving settlers, suspended investment grants for Israeli industries in the occupied territories, and begun reviewing a range of loans, tax breaks and other financial incentives given to settlers. **********The Bush Administration has demanded a freeze of settlement activity in return for $10 billion in loan guarantees over five years, requested by Israel for the resettlement of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The guarantees and Israel's recent settlement cutbacks are expected to be a main focus of Mr. Rabin's discussions with President Bush. **********At tonight's demonstration, the first mass protest by settlers and their supporters since the Labor Government took office nearly a month ago, speakers appealed to Mr. Rabin to resist American pressure for a settlement freeze and pledged to fight the government's restrictions on construction in the occupied territories. **********Protesters carrying signs reading \"Freeze Rabin\" and \"Don't dismantle Israel peace by piece\" listened to speeches by leaders of right-wing parties, including former Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, an architect of the previous government's settlement drive in the occupied territories. **********\"Mr. Rabin, say courageously that you oppose a Palestinian state in Judea, Samaria and Gaza,\" said Moshe Katzav, a leader of the right-wing Likud Party, using the Biblical terms for the West Bank and Gaza Strip. \"Tell the Americans firmly that Jews have the right to live anywhere, in Washington, Paris, Moscow, as well as in Bethlehem, Hebron and Nablus.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/13/business/your-own-account-a-gift-often-too-little-too-late.html": {"writer_name": "Mary Rowland", "pub_date": "1992-12-13", "snippet": "AS the end of the year approaches, many people think about how to thank the babysitters, nannies, housekeepers and others who take care of them and their children.

Unfortunately, experts say, many haven't spent enough time during the year working on making the relationship a good one and the holiday gift turns out to be too little too late. **********Even a big year-end bonus cannot erase what your caretaker perceives to be a year's worth of inconsideration. Caretakers who believe they have been treated with disrespect \"begin to harbor resentments,\" says Kathleen Lewis, a Brooklyn-based consultant on child care issues. \"They probably won't say anything. They will just start to look for another job.\" **********Added Eileen Stein, president of Town and Country Domestic Agency and Nurses' Registry Inc. in New York, \"Being good to your caretaker and showing respect for her time all year is what's really important.\" **********The foundation of a good relationship is open communication. It should start when your family first hires someone. You should outline exactly what your caretaker will do and exactly what you will do. Once you have made the deal, don't change the terms unless you renegotiate. **********\"You should spell everything out and then stick to that,\" Ms. Lewis said. **********Ms. Lewis, who also operates two agencies, Part-Time Sitters for permanent part-time sitters and Pinch Sitters for temporary child care, says the most common mistakes parents make are changing the rules once the caretaker has started and failing to respect the caretaker's personal time and needs. **********For example, the parents may say they want someone who will give the children their full attention from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. \"But then they start adding shopping for groceries and cooking dinner to the duties,\" Ms. Lewis said. Or they become annoyed because the house always seems messy. Or they come home at 6:15 and then want to spend half an hour discussing their child's day. **********Many families also fail to understand that their caretaker is counting on every penny of the weekly salary they pay. If you take a three-day weekend, it's hardly fair to dock the caretaker for one day's pay. If you're late getting home from the office, you should pay overtime. If you plan to stay out quite late, you should make arrangements for your sitter to reach home safely. That doesn't mean the subway. **********\"You'd be surprised at the number of people who routinely come in 45 minutes to an hour late in the evening and don't pay their sitters extra,\" Ms. Lewis said. \"Or those who always come up short of money on Friday and can't give the sitter her pay.\" **********Many of these problems can also occur for those who provide day care in their homes. If several families pull their children out of day care over the holidays, the day care provider's income tumbles and she has budget problems. That's what happened to Carol Caruthers, now a partner at Price Waterhouse in St. Louis, when she operated a day care center in her home years ago while her two children were young. **********\"If you have one child through the Christmas holidays, you have to operate the whole thing,\" she said. \"But it's very hard to keep things up and going when people pull their kids out whenever they want.\" Ms. Caruthers came up with this solution: She began to charge a flat fee for the entire school year rather than a daily fee. **********You should look at your caretaker's salary in the same way, as an annual budget item. If you get a day off from work, your caretaker should be paid. **********If your own work situation changes or if your child's situation changes, you should discuss it with your caretaker immediately. For example, if you will be cut back to four days of work and will need child care only four days, you can't just assume that your caretaker can make ends meet on four days' pay. If you lose your job, talk to your caretaker about what your plans are -- and what it means for her. **********\"The responsibility for communication is the family's,\" Ms. Lewis said. \"The sitter tries to follow along with the family's style.\" **********Don't second-guess your caretaker's judgment, either, particularly on unimportant things. If she is to feel confident about making important decisions, she must know that you trust her and respect her opinion. \"They have to take the initiative to handle an emergency,\" Ms. Stein said. \"It's critical for you to give them the confidence to do it.\" **********One of the trickiest transitions to manage is when the youngest child starts school and the family requires fewer hours of child care. Many families decide to add the weekly cleaning to the caretaker's list of chores. It is an effort that often fails. **********\"A lot of sitters don't want to do housework,\" Ms. Lewis said. **********Sit down with your caretaker when you first make plans for your child to go to school and describe your needs. \"You might say: 'Here is the new job description. Would you like to do it?' \" Ms. Lewis said. Or you might draw up a list of other chores -- shopping, cooking, picking up dry cleaning, running errands -- and see if some of the things appeal to your caretaker and if you can reach a new agreement. **********\"But you shouldn't just assume it is going to work out,\" Ms. Lewis said.BONUSES WITH A PERSONAL TOUCH **********A CASH bonus is the traditional holiday gift for those who work in your home -- typically, a week's pay, the agencies say, although it varies as radically as do the pay and duties of household help. But it's possible to add something personal if you are tuned in to their needs and likes. **********For example, Carol Caruthers, a partner at Price Waterhouse in St. Louis, discovered that the woman who cleaned her home each week so admired one of the quilts she had that she was saving her money to buy one. Ms. Caruthers bought it as a Christmas gift. **********Eileen Stein, president of Town and Country Domestic Agency and Nurses' Registry Inc. in New York, tells of a family who opened a bank account for their caretaker to help her save money to pay for course work to complete her master's degree and promised to add to it at regular intervals. **********Ms. Stein offers these suggestions: *********** If your caretaker has come here from another country, offer to pay for a 10-minute call home every other week, once a month or whatever you can afford. *********** If you belong to a gym or health club, you can usually add your caretaker's name to the membership for nothing or for a nominal fee. *********** Give time off as a gift. \"If you have a live-in person, you might give a night off to attend school,\" Ms. Stein said. *********** Take your caretaker on a holiday outing. \"Some families on Long Island bring the family and the nanny in to the city and see the Christmas tree and go to a Broadway show and to dinner,\" she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/18/business/world-markets-muted-optimism-for-a-battered-japan.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1992-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 941, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Markets; Muted Optimism for a Battered Japan", "print_headline": "World Markets; Muted Optimism for a Battered Japan", "body_text": " **********ANDREW BALLINGAL has some wonderful news. Over the next two years, predicts Mr. Ballingal, the strategist here for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities, the Japanese stock market's Nikkei index will rise at least 50 percent from its recent low. After that fantastic rally, the index would stand at more than 21,000 -- still down 12 percent or so from the beginning of this emphatically miserable year. **********Much of the turmoil that hit currency and financial markets last month missed Japan, to the relief of most Japanese. But avoiding that mayhem has done nothing to heal this market's deep, long-term ills. **********The economy is floundering, banks are swimming in a sea of bad loans, corporate profits are sliding and politics has been thrown into chaos by the resignation last week of Shin Kanemaru, the governing party's kingmaker, because of a money scandal.  With its close Friday at 17,369.81, the Nikkei index is still down more than 50 percent from its peak three years ago. **********It is a mark of the melancholy mood in Kabutocho, Tokyo's Wall Street, that an analyst who expects that it will take more than two years for the market to regain its level of nine months ago is counted an optimist. **********\"We are in a new bull market in Japan,\" said Mr. Ballingal, who bases his forecast on a view that things will get no worse. \"There's a floor under this market now. We'll get a normal cycle from here.\" **********Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, made some surprisingly somber comments in Tokyo on Wednesday in which he could have been speaking for Japan as well as the United States. **********Mr. Greenspan lamented that the problem is not that the American economy is declining, but that it is not really improving. Despite big reductions in official interest rates, the economy was not responding as it would be expected to. That prompted him to conclude that the United States was in a stubbornly sluggish phase in which many of the lessons learned over the past four decades simply do not apply. **********The Japanese Government has slashed interest rates and announced a $90 billion public works program to pump cash into the system. It has also issued a steady stream of positive pronouncements. **********\"The Government says the economy is starting to rebound, but nobody believes it,\" said Yuichi Matsushita, a senior analyst at Nikko Securities. \"At this point we're expecting a recovery in the second half of next year.\" **********As for the stock market, Mr. Matsushita said recovery was still in the future, in part because investors are being caught by surprise at the signs of how badly the slowdown is affecting corporate Japan. **********Nikko, in fact, has just made a sharp cut in its forecast for corporate profits in the current fiscal year, which ends March 30. It had been forecasting a 9.9 percent decline from the previous year, Mr. Matsushita said, but now expects a 19.7 percent drop. That means that, on aggregate, the profits of corporate Japan will have plummeted 35 percent over three years. **********Some, however, say that even that figure for the year is too optimistic. \"That's a joke,\" said Alan Bell, deputy head of research at Baring Securities here. \"They'll be down at least 25 percent.\" **********Mr. Bell's remarks underscored one of the underlying problems with the stock market -- expectations have still not fully adjusted to the depth of the economic malaise in Japan. As a result, when there are surprises, as there have been in the projections of corporate profits, they have always been negative surprises that knocked the market lower. **********Most companies have been slow to recognize in their official forecasts how deeply the economic slowdown is cutting into profits, but some analysts have been more hard-nosed. **********\"The problem is that analysts' forecasts are really not afforded any credibility here,\" Mr. Bell said. \"We can jump up and down and scream and make as much noise as we like, but the market doesn't take any notice. This is still an incredibly inefficient market.\" **********In the long run, few doubt that the Japanese economy will prove itself fit, particularly its manufacturing sector. That is one big difference between Japan and the United States. Japanese industries have not lost their competitiveness, just their profitability, and few doubt that that adjustment is taking place. **********\"I'm not utterly despondent,\" said Mr. Bell. \"The problems are just going to take a little time to work out.\" **********Mr. Ballingal of Barclays said he based his modestly positive outlook on the assumption that the economy had bottomed, even if it had not yet begun to advance strongly. The deep problems with bad loans in the banking industry are severe, he said, but manageable. In addition, new issues of shares here have all but stopped, which means investors have not had to contend with additional supply, another positive factor. **********\"The point is that it's going to get better from here, but in a normal way,\" he commented. \"It's not bad that we tread water for a while.\" **********Mr. Matsushita said he, too, had seen some mildly better signs in the form of more optimism among institutional investors. **********\"The trust banks are a little more positive,\" he said. \"They don't expect the market to collapse and so they're doing some buying. It's not an exceptional or tremendous amount of buying, but it adds some stability to the market.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/01/world/summit-un-bush-chinese-prime-minister-meet-briefly-un-amid-protests.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Faison", "pub_date": "1992-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1065, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bush and Chinese Prime Minister Meet Briefly at U.N.

The President contends that such contacts are worthwhile as a means of tempering Beijing's behavior through dialogue. Hundreds of people protested against the meeting outside. **********The meeting took place in a conference room here after both leaders attended the summit meeting of leaders of nations represented on the Security Council. **********Barely an hour before they met, the State Department issued its annual worldwide human rights report, in which China was accused of an array of abuses and described as a repressive regime \"falling far short of internationally accepted norms.\"  [ Page 6. ] **********But in his address to the Council, Mr. Li said China \"is opposed to interference in the internal affairs of other countries, using the human rights issue as an excuse.\" He insisted that China \"values human rights.\" **********Mr. Bush appeared to go out of his way to avoid any display of personal warmth toward the Chinese leader during the meeting.  Distance Is Emphasized **********Both Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d looked deliberately somber, in contrast to Mr. Li's smiles, when pool reporters were allowed to enter the room for a photo session. Mr. Bush also chose to sit across a table from Mr. Li, instead of the side-by-side armchairs used in meetings with other leaders at the summit talks. **********Mr. Bush told the Prime Minister that he found China's record on human rights inadequate, Mr. Baker said afterward. In response, Mr. Li repeated China's position on human rights, that it is an internal affair not fit for discussion by outsiders. **********\"This is not acceptable under our standards,\" Mr. Baker told reporters. **********China has repeatedly promised to abide by international agreements not to export missiles and missile technology, but recent intelligence reports revealed that China has continued to sell missile technology to Syria and Pakistan -- an issue that Mr. Bush was expected to raise at the meeting. **********Mr. Li appeared to be aiming for maximum diplomatic achievement at the summit, meeting also with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, Prime Minister John Major of Britain, and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan. He did not meet with President Francois Mitterrand of France, however; Mr. Mitterrand's Government has openly supported Chinese dissidents in exile. **********Mr. Li's participation at the summit, capped by his meeting with President Bush, gave Mr. Li a footing on the world stage that has eluded him since 1989, when his role in supporting the crackdown in which hundreds of democracy campaigners died earned him the enmity of many Chinese people. **********Mr. Bush first met with the Prime Minister in Feb. 1989 on a visit to Beijing. Appearance of Discomfort **********Mr. Li appeared slightly uncomfortable as he and other leaders posed for the summit's official photograph, nervously glancing at either side to check his position against those of his counterparts. **********Despite the hundreds of Chinese students and democracy advocates who vigorously protested outside the United Nations, and despite pointed remarks about human rights by other leaders in the Security Council, Mr. Li appeared likely to depart New York with China's and his own position enhanced. **********\"When he returns to Beijing, he will go down as a victor for demonstrating his ability to bring China back into the world community,\" said Haiching Zhao, an organizer of the protest. \"It is the opposite of what should be happening.\" **********Chai Ling, a student leader, added: \"I don't think this is a good beginning for the New World Order.\" Rally Smaller Than Expected **********At the protest rally outside the United Nations, around 1,000 people gathered, according to the police, far fewer than the 10,000 predicted by student organizers. And their chants were only faintly audible at the delegates entrance to the United Nations, several blocks away. **********At the rally, protesters arranged an eye-catching gesture of releasing 50 doves into the sky, to symbolize their continuing hope for peaceful change in China. **********Chinese democracy advocates generally call Li Peng the most hated man in China. Although widely considered to be essentially a front man for elderly leaders, such as Chen Yun, who is a hard-line conservative, and Deng Ying Chao, the widow of Zhou Enlai, the former prime minister, who wields considerable influence. Mr. Li personifies the 1989 crackdown and China's unrepentant posture since. **********Just a month after the killings, Mr. Li told a Chinese- American visitor that the army had only opened fire on civilians because there were not enough rubber bullets or tear gas to disperse them peacefully, and that water cannons were useless because water pressure around Tiananmen Square was weak. **********Few Chinese believed such remarks at them time, convinced that the Government's decision to use force was fully deliberate, but the comment reinforced Mr. Li's image as a somewhat graceless leader. **********In his speech to the Council today, Mr. Li seemed out of step with the themes of human rights and freedom voiced by other leaders, and he repeated China's longstanding position that human rights are an internal matter of sovereign nations. **********\"A country's human-rights situation should not be judged in total disregard of its history and national conditions,\" said Mr. Li. \"It is neither appropriate nor workable that all countries measure up to the human rights criteria or models of one of a small number of countries.\" **********He sat expressionless as Mr. Yeltsin declared with verve that there are no longer any prisoners of conscience in his nation. **********At the rally, one speaker after another denounced Mr. Li, whose image in a Nazi uniform was drawn on a large banner. A mock trial of Li Peng was performed, and an imitation 'Goddess of Democracy,' was erected, replicating the Statue of Liberty-like figure that students built in Tiananmen Square in 1989. **********\"For a person like Li Peng to be Prime Minister is an embarrassment for all Chinese,\" said Chen Yizi, a former Government official who is now a scholar at Princeton University."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/19/business/company-briefs-539792.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 264, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Albertson's Inc., Boise, Idaho, a retail food and drug concern, agreed to buy 34 Jewel Osco food and drug stores from American Stores Co.

First Such Evidence **********The centrifuge program is considered the centerpiece of Iraqi efforts to produce nuclear weapons, but until this week, investigators had little hard evidence of how advanced it was. **********Mr. Zifferero said that at the start of the Persian Gulf war a year ago, Iraq had been two to three years from industrial-scale production of enriched uranium using the centrifuge process, which is considered one of the most technologically advanced methods of uranium enrichment. **********If Iraq had perfected the centrifuge process, it could have produced several nuclear weapons each year, experts have said. By contrast, another Iraqi program for enriching uranium -- using a process called electromagnetic separation, which is costly and inefficient -- was only 12 to 18 months away from regular production, but its capacity for producing bomb fuel would have been much lower. **********The Iraqis acknowledged to investigators last week that they had acquired 100 tons of a special hard steel used in centrifuges, and several thousand aluminum forgings for use in the centrifuge production. They said the steel had been melted down after the gulf war ended, and they showed investigators the melted stockpile.

W. de Klerk's historic visit to Nigeria, his aides announced that he would brief journalists traveling in the economy seats of his chartered jetliner. **********Mr. Botha emerged attired in ethnic Nigerian costume, puffing on a fat cigar. The sunglasses he wore could not conceal his satisfaction at parading his new African identity. **********President de Klerk's trip to Nigeria, the most influential country in black Africa, has not only shattered South Africa's isolation but also fostered a rediscovery on both sides that white South Africans have roots in Africa too. **********And South Africa, which once took for granted that the road back to international acceptance led through Africa, is exploiting the breakthrough in proposing that regional powers set aside their old antagonism and work together to revive the continent's sagging economy. **********Mr. Botha, who accompanied Mr. de Klerk to Nigeria, dramatically referred to his hosts as \"my brothers.\" He called the visit the most important in his 15 years as Foreign Minister, a tenure during which he also defended apartheid before the world. **********Nigeria's Foreign Minister, Ike Nwachukwu, echoed the idea of one Africa wryly. \"In our view in Nigeria, the Boers are one of the several tribes that make up Africa,\" he said.

He has the job of lining up trucks and rail cars to deliver raw materials to plants and to ship flying disks, body-surfing boards and children's electric cars to hundreds of stores. **********But when the rail strike began early Thursday, he took center stage.  Plant managers, marketing people and other executives of the privately held company, with sales of about $150 million a year, all wanted to know how they would get their shipments. Making Plans for a Strike **********Coming to work at 7:30 A.M., an hour earlier than usual, and often leaving late at night, he sought to steer a middle course -- not hoarding trucks but also making plans to move goods by truck if necessary. **********The reaction of many traffic managers, he said, was to line up as many trucks as possible to deliver raw materials and finished products in case of a strike. **********\"Everybody is trying to divert right now,\" he said. \"Trucks are in really short supply.\" **********He said the situation reminded him of the energy crisis of 1973, when motorists wanted to keep their gas tanks full even if they planned to keep their cars in the driveway. Strike Ends, but Not Concerns **********Even though the rail strike ended yesterday, Mr. Ely may still need trucks because it may take days for normal service to resume on the railroads that shut down operations. His primary worry is to make sure Kransco's three plants do not run out of raw materials. **********A rail car full of expanded foam products used in making body-surfing boards was stranded in southern Ohio on the Norfolk Southern Railroad. He believes that he will have to get a truck to move the materials to the company's plant in San Diego. **********But for now, all of the plants have enough material to keep going into next week. There is little danger that any will be forced to shut down -- a prospect they would have faced if the strike had lasted into next week. The company employs about 800 workers. **********Rather than worry about shortages, Mr. Ely is now seeking to find various shipments around the country. **********\"Some raw material coming from the West Coast is somewhere between here and Indiana,\" he said. Shipping containers with electrical parts for battery-powered cars made in the Indiana plant may still have to be moved by truck because of the uncertainty about when rail service will return to normal. **********On Thursday, there had been considerable pressure from managers in purchasing for him to start moving parts by truck. \"There was real panic out there,\" he recalled. **********Working in Mr. Ely's favor is the good will of some of the company's trucking and shipping lines. Since he moves about a third of his freight with the J. B. Hunt Company, the nation's second-largest long-haul carrier, he was confident that if he was in a particularly tough spot, one of Hunt's managers would help him out. **********He also received a significant favor from P & O Lines, a steamship company. P & O called yesterday and said it would pay to transport by truck five 40-foot containers bound for Britain. The containers, filled with finished battery-powered cars, were trucked to the port of Norfolk, Va. **********Mr. Ely had been accumulating this kind of good will by being sympathetic in the past when a trucking company had a problem. For instance, if a company was having trouble finding a driver, he would say it was not crucial to have the delivery right away. \"You have to develop some give and take,\" he said. Such gestures, he said, were like money in the bank in the last week. **********Meanwhile, he remains wary. **********\"I think I will still have to make some arrangment to do some trucking over the weekend,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/06/business/airlines-offer-discounts-to-europe.html": {"writer_name": "Edwin McDowell", "pub_date": "1992-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 603, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Airlines Offer Discounts to Europe", "print_headline": "Airlines Offer Discounts to Europe", "body_text": " **********Despite an improvement in transAtlantic traffic, airlines are faced with lagging advance bookings to Europe, so they are again offering discount fares for spring and summer. **********Yesterday, American Airlines advertised fares of $448 round trip from New York to London and $548 to Paris, Brussels and Zurich for travel in April, May and September. For an additional $100 round trip, passengers can travel in June, July and August. **********The other leading airlines, including United and Northwest, quickly matched the fare. Delta Air Lines, which does not fly the New York to London routes, said it was studying matching some of the fares.  Slight Rise From 1991 **********The new fares are only $110 more than the lowest round-trip fares from New York to Europe from January through March, the traditional slow travel season. And they are slightly higher than fares for the comparable period last year, when international travel plummeted during the Persian Gulf war. **********But the fares are being offered at a time when international traffic is improving.

And when it begins New York-Moscow service later this month, via Brussels, its introductory fare will be $598 -- about half the current price on other carriers. **********As a way of building traffic, the tactic seems to be working: T.W.A. traffic rose 47.6 percent last month from February 1991, the company said, and the airline's international traffic during that period almost tripled. Call for New Laws **********But rival carriers have denounced T.W.A. fares as \"irrational\" and called for changes in the bankruptcy laws that allow carriers that file for Chapter 11 court protection from creditors to continue flying.

Government offices across the country have been swamped as the deadline approaches for signing up for a virtual giveaway of a large chunk of the state-owned economy. **********Under the program, known as \"coupon privatization,\" the Government is about to divide ownership of roughly 40 percent of the economy among all citizens over 18 who register. The cost of entry is 1,035 crowns, or about $35, a little more than a week's average wage in Czechoslovakia. **********Registration was required by the end of this month. But today, after evidence of hoarding, officials announced measures to extend the deadline. **********The registration procedure is to be simplified, and new, temporary registration cards will be issued to thwart those who seem to be responsible for buying up most of the 35 crown ($1.25) registration books needed to take part. **********Those who join the program receive a book of coupons that can be exchanged for shares in state companies that are going over to private ownership. Economists say the average value of those shares will be many times higher than the $35 investment. **********There is, however, a chance of losing the $35 if a person chooses stocks in a company that subsequently goes bankrupt. **********Interest has been so great that some of the 600 Government registration offices have been forced to stay open late and on weekends to accommodate the lines of people waiting outside. **********And some of the 450 recently established private investment funds are promising to pay back 10 or 15 times the original $35 investment after a year to people who entrust their coupons to them. **********But there is a sinister side. Government officials charge that this rare opportunity has led to misconduct by some of the big investment funds. **********The problem is that most Government offices have run out of coupon books. Eight million books were printed and to date only three million people have gone through the two-step process of buying a book for 35 crowns and registering it for 1,000 crowns. **********Tomas Jezek, the Czech Republic's Minister of Privatization, said the plan was being misused. \"Someone -- I suspect the investment funds -- bought the remaining six million books for speculation,\" he said, adding that with coupon books unavailable from the Government, a prospective buyer must turn to one of the private funds and sign up his coupons for investment by it. He said he would ask the state prosecutor to conduct a quick investigation, and threatened to disqualify any fund found guilty of hoarding coupon books. **********He said on Friday that he suspected a fund named after a well-known American university, an allusion to a company called Harvard Capital and Consulting, or H. C. &C. **********H. C. & C., the biggest of the investment funds, has so far been the most successful. Using an aggressive advertising campaign, including television commercials produced by a Czechoslovak-American advertising company, it has signed up about 30 percent of the three million people who have bought and registered coupon books so far. **********The company was the first to promise a tenfold return on the $35 investment after one year. The company has 22,000 agents signing up coupon-book holders. The agents, who are paid by commission, can be seen outside most Government registration offices canvassing for clients. **********The Harvard fund is part of a larger group of companies engaging in business services like financial advice and corporate law. The group was founded a year and a half ago by a 27-year-old, Viktor Kozeny, who says he chose the company name because he has a bachelor's degree in economics from Harvard University. He denies hoarding coupon books. **********Mr. Jezek said he was worried about the market share now held by the Harvard fund, but acknowledged that the company's campaign helped interest a large number of people in coupon privatization after the program got off to a slow start in November. **********\"People had trouble believing that the Government was really going to give away so much property,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/04/business/bank-of-boston-office.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 82, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bank of Boston Office", "print_headline": "Bank of Boston Office", "body_text": " **********Bank of Boston, as part of a plan to expand operations in Latin America, expects to open an office in Mexico City and three to six branches in Argentina in 12 months, a bank official said.

Baker 3d, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the Sandinista leader and former President, was clamoring for a meeting with Mr. Baker in Mexico before his arrival here. **********Mr. Ortega's request was denied, and he had to content himself with seeking out the Secretary of State at an official lunch in Mexico City on Thursday. However, Mr. Baker was drawn into conversation not with Mr. Ortega, the Secretary of State told reporters later, but with the Cuban Foreign Minister, Isidoro Malmierca, who was at his table. **********On Thursday night, when Mr. Baker arrived in San Salvador after witnessing the signing in Mexico of a peace accord to end the 12-year civil war, Marxist guerrillas with rock bands and red flags were holding a joyful rally in a city center plaza while President Alfredo Cristiani and his right-wing backers were celebrating in another square nearby. **********Both scenes, barely imaginable a decade ago when Central America was aflame with ideological passion and violence, are illustrative of what Bush Administration officials regard as one of their most successful foreign policy initiatives: to bring peace, disarmament and economic development to this tormented region. Collaspse of Soviet Union **********The strategy was immeasurably assisted by the collapse of the Soviet Union. But Bush Administration policy, low-keyed and methodical, has played an important role. First there was the virtual abandonment of the Nicaraguan contras, so championed by Ronald Reagan, followed by a diplomatic push for internationally monitored elections. Then came strong Administration pressure on the Salvadoran Government to accelerate negotiations to end the war and open the political process. Guatemala is next on the screen. **********\"The time has come to negotiate an end to Guatemala's 30-year-old insurgency,\" Mr. Baker told the Salvadoran National Assembly today. \"When it ends, and it will end, we will be able to look across Central America for the first time in its history and see the promise of Esquipulas fulfilled: every nation living peacefully under a government freely chosen by its people.\" **********Esquipulas is the Guatemalan town where in August 1987 five Central American presidents signed an accord calling for the cessation of regional conflicts, the strengthening of democratic institutions and the return of refugees and others displaced by conflicts. In mentioning Esquipulas, Mr. Baker acknowledged the importance of allowing regional leaders and organizations to take the lead. Keeping the United States in a supporting role lessens the chance of provoking traditional animosities born of Latin fears of United States dominance and interference. Pressing Need for U.S. Aid **********There is also an important practical side to this. Administration officials recognize that the Salvadorans need assistance in rebuilding their country. But with foreign aid a pariah topic in an election year and the former Soviet republics already making large demands for assistance, the United States does not want to be in the position of having to refuse to pay the entire $1.8 billion estimated cost of the reconstruction of El Salvador. **********Nicaragua has received about $535 million in American aid and has had $284 million in debts to Washington written off in the 20 months since the Chamorro Government came to power. An Administration official said this makes Nicaragua one of the highest per capita recipients of United States assistance. **********But there were no pledges of new help made by Mr. Baker to the Central Americans. Indeed, Administration officials described this trip as in part a mission to assess the needs of the Central American nations and to begin to look for partners to help pay for regional development programs. **********Among the groups that Mr. Baker hopes will contribute are wealthier Latin American nations and Canada, but the European Community is also being approached. A diplomat with years of experience in Latin America suggested that the longstanding concept of \"spheres of infuence\" has been substantially tempered by the Bush Administration's desire to \"multilateralize\" policies. Role of Free Trade **********Greater regional problem-sharing is also fostered by the realization in the United States and throughout the hemisphere, where most nations now have democratic governments, that European and Asian trading blocs can be best tackled by a large free-trade area in this part of the world. **********In his speech today, Mr. Baker spoke of a community of nations \"whose citizens freely trade across borders from Alaska to Argentina.\" But many Latin Americans are convinced that movement in this direction can only be set back in an American election where a troubled economy is the main issue and voters may perceive trade agreements as foreign giveaways. **********In Central America, the Administration has also encouraged a greater role for the United Nations, which is sending more than 1,000 peacekeepers to El Salvador to monitor a cease-fire due to start on Feb. 1. Secretary General Boutros Ghali presided over the signing of the Salvadoran peace accord in Mexico City on Thursday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/18/world/as-euphoria-of-unity-fades-eastern-germans-feel-scorned-and-excluded.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1992-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1565, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "As Euphoria of Unity Fades, Eastern Germans Feel Scorned and Excluded", "print_headline": "As Euphoria of Unity Fades, Eastern Germans Feel Scorned and Excluded", "body_text": " **********Like many people in eastern Germany these days, residents of this town are angry at their western cousins. The euphoria they felt in the first days of unification in 1990 has faded, and a psychological pall has settled over many of them. **********The topic that everyone and no one in Neubrandenburg wants to discuss is the sudden disgrace of their most famous neighbor, Katrin Krabbe, the world sprinting champion. Miss Krabbe is beloved here, and residents were shocked when German sports officials asserted in January that she had tampered with a drug test. **********Although an arbitration panel recently ruled in Miss Krabbe's favor, some people here cannot shake the suspicion that she is being discriminated against because she is from the east. **********\"It's not just that people think Katrin Krabbe is victim of a conspiracy, although many think she is,\" said Holger Timm, a young electrician here. \"The problem is that many people in the eastern part of the country are convinced they can't get a fair break anymore. They see Krabbe as just one more example.\"  'Disoriented and Confused' **********\"People over here are disoriented and confused. They've been very disappointed by the results of unification, and now they find it hard to believe in anything anymore.\" **********Politicians, social scientists and private citizens interviewed in recent weeks said the malaise that has spread over eastern Germany is partly a result of the region's shaky economy. Unemployment remains high as businesses formerly owned by the Government are sold off to private bidders, and workers have taken to the streets in several cities. **********Most people in eastern Germany are confident that when economic restructuring is finally complete, perhaps by the end of this decade, they will be living fairly well. But much of their current unhappiness is rooted in complaints of economic discrimination. These have added substance to the realization that in the 40 years their country was divided, they and their western cousins grew much further apart than they had realized. Continuity Is Broken **********On the streets of Neubrandenburg, a medieval fortress town 40 miles from the Baltic coast, as in other cities and towns in eastern Germany, people complain that the continuity in their lives has been broken. **********\"A lot has been taken from us,\" said Jana Frohlich, an organizer for local environmental groups. \"The friendliness and the brotherhood and sisterhood we used to have has disappeared. You don't meet too many happy folks around here these days.\" **********It is not just that their star athletes are being attacked as cheaters and their political leaders reviled as secret police collaborators, eastern Germans say. It is that many people in the west seem to believe that their decades of life in East Germany were barren and worthless. **********German unification has developed not as a merger of two equal lands, but rather as a swallowing up of one by a far larger, richer and more self-confident neighbor. In almost every respect, western laws, regulations and political cultures were imposed in the east without modification.  'Somehow a Nuisance' **********\"I haven't gotten over the feeling that we are somehow a nuisance,\" said Wolfgang Thierse, a leading member of Parliament from eastern Germany. \"Apparently if your background is wrong, if your history was in the wrong nation, you have nothing serious to contribute, especially if it challenges the status quo of the Federal Republic of Germany.\" **********The stereotype of the arrogant wise guy from western Germany who treats easterners with contempt is so widespread that a new word has been invented to describe him. He is called a Besserwessi, a pun that turns the term besserwisser, which means know-it-all or smart aleck, into a westerner who thinks he knows everything better. **********Although people in eastern Germany sometimes have trouble explaining just why they resent the Besserwessi so much, they are quick to list examples of Government policies they consider discriminatory. **********Most obvious is the difference in salaries paid to people who do comparable work in the eastern and western parts of the country. A postal worker or bus driver in the east, for example, earns just 60 percent as much as his or her western counterpart. Easterners are said to be less productive, a premise they vigorously dispute.  Inequality of Pensions **********Pensions are also unequal, with retired people in the east receiving about one-third less than those in the west. The Government plans to equalize wages and pensions by the end of the 1990's. **********Eastern Germans also complain that as the Government has sold off thousands of companies, the people have been unable to share in the bonanza. Because they have little or no savings, they have been forced to stand aside while outsiders, most of them from western Germany, buy up what was once their country. **********Perhaps the law that angers easterners most is the one giving former owners of homes and shops in eastern Germany the right to reclaim their property if they can show that it was illegally confiscated by the Nazi or Communist Governments. **********As a result of this law, which is now the subject of heated debate in Bonn, tens of thousands of families in the east are in danger of being thrown out of homes in which they have lived for decades. Others refuse to renovate homes or shops for fear they will soon be reclaimed by former owners. **********The anguish that this law has brought to many easterners was underlined tragically in March when Detlef Dalk, a local politician in the town of Zepernick who faced losing his home, committed suicide. Mr. Dalk left an impassioned letter to Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealing for a suspension of house seizures. **********\"Please listen to what I am saying,\" he wrote, \"otherwise I will not be the last.\" **********Mr. Dalk was the second politician from eastern Germany to commit suicide in two months. The other, Gerhard Riege, a member of the Bonn Parliament, hanged himself in February after the publication of documents showing he had once been a police informer. **********Although evidence against low-level police informers is spilling from newly opened files, senior leaders of the deposed Communist Government have thus far escaped legal punishment. Many eastern Germans resent the fact that some of their former oppressors are living freely and successfully, while lowly former border guards are facing prison terms. **********Young people throughout eastern Germany are angry that their favorite radio station, known as DT-64, is being phased out. They have gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures and used every kind of peaceful protest they can imagine, but the Government has not budged from its stand: Because DT-64 served the Communist Government it must go, despite the fact that it has become a popular, offbeat and creative station. **********Another debate that stirs eastern tempers is over the relocation of federal agencies that were \"temporarily\" moved to the west after World War II. The nation's highest court, for example, was in the eastern city of Leipzig from 1877 until 1945. Now that the country has been unified, Leipzig expects the court to return. But judges and other employees have become quite comfortable in the pleasant western town of Karlsruhe, and insist they will not move eastward. **********These and other conflicts have widened the gap between eastern and western Germans, a gap that many hoped would now be closing. **********One reflection of the gap was a survey published by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung showing that while 80 percent of western Germans believe democracy to be the best form of government, only 32 percent of easterners believe so. **********A minority of people in eastern Germany, including some who served the old Communist Government, have become successful entrepreneurs. Several hundred thousand have moved to the western part of the country to find better working and living conditions. But most eastern Germans have remained at home, and many are having trouble adjusting to their new lives. **********When Germans talk of bringing the two sides of their country to economic equality, they speak in terms of years, but when asked how long it will take to achieve \"inner unity,\" they often speak of generations.  Dimensions of Change **********\"If the adjective 'total' was ever the correct one to describe a change, it is correct to apply it to people in eastern Germany,\" Harry Schroder, a professor of psychology at Leipzig University, wrote in a recent paper. **********\"Not only did their political system change completely, but so did the material basis of their lives -- administrative structures, social relationships, self-image, the meaning of their past, their present and their future, and with it the very point of their existence. Even the familiar smells of their homeland are different, from cleaning fluids to gasoline.  With unification came not only a falling away of everything familiar, but also implantation in a completely new world.\" **********At the City Hall in Neubrandenburg, the Deputy Mayor, Burkhard Rauber, said he feared for the young generation in eastern Germany. **********\"Two years ago, my daughter was being taught that God did not exist and that anyone who was religious was a fool,\" Mr. Rauber recalled.  \"This year, the very same teacher led the class in religious instruction and Christmas songs, without ever explaining how or why she could make such a change.\" **********\"When kids see things like that, they naturally lose faith in adults and in institutions. They become prone to violence, alcoholism and right-wing radicalism. It's worrisome. German unification is going to succeed in economic terms, but as for what is inside people's heads, that will be a more complicated problem.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/12/business/making-a-difference-activist-heads-campaign-to-halt-deal-with-taiwan.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1992-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 338, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Activist Heads Campaign To Halt Deal With Taiwan", "print_headline": "MAKING A DIFFERENCE; Activist Heads Campaign To Halt Deal With Taiwan", "body_text": " **********In his 26 years as a production worker at the McDonnell Douglas Corporation's Douglas Aircraft plant in Long Beach, Calif., Bob Gamboa has seen the company endure constant questions about its viability.

A decade earlier the proportion was 37.9 percent. **********The decline, according to an I.R.S. spokesman, probably results from the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which eliminated various deductions, and the development of simplified forms like the 1040-EZ.

Surge of Early Filing **********Hard times seem to have prompted a surge in early filing as the size of refunds soars, Internal Revenue Service figures show. **********Through mid-February, the Treasury sent $7.3 billion to 6.5 million couples and individuals, with checks averaging $1,122, or $140 more than in the comparable 1991 period. The number of returns filed was 26.4 million, 6.5 percent ahead of last year's pace, which was slowed by the gulf war. **********The data pointed to a cash-short public eager to claim their refunds, which more than 75 percent of taxpayers arrange to collect each year despite the fact that this is tantamount to an interest-free loan to the Government. **********The faster filing pace this year may also reflect the fact that there are many more jobless with the time to file early. At latest report, 8.9 million Americans were unemployed, compared with 7.7 million in January 1991. **********Returns filed electronically have jumped more than 58 percent this year, to 6.2 million, or one of every four early returns. These produce refunds within a few weeks or even less if the money is to be paid directly into the taxpayer's bank account. **********The Treasury said it opposed providing a tax credit to those who file this way, contending that electronic filers get more benefit from faster refunds than the Government gets from reduced processing costs. Representative Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, suggested a credit but without specifying its size. **********The I.R.S. also reported this week that more than 122,000 South Carolinians have participated so far this year in a program under which they can electronically file Federal and state returns together, with the I.R.S. relaying data to the state. This system, tested in parts of South Carolina in 1991, is being extended this year on a refund-only basis to parts of New York, Maine, North Carolina, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Kansas. Footnotes *********** A survey by the General Accounting Office has found that fewer than one-half of 1 percent of the 11.6 million taxpayers receiving the earned-income credit in 1989 took advantage of their right to collect cash, through employers, in periodic installments throughout the year. The agency said participation has never exceeded 1 percent since the option was first offered in 1979. *********** New and increased taxes proposed by the District of Columbia include a 2 percent levy on the gross receipts of professionals.

The world's fifth-largest chip maker, Fujitsu is adept at precisely what the Japanese microelectronics companies are supposed to be best at: miniaturizing each new generation of computer parts and packaging it elegantly for the consumer market. **********But at the vast Comdex/Fall trade show in Las Vegas, Nev., last week, Fujitsu had very little new to offer in the way of portable computers. And the same was true for other Japanese computer makers. Indeed, in a startling reversal of the technology trend in recent years, the action in mobile computing was all American. **********From EO Computer's notebook cellular telephone and a range of hand-held wireless communicators by Motorola, to Apple Computer's new Duo notebook computers, the American computer industry demonstrated that any fears the Japanese would inevitably control personal computing -- as they do the manufacture of televisions, video cameras and much of the rest of consumer electronics -- are not coming to pass. Setting the Standards **********\"The United States computer manufacturers have re-invented themselves and are holding on to the most desirable market in the world,\" said Steven P. Jobs, a co-founder of Apple who is now chairman of Next Computer Inc. **********From the mid-1980's until last year American computer makers lived under increasing pressure from their Japanese rivals. And many industry analysts believed American companies were vulnerable because the Japanese microelectronics companies controlled the supply of an increasingly large percentage of a personal computer's basic components. **********In a widely read 1989 article in the Harvard Business Review, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Charles H. Ferguson, argued that given the pervasiveness of standardized components, Japan's economic organization and manufacturing prowess would give it an unbeatable advantage unless the United States responded by organizing its own alliances between the corporate world and government. **********But while the Japanese continue to dominate the supply of flat-panel display screens used in portable computers and also have a leading position in producing computer memory chips, many other vital components -- like microprocessors and hard disks -- are still dominated by American companies. **********And American companies, primarily the Microsoft Corporation, the nation's largest software company, and Apple Computer, have been very successful in retaining leadership by setting standards adopted by large segments of the industry. The American Advantage **********Even Mr. Ferguson and other former prophets of doom have changed their tunes. In a new book, \"Computer Wars,\" written with Charles R. Morris, the authors say that setting standards provides a mechanism that will permit American companies to maintain global leadership. **********\"System design is run by the Americans while the components are made by the Japanese,\" he said. \"Five years ago the pessimist school, including me, thought that it was an unstable situation and, in the end, the tale would wag the dog. I'm considerably more optimistic now.\" **********Unlike television sets and other consumer electronics, in which standards are adopted and then change only slowly, computer technology refuses to stand still. What is more, American computer makers have increasingly grown expert in thumping the Japanese in those areas where they are weakest -- developing products in relatively short cycles, redesigning an entire product line in 6 to 12 months. Certainly, Japanese makers have been able to beat American competitors to market. But in areas requiring constant technical innovation, like computing, they have not done so well. The Importance of Risk **********Consider Apple Computer. A year ago it had no market share in notebook computers. Now it is the world's largest notebook maker. **********\"Suddenly the Japanese have become more conservative, and they're not taking risks,\" said Alain Rossman, a former Apple executive who is now president of EO Computer, a company in Mountain View, Calif., that makes a combination cellular phone and pen-based computer that weighs two pounds. **********\"Today, winning comes from speed-based competition,\" he said. \"The Japanese are quick when everything is specified, but in innovation and path-seeking they're slower.\" **********Toshiba, which dominated the United States notebook market until three years ago, is the best example of the Japanese failure to innovate quickly enough. Toshiba's share has fallen from more than 20 percent in 1989 to less than 15 percent now. **********\"The Americans have woken up to the fact that quick product turns are something you have to be able to do or you die,\" said George Fisher, chairman of Motorola Inc. \"We have convinced ourselves that we can compete head to head with the Japanese in cost, quality, size and low power consumption if we put our heads to it.\" Winners in Marketing **********The Japanese computer companies have also been outmarketed by their America competitors. Low-cost, service-oriented mail-order companies like Dell Computer, Zeos International and Gateway 2000 have clearly caught the Japanese flat-footed. **********\"A lot of the innovation in the personal computer market has been in how you sell your products, and that has passed the Japanese by,\" said William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft. **********Japanese executives acknowledge that they have taken a beating in the marketing wars in the United States. **********\"Just making products smaller and lighter won't make them a success,\" said Takuma Yamamoto, Fujitsu's chairman. He said Japanese computer makers needed to imitate I.B.M.'s strategy in Japan, where it created a subsidiary that is almost a Japanese company. **********\"For Japanese companies to be successful in the United States market they must employ talented Americans,\" he said. **********But before the Japanese can refocus their attention on the United States, they may have to secure their home ground, where American companies have been making inroads in the last year. **********The Compaq Computer Corporation recently cut personal computer prices in Japan, presenting the market leader, the NEC Corporation, with a dilemma. Does it respond with price cuts that reduce its profit margins, hoping to maintain its market share? Or does it try to hold the line? **********NEC, whose proprietary computer design is not I.B.M.-compatible, has about 57 percent of the Japanese market, with 6.5 million of its machines in use. But besides price-cutting by rivals, NEC is facing competition from I.B.M.-compatible machines that are able to run the enormously popular Windows software made by Microsoft, which does not come in an NEC version."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/05/business/new-us-japan-accord-on-semiconductors.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1992-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 660, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New U.S.-Japan Accord on Semiconductors", "print_headline": "New U.S.-Japan Accord on Semiconductors", "body_text": " **********In an 11th-hour attempt to head off a trade crisis, Japanese and American electronics companies agreed today on measures aimed at vastly increasing the sale of American semiconductors in Japan this year. **********A key part of the plan is that Japan's 10 largest electronics companies, including giants like Hitachi, Toshiba and Sony, will take \"emergency special measures\" in which they will give American and other non-Japanese suppliers advance information on their need for semiconductor products in the third and fourth quarters. **********\"We have high confidence that these extraordinary measures that have been agreed on today will result in significant increases in market share,\" said James Norling, the president of the semiconductor group at Motorola Inc. and one of the negotiators for the American trade group, the Semiconductor Industry Association. **********But there is still some reason to be skeptical. Giving advance information on the need for chip products does not guarantee that orders will be placed. That will depend on market conditions and other factors. **********Tensions have been rising over what American semiconductor companies regard as Japan's failure to live up to a semiconductor trade agreement between the two nations. **********A major goal of that agreement was that American and other non-Japanese suppliers would obtain 20 percent of Japan's huge market for computer chips by the end of this year. The market share of foreign chip companies in Japan now stands at 14.4 percent and has not been growing, making it exceedingly unlikely that the 20 percent share can be reached by the deadline. **********Japanese companies say the 20 percent figure is not a guarantee, only an expectation. In recent weeks they have expressed increasing annoyance at American demands, saying it is hard for them to take on new suppliers during an economic downturn. **********American semiconductor companies have been threatening to seek sanctions against Japanese companies. The American Government has also begun to express its disappointment with the lack of progress in market share. Last week, the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, began a Federal review of how the existing agreement was being carried out. **********Today's agreement, announced jointly by Japanese and American trade groups, seems to be aimed at staving off sanctions. **********\"We have agreed that we'd like to avoid any unfortunate consquences,\" said Shinichi Itoh, an executive with the NEC Corporation and one of the negotiators of the agreement for the Electronic Industries Association of Japan. A Way to Avoid the Deadline **********But the agreement could also provide a way to postpone the end-of-the-year deadline. If the Japanese companies diligently try to carry out the new measures and the foreign market share improves, it is likely that the American companies will not push for sanctions even if their market share falls a bit short of 20 percent by the deadline. **********Many times in the past, American companies have applauded some trade agreements only to see the expected results fail to materialize. In the case of semiconductors, the 20 percent goal was first expected to be achieved by 1991 under a 1986 trade agreement. When that failed, a new trade agreement was signed in 1991 putting the deadline at the end of this year. **********There is also the possibility that the emergency program may provide a one-time benefit that does not lead to long-term gains in market share. For instance, a Japanese company could buy a year's worth of foreign chips in six months and stockpile the extras. **********The large Japanese companies, in general, already buy 20 percent of their chips from foreign companies. American companies have complained that the smaller companies do not buy as many. Nevertheless, the larger companies are being called on now to increase their purchases even more, in part because they have the capacity to do so and also because they would stand to lose the most from sanctions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/20/business/wall-street-advisers-who-stretch-the-truth.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Antilla", "pub_date": "1992-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1002, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wall Street; Advisers Who Stretch the Truth", "print_headline": "Wall Street; Advisers Who Stretch the Truth", "body_text": " **********Everybody knows that tough times can cause people to fall for some pretty wacky claims.

A few of the truth-stretchers who sell trading advice, money-management and investment newsletters are downright talented when it comes to making money. So you have to wonder why, for example, a guy with a 406 percent short-term gain would feel compelled to inflate that to 14,700 percent. **********That was the case with trading results of Bert Dohmen, a Honolulu investment adviser whose ads touting the \"Dohmen Double Profit System\" gush about Mr. Dohmen's excellent record trading his own accounts. \"An account I entered in a trading championship contest (with real money) gained over 14,700 percent in less than eight months using OEX options. Yes, it's true,\" the ad said. **********Well, not quite true. Or at least a tad misleading. Mr. Dohmen did perform spectacularly in the United States Investing Championship in February 1987, gaining 406 percent by the time the contest ended that May 31, according to the contest coordinator, Norm Zadeh. What Mr. Dohmen didn't make quite clear in the ad is that he didn't gain 14,700 percent during the four months of the competition. \"It doesn't refer to the number of the trading championship,\" Mr. Dohmen said. A \"significant gain\" was made before the contest began, he added, and that's why his numbers are bigger than those that can be verified by Mr. Zadeh. **********Advisers like Mr. Dohmen like to include trading contest results in their advertising because the audited performance of a public contest has more credibility with investors than the advisers' own claims. **********Aiding and abetting advisers in truth-stretching are the cagey direct mail outfits that write the breathless pitch copy to sell their trading \"systems,\" investment newsletters and other trading wares. One promotional package sent through the mail to sell the \"Grandmaster Thrust\" system of the trader Emil Van Essen boasted of a 501.6 percent gain after two months in Mr. Zadeh's contest. But Mr. Van Essen's account really gained only 83.6 percent in the first two months, said Mr. Zadeh, and then fell back to a 39 percent gain after eight months in the contest. In the end, Mr. Van Essen failed to report any profit at all, Mr. Zadeh said. **********Mr. Van Essen, whose photograph, life history and claims of genius at the game of chess are among nuggets in the mailing, said, \"That is not my advertising.\" The direct mail \"was Windsor Books' deal,\" he said. **********It took a while to find Steve Schmidt, president of Windsor Books, because his Brightwaters, L.I., company has an unpublished phone number. When finally reached, though, Mr. Schmidt said the 501.6 percent claim was a typographical error that has been corrected to 83.6 percent for future mailings. (The 501.6 percent figure was attained by annualizing two-month performance.) Mr. Schmidt said he was not aware of the decline in Mr. Van Essen's performance after the 83.6 percent two-month gain. **********Windsor Books has also disclosed only part of the story. A promotion for the trader Joe Duffy (whose instructions are \"like having a pair of loaded dice,\" according to the direct mail piece) boasted of annualized gains of 432 percent, 121 percent and 243 percent in Mr. Zadeh's four-month contest. Mr. Zadeh objects to Windsor's annualizing of performance when investors have no assurance that the good four-month record could be kept up for a full year. Mr. Duffy pointed out that the ad did disclose that the returns had been annualized. But the impression is left that he actually achieved those results. \"That's right,\" the copy reads. \"My worst performance was a 121 percent return.\" **********Investors have only one way of knowing whether the ads they read are accurate, and that's by checking with the source cited. Mark Hulbert of Hulbert Financial Digest, which publishes performance results of investment newsletter writers (page 14), said writers make all sorts of mischief with his numbers. A favorite trick is to take a bow as \"No. 1 with Hulbert\" by ignoring all the Hulbert-rated newsletters that did better and listing the ones that did worse. Along with the selective competition trick is the selective time period ploy that the Windsor clients used.

Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs told Henry A.

But more questions are being asked about what happened to those who might have survived the war, only to disappear later, especially in Laos. The numbers are not large, perhaps 40 to 80 especially compelling cases. But officials no longer deny that there were men left behind, only that they were never knowingly abandoned. **********Pressed for explanations for seeming American inaction in forcing a better accounting of prisoners from Hanoi, Mr. Kissinger angrily turned the tables on his questioners, charging Congress, the antiwar movement and the press with hobbling the Administration in talks with the North Vietnamese. **********\"In response to my presentations, Le Duc Tho disdainfully read me editorials from the American press and speeches from the Congressional Record,\" Mr. Kissinger told the committee. \"His message was clear: I understand what you are saying but I also know that you have no way to back up your threats.\" 'Bad and Cynical History' **********To take away the power to deal with Hanoi, and then blame the Nixon Administration for not getting a full accounting of prisoners, was \"straight from Kafka,\" Mr. Kissinger said. **********\"While it may make good theater, it is bad and cynical history.\" **********But some of Mr. Kissinger's contemporaries, including two former Defense Secretaries, Melvin R. Laird and James R. Schlesinger, remembered how the secrecy that surrounded the Nixon-Kissinger team helped poison the atmosphere of government and the Administration's credibility in the country. **********There were secret peace talks behind the facade of open negotiations with Hanoi, and meetings with Vietnamese leaders that Nixon Cabinet members did not know about. There was the secret bombing of Cambodia, which outraged Congress unnecessarily, Mr. Laird said. **********The mood of one tortured year, 1973, has been recalled repeatedly in hearings to illuminate the confusions and passions that surrounded the collapse of the American war in Indochina. **********In early 1973, Mr. Schlesinger, then Director of Central Intelligence before becoming Secretary of Defense, was spending 70 to 80 percent of his time in Congress dealing with allegations of C.I.A. involvement in the Watergate scandal, he told the committee.

Turkey's population is overwhelmingly Muslim, but it has been led by secular governments since the modern Turkish republic was founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923. **********Islamic Holy War took responsibility for bomb explosions that killed an American serviceman and crippled an Egyptian diplomat last October.

(As part of its continuing \"Putting quality on the road\" campaign, by McCann-Erickson, General Motors ran three spots telling consumers that G.M. had \"heard your demands\" for quality.) **********The ad critics were also lukewarm about three commercials, from Leo Burnett U.S.A., for the Seven-Up Company, which paired the red Spot character in recent campaigns for 7Up and Diet 7Up with the brands' famous \"uncola\" slogan. **********\"Three un-commercials,\" Mr. Reiman said. \"They talked about Diet Pepsi and Diet Coke more than about Diet 7Up, so they didn't sell the product.\" **********Still, Ms. DiSesa put it, \"The worst commercial was better than the halftime show.\" In fact, the halftime entertainment was such a bore -- a salute to snow -- that CBS pulled national ads from the show fearing, correctly as it turned out, that viewers were switching to a stunt on the Fox network. **********Of the ad highlights, one was a 60-second Nike commercial by Wieden & Kennedy Inc., called \"Hare Jordan/ Air Jordan,\" that teamed an animated Bugs Bunny with a live Michael Jordan in a wacky basketball game against four miscreants. **********\"I hate saying, 'They do it again,' but they did,\" Mr. Atlas said, referring to the Nike slogan, \"Just do it.\" The spot finished first in USA Today's fourth annual Ad Meter survey, in which 60 residents of the Detroit area were asked to rate the ads they liked and disliked. **********There was also the reappearance of an old favorite: the arty, yet hard-selling, Master Lock commercial. For the third consecutive year, Cramer-Krasselt ran a 30-second spot in which opera music was played over shots of thieves who tried, and failed, to destroy Master Lock locks. **********And, blessedly, for the first time since Super Bowl XXIII in 1989, viewers were spared the Bud Bowl, a goofy scrimmage between tiny animated bottles of Budweiser and Bud Light beers. **********Though a Bud Bowl IV score was announced -- for the record, Budweiser beat Bud Light, 27-24 -- two spots by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles ignored the action in favor of showing a mishap-plagued consumer searching for a Bud Bowl sweepstakes ticket. **********The bottles might not be gone for good, though. Tom Sharbaugh, vice president of Budweiser brands at Anheuser-Busch Inc., said yesterday that, yes, Bud Bowl would make a comeback next January. **********Make-believe football games seemed much on the mind of Anheuser's executives. In another spot for Budweiser, $1.8 million was spent on animating pieces of paper to a compelling illusion of football players of the past and present playing a lightning-fast game atop a bar. **********The advertising executives enjoyed two commercials by Burnett for the McDonald's Corporation, which replaced the fast-food chain's two most recent slogans, \"McDonald's today\" and \"Food, folks & fun,\" with a plain-talking theme: \"What you want is what you get.\" **********The McDonald's spots \"focused on basic values and touched an emotional chord,\" Ms. Hersh said. Ms. DiSesa echoed her approval: \"I know I was being manipulated, but sometimes, if you're manipulated well, you don't mind.\" **********It appeared that CBS was wise to manipulate the ad lineup during halftime. Overnight ratings from A. C. Nielsen showed that the Fox stunt, a live episode of its \"In Living Color\" series, sponsored by Frito-Lay's Doritos tortilla chips, attracted a strong 18.3 rating and a 27 share, compared with a 33.2 rating and 49 share for the halftime show. (The game itself in the overnight ratings drew a 40.4 rating and a 60 share.) **********Each rating point represented 431,151 households in 25 markets; the share is the percentage of homes with televisions tuned in to the program."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/23/business/givebacks-by-chevron-in-oil-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1992-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1065, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Givebacks By Chevron In Oil Deal", "print_headline": "Givebacks By Chevron In Oil Deal", "body_text": " **********As new details come to light, it appears that the Chevron Corporation's oil venture in Kazakhastan, hailed as a breakthrough for foreign investment in the former Soviet Union, will be much less lucrative for Chevron than the deal that the company had negotiated with the Soviet Union before Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Government disintegrated. **********Government officials from Kazakhstan, in interviews since the agreement was signed in Washington on Monday, have credited two investment advisers hired last fall -- the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and the Government of Oman -- with guiding them in negotiating a much tougher agreement than they could have managed on their own, given their inexperience in making commercial deals.  Evaluating the Property **********\"Our advisers valued the fields and set up satisfactory terms last February,\" Kalyk Abdulayev, Kazakhstan's Deputy Prime Minister and chief negotiator in the Chevron talks, said in New York yesterday. \"It was only after February that we could have serious talks.\" **********The agreement makes Chevron and the Kazakhstan Government 50-50 partners in developing the Tengiz oilfield, one of the world's largest. Some of the terms might serve as precedents for giant oil deals that Exxon, British Petroleum, Texaco, Marathon and other oil companies are seeking, principally in Siberia. No other area in the world has so much untapped oil as Russia and Kazakhstan, but until this week's Chevron agreement, only small foreign ventures, involving less than $30 million apiece, had been undertaken. **********\"The Chevron deal is a tough one financially, but where else in the world can you find nearly nine billion barrels of recoverable oil,\" said John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, explaining why Chevron eventually backed down from its original demands. \"It is another Alaska, and the oil is already discovered.\" The Gorbachev Deal **********Among other things, Chevron had persuaded the Gorbachev Government last year to give the San Francisco-based company 28 percent of the profits from the venture. The Kazakhstan Government, in a compromise, agreed to pay Chevron 20 percent of the profit, after taxes. Earlier this year it demanded that Chevron accept less than 15 percent -- responding in part to press criticism in Russia and Kazakhstan that Chevron was seeking too much. **********The 80 percent going to Kazakhstan is high on the international scale of payments to governments in oil ventures with foreign companies. The range is 85 percent to Britain in North Sea ventures down to 65 percent in East Asia. **********In addition, Kazakhstan officials said Chevron had agreed to make \"substantially higher\" up-front payments than the company had envisioned, the main one being a $400 million deposit that was not publicly announced after the signing ceremony on Monday. **********The announced terms called for Chevron to invest $750 million over the first three years and $10 billion over the 25-year life of the agreement, and for Kazakhstan to invest an identical amount. The announcement did not mention the extra $400 million, to be deposited probably in January; the money is to be used by Kazakhstan to help pay its $10 billion investment share. Making Tradeoffs **********Kazakhstan will not be required to repay the $400 million. The money is in effect compensation for another unannounced provision, one that favors Chevron, Kazakhstan officials and their advisers said. The entire Tengiz field, roughly as rich as Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, is to become the property of the joint-venture company, Tengizchevroil, once the company is formed, probably in January. **********That means Chevron will immediately get revenue from the 60,000 barrels a day currently coming from the field -- a flow that gives Kazakhstan more than $1 million a day, at the current price of about $18 a barrel for crude oil. The granting of revenue from existing production -- a departure from the half-dozen other small joint-venture oil agreements in the Commonwealth of Independent States -- was a longtime Chevron demand, one that assured the company of an immediate return on investment, Kazakhstan officials said. **********Chevron officials declined to comment on the various disclosures by Kazakhstan officials. \"I cannot confirm or deny reports about the structure of the deal,\" Daniel Johnson, a Chevron spokesman, said. **********The publicly disclosed agreement was also silent on another $400 million payment that Chevron will make to Kazakhstan in the mid-1990's, to help reimburse the Government for a pipeline to be built to a port city. **********Kazakhstan now sends oil through a pipeline to a refinery in Russia, but the pipeline can handle less than 200,000 barrels a day, and the Tengiz field is expected to produce up to 700,000 barrels a day, or almost as much as Chevron's current worldwide output of one million barrels a day. Negotiations Shifted **********Chevron has been trying for more than two years to land the Tengiz field, and early last summer reached a tentative agreement with the Gorbachev Government, only to find the negotiations shifted to Alma Ata, the Kazakhstan capital, as the Soviet Union disintegrated. The documents involved in the Gorbachev agreement were also sent to Alma Ata. **********\"After receiving them, we decided that we could not negotiate a satisfactory deal without reputable advisers,\" Mr. Abdulayev said, referring to Morgan Guaranty officials, among them Suresh Chugh, an Indian-born managing director and oil expert. Oman was selected in part because like Kazakhstan it is an oil-rich nation with a large Muslim population. **********To put pressure on Chevron, Kazakhstan officials threatened early this year to open the Tengiz field to bids from other oil companies, but Mr. Abdulayev said his Government's real goal was to work with Chevron -- in part because a new bidder would spend a year in duplicating feasibility studies already completed by Chevron and in part because Chevron had proved its skill in recovering and processing oil with a high sulfur content, the type found in Kazakhstan. **********\"We would not have approached another company until we received a final rejection from Chevron,\" Mr. Abdulayev said. \"But we were prepared to do so.\" **********Neither Chevron nor Kazakhstan officials would give details of the oil price projections that they used to justify a total investment of $20 billion over 25 years. But Mr. Lichtblau said the two sides were undoubtedly counting on a steadily rising price to cover the high costs of drilling as many as 600 wells, 10 times the current number, and producing an adequate profit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/30/world/conflict-in-the-balkans-un-votes-to-send-troops-to-reopen-sarajevo-airport.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1992-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 718, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

The first units are expected to reach the airport this week. **********If the current cease-fire holds, diplomats say, regular relief flights could also arrive this week; the Canadians would then escort supply convoys into Sarajevo and distribute the goods. **********One of two French transport planes waiting at Split, Croatia, landed at Sarajevo today with a cargo of humanitarian supplies, and three more are ready to fly directly from Paris. U.S. Offers Planes **********The United States has also offered to provide aircraft to ferry in supplies but it remains unclear when these would be able to start flying. The current plans call for the Canadian soldiers to return to Croatia in a couple of weeks and to be replaced by three smaller battalions of 400 to 500 men each from France, Egypt and probably Ukraine. **********The relief effort was put into motion after the Security Council was told that Serbian forces, under pressure from a Council ultimatum last Friday, were abandoning the airport and starting to redeploy their weapons in designated areas under United Nations supervision. The Council had called on Serbian and Bosnian forces to stop fighting and to start placing their heavy weapons under United Nations supervision within 48 hours or face the threat of military action. **********But the Council also warned today that if fighting starts up again, it may take \"other measures\" to secure the delivery of humanitarian supplies to the Bosnian capital -- an apparent reference to the telephone talks President Bush held with Security Council members over the weekend on possibly resupplying the city by military force.  Serbs Feel the Pinch **********The Council's action also followed President Francois Mitterrand's surprise visit to Sarajevo on Sunday, which helped focus international attention on the fate of the more than 300,000 civilians trapped under increasingly desperate conditions. **********The European Community also warned on Saturday that it might authorize military force to get relief supplies into the city. **********In Belgrade, United Nations trade sanctions have started to bite, sending living costs soaring, and opposition groups have organized demonstrations for the first time against President Slobodan Milosevic's dream of a Greater Serbia carved out of the wreckage of the former Yugoslav federation. **********In a message to the Security Council, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said \"Serb forces have begun withdrawing from the airport and both sides have begun the process of concentrating their heavy weapons\" in locations to be supervised by the United Nations. He said that although \"an absolute cease-fire has not been reached,\" the United Nations \"must seize the opportunity offered by these developments.\" **********The resolution adopted today also recognized the precariousness of the situation by appealing to both sides not to seek \"any military advantage\" -- a reference to fears that Bosnian forces might see the Serbian withdrawal from the airport as an opportunity to expand the territory they control. **********The leader of the Serbs who have besieged the airport for the past 12 weeks, Radovan Karadzic, warned on Belgrade radio that his troops would not permit relief planes to land if the opposing forces tried to take control of it from the United Nations. **********In London Lord Carrington, the former British Foreign Secretary, who is mediating on behalf of the European Community, said he planned to visit Sarajevo as soon as the airport was open to talk to local leaders. He also said he wanted to reconvene peace talks on Bosnia and Herzegovina in London as soon as possible.  Next Steps Unclear **********Just what kind of military action the United Nations might authorize to get supplies into Sarajevo if the resolution today cannot be enforced is unclear. But diplomats reported that in his telephone conversations over the weekend with other leaders, President Bush discussed the possibility of having the Council authorize countries to provide air cover that would attack any local militia that opposed United Nations forces reopening the airport."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/12/business/making-a-difference-trading-in-saab-for-opel.html": {"writer_name": "Ferdinand Protzman", "pub_date": "1992-07-12", "snippet": "DAVID J.

HERMAN found himself with a tough act to follow last week when he was named chairman and managing director of Adam Opel A.G., the German subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation. While the parent company has been posting monumental losses, Opel has prospered over the last few years under the leadership of Louis R. Hughes, who was made president of General Motors Europe on April 6. **********But tough assignments seem to be Mr. Herman's stock in trade. Before coming to Opel, for example, the 46-year-old Mr. Herman was the first president and chief executive of Saab Automobile AB, a joint venture created in December 1989 when Saab-Scania AB sold a half interest in its troubled automotive division to G.M. **********Mr. Herman, a native of New York City who has been with G.M. since 1973, led Saab through one of its toughest periods. Working closely with the Swedish company's strong unions, he initiated a wide-ranging program of cost-cutting that is expected to reduce Saab's payroll by 33 percent over the next three years. At the same time, the company began an ambitious program to develop new car models, the first of which are scheduled to appear next year. **********Despite those efforts, progress has been slow. Saab Automobile posted a first-quarter loss of $49.8 million this year. While that was a marked improvement from the loss of $174 million in the first quarter of 1991, it was far more red ink than was reported for the final quarter of the year, when the company lost $24.3 million. **********Opel is much healthier. But Mr. Herman, who speaks German and Russian and is a graduate of Harvard Law School, joins the company at a time when the European auto market's growth is fairly tepid and competition is tougher than ever. **********To keep itself in the game, Opel announced in May that it would cut nearly 20 percent of the work force over the next five years at its headquarters plant in Russelsheim, where it builds such popular models as the Vectra and the top-of-the-line Senator. And in June, Opel said its 1991 profits fell 19 percent despite a 15 percent rise in sales.

The sale, with savings that average 25 to 35 percent, was immediately matched by Continental Airlines. United Airlines and American Airlines pledged they would be competitive with Delta's special, and Northwest said it was studying Delta's announcement. **********American, apparently wanting to end the day as a leader rather than a follower, said it would discount its lowest fares to the Caribbean, the Bahamas and Bermuda this fall by up to 30 percent, expanding a domestic promotion it introduced last Friday. Again, some competitors matched the discounts, and others said they were studying them. Slow Seasons for the Industry **********The moves by American and Delta are neither unusual nor entirely unexpected. Last November, Delta nearly tripled the number of European cities it serves when it acquired routes from Pan American World Airways, and it is eager to build its identity as a foreign carrier. **********The fall and winter are typically slower seasons for the industry, which is clamoring for ways to bounce back from heavy losses in the second quarter, when Delta posted a loss of $180.2 million. American Airlines also regularly offers specials on flights to the Caribbean. **********The specials, however, continue the dizzying pace of sales trumpeted by the leading airlines recently, including a brief sale started on Friday by Continental that ended yesterday. Last week, Delta offered a 30 percent discount for domestic flights from mid-September to mid-December, a move matched by a few rivals. At the same time, Delta also said it would raise its fares by 5 percent when the sale ends Aug. 31. **********The American and Delta specials are also the first forays into international pricing deals for tourist fares since 50 percent discounts were offered in late May and early June. Industry analysts describe the latest changes as minor compared with the half-off discounts that exhausted travel agents and battered airline profits. **********The most recent discounts are expected to generate less excitement, partly because the discounts are not as deep. Also, the 50 percent sale attracted passengers who might otherwise have waited until later in the year to fly. \"They are of the skirmish variety rather than an all-out attack,\" said Edmund S. Greenslet, publisher of The Airline Monitor, an industry newsletter. Holiday Restrictions **********The Delta fares, if approved by Government regulators, would be available from Aug. 5 through Sept. 4 for trips from Oct. 1 to March 31. The nonrefundable fares require a stay of 7 to 30 days. The discounts cannot be used for flights to Europe or Israel that depart in the week before Christmas Eve or return in the week after New Year's Day. **********American's tickets to the Caribbean must be purchased by Aug. 31 for travel from Sept. 14 through Dec. 14. **********At first glance, the latest fare moves appear to complicate the simplified structure introduced by American Airlines in early April and widely copied by competing carriers. The airlines have bet that reducing the previous Byzantine structure of discounts to just four classes of fares in most markets will lure more travelers with the promise of fair pricing and less confusion. **********The airlines seem aware that their messages may sound mixed. Some airlines have been quick to note that recent changes in domestic prices have fallen within the four-tier framework of first-class, unrestricted and two advance-purchase fares. The airlines have signaled that they would like to see the new structure stick, as it holds out the promise of stabilized revenues and consistent profits, a combination that has long eluded the loss-plagued airline industry.  More Variations **********Because international pricing is set in part by foreign governments, flights abroad were not included in the price-simplification effort. Fewer levels of fares existed before the changes in April, but more variations have remained in place since. **********On the domestic front, Mr. Greenslet and others say they believe the four-tier structure will hold in most markets, especially as the industry consolidates. But they also say sales in competitive markets are inevitable. \"There will always be exceptions here and there from time to time,\" Mr. Greenslet said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/02/business/company-news-966792.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS", "body_text": " **********INTEGRA FINANCIAL CORP., Pittsburgh, completed the acquisition of Landmark Savings Association, Pittsburgh, in a stock conversion transaction.

One awards organization was curious enough to seek an answer. **********The New York Festivals, which annually presents awards to international television commercials, has inaugurated a Consumers' Choice Award. At its initial presentation, at the organization's 34th annual awards banquet in Manhattan on Friday, the winner was a humorous spot for DHL Worldwide Courier, created by Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in Sydney, Australia. **********It turned out that the same spot, in which a cat connives to get DHL to ship a noisy parakeet to Siberia, also won the 1991 Grand Award for best commercial from the ad executives who served as the organization's judges. In fact, the consumers and the ad professionals also agreed on their choice for second place, a whimsical spot created by Hunt Lascaris TBWA in Johannesburg for Nashau color copiers, in which a boy hands out valentines, inscribed, \"I love only you,\" to every girl in school. **********\"I was expecting some overlapping, but it was a surprise to me they came in exactly the same,\" said Marcio M. Moreira, chairman of the judges, who is also vice chairman and chief creative officer-international at McCann-Erickson Worldwide. **********The award was Mr. Moreira's idea. \"Consumers are what the game is all about,\" he said. \"Who in the world sets out to write advertising for their peers?\" When it was suggested that those who want to win awards from their peers do that, he replied, \"That's irresponsible.\" **********To determine the consumer award's winner, Audits & Surveys Inc., a market research firm, was hired to canvass 202 people in four cities: Buenos Aires, London, New York and Sydney. They were shown the 12 gold-medal winners that the judges scored highest from more than 4,000 initial entries. **********\"Researchers look for consistencies and confluences,\" said Solomon Dutka, chairman and chief executive of Audits & Surveys. \"So I was pleased.\" He praised Mr. Moreira \"for saying, 'Let's stop talking to ourselves.

The professionals, he added, favored well-crafted spots, like one by BBDO Worldwide in New York, in which celebrities from Tiny Tim to Jerry Lewis sing a Diet Pepsi jingle. **********Next year, Mr. Moreira said, he would like the organization to expand the consumer participation to at least 10 cities worldwide. **********\"It's a learning tool and a lesson,\" he added. \"Sometimes, something is so cleverly done that only we in the industry get excited by it.\" **********Three more Grand Awards were presented by the ad professionals. Burnett won for best television campaign, for three spots in a long-running series of offbeat commercials for Cheer detergent. GGK London won for best creative and production achievement, for three animated spots featuring human-like animals for the Electricity Association.

[ Pages D6 and D15. ] **********Nervous that the sluggish economy could hurt their election chances this November, the White House and many Congressional Republicans and Democrats have in recent weeks urged the Federal Reserve to cut rates again. They repeatedly said that one reason the weak recovery that began last spring petered out last fall was that the Fed had moved too slowly to lower rates. **********\"This being a Presidential election year might explain why the Fed didn't want to run the risk of doing nothing, because that could abort the recovery,\" said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist, at the PNC Financial Corporation, a Pittsburgh-based bank holding company. \"But at the same time, the Fed might have learned something from what happened last year.\" **********The cuts in the funds rate could help bring down rates for consumer loans, adjustable-rate mortgages and loans to companies as banks pass on to consumers the lower rates they pay for money. **********\"Today's cut in the Federal funds rate implies a reduction in short-term interest rates across the board,\" said Hugh Johnson, chief economist for the First Albany Corporation, a New York-based brokerage. **********Economists also said that a small increase of two-tenths of a percent in March producer prices that was announced today helped pave the way for the rate cut by reducing fears that inflation would ignite as the economy grows. **********And some analysts speculated that an aim of today's action was to calm domestic investors shaken by the effect on American markets of Japan's plunging stocks. But a Fed spokesman said, \"The Japanese stock market had nothing to do with today's action.\" **********Over the last two months, the Administration and many economists have voiced optimism that a recovery is taking hold based on a pickup in retail sales and housing starts. But analysts said today that the Fed had apparently become alarmed when it discovered that for the second straight week the money supply had fallen sharply. Economists say the Fed is concerned that the weak money supply numbers could push up interest rates and hamper the already fragile recovery. Money Supply Cited **********\"The primary motivation in my view was their increasing worry about the weakness in the money supply,\" said Robert Giordano, chief economist for Goldman, Sachs. \"It's really the Fed's need to demonstrate that they're on the job more than a genuine sign that the weakness in the money supply means the recovery was in deep danger.\" **********Today, the Fed reported a sharp $7 billion drop last week in the most closely watched measure of the money supply, which followed an even steeper drop of more than $10 billion the previous week. **********Economists said the central bank was no doubt also concerned about the lack of growth in employment in March that the Labor Department reported last Friday. **********The Fed's most recent rate cuts came last Dec. 20, when it drastically lowered the Federal funds rate and the discount rate -- the rate at which it lends money to banks. It lowered the discount rate a full percentage point, to 3 1/2 percent, from 4 1/2 percent, and the Fed funds rate by a half percentage point, to 4 percent from 4 1/2 percent.  Some Added Insurance **********In recent months, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, has often said he thought the cuts announced on Dec. 20 would be enough to insure a recovery, but today's move signaled that the Fed had become convinced that some additional insurance was needed to protect the recovery. **********\"It is a preventive, pre-emptive move to support this fledgling recovery,\" said Mr. Sinai, the economist. \"The danger that another failure in the recovery would have to confidence, psychology, the economy and world markets is great.\" **********Today's move could also strengthen the American economy by helping to weaken the dollar and thus spur exports, economists said. Lower interest rates discourage demand for dollars, but a weaker dollar then encourages foreign purchases of United States goods. The export sector has been one of the strongest sectors in the economy, but economic slowdowns in Europe and Japan are threatening export growth. **********Some economists also suggest that today's move was designed to help Japan's central bank lower interest rates further to buoy Tokyo's falling equity markets. The Fed's rate cut reduces fears in Japan that the yen will plunge if the Japanese central bank cuts rates. **********\"For a whole bunch of reasons,\" said Mr. Hoffman, the economist, \"the Fed decided to take out another insurance premium in the form of lower rates.\" Meeting in March **********Economists said today's move was probably approved at the March 31 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the central monetary policy group composed of the seven members of the Federal Reserve board and five presidents of Federal Reserve districts. **********The central bank does not announce changes in the Federal funds rate, but the Fed added money to the banking system this morning, making clear that it was cutting that rate. **********Some economists said it was understandable that the Fed would insist that today's move had nothing to do with Japan's markets. They said that if today's rate cut was construed as trying to support domestic markets -- which would be a highly unusual move for the Fed -- some investors might say the Fed must think the situation was extraordinarily grave. **********In addition, if the Fed's move wasviewed as seeking to buoy American markets against Japan's shocks and if the American markets continued to fall, then it would appear the Fed was weak and had wasted its ammunition.                    --------------------       Canadians Cut Prime **********TORONTO, April 9 (Special to The New York Times) -- Three major Canadian banks announced today that they were cutting their prime rate by one-quarter percentage point, as the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, signaled further relaxation of its monetary policy. **********The Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Bank of Nova Scotia said they were dropping the rate they charge their most creditworthy customers to 8 percent, from 8 1/4 percent, where it has been since early March. **********The Bank of Canada set its bank rate today at 7.21 percent, down from 7.41 percent last week and the lowest since Jan. 23. This rate is set each week one-quarter percentage point above the average yield on 90-day Treasury bills sold at auction to financial institutions. **********\"These moves are designed to address economic weakness,\" said Robert Palombi, economist with MMS International, \"and could alleviate some of the selling pressure in the stock market.\" **********Toronto stocks have been depressed in recent weeks by uncertainties related to the real estate and resources empire of Olympia & York Developments Ltd., which is expected to present a plan to restructure its debts at a meeting of nearly 100 creditors in Toronto on Monday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/24/business/company-news-barclays-plans-3000-additional-layoffs-by-1995.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BARCLAYS PLANS 3,000 ADDITIONAL LAYOFFS BY 1995", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; BARCLAYS PLANS 3,000 ADDITIONAL LAYOFFS BY 1995", "body_text": " **********Barclays Bank P.L.C. said yesterday that it plans to lay off 3,000 additional staff in the next three years, raising expected staff cuts to 18,000 by 1995.

Bill Clinton principally by ideology. They wanted to understand the approach each candidate would take to solve the nation's problems.

And if leadership is the issue, Mr. Bush can still win. **********To understand which candidate is the better leader, the public will be paying special attention to the way each candidate advances his agenda. But agendas -- like elections -- do not take place in a vacuum; each candidate must also define the context for his agenda. **********Mr. Bush's mistake has been to advance his agenda defensively. That sends the wrong message. Instead, he must reassert the positive approach he took when he first energized the country by talking about the thousand points of light. **********Mr. Bush should should use the turbulence in the world to set the context in which he will lead. He must make the electorate understand that against the backdrop of civil war in the former Yugoslavia, chaos in the former Soviet Union, the civil war in Somalia and the struggle for peace in the Middle East, the United States looks strong, healthy and stable. He must also get the message out that compared with those of our trading partners, the American economy -- with all its problems -- still looks good. **********In his ads and in tomorrow's debate, Mr. Bush should demonstrate that the countries his opponents have cited as models for the United States have deep-seated problems of their own. Japan, which has been lauded for its economic growth, is mired in a deep recession, coupled with a real estate and stock market collapse. And America's productivity is higher than Japan's. Mr. Bush's opponents point to Germany, where government and business work hand in glove. The President should point out that Germany is also in the midst of a recession with sky-high interest rates and creeping inflation -- problems already encountered here and solved. **********Mr. Bush should tell voters that Europe, the continent his opponents warn may surpass the United States in wealth and influence, has seen its currency system unwind, its unification plans put on hold and its economies slow down. For emphasis, he could point to Sweden, with its liberal social-welfare state, and tell Americans that last month, Sweden's short-term interest rates hit 500 percent. **********In the final days of the campaign, Mr. Bush must carefully draw a distinction between a strong America with real but solvable problems -- his context -- and an America in chaos, his opponents' vision. **********There are four additional tactics President Bush must embrace to present himself as a leader: *********** Credentials. Mr. Bush must make the voters feel that neither Mr. Clinton nor Mr. Perot has the credentials to be President. To do that, Mr. Bush must reintroduce himself as the candidate with world-class leadership experience. *********** Taxes. This is the breadbasket issue that will persuade most Americans. Rather than making pledges about not raising taxes, Mr. Bush must focus on the cost of Mr. Clinton's plans. He must also convey to the voters the terrible cost of Mr. Perot's deficit-reduction reforms. Unless Mr. Bush takes the offensive on taxes, many of those who voted Republican in 1988 will stray from the fold next month. *********** The cold war. Mr. Bush must warn the voters that the cold war is not over. He must tell them that unless there is a new Marshall Plan, the old Communist Party and military establishment could regain power in the former Soviet republics and other Eastern European countries. Rather than taking credit for having won the cold war, Mr. Bush should talk about how to prevent Eastern Europe from returning to totalitarianism. *********** Endorsements. Mr. Bush should turn his attention away from photo opportunities showing him eating tacos or kielbasa in favor of addressing at least one public policy group a week between now and the election. **********No Doubt, Mr. Clinton will continue to project a vision emphasizing the generational differences between himself and Mr. Bush, invoking the Democrat's Roosevelt-Kennedy legacy and emphasizing his plans to improve competitiveness. But it will be a formidable challenge for him to raise his stature beyond the domestic context. **********Tomorrow's debate has set the stage for Mr. Bush's breakthrough.

Now those prices look extremely generous because of an unexpected drop in utilities' own costs. **********The Cuomo administration is seeking a repeal of the law. But the industry that the law helped to create, independent power production, is lobbying hard to keep its provisions, at least for the time being. Changing Conditions **********The conflict illustrates the pitfalls of long-term energy policy, with a law enacted at a time of high fuel prices and perceived shortages creating unexpected problems a decade later, after the energy market took an unexpected turn toward cheaper, more abundant supplies. **********The law was meant to incubate small projects that use \"renewable\" fuels or that use oil and gas efficiently. It promised entrepreneurs who built generating stations that they could sell to utilities for a minimum price of 6 cents a kilowatt-hour. The utilities would then resell the electricity to their own customers. **********The Consolidated Edison Company, which won its first rate increase in a decade in April, said one reason it needed to charge more was the expense of buying power from independent generators, even though its peak demand for power was falling. **********The recession and an unexpected dip in fuel costs have left New York with a surplus of electricity and produced a crash in the wholesale price. Consequently, the utilities now say that they are required to pay 6 cents for power from the independents that they could make themselves for 3. **********\"We're being locked into contracts well above market levels,\" said Richard M. Flynn, the chairman of the New York Power Authority, who has been lobbying for a repeal. \"The law was enacted back in 1981, and it was a different world in those days. We projected then that electricity prices would continue to rise.\" **********Carol E. Murphy, the executive director of the Independent Power Producers of New York, a lobbying group in Albany, acknowledged that future projects should not be guaranteed 6 cents. But if existing contracts were abrogated, she said, no one would ever build another independent plant in New York. And the new plants are cleaner than the cheaper older ones owned by utilities, she said. **********Still, the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, which serves a huge area of upstate New York, says that its deals with the independents will cost its customers an extra $3 billion. Customers of Con Edison, which serves New York City and most of Westchester, may pay $1 billion more and customers of the Long Island Lighting Company may pay $500 million, by those companies' estimates. **********About 1,900 megawatts of independent power production is now on line, with another 4,700 megawatts under contract, according to Ms. Murphy, at a cost of about $10.6 billion. The total capacity of these plants is roughly 10 times the size of the abandoned Shoreham nuclear plant.  Demand Is Down **********One reason for the utilities' saying that the cost is excessive is that the demand for power is stable or shrinking because of the recession and because of aggressive promotion of conservation by utilities. **********If demand was rising, then the choice would be between new capacity built by the utilities or by the independent producers. But the utilities say that currently if it were not for distortions of the energy market caused by public policy, no new capacity would have to be built at all.  Ms. Murphy, speaking for the independent producers, said \"what we have here is a very temporary energy glut.\" She added, \"If you assume that some part of the utility system is going to have to be shut down or retired, the best guess of everyone is that we're going to need more power by the end of the century.\" **********Ms. Murphy's position is that the cost of complying with the Federal Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 will sharply raise the utilities' cost estimate of 3 cents a kilowatt-hour. She added that the public would probably be willing to pay a premium for cleaner power. \"If you ask people if they'd rather spend 6 cents for hydropower or 5 cents for a coal burner or a foreign-oil burner, most people would probably pick 6 cents,\" she said. **********Nearly 500 megawatts of the 8,500 megawatts of existing and planned capacity is hydroelectric. Most of the rest is fired by natural gas, often generating steam for industrial use along with electricity, raising total efficiency. Under a Federal law, the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978, such co-generators and generators using clean sources have a guaranteed market for their power with the utilities. **********Not everyone is convinced that the state contracts are such a bad deal for consumers. Another analyst, Christopher O. Ward, the assistant commissioner of energy policy and programs in New York City's Department of Telecommunications and Energy, said that the independent projects had another advantage, providing diversity of fuel in the electric system. He added that in utility planning, because of continuously changing circumstances, \"you can't not take a risk.\" Proposing Changes **********Mr. Flynn, however, said he would like a reorganized system for signing contracts, with the price not being set until late in the process, and a requirement that construction start soon after the contract is signed, to reduce the risk posed by changing conditions. **********For her part, Ms. Murphy said that without a firm price in hand, financing such a project would be impossible. The utilities, she said, have never liked independent generators, and Mr. Flynn, she added, wanted to scuttle the contracts in retaliation for the demise of his agency's contract to buy power from Hydro-Quebec. **********That contract was canceled as uneconomic earlier this year, an action the independent producers had lobbied for. Mr. Flynn said that just as the Hydro-Quebec contract had been canceled as uneconomic, other such contracts should be terminated."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/21/business/patents-coffee-percolator-that-s-disposable.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1992-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; Coffee Percolator That's Disposable", "print_headline": "Patents; Coffee Percolator That's Disposable", "body_text": " **********Kraft General Foods has patented an inexpensive, disposable coffee percolator that allows a person to brew a single cup of coffee in a microwave oven and then throw the percolator away.

A Blow by Compaq **********Separately, the Compaq Computer Corporation confirmed today that it was suspending plans to build a workstation based on a MIPS computer chip this year, and that it had resigned from the ACE consortium, which it was instrumental in forming a year ago. Compaq's withdrawal could be a death blow to the ACE group, because Compaq would have been the highest-volume manufacturer in the consortium. **********The Digital Equipment Corporation has also been backing away from ACE. **********Compaq said it would still make machines compatible with the standards developed by ACE, but that they would be based on chips from the Intel Corporation, the alternative to MIPS in ACE. Indeed, Intel appeared to be the big winner in today's announcements, reaffirming its position as the major volume supplier of microprocessors for desktop computing. Intel's Dominance Is Cited **********Silicon Graphics management \"is coming to realize that MIPS is not going to challenge Intel,\" said Mark Stahlman, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons in New York. \"The PC industry is an Intel-microprocessor-driven business,\" he said, \"and companies like Compaq are not going to jump ship and focus on another architecture.\" **********Mr. Stahlman said the renegotiated price reflected poor current results as well as weaker future prospects for MIPS. **********The new terms call for each share of MIPS common stock to be exchanged for 0.52 share of Silicon Graphics, an offer down 15 percent from the original exchange rate of 0.61 share. The value of Silicon Graphics shares have steadily declined since they were linked to MIPS, from $26.625 before the merger was announced, to $16, down 37.5 cents today on the New York Stock Exchange. **********MIPS closed at $7.875 today, down 12.5 cents, in over-the-counter trading. **********Edward R. McCracken, Silicon Graphics' president and chief executive, noted that there had been an average decline of 30 percent in all technology stocks during the last month. But he said the 15 percent reduction in Silicon Graphics' offer for MIPS reflected that chip maker's poor operating results in the most recent quarter and risks in coming quarters. **********\"The hidden jewel at MIPS is the technology,\" Mr. McCracken said. Silicon Graphics was MIPS's first customer and relies on MIPS's microprocessor designs for its work stations. \"If they'd had a good first quarter,\" he said, \"we'd have been very happy with the original terms.\" **********MIPS lost $12.7 million in the quarter ended March 31, in contrast to earnings of $624,000, or 2 cents a share, a year earlier. That was more than twice the loss expected by Wall Street analysts. **********In contrast, Silicon Graphics' earnings quadrupled, to $12 million, in the same period. **********Mr. McCracken said that many members remained strongly committed to ACE, but conceded that Compaq's withdrawal was evidence of declining interest by personal computer makers. \"It's an indication that the original objectives of ACE were perhaps too broad and sweeping,\" he said. **********Compaq said that it had indefinitely suspended plans for the MIPS-based machine for lack of customer interest."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/26/world/mao-s-cable-explains-drive-into-korea.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Faison", "pub_date": "1992-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mao's Cable Explains Drive Into Korea", "print_headline": "Mao's Cable Explains Drive Into Korea", "body_text": " **********The publication of a secret cable from Mao to Stalin in 1950 has provided the first documentary evidence of the Chinese leader's intentions in making the risky decision to enter the Korean War and engage American forces in combat. **********Answering questions that have haunted scholars for decades, the telegram and other documents that have recently been smuggled to the West lend support to the theory that Mao acted out of fear that an American victory in Korea would threaten China. The documents have also convinced historians that Stalin agreed to, and then abruptly canceled, a Chinese request for Soviet air cover during the attack. **********\"If we allow the United States to occupy all of Korea,\" Mao wrote in the Oct. 2, 1950, cable, \"Korean revolutionary power will suffer a fundamental defeat and the Americans will run more rampant and have negative effects for the entire Far East.\"  Threat of U.S. Bombing **********The cable explicitly recognized that the United States might bomb Chinese cities in retaliation for its entry into the war, but asserted that the destruction of the American forces in Korea was a goal worth the risks. **********Two weeks after that summary of Chinese strategic thinking was sent to Stalin, Chinese soldiers invaded North Korea, where they surprised the American troops who were spearheading the United Nations military effort to protect the South Korean Government of Syngman Rhee. **********The cable is among hundreds of documents that were published in Beijing in 1987 and 1990 as a collection of Mao's 1949-1951 papers. Although they were intended only for the eyes of senior Chinese officials and historians, several copies have been smuggled out of China and obtained by scholars in the United States. Stalin's Air Cover **********The documents also offer a glimpse at diplomacy between the Communist giants. Scholars now assert that after Stalin reneged on air cover and army supplies for the Chinese invasion, originally set for Oct. 15, Mao froze preparations and reassessed China's position, but decided with his Politburo by Oct. 13 to go ahead with the advance anyway. It began on Oct. 19. **********The invasion, by 260,000 Chinese troops, horrified American commanders in Korea and forced them into the greatest retreat in United States military history. The deadlock that followed, after three years of bitter and inconclusive fighting, left the Korean Peninsula divided, as it has remained ever since. **********At the time the telegram was sent, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the commander of United Nations forces in Korea, openly doubted China's willingness to enter Korea with an army that was fatigued from years of its own civil war. The Americans also ignored warning signals sent by Beijing as United Nations troops advanced north of the 38th parallel, which had separated the territories under Soviet and American control since the Japanese withdrew from the country in 1945. **********Because the Chinese troops moved undetected at first, and then orchestrated successive feints, the size of their military presence was not fully grasped by MacArthur until late November, when the Chinese began unleashing huge nighttime assaults -- sometimes called \"human wave\" attacks -- on the Americans. 'Inside Information' **********At the time, some policymakers in Washington believed that the Chinese troops had been sent on orders from the Soviet Union, and that Moscow controlled a monolithic Communist bloc. Although historians have since learned of the complex antagonism between Mao and Stalin, no documentary evidence has before been seen about what led Mao and his colleagues to their fateful decision. **********\"Now we really have inside information about decision-making,\" said Allen S. Whiting, a professor of political science at the University of Arizona who wrote \"China Crosses the Yalu,\" a 1960 book about China's entry into the war. \"These papers have been very illuminating.\" **********Mr. Whiting, whose theory that Chinese leaders entered the war out of a feeling of defensive necessity has been borne out in the documents, said he was surprised by the extent to which Mao worried about anti-Government forces within China at the time of the war. **********Mao at first hesitated to enter the war, Mr. Whiting said, partly because of what he perceived as a threat of lingering opposition to the Communist Government set up only a year earlier, in October 1949. But by late September 1950, Mr. Whiting said, Mao became convinced that a significant American presence in Korea might lead to an American-backed offensive by the Communists' enemy, the Nationalists, who had been expelled from the mainland but still posed a threat from Taiwan.  Altered Chinese Papers **********Scholars who have studied the documents warned that they should be viewed with the knowledge that in the past, Chinese papers have often been altered to paint political leaders in a favorable or unfavorable light. Although the complexity and internal consistency of those documents point to their authenticity, there are other limitations. **********\"The problem is that they are fragmentary,\" said Michael Hunt, professor of political science at the University of North Carolina, who is also writing about the documents. \"This is a cable in a series of exchanges between Mao and Stalin. We don't know what's been said so far.\" **********In the Oct. 2 telegram, Mao refers to much-needed assistance from Moscow. Stalin apparently agreed in the following days to provide air cover, but then reversed himself on Oct. 10. **********Prime Minister Zhou Enlai went on a secret trip to Moscow to try to persuade Stalin to support the Chinese attack, but was unsuccessful. In a cable to Zhou on Oct. 13, Mao wrote that China's Politburo had backed the decision to go to war anyway. **********Moving with stealth once they crossed the Yalu River border into Korea on Oct. 19, Chinese troops were not discovered by American intelligence until they clashed briefly with United Nations soldiers on Oct. 25. By drawing back, Chinese commanders created the illusion that they were retreating to China and deliberately drew the Americans northward before China launched a full attack in the final week of November. **********About 53,000 American soldiers were killed in the war. The documents do not reveal a total of Chinese deaths in the war, believed to be in the hundreds of thousands. The documents also fail to reveal whether Chinese leaders were part of any direct planning for the June 25, 1950, attack by Kim Il Sung that began the war. It is likely, scholars say, that Mao knew of Kim's intentions but not of his timing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/01/business/your-taxes-tax-tip-disasters.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Disasters", "print_headline": "YOUR TAXES: TAX TIP; Disasters", "body_text": " **********Hurricane Bob and other storms brought havoc last year to 12 states, which were declared Federal disaster areas -- Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Rhode Island, Nebraska, Tennessee and Wisconsin.

Baker 3d sent a message to Iraq in November 1989 telling the Iraqis that the United States had just approved new grain credits and seeking Baghdad's influence in persuading Palestinians to take part in peace talks with Israel, a newly declassified document shows. **********Although the message from Mr. Baker, now the White House chief of staff, does not explicitly link the farm loan credits to Iraq's intervention with the Palestinians, it provides the clearest evidence to date that the United States wanted something in return for the guarantees. **********The message was sent to Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, on Nov. 9, 1989, nine months before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. A copy of the message was released along with numerous other documents Friday night by the Senate Agriculture Committee, which is investigating reported abuses in the farm credit program. **********Some members of Congress have charged that the Iraqis diverted the grain for money and weapons, and that the Bush Administration generally sought to curry favor with President Saddam Hussein before Iraq invaded Kuwait. The question has become an issue in the Presidential election. **********The Bush Administration has repeatedly denied that there was any evidence of such a grain diversion and justified its decision to extend the farm credits as a way to try to moderate President Hussein's behavior through economic and political incentives. **********The decision to proceed with the farm credits was made despite opposition from the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, the Office of Management and Budget and Federal prosecutors in Atlanta who were investigating a multibillion-dollar loan fraud involving the Atlanta branch of an Italian bank and Iraq. **********In another document released by the committee, the Federal prosecutor in charge of the bank case wrote in an internal memo last July stating that Iraq had misused the farm program and that the Agriculture Department knew it but chose to ignore it. **********The July 16, 1992 memo by the prosecutor, Gail McKenzie, sharply criticizes the Department for ignoring evidence of the abuses in a meeting with other Government agencies held just before the Administration agreed to proceed with the first $500 million of the $1 billion in credits to Iraq. **********Mr. Baker's request to the Iraqis for help with the Palestinians partly explains why he became personally involved in lobbying for the farm program. Determined to make progress on his peace plan, Mr. Baker at one point, according to previous press reports, telephoned Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter to press the case for the grain credits.

It would be useful if you could weigh in with them and urge them to give a positive response to Egypt's suggestions.\" **********Mr. Baker had broached the subject of Iraqi support for the Egyptian peace plan at his meeting with Mr. Aziz on Oct. 6. But at that meeting, according to the minutes, Mr. Aziz remained noncommittal, telling Mr. Baker, it was \"Iraqi policy to refrain from public statements on the peace process.\" **********Ms. McKenzie's memo gives a detailed description of her concerns about the grain program, which she had voiced in a conversation with two senior Agriculture Department officials on Oct. 11, 1989. Other documents indicate that Ms. McKenzie and other members of her team had warned against giving Iraq new credits. **********Ms. McKenzie wrote in the memo that she told the two officials that there were strong indications that Iraq was bartering or diverting food bought through the credit program, because the country was buying more food than \"could reasonably be consumed in Iraq.\" She noted that the Agriculture Department's monitoring system traced food shipments only as far as Jordan and Turkey, not as far as Iraq. **********At the time of her meeting, Federal prosecutors in Atlanta and other United States Government officials were suspicious that Iraq was diverting either the loan money or the food into weapons purchases, although the allegations have never been proven. **********Ms. McKenzie's memo was apparently written as a protective measure to exonerate her and her team of any wrongdoing in their handling of the bank fraud. Ms. McKenzie said in the memo that it was written after she learned that Congress was investigating her briefings to Agriculture Department officials. Iraq Demanded Bribes **********The prosecutors had also uncovered evidence that Iraq had demanded bribes from American exporters participating in the program. In her memo, Ms. McKenzie described how the Iraqis paid inflated prices for goods backed by the American program in order to include kickbacks and freight charges in violation of the program's regulations. Even after the Agriculture Department \"advised Iraq to cease such demands for payments,\" she wrote, the Iraqis continued to demand kickbacks. **********Many of the loans guaranteed by the United States grain program were extended by the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, an Italian bank that Ms. McKenzie's office was investigating.

Archeologists can tell by sampling the dregs. **********In the same room of the ruins where archeologists last year reported finding the earliest chemical evidence for wine, they have now identified the earliest chemical evidence for beer. The identification was made by analyzing a pale yellowish residue sticking to the interior of a double-handled pottery jar. **********Announcing the discovery in today's issue of the journal Nature, the archeologists said this established that people were making and drinking beer as early as 3500 B.C. The discovery also reinforced the image of the ancient Sumerians as among the first people to develop a complex, literate society of prospering city-states based on irrigation agriculture and widespread trade. **********The many storage jars like the beer crock found at the Godin Tepe ruins strongly support the idea that Godin Tepe was a Sumerian outpost and fortress on an ancient trade route along what later became a main trunk of the legendary Silk Road. A Favorite Beverage **********From artifacts and other evidence, scholars had already determined that beer was the favorite fermented beverage of the Sumerians, who lived mainly in the lower Tigris-Euphrates valley. Some of their art depicted people standing around a large vessel, drinking something out of it, presumably beer, with long straws. **********One of the most common pictographs in Sumerian ruins is the sign for \"beer,\" which shows linear markings within a jar. These markings are similar to the unusual crisscross pattern of incisions inside the vessel where the telltale beer residue was identified. **********\"It's chemical substantiation of what were archeological arguments before,\" Dr. Patrick E. McGovern, an archeological chemist at the University Museum of Archeology and Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an interview yesterday. **********Dr. McGovern conducted the analysis along with Dr. Rudolph H. Michel, an organic chemist at the museum. Virginia R. Badler, a graduate student at the University of Toronto, had noted the residue in the jug grooves while studying artifacts from Godin Tepe in the collections of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. These researchers, who wrote the Nature report, were the same ones responsible for identifying the earliest known wine from red stains in other jars from the same site. 'A Lot of Serious Drinking' **********Asked the meaning of finding both the earliest known wine and beer in the same room, Dr. McGovern replied, \"I think a lot of serious drinking was going on there.\" **********Using a standard chemical test, Dr. McGovern and Dr. Michel determined that the residue contained calcium oxalate, which is a major component of material that settles out at the bottom of brewery vats and storage tanks and is characteristic of barley beer. **********Although oxalates occur naturally in large amounts in spinach and rhubarb, which grow in the Iranian highlands today, the researchers said those plants probably made up a minor part of human diet in antiquity, compared with barley bread and beer. In any event, they said, spinach and rhubarb were unlikely to have been stored or processed in the type of pottery vessels found in the ruins. **********Moreover, archeologists said they found considerable quantitities of barley in the trading post's storerooms. **********Scholars think that people may have begun to make beer almost as soon as -- or even before -- they domesticated barley in the early transition by the Mesopotamians to agriculture around 8000 B.C. A longstanding debate in archeology centers on the question of which came first after the domestication of barley: bread or beer? **********\"Analysis of storage and processing containers from earlier periods and from a wider geographical area are needed to determine the ultimate orgins and significance of beer production,\" the three researchers wrote in Nature."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/07/business/the-executive-computer-three-different-ways-to-dress-up-windows.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Lewis", "pub_date": "1992-06-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1297, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Executive Computer; Three Different Ways to Dress Up Windows", "print_headline": "The Executive Computer; Three Different Ways to Dress Up Windows", "body_text": " **********Microsoft Windows 3.1 is often referred to as an operating system, and in some ways it is. It has its own command conventions, and it puts its own special demands on both the hardware and the software used with it, just as other operating systems do. Technically, though, Windows is just a facade, albeit a fancy one, for DOS, which remains the true, underlying operating system. **********Just as Windows changes the face of DOS, making the computer easier to use, several programs are available that change the face of Windows and make it easier to use: Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0, New Wave 4.0 and Rooms for Windows. Each has its own strengths to match the different personal working styles of executives. **********Of course, \"easy\" is a relative term in the computer business, and all too often ease of use is a byproduct of countless hours of slogging through manuals and dense thickets of confusing commands. Each of these three programs eventually provides ease of use, but mastering that ease is not fun. **********Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0 (list price $179) is a faster and fancier version of the original Desktop for Windows. It is made by the Peter Norton Group of the Symantec Corporation, which is widely known for its backup, antivirus, security and disk maintenance tools. **********Faster is almost always better when it comes to computers, and that's certainly the case with Norton Desktop. Windows is no speed demon, and the first version of Norton Desktop made an already slow system even slower. Even though it requires 8 to 9 megabytes of hard disk space, the new Norton Desktop comes to life much faster than its predecessor. **********The Norton Desktop adds a variety of utilities to Windows 3.1, each tool displayed as an icon, or symbol. Tools can be kept out of sight in a folder until needed, or arrayed on the \"desktop,\" a term that Norton uses to describe working space on the computer screen. One executive might prefer a messy desk, another to keep things neat, and Norton Desktop gives the user broad control over how the desktop will look. **********\"It fits my needs because it's extremely customizable,\" said Thomas J. Miller, a microsystems analyst with Tandem Computers Inc. in Cupertino, Calif. \"It's also very flexible, in that it gives me multiple ways to launch applications or files.\" **********Some users, for example, might want to keep handy the tools for \"smart erase,\" which allows users to recover inadvertantly erased files; an antivirus scanner and eradicator; an automated backup tool for making just-in-case copies of entire disks or directories, and a viewer allowing the user to peer inside files without actually loading them. On the other side of the screen are symbols depicting the computer's disk drives. **********To back up the hard disk, the user points the cursor at the icon representing the \"C\" drive, drags it over to the backup icon and drops it. Norton Desktop takes over from there, offering the user several different types of backup, ranging from full to incremental (only the files that have been changed since the last backup). Automatic unattended backups can be scheduled, too, but the version I tested did not work with a tape drive. Symantec promises to add this in the future. **********Other utilities include financial and scientific calculators, a simple word processor that is superior to the one in Windows, a calendar and scheduler, a screen blanker, a powerful search tool for finding misplaced or forgotten files and a batch file builder. **********There's also a shredder for sensitive files. Unlike the smart eraser, which allows a deleted file to be pulled back from the trash, the shredder obliterates the file. Other security features include passwords that can be attached at several different levels to keep snoopers out completely, or merely to restrict access to specific files. **********The Hewlett-Packard Company has revamped and repositioned New Wave 4.0 ($195) as a Windows shell aimed at making Windows easier to use, after introducing it as a powerful supercharger for Windows. The truth is that New Wave retains its powerful features, even though ease of use is now being emphasized. **********Unlike Norton Desktop, which knocks some rough edges off Windows but stays true to the underlying DOS structure, New Wave makes Windows 3.1 work in much the same way as Apple's vaunted Macintosh operating system. Barring some disaster, the user can probably go weeks or months without having to descend into DOS. **********Anyone familiar with the Mac's system of managing files and folders will adore New Wave, since it uses the same conventions. File names, for example, can be 32 characters long, instead of the DOS limit of 8. Instead of dragging a file to the A or C drives, the operator can use disk icons with no-nonsense names like \"floppy disk\" or \"network drive.\" **********New Wave lacks Norton Desktop's disk tools and antivirus tools, but it was the first program to add drag-and-drop file management to Windows. To print a document in New Wave, for example, the user highlights the symbol for the document and drags it atop the symbol for the printer. That's it. **********For more advanced users, New Wave has an intriguing feature called the Agent, which can be instructed to perform special tasks automatically. On its simplest level, the Agent will keep track of mouse clicks, menu choices and keyboard strokes, store them as a single script and then perform the script whenever it is asked to do so. **********An executive might want the Agent to gather each morning's sales reports, grab the bottom line off each regional total, repackage the results into a single report and send the report by electronic mail to the boss, with a copy to the printer. Advanced users can write their own scripts, using New Wave's programming language. **********New Wave adds 7 to 10 megabytes to the already hefty demands of Windows. That slows the system noticeably, but many people may find the slower performance a small price to pay for the many advantages the program provides. **********The hardest of the three to explain is Rooms for Windows ($99 from XSoft, a subsidiary of the Xerox Corporation), which allows Windows users to organize their work in themes or projects, rather than in applications. It requires less disk space than the other two programs. **********Windows, and the other Windows managers, allow the user to switch from one application to another. Rooms does too, but in a more elegant way, creating \"virtual desktops\" -- electronic environments that change depending on the user's needs. **********If this is hard to follow, consider calendars. Some executives want to see their schedules detailed hour by hour, day by day; others want to see everything in terms of broader projects and strategic plans. Rooms for Windows takes the latter course. **********Likewise, an executive probably doesn't sit down to work a spreadsheet; he or she sits down to prepare a budget report. With Rooms, all the tools needed for making the budget report can be gathered in one \"room\" -- a spreadsheet, a word processor, a graphics program and the necessary data files. The word processor might also appear in the next room, as part of an arsenal for producing the company newsletter. Rooms are connected by \"doors,\" and a \"suite\" gives the user an overview of all the rooms. **********It is gratifying to see a strong Windows product from Xerox, whose Palo Alto Research Center in California came up with the original idea for windowed computer systems. Microsoft and Apple, among others, saw the brilliance of Xerox's work and, depending on one's interpretation of the law, either stole the ideas or adapted them. Through its XSoft division, Xerox may finally get a return on its investment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/24/business/delta-loses-1082-million-and-plans-to-cut-5-of-jobs.html": {"writer_name": "Jerry Schwartz", "pub_date": "1992-07-24", "snippet": "Delta Air Lines Inc. today reported losses of $180.2 million for its fourth quarter and $506.3 million for the fiscal year, and the company said it would reduce its work force by 5 percent.\n\nDelta's loss, which was in line with expectations, conti...", "word_count": 745, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Delta Loses $108.2 Million And Plans to Cut 5% of Jobs", "print_headline": "Delta Loses $108.2 Million And Plans to Cut 5% of Jobs", "body_text": " **********Delta Air Lines Inc. today reported losses of $180.2 million for its fourth quarter and $506.3 million for the fiscal year, and the company said it would reduce its work force by 5 percent. **********Delta's loss, which was in line with expectations, continues a string of poor performances by domestic airlines.

Delta's chief financial officer, Thomas J. Roeck Jr., estimated that Delta lost $30 million to $40 million in June alone as a result of the industry's half-price sale. **********Ronald W. Allen, Delta's chairman and chief executive, said the work-force cuts would not affect flight crews but might reach into most other job categories, including reservations clerks, customer service personnel at airports and others. **********He said the 80,000-employee staff would be trimmed by eliminating many temporary jobs and reassigning some permanent workers to jobs previously filled by temporary posts. **********\"We want to protect our permanent people,\" Mr. Allen said. \"Job security is our No. 1 goal and benefit for our permanent people.\" **********He said Delta expected the staff cuts, coupled with changes in its employee health plan and vacation policy, to result in savings of $375 million by next June 30 and cost reductions of $700 million by 1995.'Unremitting Cost Pressures' **********Delta's revenue rose 12.3 percent in the quarter to $2.83 billion, from $2.52 billion a year ago. For the year, revenue rose 18.2 percent, to $10.84 billion, up from $9.17 billion in the comparable period last year. **********In 1991, Delta had net income of $19.2 million in the fourth quarter and lost $324.4 million for the fiscal year. **********\"The losses have continued with the challenges in this business, with the revenue reductions brought about by the half-price sale and the like,\" Mr. Allen told reporters during a briefing today. **********Mr. Roeck, the chief financial officer, said: \"The industry has been subjected to unremitting cost pressures, and they continued to evidence themselves in the June quarter. Compounding that was revenue weakness caused by the soft economy. Although revenue passenger miles were up over 16 percent, they didn't keep up with capacity growth of something over 20 percent.\" **********Mr. Roeck said Delta was also hurt by the industrywide overhaul earlier this year of fare structures, which eliminated many special fares. The resulting system, with only four classes of fares, followed by the industry's steep discounting of tickets this spring, resulted in a decline in passenger-mile yield of about 4 percent, Mr. Roeck said. **********\"The problem with the fares are really secondary to the economy,\" said Kevin Murphy, securities analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company. \"The economy is still very anemic in its growth path and has affected all of the airlines.\" **********Mr. Murphy said Delta appeared to be making the correct moves. \"I think the cost containment makes a lot of sense in terms of giving them staying power,\" he said. \"In due course they'll get top-line relief as the revenue comes back with an economic recovery.

Only its 9,400 pilots and 150 flight dispatchers are union members. The company said earlier this week that it would attempt to win cost concessions from pilots and asked for a meeting with leaders of their union. **********Mr. Murphy said Delta's decision to eliminate only temporary jobs was a good sign for the company's dividend. **********\"They're not going to an austerity program,\" he said. \"Those kinds of programs are shared burdens, and if they had to lay off employees, they'd probably have to reduce the common dividend, as well.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/22/business/market-watch-bad-times-for-mesa-but-not-for-pickens.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1992-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 541, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bad Times For Mesa, but Not for Pickens", "print_headline": "MARKET WATCH; Bad Times For Mesa, but Not for Pickens", "body_text": " **********TIMES are getting hard for investors who stuck with T. Boone Pickens, the one-time scourge of corporate America and self-appointed representative of individual shareholders. But for Mr. Pickens, the money is still rolling in. **********Mesa Inc., Mr. Pickens's company, is in danger of going broke. Its share price has plummeted, and now its auditors are questioning whether it can continue as a going concern. **********Mr. Pickens professes optimism that things will work out. The company is trying to persuade its bondholders to forget about interest payments until 1996, among other things, and it is trying to sell assets. \"I've been backed against the wall before,\" Mr. Pickens said in an interview Friday. \"We've been pretty good survivors.\" **********In the old days, Mesa, whose basic business is producing natural gas, made lots of money by threatening to take over larger oil companies, with junk-bond backing from Drexel Burnham. Mr. Pickens was free with advice for managers of those companies, which he said had too much capital and should spend less of it drilling for oil while giving more of it to their shareholders. **********These days, Mr. Pickens seems a little chastened. \"You haven't heard me saying anything about that for a long time,\" he said when asked about the quality of management in big oil. \"I'd say they are doing a pretty good job. We've all suffered.\" **********Mr. Pickens has not suffered too much. When Mesa was a limited partnership in the late 1980's, he took in $1.8 million a year as general partner. But the deal was that he didn't get paid unless the limited partners did, and by 1990 Mesa could no longer borrow money to fund payouts. **********Now Mesa is a corporation again, and Mr. Pickens, as chairman, is drawing a salary of $960,000. In 1991, there was no salary, but Mesa paid him $373,853 as his cut of profits from investments, and another $131,450 for the use of his 38,000-acre ranch near Pampa, Tex. The ranch has \"the best quail hunting in the United States,\" Mr. Pickens says, and is used to entertain customers. **********Mesa's owners are not doing as well. The company is so deep in debt that it is possible there will be little left for the shareholders, and if it does survive, the biggest stake may be held by the creditors. Mesa used to have 950 employees. Now it has 350. Mr. Pickens says Mesa's stock trading is still profitable -- he says he is shorting some stocks, but won't give names -- but there is no way that will bail out the company. **********Mesa's problem is simple. \"We just pulled all the money out of the company and gave it to the shareholders,\" said Mr. Pickens. \"That's not inconsistent with my philosophy.\" **********In fact, it became the philosophy of the 1980's for far too many. Get the money now, and earn it later. In Mesa's case, gas prices did not rise as hoped, and it never did make the money it had handed out. **********Now Mr. Pickens says that was a mistake. His shareholders, and employees, must wish he had figured that out sooner."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/21/business/the-media-business-advertising-new-show-spurs-debate-on-old-issue.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 884, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Show Spurs Debate On Old Issue", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; New Show Spurs Debate On Old Issue", "body_text": " **********A TELEVISION program being offered to local stations around the country would combine elements of traditional talk shows with the buy-it-now sales pitches of home-shopping channels. If it enters production this fall, the program would be the latest in a spate of new media ventures that blur the line between editorial content and advertising. **********The hourlong daytime program, called \"Day-to-Day Live,\" is being presented to station programmers this week in New Orleans, at the 29th annual convention of the National Association of Television Programming Executives. Besides carrying conventional commercials, 12 minutes during each hour, as many as four of the seven segments in each show would feature guests who laced their interviews with pitches for merchandise like books, clothing or cosmetics. Toll-free telephone numbers for ordering would flash onto the screen. **********An added payoff for stations carrying the show: a cut of product sales in their local markets. **********\"What would happen if Oprah Winfrey had an author on and turned and said, 'Now we have an opportunity for you to transact?' \" Richard (Ritch) Colbert, the senior executive vice president of domestic television for ITC Entertainment, asked yesterday in a telephone interview from New Orleans. \"By providing the viewer an opportunity to interact with television, and immediately transact, it fulfills television's promise. And I'm not saying that as a sales guy.\" **********ITC, a television production and distribution company best known for \"The Muppet Show,\" would produce \"Day-to-Day Live\" with the Alliance Group, a television marketing company, and the Home Shopping Network, the shop-at-home cable network, with annual sales exceeding $1 billion. **********The program is intended to be shown, starting in September, during a one-hour slot between 9 A.M. and noon, Eastern time, for an audience primarily of women aged 25 to 54. **********Media directors at large advertising agencies were initially intrigued by the idea, but expressed misgivings yesterday about whether the show would seem like one long Ginsu knife commercial. **********\"It's definitely pushing the edge of the envelope,\" said Arnie Semsky, the executive vice president and director of media and programming services at BBDO Worldwide in New York. \"Certain clients will find this a good environment; others won't go near it.\" **********Marcella Rosen, the executive vice president and managing director of media services at Ayer Inc. in New York, called the program \"an interesting concept\" and said, \"You can't get much closer to the point of purchase than to offer a sale as a person is talking about a product.\" **********Yet, she added, the program's success depends on its execution. \"The biggest risk is whether they'll choose who's on the program by what will sell, rather than who makes the most interesting program,\" she said. **********Kathy Ring, the vice president and media director at the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, agreed. \"Will the viewer perceive this as an entertaining show with an opportunity to buy, or get additional information about, a product?\" she asked. \"Or will the viewer see this as just another home-shopping program?\" **********The producers recognize those concerns, according to Mr. Colbert. \"This is not paid advertising,\" he said, meaning that guests cannot pay in order to be interviewed by the show's co-hosts, Gloria Loring, an actress, and Bob Circosta, a host from the Home Shopping Network. **********\"If you don't have a program that can retain the highest level of viewers,\" he added, \"you don't have a program.\" **********Since the early days of television, when incessant \"plugs,\" or paid mentions of products, led to a crackdown, there had been strict separation of programming and advertising. That weakened during the Reagan Administration, when \"infomercials,\" program-length commercials that mimic television shows, were allowed. **********Also blurring the lines are conventional television or radio commercials, 30 or 60 seconds long, that simulate talk shows or news programs. The most castigated in that genre are television spots for the Vaseline Intensive Care line of lotions, created by McCann-Erickson, that feature Joan Lunden, a co-host of ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" **********Ms. Rosen said \"Day-to-Day Live\" would likely be \"obvious as what it is, not promotion masquerading as editorials.\" **********Given the enormous amounts of air time to fill, \"advertisers are finding there's more they can do,\" said Mr. Semsky of BBDO. \"And some of that blurs the line, like advertorials in print media,\" which are advertisements in newspapers and magazines that ape the appearances of news and feature articles. **********ITC hopes at least 100 stations will sign up for \"Day-to-Day Live,\" Mr. Colbert said. Many programs offered at the convention, the television industry's annual sales bazaar for new shows, do not make it into station line-ups because of production problems, high costs or lookalike formats that inhibit prospective buyers. **********As an additional incentive to encourage stations to sign, he added, they would get 5 percent of the total sales from merchandise sold in their local viewing areas. That would be besides the revenues they would get from selling 8 of the 12 commercial minutes in the show. ITC would get the revenues from selling the remaining 4 minutes, as well as an unspecified percentage of the revenues generated by merchandise sales."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/23/business/imf-trims-global-growth-forecast.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1992-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 736, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.M.F.

Trims Global Growth Forecast", "body_text": " **********The International Monetary Fund sharply reduced its forecast for the world economy today, saying growth would be only a sluggish 1.4 percent this year. **********Last October the I.M.F. predicted 2.7 percent growth for 1992. Fund officials said today that they cut that forecast largely because the United States had taken longer than expected to begin its climb from recession. **********The fund said the world's economy was gathering steam, however, and would grow by a healthy 3.6 percent next year. **********Although the growth in most of the major industrial countries has stumbled, the report did not forecast a recession for the industrial world as a whole. It predicted the industrial countries would grow 1.8 percent this year and 3.3 percent next year. Growth of 2.3% Seen for U.S. **********In its World Economic Outlook report, the I.M.F. said the American economy was beginning to turn up. It forecast that the nation's output would grow by 2.3 percent from the fourth quarter of 1991 to this year's fourth quarter. In a news conference today, Michael Mussa, the fund's chief economist, added that he would not be surprised if the nation's economy grew by 3 percent for the year as whole. **********The report said it would be unwise for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates further because the recovery appeared to be taking hold. \"Barring evidence that growth continues to falter, a further significant reduction of interest rates does not seem warranted in the United States,\" the report said. Concerns About Inflation **********The I.M.F. said the decline in interest rates already in place should produce the long-awaited strengthening of activity. **********Worried that further monetary easing could ultimately overstimulate the economy, the report said that underlying inflation in the United States \"still appears to be above long-term objectives.\" The report said consumer prices would rise 3.1 percent both this year and next year, compared with 4.2 percent inflation last year. **********\"The significant decline in short-term interest rates in North America and Japan -- made possible by the continued moderation of inflation -- is expected to contribute to a strengthening of growth during 1992,\" the report said. But it noted that long-term rates remained high, partly because of the huge American budget deficit. **********Mr. Mussa said that the construction slump and military spending reductions meant the American economy would not rebound at the 5 percent or 6 percent rate generally seen in the first year after other post-World War II recessions. Outlook for Japan and Europe **********The report said Japan's economy would grow by 3.2 percent from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, the same as the year before, but would rise to 3.9 percent next year. **********It said Japan's economy had slowed recently because growth in fixed investment fell to 3.5 percent this year, compared with more than 10 percent a year in the late 1980's. The report said that industrial output declined in the first two months of this year but that a pickup in government spending would help spur Japan's economy. **********The I.M.F. predicted continued weak growth in Europe, as Germany's high interest rates drag down the Continent. In pointed language, the report urged Germany to move more aggressively to reduce its budget deficit, which has been caused largely by efforts to help eastern Germany. The nation's central bank has pushed up interest rates to slow the inflationary pressures fueled by the massive spending. **********Most other European countries have raised their rates along with Germany to keep their currencies from falling against the German mark. \"For most European countries the spillover has restrained demand when activity was already generally quite weak, and when inflation was abating,\" the report said. Former Soviet Bloc **********The report said Eastern Europe's economy was beginning to bottom out, but added that the former Soviet Union would probably suffer further output declines. **********For Eastern Europe, the report projects a 1 percent drop in output this year, but growth of 3.7 percent next year. That follows a plunge in production of 16.6 percent last year. Inflation in the region is forecast at 95 percent this year, from 135 percent last year. **********For the former Soviet Union, the report sees a decline in production of 17.5 percent this year, following a plunge of 17 percent in 1991.

But they also said that the manufacturing sector remained subdued and that employment growth was likely to lag. **********\"Taken together, the picture is pretty encouraging, but it is not definitive yet,\" said David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. \"There are still concerns about sustainability.\" 'Positive' First Quarter **********Mr. Mullins said that a few weeks ago, many economists were expecting a flat first quarter, but he said recent data suggested that first-quarter growth \"would squarely be in positive territory,\" although it would still be slow. **********He said \"the pattern of data bodes well for a stronger second quarter and a return to moderate growth by midyear.\" **********Many analysts say the recent positive data make it unlikely that Fed officials would cut interest rates in the near future because they think the Fed no longer believes that additional monetary easing is necessary to insure recovery. Some Fed officials have said they worry that the markets might view any additional cuts as inflationary. **********In an interview today on the ABC News program \"This Week With David Brinkley,\" Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, agreed that the economy was recovering. **********\"We in the Administration are assuming each quarter throughout this year will be slightly better than the one before,\" he said, referring to the growth rate of the economy. \"I think we can get 3 percent by the third and fourth quarter.\" Lower Unemployment **********Mr. Darman added that at such a rate \"we could have the good fortune of unemployment coming down\" from its current level of 7.3 percent. He did not specify a level it might decline to. **********The central bank governors pointed to numerous factors that could weaken or reverse the recent upturns. They said the rise in long-term interest rates since January could undermine the momentum in housing sales and residential construction, and they still worried about the persistent low levels of consumer confidence. **********They added that the dollar's recent rise could hurt exports by making them more expensive. **********\"If you think of the two prime engines of the recovery -- the housing market and exports -- rates shoot at one and the dollar shoots at the other,\" said Mr. Mullins, who is considered the most influential member of the Federal Reserve Board after its chairman, Alan Greenspan. **********Echoing what Mr. Greenspan told a Congressional committee early this month, the governors said the slowdowns in Japan and Germany could hamper American growth by hurting the nation's exports and slowing the world economy. Nevertheless, Mr. Greenspan said he expected American exports to continue to grow because of the strong economic gains of Mexico, the rest of Latin America and the newly industrialized countries of Asia. **********Some Fed officials also worried that the positive news on housing starts and other areas could be exaggerated because of the unusually warm winter temperatures. For example, warm weather might have spurred a larger-than-normal amount of home construction in January and February. **********The governors also said this economic rebound would probably not be as robust as past recoveries, partly because consumers and businesses were still struggling to pare the large debt they accumulated in the 1980's. This, they said, was holding back spending and consumer confidence. Uneven Performances **********Another governor, Wayne D. Angell, said the lack of economic synchronization among the states would help prevent a robust recovery. **********\"We've had many quarters of recovery in Colorado, but I don't know if we have had recovery yet in New England,\" he said. \"California is kind of a soft spot, with the cuts in defense.\" **********Echoing Mr. Greenspan's Congressional testimony, the two governors said that consumer confidence appeared to be lower than recent economic reports would warrant. The governors said economic growth over the last three quarters had been so weak, after two quarters of decline, that it was depressing consumer confidence, as were fears about the nation's long-term economic prospects. Anemic Growth Rates **********Mr. Mullins noted that consumer sentiment was subdued partly because the economy has not grown at even a modest 2 percent rate since the first quarter of 1989. **********\"The concern is not going into a double dip, but staying in this anemic growth range, which tends to reinforce fears,\" Mr. Mullins said. \"There is power in negative thinking. That keeps people from spending and making the sort of commitments to keep the economy going again.\" **********The Fed governors would not tip their hand about whether they were leaning toward lowering or raising rates, but Mr. Angell indicated that the central bankers were keeping their options open. **********\"There are some circumstances out there where we might have to raise interest rates, and some where we might have to decrease them,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/08/business/the-media-business-bank-takes-mgm-pathe.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 259, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bank Takes MGM-Pathe", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Bank Takes MGM-Pathe", "body_text": " **********Credit Lyonnais today formally took possession of the crippled movie studio MGM and its parent company, the Pathe Communications Corporation. **********The French state-owned bank, which is the company's largest creditor and has controlled its board since last year, took possession of the company's shares in an auction in which there were no other bidders. **********The purchase price of $483.5 million was equivalent to the secured debt of the Pathe Communications Corporation and its affiliates, said a spokesman for Credit Lyonnais, who spoke on condition of anonmyity. **********The foreclosure sale was the culmination of a long legal and financial battle between the bank and MGM-Pathe's former owner, the Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti. **********Mr. Parretti owes Credit Lyonnais an amount estimated at $1.5 billion from his 1990 purchase of MGM-UA Communications and subsequent loans to keep operations going. **********\"It has been the bank's position that the best way to protect its investment is to work with MGM management toward the revival of the studio,\" the bank spokesman said. \"As far as we're concerned, this concludes any involvement Parretti has with MGM.\" **********Mr. Parretti owned 98.5 percent of the stock in the California studio.

Part of the investor's obligation is to put up money for such a bid.\" **********People involved in the deal, who insisted on anonymity, said Mr. Kalikow had been negotiating the financing for several months with a number of outside investors, including a former Drexel Burnham Lambert executive, Leon Black. **********Mr. Black had been a top aide to Michael R. Milken, the former head of Drexel's junk bond department, who is now in prison after being convicted of securities law violations. Mr. Black now runs a private investment firm, Apollo Partners, in Manhattan. His involvement in the deal with Mr. Kalikow was reported in this week's issue of Crain's New York Business. **********Howard Seife, a lawyer at Winston & Strawn who represents the creditors committee for The Daily News in its bankruptcy case, said that there had been rumors about a deal between Mr. Kalikow and Mr. Black for quite some time, but that he had not been contacted about any potential bids. **********\"We are very far along in the process of selling The Daily News,\" he said. \"There are a whole series of meetings planned for the upcoming weeks, though we certainly welcome Mr. Kalikow's interest.\" The creditors committee is overseeing the sale of The Daily News. **********Mr. Kalikow filed for personal bankruptcy protection from his creditors in August. **********But in February, he announced that he intended to make an offer to acquire The Daily News. It was believed that he hoped to merge the two newspapers. **********From the perspective of Mr. Kalikow's creditors, The Post would probably have limited value if someone else bought The News, but a combined News-Post operation could eventually have significant value, though attaining that value would require an investment now. **********One person knowledgeable about the financial arrangements of Mr. Kalikow's proposed deal said it had been progressing for several months and involved working out separate arrangements for each of the 44 properties that Mr. Kalikow owns. **********\"It had to be unraveled one piece at a time,\" this person said. **********The $50 million would come as part of the first phase of the deal, another person close to the discussions said. The investors would also be required to put up more money at a later date, the person added, although the amount of additional investment and when it would be made have not yet been determined."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/26/world/center-to-employ-ex-soviet-scientists-soon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 193, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Center to Employ Ex-Soviet Scientists Soon", "print_headline": "Center to Employ Ex-Soviet Scientists Soon", "body_text": " **********An international center created to provide scientists in the former Soviet republics with stable jobs over the next two years is likely to open in Moscow next month, and to begin financing specific projects in June, a Bush Administration official says. **********Robert L.

Sometime after that, the marines will go ashore to begin carrying out the United Nations mandate to secure the delivery of food to famine-stricken Somalia. **********Three other supply ships en route to Somalia from their port in Diego Garcia are expected to arrive by next weekend. Together the four ships, called maritime pre-position ships, can sustain 16,500 troops for 30 days. A fifth ship from Jacksonville, Fla., is to arrive around the end of December. **********Navy and Marine commanders here said the biggest challenge for the 44,000-ton Lummus, a civilian ship under contract to the Defense Department, and its sister ships, which are 11 stories tall and the length of more than two football fields, would be to negotiate Mogadishu's shallow harbor. Divers to Inspect Harbor **********Lieut. Comdr. Tom Zink, a Navy cargo expert, said that the harbor depth ranges from about 24 to 36 feet, and that the Lummus draws 33 feet.  Commander Zink said that Navy seal divers would go in soon to inspect the harbor. **********Officials said that if the harbor is too shallow, some amphibious craft aboard the Lummus could be launched from the ship to lighten the load and buoy the vessel in the water. **********Port specialists will accompany the first group of marines that land to check the condition of the piers, find out what dockside loading equipment may be available, and identify staging areas to unload the cargo. **********Most of the marines in the 28,000-member American force will begin arriving in Mogadishu from bases in Southern California later this week, once the vanguard secures the airport and port. Practice Started in 1979 **********\"The way it's supposed to work is that we unload the gear and the marines flying in marry up with their equipment here,\" said Col. Bancroft McKittrick. **********The idea of positioning fully loaded ships in far-flung ports of the world -- essentially as floating warehouses -- started in 1979 during the Carter Administration as a way of placing heavy equipment and supplies closer to possible strategic hot spots. **********In that way, the military could fly troops quickly to a crisis and have their heavy equipment and supplies within several sailing days instead of two to three weeks away. **********The ships, which are based in Guam and the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, were used extensively in the Persian Gulf war to support the first group of marines that arrived in Saudi Arabia in August 1990. **********But pre-positioning has limitations, as the gulf war also illustrated. Most of the Army's heavy battle tanks had to be loaded in ports like Savannah and sailed to Saudi Arabia, delaying the arrival of America's heaviest firepower by several weeks. **********As a result of that lesson learned, the Pentagon is now planning to buy more of the pre-position ships for the Army. **********The mammoth supply ships, which have five large cranes on deck, carry virtually everything the military needs. **********For instance, aboard the Lummus are more than 1,400 vehicles, including seven M1-A1 battle tanks, 27 light-armored combat vehicles, and hundreds of trucks. Lashed on deck are Hovercraft that bring troops and equipment ashore in shallow waters. Named After Marine Hero **********The Lummus, which is named after a World War II Marine hero, is also carrying huge stocks of Meals-Ready-To-Eat, medicine, 100,000 tons of fuel, 100,000 gallons of potable water and water purification systems to use once ashore. **********Before being diverted to Somalia, the three Marine vessels off Somalia and the Lummus were scheduled to conduct a training exercise in the Persian Gulf. It was the first time one of the supply ships accompanied Marine forces during an exercise. Usually the pre-position ships remain in their ports until they are called in a crisis. **********Many of the 85 marines and sailors aboard took part in an unloading drill in August in Kuwait using one of the other pre-position ships. **********\"The guys are excited about this,\" said Maj. Stan Jones, a Marine cargo specialist. \"Sure we'll miss Christmas, but we're fired up to help these people.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/04/world/111-killed-when-police-storm-brazilian-prison-during-inmate-riot.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1992-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 626, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "111 Killed When Police Storm Brazilian Prison During Inmate Riot", "print_headline": "111 Killed When Police Storm Brazilian Prison During Inmate Riot", "body_text": " **********In the worst prison violence in Brazil's history, military police repression of a Sao Paulo jail riot left 111 prisoners dead, security officials said today, but no police officers were killed. **********The violence Friday, at Sao Paulo's House of Detention, Latin America's largest jail, left 22 police officers and 35 inmates wounded, the officials said. **********\"It was a massacre: There were 2,076 prisoners in the pavilion, and almost 10 percent were killed,\" Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, director of Sao Paulo University's Center for the Study of Violence, said today.

The anti-abortion groups say the proposals will permit more abortions than are now legal; those favoring a liberalizaton of the law feel the proposals do not go far enough to protect the rights of women with unwanted pregnancies. **********But opposition from both sides does not indicate sure defeat for the proposals. A poll by Irish Market Surveys showed last week that 55 percent favored the Government amendment. **********The three Government proposals, to be voted up or down on the same day as the national election, guarantee women the right to information on abortion; the right to travel abroad to have abortions, and stipulate the new grounds for legal abortion.

The current dispute stemmed from the case in February of a 14-year-old girl who said she was raped by a friend's father and wanted an abortion in Britain. **********The Irish Government forbade her; the Supreme Court overruled the Government, saying that the girl had the right to an abortion partly because she had threatened suicide.

The state court ruled that the stock sale, part of an aggressive investment strategy that Bendix carried out under its chief executive, William M. Agee, was integrally related to the overall operations of the company, part of its \"unitary business\" although not directly connected to any of its New Jersey operations. **********Writing for the majority today, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said that the New Jersey Supreme Court had misinterpreted the unitary business principle. It was not enough to identify the company's investment strategy, he said. To tax a portion of an out-of-state company's investment income, Justice Kennedy said, a state would have to show that the transaction served \"an operational rather than an investment function,\" which was not the case with the Bendix stake in Asarco. **********The two companies did not integrate their managements, he noted, and conducted unrelated businesses. \"The mere fact that an intangible asset was acquired pursuant to a long-term corporate strategy of acquisitions and dispositions does not convert an otherwise passive investment into an integral operational one,\" Justice Kennedy said. Takeover Battle **********The Bendix strategy, in fact, failed. Mr. Agee tried to use the $212 million capital gain from the Asarco sale to acquire the Martin Marietta Company, but his plan was thwarted when Martin Marietta and Allied-Signal Inc. bought up Bendix stock. Bendix is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Allied-Signal, which filed the appeal of the New Jersey ruling. The case was Allied-Signal v. Director, New Jersey Division of Taxation, No. 91-615. **********The case, which was initially argued March 4, was viewed as fairly routine until a week later, when the Court unexpectedly ordered a new argument and expanded its inquiry from the facts of the case to the underlying principles at stake. The Justices posed a series of questions for the new argument, which was held April 22, including \"what constitutional principles should govern state taxation of corporations doing business in several states?\" and whether a new rule, if adopted, should apply retroactively. **********In response to this invitation, New Jersey contended that the Court should abandon the unitary business principle and replace it with a rule permitting a state to tax a portion of all income from whatever source of a corporation that does any business in the state. **********The Court's retreat from its open invitation was swift. \"New Jersey's sweeping theory cannot be reconciled with the concept that the Constitution places limits on a state's power to tax value earned outside of its borders,\" Justice Kennedy said. **********He added that the Court's doctrine of adherence to its own precedents was particularly strong on an issue such as this one, because both states and taxpayers in their planning had relied on what seemed to be a well-settled rule of law. \"New Jersey's proposal would disrupt settled expectations in an area of the law in which the demands of the national economy require stability,\" Justice Kennedy said. **********In reaffirming its traditional approach, however, the Court today did not necessarily inject much clarity into what has been a confusing and contentious area of tax law. **********The 5-to-4 split on the Court over how to apply the general principles to the specific facts of the Bendix dispute was an indication that many cases such as this will come down to factual disputes, to be resolved at the highest administrative or judicial level to which a taxpayer is willing to take its case. Taking Sides **********In ruling for Allied-Signal, Justice Kennedy was joined by Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia and David H. Souter. **********Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Harry A. Blackmun and Clarence Thomas. They said that Allied-Signal had not proved that the Bendix capital gains from the Asarco sale were not \"operationally related\" to the business Bendix conducted in New Jersey. **********Phil Tatarowicz, a state tax expert in the Chicago office of Ernst & Young, said the decision today insured that such cases would remain \"fact driven\" and that both states and companies would face \"tremendous burdens\" in developing their sides of tax disputes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/17/business/company-news-at-t-buys-stake-in-trans-atlantic-network.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-12-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.T.& T.

The cuts represent 7 percent of the 193,000 workers employed worldwide by the sprawling company, whose businesses include Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators. **********The largest job losses will be at the Pratt & Whitney division, based in East Hartford, Conn., and are a result of declining military spending, company officials said. But virtually all parts of the company will be affected. **********The military-related cuts are just the latest to hit Pentagon contractors in the region. The Electric Boat division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Conn., has said it will eliminate 10,000 jobs because fewer submarines are being ordered. On Long Island, the Grumman Corporation and other military suppliers lost an estimated 20,000 jobs since the procurement boom of the mid-1980's. **********Connecticut's Governor, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., was vacationing in St. Croix, in the Virgin Islands, but his office said state officials had feared that United Technologies was planning to move many operations out of state, which would have been a much harder blow to the state's economy. The Governor's office said it hoped that the company's restructuring would make it stronger and ultimately help to preserve Connecticut jobs. **********Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, agreed with the Governor's office that the news could have been worse. But he said he feared the ripple effect from the company's decision to cut in half its list of parts suppliers, to 250 from 500. \"That's a real blow to us, in terms of our manufacturing base,\" he said. \"That can have as significant an impact as what we're talking about here.\"  Executive Ranks Hit Harder **********The company's executive ranks will be hit harder than the overall work force, as 12 percent of management jobs will be eliminated. Some of the cuts, at its corporate headquarters and research laboratories, have already taken place, officials said. In all, the company said it would close or consolidate more than 100 operations worldwide, cutting its total factory space by 16 percent. **********United Technologies officials said the purpose is to reduce costs by $1.1 billion a year by 1994 to improve the company's financial performance. But for 1991, the cost of program was $1.28 billion. In addition, the company took a charge of $256 million for the anticipated costs of meeting environmental standards. **********The special charges produced a loss of $1.22 billion in the fourth quarter and a loss of $1.02 billion for the year. The loss did not come as a surprise since the company announced last fall that it would take a charge of over $1 billion that would produce losses in both the quarter and year. **********The loss for the quarter compares with a profit of $168.8 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier. Sales for the quarter totaled $5.81 billion, down 2.3 percent from $5.95 billion a year earlier. The loss for the year compares with a profit of $750.6 million, or $5.91 a share, in 1990. Total sales were $21.26 billion for the year, a decline of 2.4 percent from $21.79 billion in 1990. The company's stock closed yesterday at $54, down $1.25 for the day. **********The environmental charge had not been forecast, but in cases where accounting rules allow companies to choose when to recognize particular losses, companies typically choose years that are going to be bad anyway to pave the way for better earnings in future years. **********Robert F. Daniell, the chairman of United Technologies, said some of the plant closings and layoffs \"recognize the realities of a shrinking U.S. defense budget.\" In 1990, 22 percent of the company's sales were to the Federal Government. But he said the need to improve efficiency and the prolonged recession were factors as well. Drop in Engine Orders **********In a letter to Pratt & Whitney employees, James G. O'Connor, the head of the division, said production of jet fighter engines was expected to drop from a high of 700 in 1982 to about 50 next year. Sales of civilian engines and spare parts are being held down by the financial turmoil in the airline industry, he said. **********\"Over all, our total engine and spare parts forecast shows production volume declining through 1995 then leveling off through the rest of the decade,\" Mr. O'Connor said. About 4,100 jobs are expected to be lost at Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut, and a total of 5,096 in the division. United Technologies employed 47,650 in the state before the cutbacks began last year. **********Beyond the problems in the military business, Mr. Daniell said the plant closings and job cutbacks were intended to make the company more efficient. \"We have begun a transformation more profound and more potent than any single event in the corporation's recent history,\" he said. Blow to the Economy **********Meeting with securities analysts in New York, Mr. Daniell conceded that announcements of plant closing and job reductions would not help pull the nation's economy out of recession. He defended the reductions as necessary for the company. \"This is correct for us at this time,\" he said. But he added, \"It is a dichotomy, I'll admit.\" **********The analysts seemed generally to be favorably impressed by the presentation by Mr. Daniell and other top company executives. \"The size of the charge was eye-popping, but the returns could be wonderful,\" said Howard Rubel of C. J. Lawrence. The company said the object of the changes was to increase profits to 18 percent of shareholders' equity by 1994 from the low to mid-teens recently. **********\"The actual announcement was anticlimactic; they had telegraphed it well in advance,\" said Michael Lauer of Kidder, Peabody. \"This is a company that is not likely to benefit from a pickup in the economy except for its automotive parts business.\" Most Cuts This Year **********United Technologies officials said the bulk of the job cuts, more than 7,000, would take place this year. But job reductions will continue at Pratt & Whitney through 1995. More than 1,700 jobs were cut at the company's corporate offices and the Otis elevator division in 1991, officials said. **********The company said the layoffs would save $440 million a year. Closing plants will add another $260 million a year and improvements in design, engineering and manufacturing will add the remaining $380 million in projected savings. **********Mr. Daniell said the company would seek to reduce the cost of developing products by seeking alliances with overseas companies.

A Bad Year Anywhere **********The special charges masked what would have been a disappointing fourth quarter and year for the company. Sagging sales of military engines and spare parts depressed fourth-quarter operating earnings at Pratt & Whitney to $138 million from $252 million. Since the division typically produced more than 50 percent of United Technologies' total profit, the corporation's fourth-quarter operating profit was down 14 percent, to $302 million from $351 million. **********For the year, Pratt & Whitney's problems were given as the main source of a 41 percent decline in operating earnings, to $968 million from $1.653 billion. **********The company said it would close its Pratt & Whitney overhaul and repair plant in Southington, Conn., but keep a separate manufacturing operation in the same town.

The Europeans' Approach **********Steel companies in Western Europe had wanted the American import restrictions renewed to block producers from East Asia and developing countries from gaining an even larger share of the American market, as well as to avoid the costs and risks of defending cases brought to the Commerce Department by American producers. If the American companies succeed in such cases, prohibitive duties could be imposed. **********The Administration wanted a pact by today to reassure domestic producers that the end to import limits would not expose them to large-scale imports of subsidized steel. **********Nearly a dozen domestic industry groups have retained Washington law firms that specialize in trade. The lawyers have begun drafting cases contending that imported steel is either being sold illegally below cost or being subsidized by foreign governments. \"The issue is not whether you'll have cases but how many,\" a lawyer for the industry said. **********Some industry groups may delay filing their cases for several months while waiting for the compilation of financial and production figures from 1991. Last year was a particularly bad one for the industry as measured by the criteria for trade cases, the lawyer said. **********Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, came close today to giving public encouragement to steelmakers to bring cases. With the termination of the import limits \"the steel industry, like every other industry, will be able to rely on trade laws to remedy unfair trade practices,\" she said. \"The United States will vigorously enforce those laws.\" **********The American steel industry had been divided on whether to seek continued limits on imports or take its chances at the Commerce Department. Most producers did not bother fighting the expiration of import restrictions for two reasons. They calculated that trade cases might result in even greater protection from imports. And they decided that their political resources were better saved to resist limitations on trade cases now under discussion in a separate 108-nation round of talks in Geneva. **********Pennsylvania steel producers, particularly makers of specialty steel, led a modest push for renewal of the import limits, and were joined by the United Steelworkers of America. **********In the last year only the quotas on specialty steel have actually limited imports. In other categories, imports have fallen short of the quotas, as the declining dollar and greater efficiency at American mills have made foreign steel less competitive. The Political Factors **********Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, who is up for re-election, strongly criticized the President's decision to allow the import limits to lapse. \"It certainly won't help\" the re-election prospects in Pennsylvania next November of President Bush and other Republicans, he added. **********Three days before the 1988 elections, Mr. Bush, who was the Vice President and the Republican nominee for President, reversed his position on steel import limits during a visit to Pennsylvania and endorsed a renewal of protection until a multilateral agreement on subsidies could be struck. **********The decision not to renew trade barriers this year regardless of the outcome in Geneva came at a meeting on Friday of senior officials from every Federal agency even remotely involved in trade policy, an American official said. **********Japanese officials said today that they would continue to monitor exports, The Associated Press reported from Tokyo. It is unclear whether other countries may continue complying with the lapsed agreements to avoid damaging trade relations with the United States. **********Also today, trade negotiators continued to seek agreements to expand American sales of paper in Japan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/03/world/israel-expelling-12-arabs-plo-warns-about-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1992-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 783, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel Expelling 12 Arabs; P.L.O.

Farouk Kaddoumi, who heads the Tunis-based political department of the P.L.O., said in Amman, Jordan, that the P.L.O. was asking the delegation not to go to Washington. **********Palestinians involved in the talks said the delegates had not decided to withdraw. \"We have not pulled out of the talks,\" a spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, Hanan Ashrawi, told Reuters. \"I deny media reports that we have.\" **********Faisal al-Husseini, a Palestinian leader in East Jerusalem and a principal adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team, attacked the announced expulsions as \"a continuation of Israel's policy to destroy the peace process.\"  U.S. Credibility Questioned **********Although he stopped well short of threatening a Palestinian boycott of the Washington talks, Mr. Husseini said in an interview late Thursday night that he regarded the matter \"very seriously\" and felt that it raised \"a question mark about the credibility of the American peace plan and the credibility of the United States itself.\" **********Since the start of the Palestinian uprising in December 1987, Israel has expelled 66 Arabs from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, not including those covered by the order Thursday. The Israeli argument is that this is a necessary tactic to deal with people accused of inciting anti-Israeli attacks. But the deportation procedure has been strongly criticized by the United States and other Western nations as a violation of human rights conventions. **********There had been no expulsions since last May, and the start of the peace talks on Oct. 30 encouraged speculation that the policy might be abandoned. **********But a spurt of armed attacks on Jewish settlers has produced a sharp settler response, including attacks on Arab villages in the West Bank and an increasingly confrontational approach toward the Israeli Government and its armed forces, both of which have been accused of not doing enough to protect the 110,000 Jews living in the territories. In turn, this activity has touched off charges from some officials, including on occasion Mr. Arens, that the settlers were dangerously taking the law into their own hands.  Settler Killed in Gaza **********But the pressure on the Government to act apparently became too great after the latest ambush, in which a 35-year-old settler, Doron Shorshan, was shot dead while driving near the Deir el Balah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. **********Mr. Shorshan, the first settler killed in Gaza since the start of the anti-Israel uprising, was buried on Thursday in Holon, a Tel Aviv suburb. **********In a steady downpour, other settlers moved three mobile homes to the place where he was shot in an attempt to create a new community, but according to radio reports, Mr. Arens ordered that they be removed, at least for now. **********The Defense Minister had objected to a similar protest settlement that went up in the West Bank after two Israelis were shot dead there in October. But as settlers pressed their point, Mr. Arens relented, and the new community has received tentative approval and seems likely to become permanent. **********An Israeli Army spokesman, Lieut. Col. Moshe Fogel, said the 12 Palestinians ordered expelled represent \"one of the largest groups, no doubt about it,\" to be affected by this sort of action. In most instances, those deported have been sent to Lebanon, he said, adding, \"The law says that you can't send them where they may be endangered.\" **********The 12 people were not identifed, but an army statement said they belonged to three factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization and to the Hamas movement of Islamic fundamentalists, who are particularly active in the Gaza Strip. \"Several of these persons were involved in terrorist activities, and others were involved in incitement,\" the statement said. **********Colonel Fogel said the Palestinians would be allowed to appeal the expulsion order to a military court and then also, if they choose, to the Israeli Supreme Court.

'A Guerrilla's Dream' **********In another complication to the plans to aid the people of Bosnia, officials said any mission to deliver relief supplies would have to range far beyond Sarajevo to areas where few if any outsiders have ventured in months. Maj. Gen. Lewis W. MacKenzie of Canada, the former United Nations military commander here, has described the winding mountain roads to those areas as \"a guerrilla's dream.\" **********The people of this city say they are aware that President Bush has emphasized that he wants to limit United States military involvement to avoid being dragged into a prolonged conflict like Vietnam. But many are hoping that once Western forces become involved, they will be drawn in deeper. **********\"It's exactly what we have been thinking: Let Bush come with humanitarian aid, take control of the roads, get his troops or his helicopters shot at, shoot back, and pretty soon he'll find he's fighting the same war as us,\" said a senior adviser to Bosnia's President. **********Bosnian officials, asked to list the places they consider in desperate need of food and medical supplies, cited Sarajevo, the towns of Zenica, Tuzla, Jajce and Bihac to the north and northwest of here, and half a dozen towns in eastern Bosnia where Serbian \"ethnic cleansing\" attacks have been fiercest. Of these, the most desperate appears to be Gorazde, 70 miles east of here by mountainous road, but the officials said many Muslims were going hungry in the mountain areas to which they have retreated outside Zvornik, Bratunac, Visegrad, Foca and Rogatica, among other towns. **********If the augmented relief effort contemplated by the Western powers were to try to reach all of those areas, or even some of them, control of several of the most strategic roads in Bosnia would be needed, roads that the Serbian forces use frequently for their military convoys and along which they have until now been reluctant to allow access to any outsiders. Two weeks ago, a relief convoy that tried to reach Gorazde under guarantees from the Serbian nationalists was forced to turn back after hitting land mines and coming under small-arms fire. **********While criticizing Mr. Bush's initiatives as inadequate, senior officials here emphasized that the food and medical supplies were valued, and even crucial in some respects. According to what they and managers of the Velepekara Bakery said about the dwindling supplies of flour, Sarajevo needs to start rebuilding reserves that have provided most of the staple food for this city's population of 400,000 throughout the four-month siege. **********The flour has been used to make bread and pasta, but the pasta making was suspended 10 days ago, the bakery manager said, to conserve flour for baking bread. Even if the United Nations stepped in and started delivering the 60 tons a day of flour that will be needed, the manager said, the bakery would still face increasingly dire problems as a result of shortages of diesel fuel. It is needed to power the ovens and run the delivery trucks and the water trucks that have carried 15 tankloads to the bakery each day since Serbian forces cut off most of the city's running water last month. **********The relief demands that could accumulate if the Security Council approves militarily protected overland convoys are enormous. Sarajevo's winter arrives in October, and the city is without glass for most of its windows, without coal or other heating fuels, and without the means to repair shell-blasted central heating stations that provide most of the high-rise apartment blocks in the city with hot water for radiators. **********Beyond this, the city has virtually no shops left functioning, and thus no clothing stores where the thousands who have lost their winter clothing in the Serbian attacks can replace it. **********Contemplating the undertaking that the United Nations appears to be on the verge of assuming, an official it would be easier for Mr. Bush to approve the bombing of the Serbian gun positions around the city and the lifting of the United Nations arms embargo. **********\"If he continues to insist that his only responsibility is to feed us, what he will be doing is prolonging our agony,\" said Mustafa Pamuk, the chief official of the Sarajevo city government. \"In effect, he'll be extending the safari on which the Serbian forces have engaged, a hunt whose purpose is to track us down, one by one, and kill us.\" **********On the streets of Sarajevo, and in the offices of officials of the Bosnian Government, the pronouncements made by President Bush in recent days have been widely criticized as inadequate. Above all, this has been because of Mr. Bush's insistence on limiting new United States involvement to the provision of augmented relief supplies. **********Because Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic Presidential nominee, has said that he would favor bombing and lifting the arms embargo on the Bosnian Government, he is enjoying a sudden popularity here. **********\"Clinton yes! Bush no!\" a 12-year-old boy named Nihad said to a reporter who halted his car to buy a newspaper along Marshal Tito Street in the heart of the city.

That is particularly true of provisions that assign to a new private company such things as machinery, aircraft or buildings still technically owned by the state.  'Goods Have to Move' **********\"Russian businessmen have gone ahead of the law, but goods have to move,\" said Armen Kazaryan, a 38-year-old broker whose company trades such items as timber, cotton, oil and tires on Russia's not-yet-legal commodity exchanges. And in that spirit, Russians are signing thousands of contracts, from short-form agreements for the sale of Mr. Kazaryan's commodities to elaborate documents specifying the terms of joint ventures between Russians and Americans. **********\"What we do is write a statute book,\" said A. James Redway, head of the Moscow office of Coudert Brothers, one of the American law firms that has set up shop here to earn fees writing such agreements. \"In New York, you don't have to say that much in a contract because the obligations are clear in laws and in precedent, but here you have to spell out everything.\" **********Even then, two concepts -- mutual benefit and trust -- have come to play a major role in these early days of Russian capitalism. What these concepts come down to is this: If both parties to an agreement are benefiting from the deal, presumably they will not break the contract.  Calculating the Risk **********But that usually means both parties have to make money almost from day one. Without solid contract law, it is a rare business executive, Russian or foreign, who is willing to risk investing, say, $100 million to construct a modern appliance factory that will not generate revenue for a year. In the meantime, despite what the contract might say, the factory under construction could be seized or never allowed to open, and the $100 million could be lost. **********\"In theory, our courts recognize the enforcement of many contracts, as long as they don't contradict existing laws, but there are cases where contracts are simply not acknowledged,\" said Sergei S. Alekseyev, the chairman of the Inter-Republic Research Center on Private Law, which is drafting legislation intended to address this problem. **********The boilerplate agreement that Mr. Kazaryan and his fellow traders sign by the hundreds each day is among those without standing in a Russian court. And that will remain the case until legislaton is enacted by the Russian Parliament formally legalizing the trade exchanges. **********Nevertheless, the agreements underscore what Mr. Kazaryan describes as the system of trust on which commodity trading is based -- a trust that is nevertheless violated, with buyers often reneging on payment. They go unpunished, although \"there is already a blacklist of people with whom we don't deal anymore,\" Mr. Kazaryan said. **********Mr. Redway's clients face different pitfalls, and they rely heavily on mutual benefit to make a contract stick. He describes the sort of deal for which he writes a contracts: A Houston real estate developer, wanting a Moscow hotel that would cater to foreign travelers paying in dollars, selects a shoe factory as a site. The factory, a money loser, sits on city-owned land \"allocated\" to it by the Moscow government. **********The developer establishes a joint venture with the factory's managers, who \"cause the government to reallocate the land for hotel use,\" Mr. Redway says, perhaps offering bribes to city officials in the process. The city government, in return, gets a monthly lease payment, in dollars, which can be used to repair streets, pay salaries and the like. **********The Houston developer, making an investment of under $10 million to convert the factory to a hotel, soon generates dollar revenue. And his Russian partners get their share, \"which makes them ecstatic,\" Mr. Redway says. There is, in sum, mutual benefit. **********Neither the defunct Soviet civil code nor those surviving in the new independent republics envisioned such deals, so Mr. Redway, a Princeton-educated American with Soviet lawyers on his staff, spells out everything in the contract: the obligations of all the partners in the joint venture, the right to lease the land, the city government's obligations and the designation of a court to enforce the agreement if something goes wrong. Disputes involving foreigners have usually been settled by an arbitration association in Stockholm. **********Contracts existed in the old Soviet Union, but primarily to carry out central planning, Mr. Alekseyev said. A Government plan authorized an auto company, for example, to purchase steel from a mill, stipulating the price to be paid, the quantity and the delivery dates. Contracts ratified the deal, \"but every provision was dictated from above,\" Mr. Alekseyev said. \"The order from the center had as much authority as the contract.\" **********The old Soviet Union also had enforcement procedures, primarily a network of arbitration boards at the national level and within the Soviet republics. Those within the old Soviet republics survive in the new independent republics. Mr. Kazaryan's commodity sales agreement cites such boards as the enforcing body once the exchanges themselves are legally recognized. **********But such boards, whether in Russia or Stockholm, will most likely have difficulty ruling on the right to use equipment or property that comes into a private venture from the public sector. The cloudy status of such assets of the former Communist government is a major chapter in one joint venture contract put together by Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher & Flom, the New York law firm active in Wall Street merger deals in the 1980's and now assisting in deals in Moscow.  Until the Music Stops **********The joint venture, an 18-month-old air freight operation, brings together a British company, Heavylift Cargo Ltd., and a Russian group, Volga Dnepr Joint Stock Company. Volga Dnepr contributes three giant Antonov An-124 cargo jets, with pilots, and the British do the marketing, lining up hauling charters all over the world. **********A state-owned aircraft manufacturing company that bought shares in Volga Dnepr contributes one of the An-124's, and the military leases two others to Volga Dnepr, which in turn leases them to the joint venture. **********The contract details this ownership chain and, with supporting documents, makes the case for the joint venture's right to use the planes, although Bruce Buck, a Skadden, Arps partner, says no one can be sure that a transfer of property will hold up. **********And if it does not? \"Well, we've made money in the interim, and if the deal stops, O.K.,\" Mr. Buck said. \"Or, to say it a little differently, we'll dance together until the music stops.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/23/business/consumer-rates-gain-in-tax-exempt-yields-reverses-a-two-week-slide.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1992-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 506, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gain in Tax-Exempt Yields Reverses a Two-Week Slide", "print_headline": "CONSUMER RATES; Gain in Tax-Exempt Yields Reverses a Two-Week Slide", "body_text": " **********Yields on money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed in the latest week, as institutional and retail investors scrambled for the best returns. **********For the week ended Tuesday, tax-exempt money fund yields showed substantial gains after two weeks of declines.

Taxable Funds **********The assets of taxable money market funds grew by $1.3 billion for the week ended yesterday, to $498.9 billion. As in the previous week, institutional assets accounted for all of the gain, growing by $2 billion, to $165.7 billion. This, however, was slightly offset by a $700 million decline in retail assets, to $333.2 billion. **********Analysts noted that low market rates were making money fund yields attractive. But as the money fund yields eventually match market yields, they said, expect institutional investors to move elsewhere for higher yields. **********The average seven-day compounded taxable yield slipped 4 basis points, to 3.69 percent, with the simple yield down the same amount, to 3.62 percent.

At 200,000, the number of tourist visits here has doubled in the last four years, slightly outstripping the number of inhabitants. But even as plans to expand nature tourism proceed, concerns have been raised that the marketing of Belize as one of the world's least spoiled lands may end up undoing the very nature that is being sold to avid outsiders. **********At the Chan Chich Lodge, biologists laud the care taken to preserve the surroundings. Hunting and fishing are prohibited. The number of guests is strictly limited by the availability of only 12 thatched-roofed cabanas. Here, guides accompany visitors on hikes over miles of jungle trails that wend their way around 1,500-year-old Mayan burial mounds. **********But elsewhere in the country's interior, the success of places like Chan Chich have drawn less conscientious imitators. Along the wilds of the Macal River, another nature lodge that is given high marks for the care it has shown for the surrounding environment has seen over a dozen copycat lodges sprout up in the last couple of years to offer hikes and canoe rides amid a greenery of Amazonian splendor. To accommodate urban tourists, some have razed undergrowth down to the riverbanks, leading to rapid soil erosion and damage to the aquatic life. **********But for many, the best example of the environmental degradation in Belize is the development of its coast. Well before the advent of eco-tourism, Belize's extraordinary reefs made it a favorite destination for divers, and sprawling developments were built on the most popular keys. Some of the favorite reefs began to die. **********Belize has responded to the reef damage by suspending new construction on the keys pending an environmental impact study and is considering measures like raising fees for divers and limiting their numbers. **********\"One thing we have learned is that the principles for eco-tourism are not firmly established yet,\" said the Minister of Tourism, Glen D.

In addition, several companies, including Motorola, the state's biggest employer, bought $8 million in prepaid tickets and said they would replenish the amount as it was used up. **********While public and community help for airlines has not been uncommon, it has become much more visible in recent years -- probably because communities have increasingly felt the economic impact of one airline after another liquidating or being swallowed by bigger rivals. **********Kiwi International Airlines, for example, which is based in Newark and started flying in September, received a $1.5 million loan guarantee from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. **********Northwest Airlines, with headquarters in Minnesota, provides its home state with some 18,000 jobs and $2 billion in wages, benefits and taxes.

The winner was Indianapolis, which together with the State of Indiana offered $270 million in cash grants, said Dennis Rosebrough, director of public affairs for the Indianapolis Airport Authority. In return, he said, United agreed to provide 6,300 jobs. **********The $1 million state loan to America West was granted by the Arizona Commerce and Economic Development Commission, established in 1989 to offer low-interest loans to new or expanding businesses. **********\"States go out of their way to chase smokestack industries, and we think it's more important to keep existing industries,\" said Bruce Sankey, director of communications and research for the Arizona Department of Commerce. \"America West is crucial to Arizona's economic competitiveness because it supports 7,000 jobs directly, and businesses relocate here because of the wonderful, low-cost airline service.\" **********A study published earlier this year by the Arizona State University college of business estimated that America West, with headquarters in Tempe, was responsible for a $3.4 billion infusion, direct and indirect, into the Arizona economy in 1990. It is responsible for about $100 million in purchases in Phoenix alone, said Shirley Richard, chairman of the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce. And it is the biggest employer based in Arizona.

The Conservative majority in 1987 was 101 seats. **********Neil Kinock, the Labor Party leader, bitterly conceded defeat, saying, \"Now the Conservatives will continue with the decline.\" He won in his constituency, Islwyn, South Wales. **********\"The whole country deserves better,\" he said, \"and we will work to ensure that the day will come when, with a Labor government, the country will get better in its spirit, in its soul, in its fortune, in the chances it gives to its children, the care it gives to its old and to its infirm.\" **********Labor's deputy leader, Roy Hattersley, said: \"I'm surprised. I simply don't know how the British mind works to produce this result.\" **********This was Mr. Kinnock's second attempt to defeat the Conservatives in nearly nine years as leader of the opposition. **********Mr. Major did not rush to claim victory, even after the BBC and Independent Television News had predicted a Conservative majority of close to 20 seats, confounding poll predictions that no party would win a majority. **********Among the many losers in Mr. Major's camp was the Conservative Party Chairman, Christopher F. Patten, who lost his seat in Bath to a Liberal Democrat, 25,718 votes to 21,950. **********Glenda Jackson, the actress, won for Labor over the Conservatives in the north London seat of Hampstead and Highgate, 19,193 to 17,753. **********Despite the Conservatives' losses, it appeared that Mr. Major would not need to form a coalition government with smaller parties in Britain or Northern Ireland to reach a majority. Liberal Democrats Falter **********The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Paddy Ashdown, had looked for major gains in this election, and was prepared to demand major changes in the electoral system as the price of cooperation with either of the other parties if they needed to form a coalition with him. Early this morning, it appeared that his party might win about 18 percent of the vote nationwide, with fewer than the 22 seats it had in the last Parliament. **********Final results from all 651 contests in Parliamentary constituencies in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will not be available until Saturday. **********Mr. Ashdown observed that Labor had lost its fourth consecutive election to the Conservatives. But the result indicated that he would not make much headway on his demands for the British voting system to be changed to allocate his party more Parliamentary seats. What he wanted was a move to a proportional representation system giving all parties the number of seats corresponding to the percentages they win in the national vote. **********\"The one thing that is clear about this election is that the Conservatives have won it,\" said Michael Heseltine, Mr. Major's Environment Secretary. **********The last time an election was very close, in 1974, Prime Minister Edward Heath of the Conservative Party failed to win even a narrow majority and, four days after the Feb. 28 election, gave up to let the Labor leader, Harold Wilson, form a minority Labor Government. Mr. Wilson called a new election and won a bare majority that October. **********Mr. Major's Conservatives were predicted to lose seats in Scotland, where Labor holds a comfortable majority, but they apparently did not. **********Mr. Major, who is 49 years old, voted in his local constituency, Huntingdon, on Thursday morning after eating a widely photographed breakfast of tea, toast, margarine and marmalade. **********Mr. Kinnock, who is 50, voted in south Wales. \"The sun is out,\" he said there. \"So are the Tories.\" **********And Mr. Ashdown, who is 51, cast his ballot in his southwest England village, Norton-sub-Hamdon. \"Polling days always make me nervous,\" he said. **********Britain's 43.2 million voters were called upon to decide what they wanted for themselves at home, not great international issues like the future of Europe, how to deal with the collapse of the Soviet Union, or relations between rich and poor countries. Recession the Big Issue **********The main underlying issue was the British recession, the second in 13 years of Conservative government. With unemployment at 9.4 percent and rising, Mr. Kinnock accused Mr. Major's party of bringing on recession with a policy of high interest rates in 1988 and 1989 after a boom that sent inflation soaring. **********Mr. Major said the Conservatives were best qualified to lead the country out of it, but Mr. Kinnock said Labor would have a more active economic strategy for investment and growth. **********Mr. Kinnock, fighting his second national campaign as Labor leader, took his party into battle with a new set of policies that bore little resemblance to its positions in the early 1980's, or his own then. Labor this time was foursquare behind a strong British defense, supported a British nuclear deterrent, and backed most of the laws reining in the power of British labor unions that Mrs. Thatcher had passed to prevent a repetition of the strikes and economic paralysis of the 1970's. **********The Labor Party opened its campaign a month ago with a promise to spend more money on Government services it said the Conservatives had neglected in order to cut taxes over the years, from a maximum rate of 83 percent when they took over in 1979 to 40 percent now. Competing Tax Plans **********Labor pledged to reverse that for the wealthy, redistributing income by raising taxes on all people earning more than the equivalent of $36,644 per year, charging 9 percent social security tax on everything they made and raising the maximum tax rate to 50 percent, plus social security, on incomes above $69,600. **********The Conservatives introduced a tax cut with the greatest benefit for the lowest paid just before they called the election, reducing the rate on the first $3,480 of income from 25 to 20 percent. Mr. Major said they would try in coming years to bring all middle-income taxpayers down to the 20 percent rate. **********Close behind the recession issue was concern about the $62.8 billion National Health Service, which Mr. Kinnock said the Conservatives were weakening in favor of private medical care for those who could afford it. **********\"If that happens we do not need to speculate on the future,\" Mr. Kinnock said at a rally in northwest England a few days ago. \"We only have to look to a country which is even now searching for a way out of the health marketplace, the United States of America where, as the former chairman of the British Medical Association put it last week, 'God help you if you are poor and sick in America.' \" **********Labor promised to put an additional $1.74 billion into the health service over the next two years if it was elected, and to undo the management changes the Conservatives had begun to introduce to give some hospitals and general practitioners more control over their own budgets. **********The future of the European Community and Britain's role in it played hardly any role in the campaign. Separatists in Scotland **********In Scotland, the main underlying issue was more autonomy from central Government control in London, whoever won.

Sefer Halilovic held one finger in his ear to block the blast of heavy artillery shells exploding less than 100 yards away from the Government headquarters in central Sarajevo today, and spoke urgently into his walkie-talkie. **********\"This is your chance, Juka,\" he said. **********A mile away, a 35-year-old former debt collector and repossession man, Juka Prazina, crouched behind a wall near the high school for police cadets, 12 hours into a battle for the heights of Vraca that overlook the heart of Sarajevo. The battle, begun at dawn today, was one of the fiercest since Serbian forces began their siege of the city two months ago, and Mr. Prazina's volunteer fighters were barely a rifle shot away from taking the heights. **********In the war for Sarajevo, the Serbian forces in the mountains surrounding the city have what amounts to a free-fire zone for a devastating array of artillery guns, tanks, mortars and antiaircraft weapons that are used as cannon against ground targets. **********Below them, in the bowl of the city, men like Mr. Prazina, many of them part-time fighters in jeans and down vests and running shoes, and most with only automatic rifles and pistols, struggle to retake the heights and silence the guns that are reducing much of this 500-year-old capital to rubble. Defenders Launch Attack **********Today, the defenders mounted a counteroffensive, using one of two captured 1960's-vintage tanks to fire across the Miljacka River from a park beside the Presidency, the site of the Government headquarters, and following up with an infantry assault across the river and into Serbian-held territory in the districts of Grbavica and Vraca. **********At nightfall, they had advanced several hundred yards into the Serbian strongholds and were threatening the last Serbian dugouts in the Vraca heights, around the burnt-out shell of a hotel built for the 1984 Winter Olympic Games. **********The intensity of today's fighting, in which at least a dozen people were killed by Serbian artillery barrages against civilian districts in the older part of the city, closest to the guns on the Vraca slopes, made officials here doubtful of the cease-fire that the Serbian nationalist leader, Radovan Karadzic, said he would observe beginning on Monday. **********For now, the battle for the Bosnian capital shows no sign of relenting. The defenders, running short of ammunition and desperate to break the Serbian encirclement before starvation sets in among a civilian population that is close to exhausting supplies of food and water, have fought every day this week to break through the siege, taking heavy casualties. **********The Serbian forces, more than a week into their continuous bombardments that have devastated every quarter of the city, have responded to the defenders' advances by attempting breakthroughs of their own into the heart of the city. **********The situation has placed new strains on Major Halilovic, a 40-year-old artillery veteran who quit the federal Yugoslav Army last September to protest the Serbian-led forces' attacks on towns like Vukovar in Croatia, where similar weapons were used to level the city and killed and wounded thousands of its inhabitants. **********Now, Major Halilovic faces some of his former comrades-in-arms from Yugoslavia's artillery battalions, who have changed their badges to support their claims that they are no longer under Yugoslav command but part of an autonomous force controlled by the Serbian nationalist leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********The new Bosnian force with which the major defends this city is little more than a ragtag army. **********\"It's what you see -- a citizens' army,\" the major said, listing the motley assortment of men he commands. His list included taxi drivers, chefs, soccer players, merchants, high school and college students, university professors, journalists, musicians, bakers, poets and dancers. According to senior Government officials, the defenders number fewer than 5,000 all told, and by Major Halilovic's account, only 400 to 500 are professional soldiers who crossed over from the Yugoslav forces. Forged From Militias **********It is a force that is less than two months old, and it grew from a motley assemblage of individual militias with names like \"Dragon of Bosnia,\" \"Alf's Army\" and \"King Tomislav's Dragoons\" that were formed when rumors of impending war first swept across Sarajevo after Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its independence in March. **********\"They fight with their hearts,\" said Mr. Ejup Ganic, an American-educated engineer who is one of the Vice Presidents of the Bosnian republic. Mr. Ganic compared the siege of Sarajavo to that of Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, by Nazi troops in World War II and to the anti-Communist uprising in the streets of Budapest in 1956. He said the similarities lay in the fact that ordinary people, facing overwhelming military superiority, were fighting for their survival and for what he called their \"democratic liberties.\" A Multi-Ethnic Force **********The point is one that is insistently made by Sarajevo's defenders. Because the Serbian forces say they are fighting to carve out what they've called \"ethnically pure\" enclaves in Sarajevo and elsewhere where they can govern themselves, the fighting here has frequently been described by Western officials as an ethnic conflict. But that characterization has been rejected by those under siege. **********Major Halilovic, who is a Muslim Slav, heads the command structure that includes three deputies, one each from the Muslim Slav, Serbian and Croatian population groups. His fighters broadly reflect the ethnic makeup of Sarajevo's population of 560,000 before the fighting -- more than half Muslim Slavs, but with large numbers of Serbs and Croats. **********\"This is not a conflict of one ethnic group against another,\" Major Halilovic said. \"It's a war by extreme Serbian nationalists against the rest of the Bosnian population, who would like to live together in a mixed, democratic society.\" **********Despite the odds, the Bosnian fighters seem convinced that they could not lose to the Serbian forces, even though all concede that a continuation of the battle would result in the destruction of Sarajevo. **********Still, Major Halilovic said the only hope that his fighters could win the battle, as opposed to holding out while the city crumbled around them, was that the United States would respond to appeals by Sarajevo leaders for an American bombing attack on the Serbian heavy weapons around the city. **********\"We are not asking for American paratroopers,\" he said. \"The rest, the Bosnian territorial forces, can do for themselves.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/21/world/shamir-retains-grasp-on-likud-reins.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1992-02-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 833, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shamir Retains Grasp on Likud Reins", "print_headline": "Shamir Retains Grasp on Likud Reins", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir staved off challenges to his Likud Party primacy today, winning a mandate to carry on as leader for June elections against a Labor Party that hopes its exile in opposition is about to end under the guidance of a new chief, Yitzhak Rabin. **********Mr. Shamir won less than half the votes of some 2,800 members of the Central Committee as he defeated two prominent and ambitious Cabinet members who were less interested in unseating him this time than in establishing future claims on the leadership. **********Mr. Shamir's victory was hardly overwhelming, and he would have been forced into a runoff had the party not changed its rules thise week to lower the threshold for a first-round victory from 50 percent to 40 percent. Nonetheless, he won comfortably enough, and the outcome was never in doubt. **********A final ballot count today gave him 46.5 percent of the votes that were cast on Thursday. Foreign Minister David Levy had his future hopes brightened by finishing second with 31.2 percent, ahead of Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, who had 22.3 percent.  Labor's Bigger Splash **********But as important as the Likud balloting was -- especially with opinion polls giving the party the edge in parliamentary elections scheduled for June 23 -- it was eclipsed by Mr. Rabin's dramatic toppling of Shimon Peres as Labor leader in a primary on Wednesday. **********Mr. Rabin's victory was made official on Thursday after seesaw vote-counting that had left it unclear for a long time whether he would be able to get the 40 percent needed to avoid a runoff, in which Mr. Peres's chances might have improved significantly. In the end, Mr. Rabin, like Mr. Peres a former Prime Minister, cleared the hurdle by half a percentage point, hardly a landslide but good enough. **********With the party races out of the way, the stage was set for what many commentators say could be Israel's most important election ever. Moreover, some political scientists are convinced that the emergence of \"the two Yitzhaks\" as leaders improved the chances for reviving the Likud-Labor partnership that governed from 1984 to 1990. **********They argue that Mr. Rabin is more of a vote-getter than Mr. Peres and will weaken Likud by siphoning off some of its supporters on the moderate right. In that sort of situation, the reasoning goes, the parties are more likely to turn to each other than to try, probably in vain, to form coalitions on their own with the help of smaller parties. **********And Mr. Shamir and Mr. Rabin have proved in the past that they can work together, while Shamir-Peres animosities run deep.  Annihilation or Coalition? **********\"This seriously increases the likelihood of a national unity government,\" said Gadi Wolfsfeld, a political science professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. **********For the moment, however, both parties are predictably emphasizing their intention to defeat the other camp, not work with it. **********\"We'll beat Likud,\" the 69-year-old Mr. Rabin declared in a voice turned to gravel from years of chain-smoking. **********As for Mr. Shamir, 76, he described the contest as one that puts \"two world views\" against one another, and said that party differences were paramount. \"I don't see any difference between a situation in which I have to contend with Rabin or Peres,\" he said. **********The elections come at a time of great change and uncertainty for Israel, amid peace talks, an uncommonly frayed relationship with the United States, and a strained economy. **********As is usually the case, much will revolve around the issue of Israeli security: Who can guarantee it best, and how many concessions can safely be offered the Arabs? **********In this regard, Mr. Levy's second-place showing -- coupled perhaps with Mr. Shamir's less-than-dazzling victory -- could be important because the Foreign Minister has been the most enthusiastic supporter of the peace process among senior Likud members. **********It could have the effect, some commentators argue, of producing a more accommodating approach on autonomy for Palestinians in the occupied territories. **********That is something Mr. Rabin could accept as well. He and his party favor autonomy and unlike Likud, a freeze on Jewish settlements in the territories and the exchange of some land for peace. In substance, Mr. Rabin's views were not greatly different from Mr. Peres's, but the new party leader is seen by many as the one who would strike the tougher bargain. **********As such, he is considered likely to appeal to center-right voters who might otherwise line up with the Likud. Then again, Mr. Rabin could cost his party some votes among relative doves, who might feel more comfortable now siding with a new federation planned by three small leftist parties. **********In any event, no one expects wild mood swings among the electorate. That rarely happens anyway, as the near-balance between Likud and Labor in the last two elections proved. **********In Israel's fractured politics, the needle on the meter has to move only a few degrees to shift enough parliamentary seats to determine which party is called on to form a new government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/07/world/trade-discord-persists-as-bush-arrives-in-japan.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1992-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1241, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trade Discord Persists as Bush Arrives in Japan", "print_headline": "Trade Discord Persists as Bush Arrives in Japan", "body_text": " **********President Bush began his visit to Japan today in an atmosphere of contention and confusion, with negotiators for the United States and Japan in sharp disagreement over an American demand for Japan to buy more American automobiles and parts. **********At issue are both the amount of cars and parts that Japanese auto makers and dealers would purchase and how the commitment would be described in light of Tokyo's insistence that purchases should be left up to Japanese businesses and not to the Government, officials on both sides said. **********\"There is no agreement, and we're still skirmishing,\" a Japanese official said, speaking with some exasperation. He said the disputes could not be resolved until after negotiations with Mr. Bush, his top advisers and 18 corporate leaders on the final and most important leg of his four-nation Asia trip. **********Nevertheless, the White House has expressed confidence that in four days of trade talks the President will be successful in achieving his goal of winning concessions from Tokyo that will appear, at least, to prop up America's slumping economy. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is said to be eager to give Mr. Bush some of what he seeks.  [ Page A8. ] **********Mr. Bush came to Japan, the final country in his Asian tour, from Seoul, South Korea. The Government there canceled annual military maneuvers it was due to hold with United States forces, after receiving indications that North Korea was ready to allow inspections of secret nuclear installations. The President said during his Korean visit that the end of the 40-year-old division of the Korean peninsula was finally within reach.  [ Page A8. ] **********A principal area of disagreement with Japan concerned earlier announcements by Japanese auto manufacturers that they would raise American purchases to about $17 billion by 1994 from the current $9 billion. **********A Japanese official said on Monday that the United States was demanding that this target be doubled or tripled. An American official denied that American demands were so sweeping, but he added, \"We're shooting for Japan to up the ante a little bit more.\" **********There was considerable confusion about whether Japan would agree to any kind of target or quota on automobile parts. Early in the day, the Minister of International Trade and Industry, Kozo Watanabe, said Japan would set specific targets for imports of American-made autos and auto parts. **********But later, the deputy minister, Yuji Tanahashi, contradicted him, saying the Government was not asking the automobile industry for targets, but only to consider \"various forms of cooperation.\" He added, \"I guess the minister's remarks are a sort of wishful thinking.\" **********The Japanese were said to be especially resistant to demands that targets be set for the purchase of American cars, since they would ultimately have to be purchased by consumers, who are free to buy what they want. American models now account for less than one-half of 1 percent of the 5.1 million cars sold annually in Japan. **********Japan was, however, reportedly preparing some incentives to get dealers to handle American cars, although there was widespread skepticism that this would ease consumer distaste for American cars. **********American cars are widely perceived here as being inferior in quality, too big and with too few concessions to Japan's narrow roads and to the fact that the Japanese drive on the left side of the road. European cars are much more popular in Japan than American cars. Resentment and Concern **********Japan's accessions in part to the American demands are being carried out in an atmosphere of some resentment, coupled with concern that something be done for Mr. Bush to head off even worse trade pressures or threats of sanctions from Congress or the President's Democratic rivals. **********\"This is crazy,\" a Japanese official said. \"If consumers don't buy the final products, are all these cars and parts going to end up being dumped in the gutter? But we just have to do something.\" **********In a separate development reflecting the deepening sense of urgency over Mr. Bush's trip, it was announced that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady would fly to Japan to be with the President. That fueled speculation that broader financial issues and policies would be discussed. **********All the American demands are viewed in Japan as resulting from political pressures in the United States, prompting a desire in Japan to help President Bush, who is seen here as basically opposed to protectionism and to the anti-Japanese retaliation advocated by many Democrats. **********Intense talks have taken place behind the scenes in recent days between the Government and auto industry leaders in particular, since automobiles and parts account for three-quarters of the $41 billion American trade deficit with Japan. **********On Monday Prime Minister Miyazawa again called on Japanese auto manufacturers to show some flexibility and, in effect, to help bail out the American car industry -- and also President Bush -- at a time of deepening economic woes in the United States. **********\"Japanese auto manufacturers may have some difficulties in meeting the request of the Government to do more than they have been doing,\" he told a group of American reporters. \"But I think they are understanding to the need to contribute to the solution of the American problems. **********\"I think I can persuade them that it is in their own interest in the longer term to do so,\" he added. **********Sounding a familiar theme, Mr. Miyazawa said that the Japanese must act, not to open markets that are closed, but out of a sense of obligation for past American generosity to the nation it defeated in World War II. **********\"It's over 40 years that Japan has benefited from the friendship of the United States, and it's about time we reciprocate,\" he said. \"We'd like to be a friend in need.\" **********Mr. Miyazawa's comments, couching Japanese actions as acts of generosity or compassion, have left a bitter taste for some Americans and some Japanese. A commentator recently said it was as if Japan were being asked to make reparations payments 45 years after its war defeat. Some Implicit Criticism **********While sounding a basically conciliatory note, Mr. Miyazawa also rejected recent comments by President Bush and others that Japanese trade practices had contributed to the American recession. **********\"External trade is contributing positively, not negatively, to your growth,\" he said, explaining that Japanese imports of American products had grown by 70 percent since 1987, a far higher growth rate than exports to the United States. **********The Prime Minister, who is a former finance minister, also implicitly criticized American economic policies, saying that the recession was attributable to indebtedness by consumers and businesses, weakness of banks and high interest rates resulting from the American budget deficit. **********Spokesmen for the Japanese automobile manufacturers and dealers said that they were ready to cooperate with Mr. Miyazawa and other Government leaders, but they criticized the United States, saying it had not done its part to sell its cars in Japan or cater to Japanese consumer tastes. **********\"Japanese auto dealers are ready to sell U.S.-made cars if they meet Japanese consumers' preferences and if dealers are guaranteed appropriate profits,\" said Kenichiro Ueno, president of the Japan Automobile Dealers Association."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/22/world/israelis-to-vote-facing-challenges-fearing-stalemate.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1992-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1554, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAELIS TO VOTE, FACING CHALLENGES, FEARING STALEMATE", "print_headline": "ISRAELIS TO VOTE, FACING CHALLENGES, FEARING STALEMATE", "body_text": " **********When Israelis vote on Tuesday, they will determine the shape of a new government to shepherd them through what may be some of the biggest changes in their history. **********Yet paradoxically, the final weekend of the parliamentary election campaign ended today with the politicians having discussed few of the dominant issues in any depth. **********And as important as this vote is, opinion polls strongly suggest that Israelis may end up with a stalemate. **********These surveys consistently put the opposition Labor Party ahead of the governing Likud, but without any guarantee of sufficient strength to stitch together a workable coalition with small left-wing and religious parties. Likud, even if it should confound the poll takers by getting more votes than Labor, would be similarly hard-pressed to form a sturdy parliamentary majority with the far right and with the same religious parties Labor would court.  Revival of Coalition Seen **********As a result, many political experts predict that Israel will end up with a revival of the broad coalition of the two major parties that prevailed uneasily and often ineffectually through much of the last decade. **********Whatever happens on Tuesday -- and polls here are often imperfect guides -- it will simply be the opening bell for weeks of negotiations over possible alliances, always necessary in Israel because no single party has ever managed to win a majority in the 120-member Parliament. Like sausage-making, it is not a pretty process to watch, tending to be laden with blatant deals and even payoffs. **********It raises serious questions even before the fact about how stable the new government will be to tackle some of the most important diplomatic and economic challenges this country has ever faced.  Touching on Bedrock Issues **********Above all, it is involved for the first time in wide-ranging peace negotiations with the Palestinians and neighboring Arab nations, touching on bedrock issues of land and security. **********With the cold war over, Israel's relationship with the United States is in flux, and many Israelis worry that the Americans have turned inward and away from eternally messy foreign problems like the Middle East. **********Domestically, the country is at a crossroads, having recently absorbed 360,000 arrivals from the former Soviet Union, the equivalent of nearly 10 percent of the Israeli Jewish population. Culturally, these highly educated newcomers will be an asset of incalculable proportions in the future. For now, however, they are an economic headache. There are not nearly enough jobs for them, and Israelis have watched nervously as overall unemployment has climbed to 11.5 percent. **********Many Israelis are fed up, and while they are often unable to put their finger precisely on what troubles them, they sense that the country is not being run right. They are people like Shlomo Aked, who lives in southern Tel Aviv. **********Normally, his working-class neighborhood is fertile territory for Likud, the right-wing party that has been in power for 15 years. This time, Mr. Aked, who basically considers himself a Likud supporter, says it is time to let the party sit on the bench for a while. **********\"They take all this money and give it to Hebron,\" he said, referring to a town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank that is a center for ardently nationalistic Jewish settlers. \"What do I care about Hebron? When was the last time I was in Hebron, or in Nablus? What I care about is my neighborhood. The money doesn't go to the right places.\"  Hoping for a Few New Seats **********Labor hopes that there are tens of thousands like him ready to switch allegiances. Its strategists are not looking for seismic shifts, for that rarely happens in the Israeli electorate of 3.4 million people. Rather, they hope to lure perhaps 100,000 to 120,000 votes from Likud -- enough to win an extra four or five parliamentary seats, putting Labor in first place and giving it the first crack at forming a governing coalition. **********Labor has also been helped mightily in the polls by the Russian newcomers, who resent their joblessness and who say by margins of as high as 4 to 1 that they are ready to punish Likud for not having done enough to smooth the entry into their new society. **********With people who have lived here longer, Labor's sales pitch is not its platform, which differs from Likud's in its calls for reduced settlement-building in occupied lands and for territorial concessions in exchange for peace with the Arabs. Instead, Labor has staked its future on its leader of the last four months, Yitzhak Rabin, a lackluster Prime Minister from the 1970's who nonetheless enjoys more popularity than the incumbent Likud leader, Yitzhak Shamir. **********Both men, whose combined age is 146, are studies in gray, so lacking in magnetism that neither one would set off an airport security detector. But many Israelis have high regard for Mr. Rabin, a former army commander and no-nonsense Defense Minister whom they consider a solid protector of Israel's best interests. While many traditional Likud supporters find Labor as a whole too soft on security matters, they find Mr. Rabin reassuring -- a safe way for them to register a protest vote without feeling that they may put the country at risk. **********This inherent division between a relatively dovish party and hawkish leader has contributed to a blurring of important issues. Most were scarcely debated in the campaign, which was uncommonly tame by Israeli standards, touching off discussions among Israelis about whether they had become appallingly apathetic or rather so politically mature that they no longer punch out those who disagree with them. **********Mr. Rabin talked often about eliminating \"political settlements\" in the territories and shifting money to social needs in Israel proper. But he said barely a word about where exactly the money would go or how specifically he would invigorate an economy that he calls anemic. **********Similarly, Mr. Shamir, who has championed settlement-building and presided over greatly accelerated construction in the last two years, played down the issue, apparently in recognition that his program is not popular with many Israelis. Virtually invisible was a related matter that had preoccupied Israel for months: the Bush Administration's refusal to provide $10 billion in housing loan guarantees because of Mr. Shamir's settlement policy. **********Political commentators say the lack of real ideological conflict shows that the party leaders recognize that they may soon be working together. In fact, both men give every sign of being more comfortable with each other than with their natural coalition partners to the left and the right. Gains on Far Right **********In looking at where disaffected Likud voters will go, political experts say it is far from certain that they will turn to Labor. **********Many seem to be moving even further to the right, with polls showing substantial gains for two established parties on the far right, Tsomet and Moledet, which are both opposed to territorial compromise. Young voters are said to be moving to the extremes in both directions, in particular toward Tsomet, which appeals to nonreligious territory hawks, and to Meretz, a coalition of left-wing parties. **********But it is also possible that at the moment of truth on Tuesday many Likud voters will find that they simply cannot leave the fold, whether for ideological, ethnic or personal reasons. **********\"Labor's the party they love to date,\" said Gadi Wolfsfeld, a political scientist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"But when it comes down to marriage, they go into the booth and vote Likud. And the reason is they're scared. They're scared about security. They're scared about the P.L.O. And in the end they vote for what they know.\" **********Even if the polls are on target, \"Labor can win the election and still lose the government,\" said Yaron Ezrahi, also a political science professor at Hebrew University. **********The crucial question is not whether Labor finishes first but whether it can scrape together 61 seats for a parliamentary majority. Most polls say it could do it only with the help of Israel's three Arab parties. But Mr. Rabin pledges not to form a government with them, thus honoring an unbroken political tradition. **********Likud is in a similar predicament. Even if he is stronger than the polls say, Mr. Shamir will be hard-pressed to put together more than a slender majority, one dependent on the same far-right parties that walked out on him half a year ago for taking part in the peace process. It would be impossible for him to maintain such a coalition and talk peace at the same time. **********That is why the experts are betting on a Labor-Likud coalition similar to one that existed, often in mutual unhappiness, from 1984 to 1990. **********Who gets to sit in which chair will depend on the parliamentary seat distribution. Almost inevitably, some of the heaviest maneuvering will involve the rigorously religious parties, which will want to be included in any new government, for they exist to obtain state funds for their schools and other institutions. They are presumed to be in a weaker than normal position in this election because of the large numbers of overwhelmingly secular Jews from former Soviet territory. **********Before long, the political game may get even rougher for these parties. The next vote, which is not scheduled until 1996 but could come sooner, will feature the direct election of the Prime Minister for the first time. **********In theory, it should make the national leader a far more powerful figure and reduce the king-making leverage of small parties, including the religious."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/17/business/bush-ads-try-ozzie-not-murphy.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 624, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bush Ads?

Yesterday, bargain hunters in European bond markets decided to bet that it would survive. **********That bet sent the prices of bonds denominated in European currency units, known as ECU's, up sharply for the first time in months. That market, into which investors were piling as recently as this spring, had almost collapsed. **********Yesterday's rapid price rise drove the yield on the Paribas 10-year ECU bond index down to 9.65 percent from 9.85 percent on Tuesday, according to Deutsche Bank. **********By contrast, such bonds yielded less than 8.5 percent earlier this year. The yield remains well above where it theoretically should be, based on rates on bonds in the various European currencies that compose the ECU. **********The rally yesterday surprised many market watchers, and appeared to indicate that some traders were betting that French voters would support the Maastricht Treaty on European monetary union in a referendum Sept. 20. **********Last night, President Francois Mitterand of France and an opposition member of Parliament who opposes the treaty staged a televised debate. Polls have indicated that the vote will be very close, but if the measure passes, it seems likely that ECU bond prices will rally sharply. **********Moreover, the market took heart from the announcement by Britain yesterday that it would borrow the equivalent of 10 billion ECU's, or about $14 billion, in foreign currencies, which it will then sell to bolster the pound. **********Britain's decision to announce the amount in ECU's, rather than pounds or dollars, was viewed as \"designed to indicate their commitment to Europe,\" said Gordon Johns, a managing director of Kemper Investment Management in London. **********The recent saga of the ECU bond market -- rapid growth and excessive enthusiasm that sent prices up to unreasonably high levels earlier this year, followed by a rush to exit when sentiment turned negative -- has provided an example of just how ephemeral the notion of market liquidity can be. There was plenty of liquidity before early June, when no one wanted to sell. Then, when few wanted to buy, liquidity vanished. **********The ECU is a basket of European currencies, and under the Maastricht agreement on European monetary union, it is scheduled to evolve into the single European currency. Investment banks eagerly embraced ECU's, and the issuance of bonds denominated in the units grew rapidly, from about 10 billion ECU's in 1988 to 28 billion ECU's last year. So far this year, almost 20 billion in ECU bonds have been sold. **********\"We've had fairly exponential growth,\" said Bob Tyley, the head of bond analysis for Paribas Capital Markets in London. **********Since the ECU is made up of a basket of the 12 currencies of European Community countries, it is possible to calculate the approximate fair interest rate on ECU bonds, based on the rates of bonds in the 12 currencies. **********Earlier this year, ECU bonds were trading at unreasonably high prices, yielding about two-thirds of a percentage point less than a theoretical basket of bonds in the 12 currencies. **********\"It was easier and more liquid to trade the ECU bond,\" said Hung Tran, a managing director of Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt, explaining the premium. \"There was a strong expectation that by 1997 or 1999, there would be a single European currency, and yields would come down significantly.\" **********Then came Denmark's vote in early June against ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, followed by France's decision to submit ratification to voters, rather than to Parliament, where approval would have been certain. **********Maastricht can probably be preserved without the Danes, but not without the French. Add in the decision of Germany's Bundesbank to push up interest rates, which produced declining prices in most European bond markets, and the need of Japanese investors to sell assets for domestic reasons, and selling pressure began to build. No new ECU bonds have been issued since June. **********In domestic government bond markets, central banks can support bond prices under some circumstances. But there is no European central bank, and the support for the ECU market came from the investment bankers that had underwritten them. As more institutions tried to sell, that support vanished. **********By the end of last week, the Paribas ECU bond index was yielding half a percentage point more than fair value. Even after yesterday's rally, the spread remains at one-third of a point. **********That yield spread is likely to narrow more if France votes for Maastricht, but there remains fear that liquidity will not return, since numerous hurdles will remain before the ECU is sure of becoming the single European currency. **********Those fears notwithstanding, for bond investors who are willing to buy and hold, it appears likely that ECU bonds bought now are likely to outperform most European bonds for the period until maturity, whatever the uncertainties of the Maastricht Treaty ratification process."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/03/business/company-news-august-was-busiest-month-ever-for-american-air.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1992-09-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AUGUST WAS BUSIEST MONTH EVER FOR AMERICAN AIR", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; AUGUST WAS BUSIEST MONTH EVER FOR AMERICAN AIR", "body_text": " **********American Airlines said yesterday that the half-fare promotions that expire throughout the airline industry this month had made August the busiest month in its history.

Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman, said sales growth in the quarter was led by the maker's Vasotec and Prinivil heart drugs, Mevacor and Zocor cholesterol-lowering drugs, and Pepcid and Prilosec ulcer treatments. Vasotec and Mevacor are the largest selling in fields where competition is growing. **********Sales of Proscar, Merck's new treatment for enlarged prostate symptoms in men, were \"consistent with our expectations,\" Dr. Vagelos added.

It said net income would have been $153 million, up 9.2 percent, before the restructuring charges. **********Upjohn's revenues rose 7.5 percent, to $894 million. **********Upjohn's shares were unchanged yesterday at $31.125 on the New York Stock Exchange."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/29/business/market-place-stock-prices-as-measured-by-inflation.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1992-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 754, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Stock Prices As Measured By Inflation", "print_headline": "Market Place; Stock Prices As Measured By Inflation", "body_text": " **********JUST how high are stock prices? By one measure, they are nearing, but have not yet reached, the level set more than 23 years ago, back when Richard M. Nixon was winning the Presidency and a subway token was 20 cents. **********That measure of stock prices is adjusted for inflation, comparing the prices of stocks with the Consumer Price Index. Rather than measure stock prices in dollars, as normal indexes do, that calculation measures them in the context of what other things cost. The Consumer Price Index reflects the cost of a basket of items purchased by consumers; this measurement effectively shows how many such baskets an investor would need to give up to buy a representative sample of American stocks. **********Some bulls may take comfort from the fact that stock prices by that measure are no higher than they were in 1968, despite substantial economic growth. Over that period, it should be noted, stocks have outperformed inflation after dividends are included. **********But there is also a bearish way to look at the figures. Prices now are at levels that three times in the past have proved to be market tops. By contrast, when the ratio was low, stocks have often been an excellent investment. **********In the summer of 1982, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock average was barely higher than the Consumer Price Index. The ratio was just 1.1 to 1. One way to look at that is that to buy a certain amount of stocks one had to give up just more than one basket of consumer products. **********That came at the time that most Americans believed that inflation was all but certain to continue, and that stocks were unlikely to be good values. In fact, inflation was dying and the stock market was about to begin a decade of explosive growth. **********At the end of 1991, the ratio was 3.03 to 1. That means that to buy the same group of stocks, one would have to forgo more than three baskets of consumer goods. In January, the S.& P. 500 is about unchanged, having retreated from rises early in the month. So the ratio for this month seems likely to be about the same. **********The first time the ratio got so high was in November 1968, when it peaked at 3.06. By the summer of 1970, the S.& P. 500 had fallen 33 percent. **********There are other comparisons between 1992 and the late 1960's. Estimates of stock holdings by individuals, as a percentage of total investments by those individuals, indicate that they have risen to the highest levels since they began declining in the early 1970's. That rush to stocks, which has taken the form of both direct holdings and purchases of stock mutual funds, has followed the sharp decline of interest rates, which made many investors more willing to take risks in hopes of gaining higher rewards. **********The second time that the ratio of stock prices to consumer prices reached a high level was in late 1972. The ratio, using month-end figures, peaked at the end of December of that year, at 2.78. That was just before the brutal 1973-74 bear market began. Two years later, the S.& P. 500 had dropped 42 percent. **********In the summer of 1987, the ratio climbed back to 2.88 by the end of August. Three months later, after the October crash, the S.& P. 500 was down 30 percent. **********It may be interesting to note that the economy was not in a recession during the three previous times that the ratio reached current levels. In that sense, the current run-up is unprecedented. The fact that prices have risen so far during the recession -- the ratio was at 2.28 at the end of October 1990, the recent low for stock prices -- is another indicator of the extent to which the stock market seems to have discounted a substantial economic recovery. **********Such calculations do not prove that stock prices are about to collapse. But they do provide another reminder that whatever else the market is it is not very cheap by historical standards. Low inflation is beloved by the bulls, in part because it makes lower interest rates possible. But it also makes it harder for companies to raise prices, and thereby to push up profits. And current share prices may be assuming a sharp rise in corporate profits within a year or two."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/06/world/alps-caught-in-vise-between-tourism-and-trucks.html": {"writer_name": "Marlise Simons", "pub_date": "1992-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1503, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Alps Caught in Vise Between Tourism and Trucks", "print_headline": "Alps Caught in Vise Between Tourism and Trucks", "body_text": " **********The people of the Alps have always reshaped their breathtaking and dangerous landscapes. But in recent years they have become more than ever the masters of the mountains, taming rivers behind dams, razing forests for roads and ski runs and covering slopes with tourist resorts. **********Yet in the scramble to accommodate 100 million visitors a year in a region that ranges from southern France to Slovenia, a debate is raging over how much further man can go in extracting pleasure and profit before nature strikes back. **********Some say nature is already doing so. **********Narrow valleys are choking on the pollution from factories and passenger and freight traffic -- traffic that will increase as trade barriers in Europe come down. As traffic increases, so does acid rain, which has already blighted more than half the trees, which then topply easily in storms. **********The wolf, the bear, the ibex and the falcon have largely disappeared, along with many other bird and plant species. The Evil That Men Do **********\"The question is not whether but when we are reaching a turning point,\" said Thomas Berghold, a professor of physics and environmental counselor to the city of Zurich. \"If we let this kind of economic growth run its course, it will destroy the Alps as a habitat.\" **********Not that life was ever without danger among these stunning peaks, which range across France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria and Slovenia. **********Yet since the skiing boom of the seventies, things have changed: Alpine villages, once protected by thick forests, have become more exposed. Mountain roads have changed watercourses and destabilized the slopes. The sick and diminished forests and the erosion have in turn brought more mudslides, floods and avalanches. **********Experts warn that such disasters are likely to increase. \"You cannot meddle with water flows on such a scale, and then expect to get away with it,\" said Pierre Gensac, a watershed specialist.  No to Revolving Restaurants **********In every Alpine nation, environmental associations are pressing for a slowdown in the conquest of the mountains. They argue that the 40,000 ski runs, with their 12,000 lifts and cable cars, are enough, that there is no need for more revolving restaurants on mountaintops. Dozens of groups are demanding a ban on new resorts, on helicopters dropping skiers on untouched glaciers, on bulldozers. **********The rest of Europe is watching and its interests are contradictory. Many nations have a stake in the Alpine slopes because the snow and ice feed Europe's four major rivers, the Rhine, the Rhone, the Po and the Danube, which spill into three different seas. **********\"The Alps are Europe's watertowers,\" said Tage Nielsen, a specialist in water management. The speed with which water runs steadily from forests or gushes from eroded slopes, he said, can have great impact on the water needed for drinking, irrigation or navigation hundreds of miles away. **********But the Alps are also Europe's crossroads, and the European Community is demanding new highways and tunnels to cope with traffic. A cargo boom will put new pressure on the Alps, which already have the world's busiest mountain roads, carrying more than 15 percent of Europe's freight traffic through a narrow sliver of territory.  No to More Tunnels **********Just below the glowing Mont Blanc, the roar of traffic echoes around the narrow valley as trucks and cars heading for a tunnel linking France and Italy. Last year, 800,000 trucks and four million passenger cars passed through. Managers expect the tunnel to be saturated soon and want to double its size. But the people of Chamonix, a nearby French resort, are fighting this. **********\"We want less traffic, not more,\" said Claude Marin, an official at the Chamonix town hall. \"We already get the fallout from 25 tons of fuel a day.\" **********For the moment, he said, the tunnel project has been postponed. **********Chamonix is just a part of the anti-traffic lobby. **********In March, the Green Party in Switzerland collected 50,000 signatures, enough to force a referendum this September on a separate plan -- a $25 billion project to drill two railroad tunnels through the Alps. This would be Europe's public works project, costing almost twice as much as the tunnel under the English Channel. **********The two tunnels are the cornerstone of a new transit agreement between the European Community and Switzerland, which has committed itself to doubling its railroad capacity by 1995. **********Until a hundred years ago, the mountains and their wild waters were seen as enemies. Then governments built dams to control mud and water and laid ducts and culverts to capture water for reservoirs and generators. Cheap electricity attracted industries, bringing wealth but also waste. **********\"Hydro-power has made for the most drastic intervention,\" said Jaro Stvan, author of \"The Tamed Alps,\" a study of man's impact. Tiny Switzerland has more than 1,100 dams, reservoirs, basins and small and large hydroelectric installations, producing 60 percent of the nation's electricity. \"It has completely changed the lakes, the landscape and the water regime,\" said Mr. Stvan. \"Below the dams, rivers and gullies are often stone dry.\" **********Mr. Stvan, an architect, rails against the \"ugly ski-lift terminals, parking places, boxlike hotels and apartments that have no respect for the landscape or the local style and building materials.\" But he worries most about new resorts, railroads and other big projects that will require more energy and more dams. **********Plans to add a second dam to the high Grimsel Lake in Switzerland have brought wide opposition because it would inundate one-third of an ancient glacier. Critics warn that the glacier could break or melt, slip into the lake and create a wave that would flood the valley below. 'All Those Machines' **********George Roth, a farmer who looks out over three stunning Swiss valleys on the heights above Leysin, says he does not mind skiers. Even in winter, Mr. Roth and his wife, Josianne, get up early and milk the cows. Then they take the cable car up to 6,000 feet, where they have converted a summer stable into a skiers' cafe. **********They like the extra income and mingling with the visitors. But they hate \"all those machines. **********\"Everyone wants bigger and better ski runs,\" said Mr. Roth, so machines flatten the runs and harden the snow, which turns to ice. The ice melts later than snow, \"so we get less grass.\" Mrs. Roth added, \"There must be a way to ski and not destroy so much.\" **********As they spoke, two helicopters broke the luminous stillness.  The Demise of Farming **********Experts say that good ski-runs need not be an ecological hazard if properly shaped and lined with vegetation. But such rules are often overlooked. **********\"Ski-runs generally create more run-off,\" said Mr. Nielsen, the watershed specialist. \"Water comes down faster and in bigger quantities. You need bigger culverts and check dams. With excess run-off, ravines quickly become deeper and slopes become more unsteady and slide or collapse.\" **********The Roth family owns one of the last four farms around Leysin. Twenty years ago, there were 25. The story of the vanishing farmers is repeated throughout the Alps, although many governments subsidize farmers to keep them on the land, to take care of trees and guard the landscape. **********\"If you take away the farmers, the landscape degrades even faster,\" said Mr. Berghold, the adviser in Zurich. \"Many chalet owners are outsiders and they don't know or care.\" **********Furthermore, Government officials and environmentalists worry about the dwindling number of cows, seeing cattle as useful, rather than the environmental burden they are viewed as elsewhere: The cows crop grass, and short grass holds snow, while long grass bends and lets the snow slip off, leading to snowslides in these steep slopes.  Organizing for Action **********The seven Alpine nations signed an Alps Treaty in October to regulate growth and make the economy and the environment more compatible. But it may take several years before regulations are written and accepted as law. **********In all Alpine countries, citizens' groups have banded together to protect the mountains. Some belong to national Green Parties, while others work locally, lobbying against garbage dumps or ski lifts. The International Commission for the Protection of the Alps, an umbrella for more than 30 groups, informs governments, local officals and private groups of damage that new projects can cause. Of late, large corporations have found environmental action good for their image and have started to support conservation groups. **********What amazes Alpinists is how much people are willing to soil the beauty they have come to admire. The head of Alp Action, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, warns that tourism may yet kill tourism unless the precarious beauty of the Alps is protected. **********Jeffrey Sayer, who works at the International Union for Conservation of Nature in Geneva, said he recently returned to Nadelhorn peak after 15 years. Even here, on one of the Alps highest peaks, he said, the changes were striking: **********\"Paths and gullies were worn and mountain bikes and sports vehicles had skidded and rutted the soil. Looking down, I saw ski lifts and bulldozed runs everywhere. People enjoy skiing; it's important for people to earn money. I find it hard to oppose. But I wouldn't want to see it go much further.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/11/business/company-news-sears-chief-will-share-some-duties.html": {"writer_name": "Eben Shapiro", "pub_date": "1992-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 641, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sears Chief Will Share Some Duties", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Sears Chief Will Share Some Duties", "body_text": " **********In a management change that will give Sears, Roebuck & Company's chief executive, Edward A.

Much, of course, would depend on the nature of the deal, whether it included Syria and Lebanon, whether it maintained an open economic border between Israel and the West Bank. **********Recent history is not encouraging. The \"cold peace\" with Egypt has yielded few discernible economic benefits. And the most recent negotiations have been marked by a level of bitterness that augurs poorly for future economic cooperation. Even in the best conceivable circumstances, few Israeli economists anticipate an immediate dividend from reduced military spending or increased trade. Some expect that outlays for settling property claims and securing new defense perimeters would actually exceed the initial gains. **********The real payoff, they say, would only come in the longer term, in the form of an improved climate for private investment. But if it comes, that dividend could be enormous, as both domestic and foreign investors rush to take advantage of Israel's highly skilled work force and access to major markets. Indeed, many economists believe that peace is a key to breaking out of the economy's current slow-growth miasma, a necessity for gracefully absorbing the new Soviet immigrants and raising the Israeli standard of living to that of the United States or northern Europe. **********When most people think of peace dividends, they think about cuts in military spending. And by this measure, it seems, few countries in the world have more to gain than Israel. According to the Bank of Israel, the country now budgets 15 percent of gross national product to defense -- three times the United States expenditure. If the costs of civilian shelters, chronic economic dislocation associated with the annual month of military reserve duty and military use of valuable land are included, the bill is roughly half again larger. **********Few analysts, though, think a peace accord would lead to quick relief. Nadav Halevi, an economist at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, argues that the immediate impact on military spending might well be perverse. **********Arab negotiators are pressing for the creation of an autonomous Palestinian entity on the West Bank and the return of the heavily fortified Golan heights to Syria. But either action, Professor Halevi notes, would mean a considerable investment in a new fixed defense perimeter, along with an expensive upgrading of surveillance capacity. **********Even if the Israeli military was able to contain spending to current levels, the net burden on the Israeli economy could easily increase if a peace treaty reduced Israel's moral and political claims to American aid. Currently that aid equals about $4 billion annually -- 8 percent of Israel's G.N.P. and almost the entire gap between Israel's export earnings and import costs. **********The most visible reward to an accord with Palestinians would be the end to the four-year old intifada, the organized resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza territories. But the tangible gain would not be very large because the resistance is apparently taking a small (and diminishing) toll on the Israeli economy. A 1988 study for the Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest commercial bank, concluded that the added military costs of containing the intifada ran to just two-tenths of a percent of Israel's G.N.P. While there is no comparable estimate for 1991, official Government figures show that overall military manpower costs -- the bulk of the cost of policing the territories -- have since shrunk. **********According to the Bank of Israel, the intifada-proclaimed boycott of Israeli goods did pare sales by about one-third between 1987 and 1989. But half this loss was recouped in 1990 as Israeli goods not labeled by origin trickled back into Palestinian markets. And in any case, notes Howard Rosen at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, the potential damage was never very large because Israeli sales to the territories never amounted to more than one-tenth of Israel's total exports. **********Other disruptions linked to resistance to Israeli rule were perhaps more damaging. Tourism fell by 15 percent in the first year of the intifada. And the number of Palestinian workers commuting from the territories dropped by half, initially creating shortages of unskilled labor in Israeli agriculture and construction. **********But tourist arrivals in 1991 probably exceeded the record traffic in 1987. And one of the few saving graces of an economy with 11 percent unemployment is that local labor can be found to pick vegetables and lug bricks. **********In an analysis for the Institute for Social and Economic Policy in the Middle East at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, Professor Halevi estimates that overall losses to Israel from the Palestinian insurrection -- and thus the potential gain from its end -- amount to less than 1 percent of Israel's G.N.P. Pinchas Landau, an analyst for the Israel Business Report, goes further. \"The intifada,\" he says flatly, \"has become irrelevant to the Israel economy.\" **********What may be relevant is trade. It is widely assumed that a deal on the occupied territories would mean an end to the broader Arab trade boycott of Israel. Here, too, however, economists are skeptical that gains for Israeli exporters or consumers would be great. **********Prof. Ephraim Kleiman of Hebrew University sees some potential in what economists call \"border trade\" -- commerce in goods and services that rarely move very far. Israelis living near Lebanon or Egypt might, for example, sell fresh milk to neighboring Arab villages or repair their trucks. And Professor Halevi looks hungrily at the huge import market in the oil-rich Persian Gulf states. All things equal, he suggests, Israelis' knowledge of Arab language and commercial customs should give them an edge over Japanese, American and European suppliers. **********But there is many a potential slip. The Camp David accord brought no bounty in trade with Egypt; a formal end to war with Syria and the gulf states might mean no more. And even with a genuine thaw, predicts Michael Bruno, the former governor of the Bank of Israel, these markets will be tough to penetrate. **********The secondary boycott of companies that do business with Israel has deprived Israeli consumers of access to hundreds of brand-name goods and limited trade with Asian industrial powers that have an economic stake in Arab countries. But in the view of Amos Rubin, an economic adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, it might not take a peace agreement to reduce the boycott's impact to very modest levels. Since the Persian Gulf war and the subsequent sea change in Mideast geopolitics, he notes, the number of Japanese companies selling in Israel has been multiplying rapidly. **********Mr. Rosen offers an entirely different perspective. He argues that the boycott's damage has been more apparent than real. The boycott, he says, \"forced Israeli exporters to move up the technological ladder\" to win acceptance in the industrialized world. It also helped break domestic political resistance to free-trade deals with America and the European Community -- agreements that guarantee Israeli consumers the benefits of international competition and assure access to the world's richest markets. **********The cost of settling resource and private land claims could add to Israel's adjustment bill. Hishan Awartani, an economist at Al-Najah University in Nablus, says that Israel's disproportionate use of water from the Jordan River and the aquifer under the West Bank ranks high among Palestinians' economic grievances. While Israel's population is slightly smaller than that of the occupied territories and Jordan combined, it gulps twice as much water. All told, the region is now consuming about 20 percent more than the amount sustainable from existing sources. **********But Ezra Sadan, an economist who heads Israel's Volcani Center for Agricultural Research, counters that the scarcity is a failure of markets, not nature. If Israel stopped subsidizing thirsty crops and all farmers in the region paid the real cost of irrigation, he says, water would cease to be a significant obstacle to growth. Clearly, though, any transfer of water rights to Palestinians or Jordan would generate some initial dislocation for Israeli farmers. **********A far more substantial bill could be due on residential property, since more than 200,000 Israelis now live in the West Bank. Neither Israeli nor Palestinian economists are eager to contemplate the political and economic trauma in their mass resettlement. **********And perhaps they will never be forced to.  Since roughly three-quarters of them are commuters whose attachment to the soil is apparently not based on either religion or nationalism, it might well serve everyone's interest to let them stay in an autonomous Palestinian entity. \"The settlers could be a benefit to the West Bank economy,\" agrees George T. Abed, who heads the Welfare Association, a Palestinian development group in Geneva. **********But some transfer of property, with compensation for repatriated Israelis, seems likely. And the burden, particularly on housing, could be heavy since it would come on top of the demands from newly arriving Soviet immigrants. **********The gains from peace it seems will have to come from elsewhere.  MAKING INVESTORS FEEL SECURE **********If experts on the Israeli economy are quick to pile reason upon reason why peace would generate no overnight dividend, they still insist it is critical to Israel's economic future. Indeed, Pinchas Landau, an analyst for the Israel Business Report, argues that the \"peace process is being driven by economic imperatives\" -- in Israel's case, by the need to accelerate growth, reduce its dependence on foreign aid and provide good jobs for its exploding work force. **********From 1951 to 1972 the Israeli economy grew an astounding 10 percent annually -- a rate in the big leagues with Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Since then, however, it has averaged just 3 1/2 percent, barely enough to stay ahead of population growth. Income per person is stuck around $11,000, a comfortable figure by world standards, but a third less than in northern Europe. **********The slowdown, economists now acknowledge, was caused largely by excessive regulation and the failure to encourage competition. But they also argue that reforms instituted since Israel's 1985 brush with triple-digit inflation will not turn the economy around unless investors decide Israel is secure from Arab attack. **********Investment did surge in 1991, but the lion's share was in Government-guaranteed housing. According to the Government's latest report on the economy, \"a much higher level of  [ industrial ]  investment is needed for successful absorption of the immigrants. So far, there are no signs of a turnaround of the required scale.\" **********Perhaps most disappointing, foreign investment has been stuck at a mere $200 million annually. \"We need strategic investors,\" says Dov Lautman, president of the Manufacturers Association of Israel -- investors willing to plow billions annually into export-oriented, high-tech enterprises. And a pre-condition, he argues, is a durable resolution to Israel's conflict with its neighbors. **********Dov Mishor, the economic adviser to the Minister of Finance, agrees. \"If there is peace,\" he says, \"the sky's the limit.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/26/business/wall-street-at-hmo-america-the-drag-of-rebuilding-reserves.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 167, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wall Street; At HMO America, the Drag of Rebuilding Reserves", "print_headline": "Wall Street; At HMO America, the Drag of Rebuilding Reserves", "body_text": " **********The coming week should be interesting for investors in HMO America, a Chicago-based health maintenance organization, which has been battered by market uncertainty about an overdue actuarial report on the adequacy of its 1991 reserves. **********A company spokeswoman said on Friday that the report had been filed with state regulators on Wednesday and entailed no changes in 1991 figures.

Two are a couple of rotten apples. But when a whole slew of companies in an industry are caught up in highly questionable -- if not criminal -- acts, we should reform the system and not just those caught up in it. **********In recent months, some of the best-known pharmaceutical companies -- Dow Corning, Upjohn, Bolar, Hoffman-LaRoche, SmithKline and Syntex, among others -- were said to have failed to report data showing their drugs or products were unsafe. Dow Corning is said to have withheld information about the dangers of silicone injections and breast implants; Upjohn, about violent side effects from its sleeping pill, Halcion; Bolar, for mislabeling and adulterating eight drugs. **********What tripped them up? The system that permits companies, rather than the Food and Drug Administration or another group, to test the safety of drugs that pharmaceutical companies want to market. The evidence strongly suggests that drug companies often find it irresistible to doctor, or even conceal, unfavorable data -- particularly if the alternative is endangering the prospects of a drug that has cost them a fortune to develop. **********Free-market purists argue that the system needs no change, that it is self-correcting. They say that companies caught misleading the public will lose credibility -- and business. But without oversight, it often takes decades before the public finds out about pharmaceutical wrongdoing. By then, thousands may suffer ill consequences. **********Complicating this is the fact that pharmaceutical companies sell many products. When word leaks out that a manufacturer did not tell all about the ill-effects of a particular drug, how will the people taking other medications made by the company react? The public cannot forgo essential medications because the manufacturers withheld information about another drug. Besides, when so many companies are involved, the public may not feel much safer by switching. Clearly, we need a better way to enhance drug safety. **********Why not have the pharmaceutical industry set up its own facilities? These would not be under control of any one company; there would be nothing to gain from cheating. They could be financed by fees paid by companies whose drugs are tested. Companies would save money by being able to use a shared set of labs. This system would uncouple the profit motive from testing -- and keep government bureaucracy at bay. Those considering this approach utopian, and there are many, should not be surprised when the public demands and gains more regulation of this industry. **********Then, the industry may be encouraged to tackle the next problem: changing the way its sales force pushes drugs on physicians by spending billions of dollars on free meals and entertainment and outright cash payments, rather than relying on the efficacy and safety of their drugs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/01/business/the-media-business-advertising-figuring-out-the-russian-consumer.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 800, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Figuring Out the Russian Consumer", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Figuring Out the Russian Consumer", "body_text": " **********Though Russia resembles a consumer society about as much as Moscow resembles Muskogee, Western marketers are focusing on demographics, seeking to penetrate the psyche of a country that Winston Churchill called a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. **********D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles has published \"The Russian Consumer: A New Perspective and a Marketing Approach.\" The agency, which has offices in Moscow and St. Petersburg, serves Western clients in Russia including Mars Inc., the Procter & Gamble Company and Finnair. **********At the agency's headquarters in Manhattan yesterday, executives shared the study's insights into how Russians behave as consumers. **********For example, a segment of Russians characterized by the study as \"Cossacks,\" for their ambition and nationalism, prefers German cars and English cigarettes, while another segment with a merchant-like mentality prefers American cigarettes and domestic vodka. **********Perhaps \"might prefer\" is a better phrase, given current conditions in Russia that make any exercise in assessing consumer attitudes academic, at best.

In their apartments \"you are likely to find empty cans and wrappers stacked up as testimony to consumption,\" he said, adding, \"Empty cans of Pepsi and wrappers from Western confectionery are next to the hi-fi and the Western television.\" **********Another group, \"Business Executives,\" which resembles so-called yuppies in this country, is \"Western-conscious, but not Western-dependent,\" Mr. Clarke said. These entrepreneurs prize functionality as well as imagery, he added, and might be as likely to want to drive a Russian Lada automobile as a Western Mercedes-Benz or Honda. **********A crucial point to deciphering an emerging Russian market is that \"Russia is not desperate just to be like the West,\" he asserted. **********While \"Hungary wants to be similar to Austria,\" he added, \"Russia wants to be a nicer Russia.\" **********In advising marketers to divide Russians into groups in order to conquer them, the study is a blueprint for Western-style segmented, or targeted, marketing, rather than the kind of broad-based, mass marketing one might expect would be more efficacious in a consumer society, like Russia's, in its infancy. **********\"If you're dealing with a market as different as Russia is,\" Mr. Clarke explained, \"even if you want to go 'broad,' it's best to think: 'Which group would go most for my brand?

Summerville, senior economist for Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. **********The strength of its currency is likely to prove a mixed blessing for Japan. It could alleviate some of the pressure on Japan's beleaguered banks and make it less expensive for Japan to import the oil and other raw materials it depends on. Politically, a strong yen could help mitigate a soaring trade surplus by making Japanese exports seem more expensive to the world and foreign products cheaper to the Japanese. **********But for automobile and electronics companies that depend heavily on exports, the high yen could deal another blow at a time when the companies are already suffering heavily from a slump in Japan's domestic market. The net overall impact of a higher yen could be to prolong the nation's recession, some economists say, even in the face of the Government's $86 billion stimulative spending plan. **********Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and other top officials have said in the last two days that the Government would consider intervening in the market if the yen experiences too sharp a rise, but that this did not appear to be the case yet. The prospect of intervention has helped keep the yen from rising further, analysts said. Gradual Change Sought **********But Japanese officials actually appear to be more interested in making sure exchange rate changes are gradual, not in keeping the yen from rising.

Many executives and economists think the yen looks good only by default, as investors seek to escape the turmoil in Europe and because prospects for the American economy are uncertain. **********\"The main reason for the sharp rise of the yen doesn't exist in the yen itself,\" said Akira Satate, deputy general manager of foreign exchange at the Bank of Tokyo. Strength Seen Fleeting **********Some executives said the current strength of the yen would be only transitory. But others say the same factors that have brought the yen to its current position will drive it even higher. In addition, some people are hoping the economy here will recover because of the Government's stimulatory package announced last month. **********\"The yen is now a safe-haven currency,\" said Robert Alan Feldman, director of economics and market analysis for Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., who thinks the yen will rise to 115 to the dollar or even higher. Despite its poor economy and its political scandals, Japan has a more certain political and economic outlook than the United States and many European countries, he said. Japan's strong trade and current account surpluses are also helping keep the yen strong, he said. **********The prospect of a higher yen is sending chills through the board rooms of Japan's electronics and automobile companies, which are already facing periods of extremely low profits or even losses. **********Takashi Matsuda, managing director and chief financial officer of the Honda Motor Company, said in a statement that if the yen stayed at its current level or gained strength it would have unfavorable effects both on Honda's export profits and on the Japanese economy. The company, which gets nearly half its revenues from sales in North America, has been basing its financial projections on the assumption of 130 yen to the dollar. **********In part because of the gradual strengthening of the yen since last year, Japanese auto makers have already been raising auto prices in the United States more than their American competitors, and have lost some market share. **********\"The move in the currency right now is the best thing that's happened to Detroit in a long time,\" said Stephen Usher, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International in Tokyo. **********For Casio, the Japanese manufacturer of calculators, watches and other electronic gadgets, each 1-yen rise in the exchange rate translates into a reduction in pretax profit of 1 billion yen, or more than $8 million, said Toshio Isobe, a spokesman for the company. But raising prices right now would be difficult, he said, given the weak economies throughout the world. **********Japanese banks could also get a break in meeting new requirements for the capital they must have relative to their assets. The sharp fall in stock prices in the last two and a half years has already put some banks in danger of not being able to meet those requirements because some gains on stocks are counted in the capital calculations. **********Mr. Summerville of Jardine Fleming said that about 25 percent of the asset of the major Japanese banks were in dollars, such as loans for real estate in the United States. With the yen strengthening, less capital, as measured in yen, is needed to cover those assets. \"This is good for Japan because it gives the banks more breathing room,\" he said. **********Japan has managed to adjust to a much bigger gain in the yen that was caused by the 1985 Plaza Accord, in which major nations agreed to strengthen the yen in an attempt to slow Japan's export machine. By early 1988 the yen had risen to almost 120 to the dollar -- a record passed only this week -- from about 250 yen to the dollar in 1985. **********The sharp change in the currency caused an economic slump here, but one from which Japan recovered with dazzling speed. **********To make up for tougher export markets, Japan stimulated its own economy with fiscal measures, leading to a domestic boom. Manufacturing companies invested heavily in automation to improve efficiency and moved some operations offshore so they could remain competitive in world markets. And with its currency strong, Japanese companies became major buyers of downtown skyscrapers, Hollywood studios, oceanside golf courses and other American property. **********The Japanese will not be able to rely on the domestic market for help this time. However, with banks nursing bad loans and companies in weak condition, the new strength of the yen is not expected to set off a new shopping spree for foreign properties."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/28/business/finance-new-issues-california-agency-is-offering-bonds.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "California Agency Is Offering Bonds", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; California Agency Is Offering Bonds", "body_text": " **********The California State Public Works Board is offering $140 million of tax-exempt lease revenue bonds priced to yield a maximum of 6.875 percent for a 6 3/4 percent bond due in 2012 priced at about 98.645. **********The lead underwriter, the Smith Barney, Harris Upham unit of the Primerica Corporation, said the financing was insured by the Ambac Indemnity Corporation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-484892.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-09-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Shearson Lehman Brothers New York, narrowed the review on its estimated $16 million account, previously at Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc., New York, which was dismissed last month.

At a press briefing earlier this week, Apple also showed a nonworking black plastic mock-up described as a \"concept model of a class of device that might be made using Newton technology.\" **********Paul Saffo, an industry consultant with the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif., said, \"This is a gutsy move into unexplored territory.\" **********Analysts who have seen Newton like it, and welcome Apple's entry in a new business, but they also question the size of the potential market for a personal organizer priced close to $1,000. If Newton remains little more than a more elegant version of Sharp's Wizard pocket organizer, the market will be small, they say. On the other hand, if Newton can harness digital technology for nonusers of computers, the potential market is huge. **********\"Apple has an opportunity to play a leadership role, but there's no shortage of competition out there,\" said Richard Shaffer, publisher of the Technologic Computer Letter. **********Apple executives said Newton would be shipped within nine months. The delay insures that the new device will face ample competition. On Wednesday, the Tandy Corporation and the Casio Computer Corporation of Tokyo, said they would collaborate on a line of personal information systems. And the Hewlett-Packard Company, which has already sold 100,000 pocket-sized keyboard computers, has said it will make a pen-based device, which it could ship next year. **********To be built by Sharp in Japan, Newton uses a clip-on pen to issue commands and enter data, which can be either text or graphics. Newton's software provides handwriting recognition -- of printed letters but not cursive writing so far -- and can also straighten lines in drawn images. **********Newton also uses a software concept known as \"smart agents,\" or \"intelligent assistance\" in Apple lingo, which organizes any entered information without being told to do so. For example, a scrawled note to remember a lunch date with a client is automatically entered in the calendar at the appropriate time. Apple developed its own pen-based operating system software for Newton. **********Newton packs a lot of power in a package just 6 inches by 8 inches through the use of RISC, or reduced instruction set computing, technology, which speeds computing by relegating more tasks to software. Newton's brain is a RISC microprocessor developed by Apple, VLSI Technology of San Jose and Acorn Computer of Britain. Apple said Newton products would all sell for under $1,000. **********SRI International, a consulting company based in Menlo Park, predicts that the market for personal digital assistants will grow from about 1.8 million last year to 17.6 million a year by 1995. Sounding a more conservative note, Charles Wolf, an analyst with First Boston, predicted that Apple could sell 250,000 Newtons in 1993."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/19/business/market-watch-in-washington-the-dollar-has-few-friends.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1992-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 507, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Washington, The Dollar Has Few Friends", "print_headline": "MARKET WATCH; In Washington, The Dollar Has Few Friends", "body_text": " **********As the Democrats recounted the list of economic woes for which they hope voters will hold George Bush responsible, there was a curious omission. The steady slide in the value of the dollar went unnoted and unlamented. **********Yet the dollar's fall is in some ways the signal indicator of the decline of America as an economic power over the last three decades. In contrast to such countries as France, where the value of the currency is deemed to be a measure of national accomplishment, the Government of this country has tended to see a sinking buck as a painless way out of economic binds. **********These days, the hope is that American exports will become more competitive, and thus American incomes (measured in dollars) greater. The fact the same trend damages American consumers by raising the costs of imports is not mentioned. Nor is the fact that as Americans pay more for imports there is less cash left over to buy other things. **********In fact, the trade deficit has proved surprisingly resistant to improvement. The May figure released last week was the worst since November 1990, with both exports and imports declining, notwithstanding the fact recessions normally depress imports and boost exports. \"The thing that is noteworthy about America is that we are still running trade deficits with a miserable economy,\" said Michael J. Harkins, the president of Levy, Harkins & Company, a New York money manager that is betting on a further dollar decline. **********The dollar's most recent weakness, especially against European currencies, can be traced to Germany's decision to raise interest rates at a time when the only thing the Bush Administration can think of to improve business is to lower rates. **********But the decline of the dollar is a longer-term phenomenon. When Ronald Reagan took office, the average American worker earned $249 per week. Last month the average was $363, a 46 percent increase. But expressed in marks it was up just 4 percent, and expressed in yen it was down 11 percent. **********Long term, the implications of a depreciating dollar are for rising inflation and a poorer populace. Until now, markets have seemed remarkably unconcerned about such possibilities, but gold's surprising surge last week could signal that is changing. **********To a real dollar bear, the eventual result will be a currency crisis, in which the Government must push up interest rates to support the currency, and perhaps even slap on currency controls. But that won't happen as long as the world is happy with the dollar's slow decline, and it seems to be. Bonds sold to foreigners are worth fewer marks or yen than when they were sold, but there is no wholesale liquidation. And few Americans are rushing to take advantage of high German interest rates. **********But all that could change, especially if investors decide that it is significant that the once-almighty dollar has few friends in Washington, a fact that will not change whether or not Bill Clinton wins."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/15/world/burmese-say-detained-peace-prize-winner-may-yet-face-a-trial.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-12-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 384, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Burmese Say Detained Peace Prize Winner May Yet Face a Trial", "print_headline": "Burmese Say Detained Peace Prize Winner May Yet Face a Trial", "body_text": " **********The Government said today that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese dissident who won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and who has been under house arrest here for more than three years, was not on a hunger strike and issued a new warning that she may yet face a criminal trial. **********\"We can put her on trial anytime we like because we have lots of evidence which can be used against her,\" said Col.

Some politicians are now pushing hard to adopt anti-Japanese protectionist measures. The trade imbalance, however, is only a symptom of deep industrial problems that require serious attention. **********The answer to these problems is not to impede Japanese companies' ability to sell their products to American consumers. A better approach is for the United States to make fundamental changes in the rules that govern financial institutions. Reforms that enhance the ability of American companies to raise capital will also enhance their ability to compete globally. **********Competition in the United States is stifled in two fundamental ways that are so endemic they are hardly recognized. First, nearly every important industry is dominated by a few companies. Sometimes, the industry leader has revenues that are twice the next competitor's. Such industries now include autos, chemicals and computers. More commonly, two to four companies dominate 40 to 80 percent of a market. This is true of aerospace, building materials, computer chips, metals, petroleum refining, pharmaceuticals, soaps, cosmetics and some high-tech industries, among others. **********Japanese markets are less concentrated. Usually six to eight companies share about 80 percent of a market. Where an industry leader emerges -- as in autos and consumer electronics -- a tier of five to six companies will bunch up close behind to divide the remaining market share about equally. Competitiveness is so fierce that market-share rankings shift among companies, both from one geographical market to the next and over time, more frequently than in the United States. **********Second, Japanese companies are much smaller than their American counterparts. Until recently, there has been no Japanese manufacturing-related concern with more than 100,000 employees except for the nation's phone company. More than 20 companies in the United States are that large. **********G.M.'s auto sales are only twice Toyota's, yet its auto work force of 400,000 is four times Toyota's. Admittedly, Japanese companies are affiliated into networks of keiretsu, and, added together, some of these groupings of concerns are large. But despite their close ties, member companies remain autonomous and do business with other Japanese companies outside the keiretsu. **********Japan has avoided the dual problems of dominance and largeness in part because of the influence banks have in shaping company strategies. Banks are allowed to own up to 5 percent of a company's shares. Because banks are shareholders as well as lenders, they tend to be watchful investors, and companies are better able to plan for the long haul. What has been overlooked, however, is the way banks shape the competitiveness of Japan's entire industrial structure. **********There are only about 150 banks in Japan, and they are highly competitive. No one bank dominates because only marginal differences in assets separate Japan's 10 leading banks. These banks create a sort of level playing field for their keiretsu members. A company in a particular industry would have more or less equal access to financing to support innovations and to enter new industries as a competing company in another keiretsu. **********In contrast, competition in the American banking industry is lopsided. Japan's 18th-largest bank has about the same assets as Citicorp, the United States' top banking company. Yet Citicorp's assets are nearly twice as large as the next American bank. The size of banks following also drops quickly, and so on down the trail of 12,000 banks. Too few banks have sufficient assets to make investments large enough for a promising company to make a research or technological breakthrough. **********In the United States, there is too much of a dependence on venture capitalists and pension and money managers. The former do not have enough capital, and the latter do not take a long enough view in investing in the nation's industry. Changing the rules that govern banking is a key to America's industrial transformation. **********Three basic reforms need to be developed to strengthen the global competitiveness of the nation's economy. *********** The centerpiece is to allow banks to hold limited equity positions in corporations. *********** The next change calls for banking regulations to cultivate 10 to 20 national megabanks. The result will be fewer and bigger banks, and they will create greater competition among more equally endowed emerging businesses. As in Japan, banks will not want to miss out in supporting new industries or innovations. *********** The third reform will probably be most painful. It calls for reducing the number of the nation's banks by a half. Regulators should not be helping ailing savings and loan associations but eliminating them even more quickly. **********These three changes will encourage megabanks to develop networks of well-financed and, thereby, better-positioned companies. As in Japan, bank concentration will face built-in market restraints that dissuade banks or allied companies from dominating an industry or growing too large. Nothing short of revolutionizing Americans' distrust of powerful banks will solve the nation's longstanding industrial problems.

Over the entrance doors, they proudly announce the year of construction: 1989 appears to be the earliest.  Leveled by the Chinese **********In 1979, after the Chinese Army poured south from the mountains of Guangxi Province to punish Vietnam for having invaded Cambodia, this region and its principal town, Lang Son, were among the most devastated in a war that was brief but destructive. **********The ruins of Lang Son, about 10 miles farther from the border, could be visited shortly after the fighting ended, but officials then said the border area remained a forbidden military zone, devastated and heavily mined. Leftover mines remain a danger to this day. **********After the Chinese intrusion, the official policy, stated in Lang Son and Hanoi, the capital, was that Beijing had proved that it could never be trusted to let Vietnam live in peace. Consequently, while some men might return in daylight to till their fields, most of the population would be resettled out of reach of China's guns, and Lang Son and the border villages would be left in ruins.

Up and down, from dawn to dusk, ply porters bearing their loads on bamboo yokes, ancient trucks whose continued roadworthiness belies their discouraging appearance and battered motorcycles of Soviet manufacture, each bearing more passengers and freight than their designers intended. **********The noisy traffic in this remote corner bears witness to the new pragmatism of what has always been one of the most dogmatic Communist leaderships. **********Long before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Vietnam's principal ally, hastened normalization with China, bustling trade across the border had been quietly tolerated by both sides. Both Governments even collected duties on trade that they officially refused to acknowledge. **********Officials concede that the remoteness of the region and the unofficial nature of the trade offered customs officers an opportunity to supplement their meager earnings, perhaps $20 a month. \"They collect a lot for the Government,\" said Bui Ta Khanh, a provincial official, with a laugh. \"For the rest, we can't tell.\" **********The bustling trade also shows how actively even the northern Vietnamese, who have lived since 1945 in an atmosphere hostile to private enterprise, have taken the Government at its word now that Vietnam, following the Soviet example, has allowed trade for private gain. What comes and goes across this porous border feeds strictly private commercial circuits. **********Those who use the motorcycle taxis are nickel-and-dime dealers who sell their imports from village market stands. **********But bolts of textiles and crates of electric fans or other appliances are shipped on trucks chartered by factory owners or wholesalers, something new in northern Vietnam.

Public and Private Sessions **********The inquiry would be convened in both public and private sessions, depending on the sensitivity of intelligence matters, and investigators would have access to all papers and witnesses, including Government ministers. **********A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said it was not clear if the inquiry would be authorized to question Americans who may have relevant knowledge of arms sales to Iraq. It is not clear if the United States took part in the British program. **********In the inquiry, witnesses cannot be compelled to testify but Sir Nicholas said the Government would cooperate fully. **********The Prime Minister acted after Government prosecutors in London dismissed the case against three executives of Matrix Churchill, a toolmaker taken over by Iraq in the late 1980's; they had been charged with lying because the company had told export agencies that the equipment it was sending to Iraq would be used for civilian purposes. Change by Key Witness **********The Government said it was forced to drop the case because one of their most important witnesses, a former Cabinet minister, changed his account of key events before taking the stand. **********Alan Clark, the former Minister for Trade, acknowledged in court last week that he had told the three men when they applied for export licenses to stress that the equipment -- machine tools used to make fuses for shells -- was for peaceful use. He also urged them to send \"profuse\" amounts of paperwork, although he denied he was giving the men what he called a \"nudge, nudge, wink, wink.\" **********Government lawyers said Mr. Clark had given a different account in pretrial testimony. **********But rival politicians and lawyers for the defendants argued that the real reason the Government moved to drop the case was to head off embarrassing disclosures, included those in some 500 intelligence documents that had been handed over to the defense by the court. Links to Americans? **********Among other things, defense lawyers said the documents included circumstantial evidence, but no direct proof, of American complicity in illegal sales. Matrix Churchill has a subsidiary in Solon, Ohio. **********The New York Times has obtained many of the intelligence documents that might have been released. They do not make clear if the United States was involved in the program. But they offer details of how the British Government pushed exports to Iraq to maintain the intelligence connection and compete with other countries, including West Germany, Japan and France, that were scrambling to feed Iraq's hunger for military technology. **********In one 1990 document, for instance, an official of the Department of Trade and Industry argued that shipments of British technology and equipment should continue, despite growing evidence that some of it could be used in Iraq's missile-bulding program. **********Paul Henderson, former managing director of Matrix Churchill and one of the three executives on trial, provided the British Government with information about Iraq's arms buildup. One March 1990 document, entitled \"A U.K. Businessman Describes Military Projects in Iraq,\" listed at least six specific Iraqi military programs, complete with code-names, involving lasers and a long-range gun. **********The trial featured embarrassing disclosures about how the British Government had operated a secret program that enabled President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to buy tools and technology to make arms.

Among the more imaginative were signs advertising the Museum of Flight, by Livingston & Company in Seattle, to which were affixed re-creations of bygone planes. **********A biplane model was even made to appear as if it had blundered into a sign and crashed; a dummy of a pilot was placed at the bottom of the sign, as if recovering from his mishap. **********Several billboards and posters in a long-running campaign by Chiat/ Day/Mojo Inc. in New York won two Obies, plus Best of Show, for executions like a cutout of a cow peering out from behind the top of a sign, to illustrate the \"Cowhides\" listings in the Nynex Yellow Pages. **********To promote the billboard medium for Reagan Outdoor, Evans/Salt Lake City erected a sign reading, \"Billboards draw people like flies.\" Then, over a period of time, dummies of people were pasted onto the sign, accumulating to cover its surface. **********And two signs tying as winners featured food-related extensions.

Then came the great banana debacle. **********With demand for bananas growing rapidly, Dole entered into costly contracts with independent producers to insure that it would have an adequate supply. When banana prices declined in the summer after an unexpected price war, however, those contracts suddenly became very bad deals, and the company's profit margins got squashed. Dole's third-quarter earnings, released in October, were down 41 percent, blindsiding investors who only months earlier had been assured by Dole's chairman, David H. Murdock, that profits for the full year would be substantially higher than in 1990. **********The stock, which had surged from $28 last January to $48 in September, immediately plunged into the low 30's. There it languished, virtually untouched by the bull market, until Dole once again surprised Wall Street last week, this time pleasantly. The company's fourth-quarter earnings of $29.1 million, or 48 cents a share, were 45 percent higher than in the fourth quarter of 1990 and were significantly higher than analysts had expected. The stock immediately rallied. It closed at $37.375 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, up from $34 before the earnings were released on Wednesday. **********Mr. Murdock, the 68-year-old financier who owns 23 percent of Dole, has suffered through the ups and downs along with other shareholders. But Mr. Murdock at least knows in detail what is going on inside the company, which until last summer was called Castle & Cooke Inc. The rest of the company's shareholders are not so lucky, because Mr. Murdock almost never talks to Wall Street or the news media, and the company typically releases only bare-bones financial information. A spokeswoman for Dole declined to answer questions about the company's stock price or to provide details of its operations beyond the basic information it had already made public. **********The few analysts who track the company said the dearth of information and the ensuing surprises made Dole an investment perhaps best suited for the stouthearted. But they also said that Dole, which in addition to its food business also has extensive real estate holdings in California and Hawaii, is fundamentally strong and that beneath the quarterly gyrations is a record of consistent growth. For all of last year, Dole earned $133.7 million, or $2.24 a share, up 10.9 percent over 1990. **********\"Over the past six years or so, since David Murdock took over the company, they have had a very solid 15 percent-plus annual sales growth, and net profit annual growth in the double digits,\" said Michael J. Branca, an analyst at Mabon Securities in New York. \"Investors should recognize that although quarterly earnings are subject to significant variance, the long-term prospects for the company's core foods business are very strong.\" **********Mr. Branca said the fourth-quarter results \"reflect the success of the company in broadening its packaged food line and in building on the Dole brand name.\" **********In bananas, which account for about a third of Dole's sales, Dole, which is based in Westlake Village, Calif., and Chiquita Brands International run neck and neck in the United States with about 30 percent of the market each. (Worldwide, Chiquita is the clear leader in market share.) In fresh fruits and in produce like lettuce, carrots and celery, Dole is either No. 1 or a close second to its various competitors, Mr. Branca said. Demand for fresh fruit and produce continues to climb, not just in the United States but worldwide, and Dole is well positioned to capture a big chunk of the growth. **********And then there are Dole's extensive real estate holdings. Through much of last year real estate earnings were depressed by the heavy start-up costs from the opening of two resorts the company built in Hawaii. Those costs are expected to diminish this year, analysts said, and should help push earnings higher again. Mr. Branca said Dole's real estate holdings alone were worth about $32 a share at current market prices. **********Mr. Branca is bullish on the stock. A number of other analysts are somewhat less enthusiastic, like Craig Silvers of Crowell, Weedon & Company in Los Angeles, who said he gave Dole a neutral rating. But Mr. Silvers agreed that the company's potential for growth was strong. **********\"Dole has great long-term prospects because in fruits and vegetables there are only three major companies -- Dole, Chiquita and Del Monte,\" Mr. Silvers said. \"The U.S. population is growing and aging, and as people get older they tend to eat more fruits and vegetable. Also, Dole will benefit from the opening of markets in Europe and the Far East.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/12/world/peruvian-official-assails-pressure-from-us.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1992-04-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 672, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Peruvian Official Assails Pressure From U.S.", "print_headline": "Peruvian Official Assails Pressure From U.S.", "body_text": " **********In an interview before his departure for talks in Washington, Peru's Foreign Minister bitterly criticized the Bush Administration for putting pressure on other governments to isolate President Alberto Fujimori, who seized broad power last Sunday in what many people are calling a civil-military coup. **********The Foreign Minister, Augustino Blacker Miller, said in the interview late Friday night that Mr. Fujimori's action had wide popular support among Peruvians and wondered how the United States could be so \"naive\" as to lump Peru's situation with the military takeover in Haiti last year. **********\"We feel that if we have the support of the Peruvian population, eventually we will get the support of the world because the world cannot deny the fact that this is not a dictatorship when you have 90 percent of popular support,\" the Foreign Minister said. **********Late Sunday, President Fujimori dissolved Congress and the judiciary, arrested more than two dozen members of Congress and suspended the Constitution. He said the actions were necessary to confront severe challenges from Maoist Shining Path guerrillas and drug traffickers as his Government tries to address dire economic problems. He has promised to restore democracy and free elections under a new constitution. **********United States officials have condemned the move as a coup and cut off all but humanitarian aid to the Fujimori Government. On Friday President Bush said he would support submitting Peru to \"outside pressure,\" including economic sanctions, to promote a return to democracy. **********Behind the United States pressure is concern that Mr. Fujimori's actions could set a dangerous precedent for other Latin countries at a time when the continent is enjoying broad democratic rule for the first time in decades. **********The Organization of American States on Monday is to hold an emergency meeting on the Peruvian situation. Mr. Blacker Miller is scheduled to present the Peru's case at the meeting. **********The Foreign Minister said he was encountering an intense effort by the United States to dissuade Latin and European Governments from showing any support for what he described as Mr. Fujimori's attempt to \"create a real democracy in Peru.\" **********He added that strains in the relationship between Peru and the United States in recent months over anti-drug efforts prompted the Fujimori Government not to warn officials in Washington of its intention to seize broad powers. **********The Peruvian Foreign Minister traced strains in the relationship with Washington to the San Antonio summit meeting of seven countries on drugs in February, at which the United States pressured Lima to accept tougher drug interdiction measures. **********Since the takeover, those strains have only increased. The Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Bernard W. Aronson, arrived in Lima the day Mr. Fujimori announced his seizure of power. Fuming, Mr. Aronson canceled a meeting with Mr. Fujimori and returned to Washington. **********Mr. Blacker Miller said that while every approach to the United States for help and understanding since the coup has been rebuffed, he has met with a more tolerant reception in Europe and Japan. \"The reaction in Europe is, 'We believe you are confronting extraordinarily difficult odds in your fight to proceed with development and therefore we are not going to cry wolf until we see that you are not meeting your promises,' \" he said. **********Tired, and obviously concerned about the outcome in Washington, the Peruvian Foreign Minister said the seizure of power early this week had been planned for more than two months. **********\"When you are looking at things from the frying pan it is hard to believe that they could look any worse,\" he said. \"When you are in the frying pan and others are holding the pan, you are the one who is burning, not they.\" **********Mr. Blacker Miller said that he had advised Mr. Fujimori earlier that if radical changes were not made soon the situation with terrorism, a stagnant economy and drug trafficking could get so bad that \"we might have a real military coup by the end of the year.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/01/world/violence-takes-over-a-colombian-city.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Violence Takes Over a Colombian City", "print_headline": "Violence Takes Over a Colombian City", "body_text": " **********Human rights monitors say this sweltering central Colombian city has become an alarming focal point of violence, a place where leftist rebels, common criminals, paramilitary groups, the military and the police are killing people at an ever-increasing rate. **********The monitors and residents say that many of the victims are innocent peasants indiscriminately slain by army and police forces in anti-insurgency operations. **********This year alone, 84 homicides have been registered in the city of 156,000, a rate that eclipses last year's record-breaking average of more than a slaying a day and makes this one of the most violent places in the country. Deadlier Than Washington **********The rate of killing -- 250 per 100,000 people in 1991 -- is more than three times that of Washington, which has the highest homicide rate in the United States. Washington's rate was 77.8 homicides per 100,000 people in 1990, the most recent year for which United States figures are available. **********\"The violence is exceeding all the limits,\" said an official in the local Attorney General's office in Barrancabermeja, who conceded that state forces are involved in at least some of it. \"We're in a pressure cooker.\" **********Anxiety is clearly evident among residents, who nervously check crowds when they go out in public and drop their voices before speculating on who is planning to kill whom.

In it, he strongly criticized Government forces for what he called widespread human rights abuses in the region. The local radio network broadcast excerpts from the article the same day. Not Deterred by 'Message' **********\"The death was clearly a message to try and keep us quiet,\" said Mr. Gomez, the breeze from a fan stirring the stacks of photographs of slaying and torture victims that cover his desk in his muggy second-floor office. \"But we are going to keep working to denounce these abuses.\" **********The only violent element missing here is Colombia's drug traffickers, who operate farther outside the city, though a sharp drop in the nation's drug-related violence has been reported in recent months. **********Barrancabermeja (pronounced bahr-ahn-cah-ber-MEH-ha) a port city on the Magdalena River some 150 miles north of Bogota, has traditionally been a domain of leftist rebels belonging to the National Liberation Army and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. **********Their movements gathered support as the city's working classes toiled to exploit the area's rich natural resources of oil, coal and coffee but were denied the economic benefits. Drinking water, roads, sewers and hospitals are woefully inadequate in most of the neighborhoods. **********In the past year, rebel attacks have increased as the two guerrilla groups try to strengthen their hand during peace talks with the Government held in Caracas, Venezuela. Though several other rebel groups have disarmed in recent years, the Caracas negotiations with the two remaining groups have been limping along since June. The talks are to resume in March after a nearly three-month recess. Cycle of Violence **********Each time the guerrillas make a show of force, like bombing electrical pylons near Barrancabermeja, the state answers by sending in more security forces. **********\"Every time the military comes in, the rate of violence goes up,\" said Mr. Gomez. He said that over the past decade thousands of people have moved into the city from rural areas to escape the violence, increasing social strains within Barrancabermeja. **********Mr. Gomez said that in their zeal to rout the left, the state forces view every peasant and urban worker as a guerrilla supporter who should be eliminated. **********\"The bottom line is that the military and police are among the worst offenders -- if not the worst -- of certain human rights abuses, such as summary executions, torture and disappearances,\" said Chuck Call, associate with the Washington Office on Latin America, a nongovernmental human rights organization. **********Attesting to that charge is a 39-year-old mother of nine, too terrified to give her name. She says her husband, a manual laborer, was abducted, tortured and slain with three of his coworkers in January 1991. **********Witnesses say the four men were killed by army soldiers, who dressed the bodies in guerrilla fatigues and later reported that four \"rebels\" had died in battle. The wife denies that her husband was ever involved with leftist radicals and scoffs at the army's allegations of combat. **********\"I'm not a fool,\" she says. \"People who die in battle don't show signs of torture.\" **********Although she has tried to pursue the case, she worries that if she presses too hard her children will lose their mother as well. **********Fear is one of the main reasons that conviction rates in Barrancabermeja, as in all of Colombia, are so low, according to Government officials and human rights workers. There were 391 slayings in 1991, but only 11 people sit in jail accused of murder. **********\"People won't cooperate with the investigations because they are afraid,\" said the President's human rights adviser, Jorge Orlando Melo, in his Bogota office. \"And the officials can't form cases without the cooperation of the people.\"  Changes in Judicial System **********But Colombia has made some significant changes aimed at improving the judicial system. The 1991 Constitution created a national public prosecutor to build better cases against all criminals, including those accused of human rights abuses. In addition, a public defender's office, also dictated by the new Constitution, is charged with overseeing processes against human rights violators. **********Last summer, President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo appointed Colombia's first civilian Defense Minister, Rafael Pardo Rueda, who has announced his commitment to cleaning up security forces. **********Even with the deterrent of fear, the Attorney General's report cites a large number of complaints against state forces between January 1990 and April 1991: more than 550 alleged killings, 664 cases of torture and 616 disappearances nationwide. **********Nor are guerrillas free from accusations of harm to innocents. Recently, for example, two children died when they stepped on one of the guerrillas' land mines in Carmen, 35 miles southeast of Barrancabermeja."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/10/business/executive-changes-606892.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 185, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** AEG Corp., Basking Ridge, N.J., an international high-technology company and a unit of AEG A.G., named David L.

Mr. Forbes had started riding at 48. \"People think you're eccentric if you ride a motorcycle. Unless you're poor. If you're poor they think you're nuts,\" he wrote in his book \"Around the World on Hot Air and Two Wheels.\" **********Chuck Pfeifer, a former ad man, was another early biker about town. \"It was me, Mickey  [ Rourke ]  and the Hell's Angels,\" he said of the late 70's and early 80's. \"I was viewed as a crazy Vietnam vet.\" **********Mr. Pfeifer, now part of a group opening a Manhattan restaurant called 1629 Second Avenue, speculated that \"one reason more people are riding is because Harleys have gotten better -- they used to be a bucket of bolts.\" **********Whatever the reason, Mr. Pfeifer is sorry to see so many weekend warriors. \"Everybody is on a bike these days,\" he said.

In recent weeks the C.I.A. has turned up several classified reports indicating that officials of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro knew about the scheme and might have been involved. **********The Jan. 31, 1990, letter to Agriculture is the earliest and clearest indication that the C.I.A. concluded that bank officials in the Rome headquarters were involved in the scheme. **********Over five years, the Atlanta branch of the bank extended $5 billion in loans and credits to Iraq and other countries and companies in violation of bank rules, providing crucial financing for President Saddam Hussein's arms buildup.

This drive is still alive despite the development of supersonic airliners and space travel. And now researchers are making progress toward a machine in which a solitary person could experience flight much as birds do. **********The prototype of this quest was the mythological Icarus, with his arm-powered flapping wings. Of course, he had technical problems. According to the legend, he flew too close to the sun, which melted the wax that held the feathers to his arms. **********This early failure was not unique. Even the inventive Leonardo da Vinci explored the concept with little success. **********In reality, trying to imitate birds only delayed the development of practical aircraft. As the Encyclopedia Britannica notes, \"All human attempts to fly on flapping wings led only to frustration and disaster, for what comes naturally to birds is almost certainly impossible for man to duplicate with mechanisms.\" **********But now two researchers have developed a working model of an ornithopter, a motorized aircraft that flies by the action of its flapping wings. Like the first efforts of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, the inventors' flights last year from a hill north of Toronto were measured only in minutes. In two unmanned flights, the craft soared as high as 100 feet over the ground, flew figure eights and landed in a controlled manner. **********The inventors say it was the first time a powered flapping-wing aircraft was able to gain altitude and maneuver on a sustained basis. One day, they say, people may fly such craft as easily as they would fly ultralight aircraft today, imitating not Icarus, but his father, Daedalus, who stayed low and completed his flight. **********The ornithopter is the handiwork of Jeremy M. Harris, a research engineer at Battelle Institute in Columbus, Ohio, and James D. DeLaurier, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Toronto. The flights last September from a hill 60 miles north of Toronto, represented the culmination of a 17-year effort, in their spare time, to develop a flapping- wing aircraft. **********\"Rotary and fixed-wing aircraft are pretty well developed; flapping-wing flight represented a challenge,\" Mr. Harris said. And quite a challenge it has been. The pair nicknamed their aircraft Mr. Bill, after the perpetually maimed character on the television show \"Saturday Night Live,\" because of its propensity to crash. Between 1985, when flight testing began, and last September, they made more than 25 unsuccessful tests. Indeed, their favorite test site in Bond Head, Ontario, was chosen because there is a nice soft sod farm at the bottom of the hill, Mr. DeLaurier said. **********The ornithopter is made of lightweight materials, like Kevlar and carbon fibers, and weighs only 9 pounds, despite a wingspan of 10 feet. The craft, which is almost 5 feet long, is powered by a model helicopter engine and has radio controls for the throttle, rudder and elevator. **********Birds were not much help in developing the ornithopter, its inventors say. \"Early in our project, we looked at slow motion movies of birds in level equilibrium flight in order to gain some insight on nature's wing motions,\" Mr. DeLaurier wrote in a report on the project. \"In truth, very little was learned from this.\" The reason is that birds manipulate their wings and feathers in ways too complex to be imitated by a mechanical device. **********The ornithopter's wing structure is made up of three pieces. The two outer wings are hinged to the center wing, which rises and falls three times a second, producing the flapping motion. The downstrokes provide lift and the airfoil shape of the wings provides forward thrust. The wings twist in flight as much as 22 percent at the tips, which the inventors say is necessary to prevent the craft from stalling -- or losing its lift. **********Mr. Harris said avoiding stalling was a significant technical problem. With a fixed-wing aircraft, stalls happen most often when a pilot pitches the nose of the aircraft up too sharply, making what is called the angle of attack too steep. But with the ornithopter, the situation is more complex, because the angle of attack is changing constantly as the wings cycle up and down. **********The wings twist because of the action of the air and the way they were designed and built. That the wings should twist \"was a conclusion that took us a long time to reach,\" Mr. Harris said. **********Because designing the wings was such a long, tedious process, Mr. Harris and Mr. DeLaurier have decided not to use a birdlike tail. The after part of the ornithopter has a standard aircraft tail, rudder and elevators. **********Paul MacCready, a pioneer in human-powered flight, attributed the crash of his flapping-wing dinosaur reproduction in the mid-1980's to its ungainly long-necked, tailless layout. **********One problem the two inventors have not solved is taking off. At this stage of development, the flapping wings do not develop enough forward thrust for a takeoff roll. So the craft is launched by having someone (usually one of Mr. DeLaurier's graduate students) run down a hill and throw it into a headwind. Mr. DeLaurier said he hopes to launch future models by means of a towed cable, as sailplanes are. **********Having flown successfully, Mr. Bill was retired. The inventors have built a larger model that is to be exhibited this summer at Expo 92 in Seville, Spain. After it is returned, the inventors plan to remove the electric motor that will slowly flap the wings at the exposition and install an internal combustion engine to power the more rapid motions needed to fly. They plan to resume flights next summer. **********Mr. Harris said a fully developed ornithopter might combine the best characteristics of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. It could hover like a helicopter but fly forward more like an airplane. **********But the vision that seems to delight Mr. Harris is making it possible for people to soar. He envisions people strapping on powered ornithopters and taking to the skies. \"Sustained human-powered flight is possible, but only barely possible,\" he said. \"But with the additional energy, people could fly like birds.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/15/world/greek-official-escapes-death-in-a-rocket-attack-in-athens.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-07-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 137, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Greek Official Escapes Death In a Rocket Attack in Athens", "print_headline": "Greek Official Escapes Death In a Rocket Attack in Athens", "body_text": " **********Greece's Minister of Finance, Ioannis Paleokrassas, narrowly escaped assassination today in a rocket attack on his armored limousine in broad daylight.

J. Rogers, chairman of Cypress Semiconductor, a chip maker in Sunnyvalewho has long symbolized the Valley's fiercely independent management style. \"We've got troubles here in Silicon Valley.\" **********After working 70 hours a week for years on end, founding successful companies and becoming multimillionaires, many top executives here say their entrepreneurial zeal has been overtaken by worries about fierce global competition, increasing Government regulation and the cumbersome size of some companies, as well as the high cost of living, poor transportation and pollution. The Doomsayers vs. the Optimists **********And Tom Hayes, an executive at Applied Materials, a producer of chip-making equipment in Santa Clara and the chairman of an industry group that recently issued a report on Silicon Valley, said: \"High-tech jobs have been growing like crazy. They're just not growing here.\" **********But a variety of new entrepreneurs and Valley veterans say that is nonsense, arguing that the doomsayers are overlooking the extent to which the Valley's best and brightest now work on software and related new design technologies rather than hardware. **********\"There are plenty of ideas around and plenty of personnel around,\" said Sheldon Breiner, who recently founded Quorum Software Systems in Menlo Park, Calif. **********And Cyril Yansouni, the chairman of the Read-Rite Corporation of Milpitas, Calif., asserted: \"As far as creative ideas, this remains the nation's hotbed. I can see a lot of reasons to be frustrated, but in the end we get better products.\" **********Some people say the pessimists are nothing more than executives of established companies, whining because they cannot grow as quickly as they once did and because they oppose Government regulations intended to protect the environment and the Valley's workers against such things as the hazards of working in a semiconductor manufacturing plant. **********\"Everyone is screaming that we're losing our edge,\" said Anno Saxenian, a professor of regional planning at the University of California at Berkeley. \"But there is a lot of dynamism under the surface.\" Survived an Earlier Crisis **********The soul-searching found voice in the report by Mr. Hayes's panel, a study sponsored by some of the Valley's largest companies and business organizations. The report, titled \"An Economy at Risk,\" cautioned that a range of warning signs on the horizon are pointing toward the decline of Silicon Valley as a center of innovation for business and technology. **********\"It's getting so darn expensive to live here that we're restricting the flow of bright new people coming into the Valley,\" said Gordon Moore, vice chairman of Intel and a member of the industry panel. **********This is hardly the first time that the region -- 50 miles south of San Francisco and synonymous with the silicon chip, digital watch, hand-held calculator, video game and personal computer -- has found its competitiveness called into question. In the early 1980's, doubts arose about the Valley's ability to survive as a manufacturing center in the face of what appeared to be an overwhelming Japanese assault. **********Silicon Valley survived that crisis by shifting its focus from chip making to product design. As manufacturing jobs fled to lower-cost regions, Silicon Valley did not wither. Start-up companies thrived, new industries like pen computing continued to emerge, and bearded programmers and corporate executives replaced the thousands of assembly workers whose jobs were shifted elsewhere. **********But now a tangible mood of despair looms in Silicon Valley, leading to a debate about whether the very creativity that has defined the Valley is being exhausted. **********\"One of the things that is striking is that there has been a slowdown in the number of new businesses that are being formed,\" said Douglas Henton, assistant director in the center for economic competitiveness at SRI International, a research center in Menlo Park that prepared the original report. \"That's a warning sign.\" **********Some industry executives have called for an industry-government effort to shore up the Valley's economy -- a departure for business executives known for going their own ways. **********\"They're going from being cowboys to becoming collaborators,\" said Steven Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy, an economic research center in Palo Alto. **********Optimists say studies that have charted the region's decline have overlooked part of the Valley's continuing success: the impact of high-technology growth in areas surrounding Silicon Valley. Many technology start-up companies have emerged as far away as San Francisco and Berkeley -- but they are directly tied to the Valley's economic infrastructure. **********Another source of confusion is that much new growth in the Valley has been in software rather than in computer or semiconductor manufacturing. Because many software jobs are classified as service rather than manufacturing, the manufacturing employment numbers have not reflected this shift. **********Economists say the service category hides the real growth in the Valley -- software and hardware design jobs that have made the region the world's microelectronic research laboratory. **********Data collected by the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy show that manufacturing jobs in Silicon Valley fell to 258,500 last year from a peak of 291,600 in 1984. During that period, the number of service jobs grew to 219,900 from 179,200. Less Seed Money? **********Another area of concern is the falling amount of venture capital that is available for start-up companies. In past years the availability of such investments allowed virtually any engineer or executive with a bold idea to strike out on his own. **********But venture financing dropped to $1.09 billion last year from $1.24 billion in 1987, and the portion invested as seed money in new projects fell even more sharply. But not everyone is complaining. **********\"There's still plenty of venture capital,\" said Richard Shaffer, president of Technologic Partners, a New York firm that monitors high-technology start-ups. \"In fact there is no place else in the world that compares to Northern California in terms of start-up activity. What's broken is the economy of the state of California.\" **********And Wilf Corrigan, who founded the valley's largest chip maker, LSI Logic, and is a longtime engineer and manager there, said: \"I'm one of those people who have great confidence in Silicon Valley. There are a lot of people who come to work in the morning believing that they work for Silicon Valley.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/08/business/company-news-bell-atlantic-to-cut-profits.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bell Atlantic To Cut Profits", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Bell Atlantic To Cut Profits", "body_text": " **********The Bell Atlantic Corporation, one of the largest of the regional Bell operating companies, plans to take a $1.55 billion one-time charge for the year just ended to meet new suggested accounting rules for retirees' health costs.

Head Scolds U.S. And Bonn for Deficits", "body_text": " **********Laying out an economic rationale for the politically difficult step of cutting budget deficits, the head of the International Monetary Fund scolded the United States and Germany today, saying their large budget deficits hurt world growth. **********Opening the formal sessions of the annual meeting of the monetary fund and the World Bank, Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, used the moral suasion of his office to press Washington and Bonn to cut their deficits. He said the move would improve investor confidence, ease inflationary pressures and reduce long-term interest rates. **********If Germany cut its budget deficit, Mr. Camdessus said, that would give that nation's central bank more latitude to lower its high interest rates, which the United States and Britain repeatedly criticized last week. The Bundesbank has pushed its rates to over 9 percent to offset the inflationary pressures caused by the deficit, and those high rates helped fuel last week's currency tensions in Europe. Defying Conventional Wisdom **********In a hotel ballroom packed with finance ministers and central bankers from 172 countries, Mr. Camdessus defied the wisdom of most economists and said the United States and other nations should cut their deficits now, even though the world was mired in a protracted slump. While the conventional wisdom is that cutting deficits during an economic downturn would further weaken fragile economies, Mr. Camdessus said, \"Each postponement of long overdue fiscal action adds to the severity of the problem.\" **********\"Any further postponement\" of deficit reduction \"out of concern for possible short-tem effects on activity would contribute to a worse environment rather than a better one,\" Mr. Camdessus added. He did not address the short-term political pain that would be exacted by the spending cuts or tax increases needed to cut deficits. **********Mr. Camdessus spoke on a day when financial markets remained tense, with the French franc and several other European currencies slipping to near the minimum level to which they are allowed to fall under the European monetary system, an 11-nation arrangement of fixed exchange rates. **********As financial officials and journalists milled about, the halls of the Sheraton-Washington Hotel were filled with rumors that there might be further devaluations in Europe. Finance Minister Theo Waigel of Germany was so wrapped up in meetings that he canceled a long-scheduled lunch with journalists. **********Sounding like a lecturing schoolmaster, Mr. Camdessus praised Japan, saying prudent budget policies had allowed Tokyo to \"announce a welcome economic package\" to stimulate its economy. Scolds the United States **********But he spoke of the United States as a wayward pupil, suggesting that its budget deficit had made it difficult for Washington to use fiscal stimulus to escape its protracted slowdown. Instead, the United States has relied on monetary policy in the form of low interest rates to spur the economy. **********On Monday, Finance Minister Carlos Solchaga of Spain, the chairman of the monetary fund's main policy-making committee, said that American rates were too low and German rates too high, and that the gap between the two countries' rates had caused Europe's currency crisis. The gap encouraged many money managers to shun American investments in favor of high-yield German assets. That strengthened the mark so much that it forced Britain, Italy and Spain to devalue their currencies last week. **********Mr. Camdessus weighed in against lower American rates today, saying it would be imprudent for the Federal Reserve to cut rates further. In remarks clearly aimed at the United States, he said: \"Some will tell you that it could be safe now to relax monetary discipline and so give a boost to activity, because inflation has been subdued, if not quite defeated. But this would be the most serious mistake we could make today.\" **********In brief remarks to open the meeting, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady rejected the idea that American rates should be higher. He said, \"When interest rates remain high for whatever reason,\" that hurts growth by discouraging businesses from borrowing to expand. Third-World Perspective **********Speaking for the developing world, Mohammed Berrada, the head of Morocco's central bank and chairman of the I.M.F.-World Bank meeting, chided the United States and other industrial nations for their budget deficits. He said the deficits reduced the global pool of investment money that the developing world and former Communist countries could use to build their economies. He added that deficits pushed up long-term interest rates, increasing the third world's debt burden. **********Mr. Berrada said, \"It is more crucial than ever for government policies to display a consistent and overarching vision that takes account of the repercussions of such policies on other countries.\" **********Regarding the former Communist countries, Mr. Camdessus said their transition to a market economy \"is urgent and daunting.\" He noted that there have been setbacks, most notably inflationary pressures, and even the threat of prices increases of more than 1,000 percent a year. **********Despite the pain that market-oriented reforms are causing, he urged a full-speed-ahead approach. \"Full transformation will take time,\" he said, \"but that is a good reason to start immediately, and to take advantage of the dynamism and enthusiasm of the present period to create, irreversibly, the basic structures of a market economy.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/28/business/all-about-the-gold-market-the-good-news-about-gold-there-isn-t-a-lot.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1992-06-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1585, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "All About/The Gold Market; The Good News About Gold: There Isn't a Lot", "print_headline": "All About/The Gold Market; The Good News About Gold: There Isn't a Lot", "body_text": " **********Yes, there is some good news about gold. **********Gold fillings are making a comeback as prices have retreated. And in 1991, the amount of gold used to make jewelry rose to 2,111 metric tons, a 3.7 percent increase from the year before and a new record, according to Gold Fields Mineral Services, the London-based precious metals research firm owned by three gold mining companies. It was the fifth straight year that jewelry manufacturing had increased. **********It appears, according to the same Gold Fields study, that the huge increase in the production and overall supply of gold that lead to the sharp price declines of the last six years is leveling off. The total world supply of gold declined last year for the first time since 1983, and mine production showed the smallest increase since 1980. **********Less supply could mean stable, if not immediately higher, prices. But the bad news right now is that these facts, and all the others that are mined daily in the gold market, still may not mean much in the way of a stronger price. **********The problem for gold is that no matter what you think moves the price -- supply and demand, inflation, the dollar, wars, ideological conflict or even the possibility of a renewed gold standard -- none of these factors is currently providing much of a plus signal. Communism has faded; inflation is at low levels around the world, and gold supplies are shrinking but not plummeting. So no matter how you track gold, its outlook at the moment is neutral at best. **********A Raging Debate  What Causes Prices To Rise and Fall? **********From an average price in 1987 of $446.07 an ounce, gold fell to $362.26 in 1991. Adjusted for inflation, gold in dollar terms is at its lowest level since the late 1970's and in Japanese yen its lowest since 1972. On Friday gold closed at $343.50 an ounce in London, up $8.40 from its low for the year. But at its 1992 low, gold was at a level not seen since 1986. **********Despite the disappointing performance of gold, the debate still rages over what moves its price. **********David Poole, a senior vice president and economist at Van Eck Associates Corporation in New York, is in what might be called the traditionalist camp. He is in some ways a \"gold bug,\" someone who believes strongly that gold is the best insurance against any currency's depreciation. **********For Mr. Poole, who has followed gold for more than 30 years, the price is moved by expectations of inflation and the strength or weakness of the dollar. Using data for these forces and other proxies, like the interest rate on 30-year Treasuries, Mr. Poole has traced the performance of gold since it was allowed to trade freely 21 years ago. **********Like most gold bugs, Mr. Pool is optimistic: He sees a rebound in gold prices over the next two years. Mr. Poole is bullish because he expects the economic recovery to continue and to be a little stronger than the consensus outlook. With growth, Mr. Poole expects the rate of inflation to rise to the 5 percent range. This should lead to a further weakening of the dollar, with gold rising to around $500 an ounce. The last two rallies to the $500 level came when inflation rose from below the current 3 percent range into the 4.5 percent to 5 percent range. **********Mr. Poole acknowledges that his theory is not perfect. For example, in his view, the price of gold should be rising when the dollar is falling. But that is not the case at the moment. The dollar, compared with other major currencies like the Japanese yen and German mark, has fallen 3.5 percent since the end of May, but gold has managed to inch up just 1.8 percent. **********Money or Commodity?  Supply and Demand In the Ascendancy **********At the other end of the spectrum is the view that gold is moved basically by supply and demand. This means that gold is a commodity, like soybeans, wheat or coffee. **********James R. Steel, a metals analyst at Refco Inc., the big commodities trading firm based in Chicago, believes that gold is part money and part commodity. But because inflation is at such lows, the money part is getting no help. Mr. Steele thinks that \"supply and demand is going to increase in relevance.\" **********Looking at the Gold Fields report, which the industry often refers to as \"The Bible,\" one feels that gold is behaving more like a commodity. This is the case because forces other than supply and demand that could have an impact on gold prices -- like inflation, war and financial catastrophe -- seem to be receding. **********In addition, there are more alternative investments today than 10 years ago, so gold is less likely to be a preferred investment.  And the supply and demand factors over the last 10 or 15 years really look like they have had an impact. The rise in supply in the 1980's helped lead to the fall in the price of gold, the Gold Fields analysis shows. The slowing of that supply might now lend some support to the price. **********But the report also postulates what Gold Fields considers a more likely supply and demand scenario. With sluggish economic growth, the slowing supply of gold will not become a force boosting the price very quickly. This in turn will encourage a lot of investors to sell gold, adding to the pressure on price and maintaining \"a depressed gold price for some time to come,\" the report says. **********Fillings  Dental Patients are Going for the Gold **********One of the key supply factors is mine production. According to Gold Fields, the continuing fall in the price of gold has left around one third of the world's industry unprofitable, although this does not mean they have stopped producing. In 1991, mine production rose only 2.1 percent, down from 3.7 percent in 1990 and 8 percent in 1989. If the price of gold falls further, the pressure on production will increase. **********South Africa is the world's largest producer of gold, but it also has the second-highest average cost of production. There are only four mines in South Africa, according to Gold Fields, that have production costs under $250 an ounce. Eighty percent of the mines in South Africa have costs per ounce of gold that range from $230 to $372. At the higher range, the cost of producing an ounce of gold is higher than the metal's current selling price. **********One clear effect of the lower price of gold is that people are putting it back into their teeth again. **********The biggest players in the dental gold market are the Japanese and the Germans. In 1982, they put 31.3 metric tons of gold in their mouths -- half of the world's dental goldplate. But then Germany -- and the rest of the world's dental patients, except for the Japanese -- turned to less expensive alternatives like compacted porcelain, titanium and palladium-based alloys. Use of gold dropped just over 28 percent from 1982 to 1987. **********But in Germany last year, the use of gold rose 22 percent. The reason: the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany. The former West German government has subsidized 80 percent of the cost of dental treatment for former East Germans. But this subsidy will be halved on July 1. So there has been a rush to get the gold in. A LITTLE TARNISH ON PLATINUM **********Platinum, another precious metal that is not as precious as it used to be. Because its major industrial use is in catalytic converters, platinum is moved by economic slowdowns or recoveries, when auto production is falling or rising. It can also be moved by new demand, like that expected when Europe tightens its air-quality standards and thus demands catalytic converters. **********But the price of platinum is moved most abruptly by scares that some other material can be substituted for it. The most recent scare came in May of last year, when Nissan, the giant Japanese auto maker, said it was developing a palladium-only catalytic converter. Even though it was obvious that this converter could be used only on small cars in Japan, the price of platinum tumbled $30 an ounce. **********But while platinum is not a mystic metal like gold, many in the market believe it has an inverse connection to the price of gold. And this can make it a hedge against adverse moves in the price of gold. **********The outlook for platinum, according to the annual review released last month by Johnson Matthey, a refiner and marketer of precious metals based in London, is a little unclear. The metal rallied from a low of $331 an ounce in January to $378 in June.. But recently, said James R. Steel, a metals analyst at Refco Inc., the commodities firm based in Chicago, it has gotten a \"little bit of a bloody nose.\" It closed on Friday at $360.40. **********And while the Johnson Matthey report points out that supply will shrink this year and demand in Europe will rise, the slowdown of the economy in Japan could turn off any major rally. The Japanese are the world's chief consumers of platinum jewelry -- they bought 86 percent of the world's total last year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/01/business/company-news-sears-plans-to-cut-2000-more-jobs.html": {"writer_name": "Stephanie Strom", "pub_date": "1992-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 688, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sears Plans To Cut 2,000 More Jobs", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Sears Plans To Cut 2,000 More Jobs", "body_text": " **********Sears, Roebuck & Company said yesterday that it would eliminate 2,000 more jobs by early next year.

By the end of 1993, Sears expects to have eliminated 43,150 jobs, for savings of $940 million a year. **********Last month, Sears started a new compensation plan that has persuaded about 3,200 commissioned sales associates to leave with severance pay. Sears said about 650 of the jobs would be eliminated, while the others would be filled by lower-paid Sears employees or workers hired from outside the company. **********The reductions were at least partly responsible for improved earnings in 1991, which increased by 42 percent, to $1.28 billion. **********In its annual report, Sears also said it planned to open 14 new stores this year and renovate 72 others.

The company said it acquired the bankrupt U.P.I. to bolster the news-gathering scope of its satellite television channel, which is broadcast in Arabic throughout Europe and the Middle East. **********As a result of the decade-long spending spree, Saudi Arabians, mostly princes from the Saudi royal family and others close to the King, now exert a dominant influence over the news and political opinions presented to millions of Arabs. **********At least two dozen Saudi-owned Arab publications are now based in London, including the two most influential Arab dailies -- Al Hayat and Asharq al Awsat -- as well as several newsweeklies like Al Mijalla and Al Watan.

Prince Salman is widely viewed as the Saudi royal family's press overlord. **********Noted Arab writers, including Islamic fundamentalists and leftist critics, as well as Mutafa Amin, the Arab world's best-read columnist, are paid highly to write for Saudi publications. But they follow a certain amount of self-censorship when it comes to Saudi causes. **********For instance, Fahmy Howeidi, an Islamic fundamentalist who was once a vehement supporter of the Iranian revolution, has toned down his enthusiasm for Teheran since he began to write for the London-based Saudi news magazine, Al Mijallah. **********Still, some Arab journalists say the Saudi-backed news organizations are reviving the aggressive journalism that thrived from the 1950's to the 1970's in Cairo and Beirut. **********Urfan Nizam-Eddin, the executive editor of Middle East Broadcasting, said the London-based Arab news media had more freedom than any Arab news organization elsewhere. **********\"If I can't write or say it in London, I wouldn't be able to write it elsewhere anyway,\" he said. \"What we get more of, coming out of London, is the cultural diversity and the wide view on the world.\" **********But this is not a widely shared view. \"Every Saudi newspaper gets its orders from Riyadh,\" said a senior editor at such a newspaper, who spoke on condition of anonymity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/30/world/croats-and-serbs-battle-fiercely-in-bosnia.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 248, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Croats and Serbs Battle Fiercely in Bosnia", "print_headline": "Croats and Serbs Battle Fiercely in Bosnia", "body_text": " **********Croatian and Serbian forces clashed in Bosnia and Herzegovina today, just hours before a cease-fire signed by their commanders on Saturday was scheduled to take effect, local news reports said. **********Fierce fighting was reported near the towns of Orasje and Brcko, where Croatian units are holding on to their last positions on the Bosnian side of the Sava River valley. **********An official Serbian news agency reported a Croatian attack on the nearby town of Loncari, which straddles the only Serb-controlled road that links their strongholds in western Bosnia and occupied regions of Croatia with Serbia. **********Bosnian radio bulletins said Serbian forces had shelled the towns of Gradacac, Tesanj and Olovo, which lie just south of the Serbs' vital supply line.

The museum will open to the public on April 26. **********Mr. Chamberlin, a historian of modern Germany who taught at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland, was interviewed here before continuing to Kishinev, the capital of Moldova, a former Soviet republic and a place of a mass murder by German and Romanian forces of its large Jewish population. In both cities, he negotiated with archive officials and selected materials to be microfilmed. **********The historian said the fall of the old governments in Eastern Europe had breached the walls of secrecy with which all Communist countries customarily protected their collections of official documents. This applied equally to captured German material and surviving records of extinct Jewish areas. **********Since the countries dominated by the Soviet Union after World War II were the principal sites of the murder of 6 million Jews, the new accessibility of their archives represents a major gain for study of the subject. **********The changed attitude contrasts sharply with the way former Communist governments always treated the history of the murder of their Jewish citizens. In an effort to place all blame on Nazi Germany, they kept a lid on records because they contain evidence of local collaboration in the killings. **********Mr. Chamberlin said a loosening of the former restrictions had begun even before the dissolution of the Soviet bloc under the policies of glasnost, or openness, introduced by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader. **********The first breakthrough was achieved in 1987 in Poland, Mr. Chamberlin said. An agreement was reached to provide for the microfilming of captured German records that had served as evidence in Polish war crimes trials. **********He recalled that as a sign of good will, Warsaw donated to the museum a boxcar that was said to have transported Jews from the Warsaw ghetto to the Treblinka extermination camp. Unfortunately, he said, the donors covered it with a fresh coat of paint, which had to be stripped off in Washington to lay bare the old markings. **********On his last visit here, 18 months ago, Mr. Chamberlin said the Romanian military's archives were made readily accessible and many documents were selected for copying. \"Other institutions were not so forthcoming,\" Mr. Chamberlin said. **********On this visit, he said the Romanian Information Service, the successor to the Securitate, the feared secret police under the old Communist regime of Nicolae Ceausescu, \"keeps bringing tremendous quantities of documents, including photos that have never been published,\" of pogroms and roundups of Romanian Jews for deportation. **********The historian said microfilming in the former Soviet Union began in 1988 and hundreds of thousands of pages, mainly of Nazi documents, have been copied in Moscow and such major centers of Jewish life and death as Minsk, Kiev, Odessa, Riga, Grodno and Mogilev. Work has also been done in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. **********The museum is being built with private contributions. About $140 million of the total cost of about $150 million has already been given or pledged. The United States Government donated the site, on 14th Street SW, south of Independence Avenue, and will pay the operating costs of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, which will run the museum. **********Mr. Chamberlin said the purpose of the archives was to gather in one place as much material as possible to ease research.

A 'Luxury They Could Ill Afford' **********In eliminating of the Cadillac Allante, Cadillac said the car was profitable but that sales of the $62,000 car had slowed with the sluggish economy. And the expensive manufacturing process -- undercarriages made in Detroit and flown to Italy, where the Pininfarina-built bodies and interiors are installed and flown back to the United States -- is out of step with the new management's eagerness to improve efficiency and focus on high-volume products. **********\"It was another luxury they can ill afford,\" said Thomas M. Dukes, director of competitive assessment for J. D. Power & Associates, an auto marketing consultant. **********The Allante announcement disappointed many Cadillac dealers, who noted that the model brought additional business. But the car never created the halo with which Cadillac had hoped to illuminate the entire division. A Roof That Annoyed **********The Allante's problems included a convertible roof that leaked and created bothersome wind noise. The manually operated roof was also a struggle for many owners, who believed the top on such an expensive car should operate with the push of a button. The newer models are semiautomated but still require manual help. **********\"I don't like to spend that kind of money and have a half-manual top,\" said Joel Must, president of Detroit City Dairy, who owned one before trading it for a Cadillac Seville. **********Allante production has fallen since the 1987 model year, when 3,363 Allantes were made. In the first 10 months of 1992, Cadillac sold 1,844 Allantes, a 26 percent drop from the corresponding period in 1991. When it was introduced, Cadillac said it was prepared to build 7,800 of the luxury cars a year. **********Although Cadillac introduced many technological innovations in the Allante, including its Northstar V-8 engine in April, the roadster did not measure up to many competitors in its handling and other performance characteristics.

Even the wells were blown up, covered with concrete or poisoned. **********Kurdish leaders say more than 180,000 people disappeared in the campaign, known as Anfal, a corruption of a Koranic verse that permits Muslims to slaughter heretics. **********No one was meant to inhabit Qala Diza, or any of the hundreds of other Kurdish population centers, again. And even today the main source of fresh water for the 40,000 people who have returned comes from tanks supplied by the United Nations. **********The Kurds are painfully aware that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is scheduled to leave in April, and that the Western troops are supposed to pull out of the security zone in June. If these groups leave, most Kurds say, they will flee again, even if it means abandoning the towns and villages they have reclaimed. **********\"If the allies and the United Nations leave,\" said Zahra Khider, a 30-year-old mother with five small children, \"then Saddam will send his troops and helicopters against us. We will run or be killed.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/06/world/free-market-ideas-grow-on-russian-farms.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1992-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1911, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Free-Market Ideas Grow on Russian Farms", "print_headline": "Free-Market Ideas Grow on Russian Farms", "body_text": " **********Ask about the \"free market\" or \"reform,\" and people out on these fertile South Russian plains still begin to snarl. **********But ask about the price of wheat or the cost of fuel, and the animated patter tells a different story. A year after the Government began to wean agriculture from the hugely inefficient Soviet system, some tender new shoots of market are appearing in the hardened old collective farms, the kolkhozes. **********Russian farmers have always had a capitalist streak of sorts. Even during the most Communist of times, peasants were allowed their private plots of land, which in some areas provided most of the meat and vegetables in local markets. **********But rare was the farmer who felt any direct responsibility for the collective farm. This is what is changing. **********The effect on production is hard to measure. Officials in Moscow say they expect 96 million tons of grain this year, short of the 115 million Russia needs, but 7 million tons above last year's harvest. While no one says the increase was a result of the fledgling market, it confounded the many skeptics who had warned that reforms would destroy agriculture. **********The shortage, officials said, will be offset in part through purchases in Kazakhstan and Ukraine and in part through more imports from the West. **********The key point, the change in attitude, has become evident over the past 12 months. **********Last year, when the first decrees came down proclaiming the new era of the free market, virtually every member of the huge Rossiya collective here -- 1,900 workers on 55,500 rich, black acres in the wheat belt between Krasnodar and Stavropol -- signed a petition to the regional administration saying, in effect, \"Leave us alone.\" **********People still go on about \"those cockroaches in Moscow\" and complain, \"What's this country coming to?\" But these were some other recent remarks: **********\"We did a lot of barter last year, but now we can get up to 22 rubles at the exchange.\" **********\"We might sell our wheat in Russia and buy the cheaper stuff from Kazakhstan for feed.\" **********\"We'll put in less sugar beet next year. The plant is 1,000 kilometers away, and with new fuel costs ----\" **********\"We're looking into our own sunflower press. We could easily pay it off in five years.\" **********Despite all the doomsday warnings last year of collapse and famine after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Communist system, the wheat crop was respectable, the corn and sunflowers pulled through the drought and the accounts ended up in the black. A Real Cooperative **********The debate is far from over, of course. Kolkhoz members still argue vehemently against parceling out collective land for private farms, and Parliament has not yet crossed the hurdle of private land ownership. **********But what is already clear is that the Rossiya kolkhoz, much like the country it is named after, is learning to look to the bottom line. **********For one thing, it has become a real cooperative, in which all the workers and pensioners have a formal share. Even the fields look better, because workers have been far more careful harvesting. **********On the next rung of the food chain, the grain elevator in the regional center at Novo-Aleksandrovskaya, Raisa Makarenko's job as deputy director used to entail little more than receiving and dispensing state-owned grain. Now she slips naturally into bargaining. Learning to Bargain **********Discussing the ruble price per kilogram of wheat, she said: \"If we buy at 12, we have to sell at 21 or 22 to make ends meet. Break-even is 17, with the value-added tax. But here's the problem: I just talked to Yaroslavl and offered them 3,000 tons for 25. They just said no. On the exchanges they're offering 20 to 22, so I had to go for 20.\" **********That meant a loaf of the best bread in Yaroslavl, a city north of Moscow, will sell for about 15 rubles, roughly what it costs today. **********Aleksei P. Zalkin, the head of the regional administration at Novo-Aleksandrovskaya, remarked: \"We're not used to all this yet, of course. All our life we worked on stern diktat from above,\" he added, flicking a glance at the unsmiling Lenin still hanging over his desk. \"We answered with our head and our party card for every head of cattle. **********\"But our psychology has changed a lot in the past year. Nobody counted money before. Now a day doesn't pass without a check on the balance sheet. People understand that it will never be, that it can't be, as it was.\" **********And Lenin? \"Oh, we'll get to that when we have time.\" It Was the Peasants' Fault **********Here in Russia's heartland, it is hard to blame people for not rushing to take down their Lenins. Reforms came and went with brutal regularity under the czars and under the Bolsheviks, who granted land, then took it away, always binding the muzhik, or peasant, to the land -- and always in the end blaming him for the resulting disaster. **********So it is little consolation here that the latest reforms are intended essentially to undo decades of disastrous manipulation and to restore elemental links among farmer, land and market. **********\"This is a country where we create problems and then take great pride in overcoming them,\" said Mikhail G. Solovyev, the chief agronomist of the Rossiya kolkhoz. \"Just look there.\" **********Outside the window of his office, a grand Russian Orthodox Church was in the last stages of reconstruction. The original church, the pride of the prosperous Kuban Cossacks who lived on these lands before they were scattered by the Bolsheviks, was blown up twice, once after the Revolution and again after World War II. **********Mr. Solovyev's concern, shared widely in the conservative brotherhood of agriculture, is that the reforms not become simply another twist in the cycle of restoration and destruction. Spending Priorities **********He concedes that the kolkhoz is not in bad shape: It earned enough to meet expenses and then some, and there are plans for a new sunflower press. Mr. Solovyev's dream is that instead of \"wasting\" dollars on imported grain, the state would spend them on imported combines and processing plants. **********But market forces, he argues, have had a dual effect. Many collective farms are withholding grain from the state (which still buys 35 percent of the crop at a fixed price), hoping that prices will rise. **********This year, the entire Stavropol region did not produce a single pound of top-class wheat, because the amount of fertilizer needed was too expensive. At the same time, it has become more profitable to sell grain than to raise livestock. **********\"The arithmetic is simple,\" Mr. Solovyev said. \"The feed for a pig costs 12,000 rubles, and the pig fetches 5,000. So of course it's better to slaughter the livestock. But if we do, what happens to all the people and the facilities in which we invested so much? So we resist killing off the animals, but I don't know how long we can do that.\" **********The other problem is that like most state and collective farms, Rossiya was built as a paternalistic Soviet state in miniature, responsible not only for production of food but also for the lives of its people. The names of surrounding farms bear testimony to that heritage: Lenin, Karl Marx, Friendship, Gorky. A True Company Town **********Here in Grigoropolisskaya, the 8,000 residents depend on Rossiya: it built the roads, the school and the hospital; it sends people to its own rest homes on the Black Sea; it supplied the private plots and the seeds to plant them. **********Wages have always been decent. Today, kolkhoz workers can earn between 3,000 and 5,000 rubles a month, well above the 2,000-ruble poverty line, plus a share of the crop and of the profits. **********The kolkhoz fed its dependents through the lean years and rewarded them in good ones. And whatever the kolkhoz did not supply, the kolkhozniks could always steal, in time-honored Soviet tradition, pilfering fertilizer and fuel to maintain the lucrative private plots. **********Rossiya, moreover, was a showcase. It once carried the name of Stalin himself, something only the most privileged enterprises could do, and it was a place to which Nikita S. Khrushchev and Mikhail S. Gorbachev brought visitors. When there was an American combine to try out, Rossiya got it. Big, It Seems, Is Better **********Moreover, Mr. Solovyev argued, the economies of scale developed over the decades on these black-earth plains could be destroyed if the land is parceled out. Under the current kolkhoz organization, each worker and pensioner can claim a share of land, about 17 acres, only a small fraction of an average cornfield. **********\"However we go about these reforms, we will return to large associations,\" Mr. Solovyev said. \"So why waste time? What would be the use? How can small farmers ever provide the roads, the schools?\" **********To the architects of the reforms, such plaints are reminiscent of Leonid I. Brezhnev's celebrated frustration with farmers who never ceased complaining about the weather. \"The experience of many years has shown that unfavorable weather occurs almost every other year,\" the longtime Communist chief grumbled 12 years ago. \"It should therefore not be viewed as an exception, but as a natural aspect of our climate.\" **********Agriculture Minister Viktor N. Khlystun might well agree. The main challenge, he said in an interview in Moscow, is to change the consciousness of the farmer, to break the fatalism, the suspiciousness of the market, the dependence on the kolkhoz. A Beginning, Anyway **********Yes, he said, there are problems with livestock, with disparities in prices, with wheat withheld from the market. Parliament is still dragging its feet on land ownership. Private farmers are only starting up, and basic market structures -- banks, cooperatives, equipment supplies -- are still rudimentary. **********Mr. Khlystun said private farmers were expected to account for 3 percent to 3.5 percent of this year's agricultural production. **********Many of the problems, he said, are predictable, and many can be resolved through some transitional juggling of prices, subsidies, interest rates and fuel discounts. **********\"But the main change has to be a change in mentality,\" he argued, echoing a conclusion reformers in all aspects of the economy have reached after the first nine months. \"That's why we cannot accelerate the pace of reform, because it's linked above all to changing the mentality.\" The Long-Term Goals **********Mr. Khlystun said the Government's goal was not to kill all the state or collective farms, but to make them self-sufficient and profitable. At the end of the transition, he said, he envisions that half of Russia's farms will be large associations, 20 percent small cooperatives and 20 percent individual farms, with 10 percent remaining with the state. \"But the time is over when the Government gives money to ineffective structures,\" he said. **********The immediate challenge is to survive the transition. **********\"We are now in a crisis period, in a period of survival,\" Mr. Khlystun said. \"If there is no further cataclysm, we should finish the privatization by next spring. But it will take another 10 to 12 years to set up the banks, the services, the infrastructure. All that depends on the state of the economy.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/19/world/ousted-thai-leader-now-political-front-runner.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1992-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 656, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ousted Thai Leader Now Political Front-Runner", "print_headline": "Ousted Thai Leader Now Political Front-Runner", "body_text": " **********The scandal-tainted Thai Prime Minister ousted in a coup in 1991 has re-emerged as a front-runner to lead Thailand's next civilian government, a political rebirth that has dismayed many in the country's new democracy movement. **********In a political system in which office-seekers are often compared to \"ching chok,\" or chameleons, and yesterday's enemy is today's devoted ally, perhaps no one has changed colors so dramatically as Chatichai Choonhavan, the 70-year-old former Prime Minister. **********Mr. Chatichai has patched things up with Thai military leaders -- many of the same men who toppled his Government in February 1991, forced him into temporary exile and impounded his wealth -- and is being touted as a serious contender in the election scheduled for Sept. 13. **********His newly formed political party, Chat Pattana, or National Development Party, has attracted a variety of discredited if still powerful and wealthy politicians, many with close ties to the military.

In Mr. Chatichai's case, more than $9 million in assets were seized. Mr. Chatichai has denied the corruption allegations and has gone to court to appeal the ruling. **********In seeking support for his new party, Mr. Chatichai has pointed to his record as Prime Minister in promoting economic growth and in assisting Thailand's impoverished neighbors, including Vietnam and Cambodia, through investment. For several years, the Thai economy has been one of the world's fastest growing. **********Leaders of the democracy movement fear that a new Chatichai government could undo this year's dramatic progress in reforming Thai politics -- reform that came at the cost of scores of lives in street clashes last May between democracy protesters and armed soldiers. **********The killings inflamed the Thai public and brought about the collapse of the military-dominated Government that had succeeded Mr. Chatichai, and led as well to the ouster of several senior army and air force leaders. **********The caretaker Prime Minister now running the government, Anand Panyarachun, is seen as one of the most capable and honest leaders in Thailand's history.

And indeed the industry prospered right along with Americans in general in the 1980's. **********But the good times ended three or four years ago and construction of in-ground pools has fallen sharply. If the recession were not frightful enough, this summer has been the second straight bad one in terms of weather. Cooler than normal temperatures discouraged homeowners in some areas and long stretches of rain prevented planned construction in others. **********\"In some portions of the country, there was basically no real summer,\" said Terri Simmons, editor of Swimming Pool/Spa Age magazine, pointing, for one, to the Great Lakes region. **********The industry's trade group, the National Spa and Pool Institute, will hold its 36th annual convention in Atlanta in a few weeks, but with fewer exhibitors than in years past.  A few will no doubt gain business as Floridians gradually rebuild after Hurricane Andrew, but in the bad times, some companies have gone under and others are holding on by concentrating on renovation rather than new installations. **********Meanwhile, the fight for the homeowner's discretionary dollars has become a real battle. Even companies like B-L Network Inc. of Decatur, Ga., a large distributor of in-ground pool components, above-ground pools and spas that have managed to increase sales over the past few years tell a grim tale. B-L Network's success, rather than reflecting market growth, came \"at the expense of others,\" said Rod Sterling, president of the company. **********Mr. Sterling, whose distribution company has 30 wholesale locations and is a subsidiary of BioLab Inc., a pool-chemical manufacturer, mentioned still another cause of trouble. \"One of our primary lending institutions for pools was the S.&L.; People are going to do whatever they can to salvage their house, so we thought we were a very good risk. But we got caught in that whole net,\" said Mr. Sterling, adding, \"In many areas the demand was there but the financing wasn't.\" **********In 1989, when sales leveled off, 149,000 in-ground pools were purchased nationwide. Made of concrete, vinyl and, less often, fiberglass, steel and aluminum, a mid-size pool costs roughly $25,000. Added to the sales of spas and above-ground pools, each at an average $3,000, together with ancillary services and accessories, the industry generated an estimated $7.5 billion in revenues that year. **********Although even the industry has few reliable statistics, sales of above-ground pools and spas appear to have remained fairly strong. One reason, presumably, is that they cost so much less than the in-ground pools.Search for an Identity Teen-Age Industry, Little Brand Loyalty **********The United States is by far the largest pool market in the world, with an estimated 7 million in-ground pools alone. The industry is, however, remarkably fragmented for its size, embracing everything from local construction companies to companies that make accessories like pumps to major companies that make chemicals to clean pools. Market growth has not been helped by this lack of cohesion. **********\"It's a mom-and-pop business,\" said Joe Smith of Oxtoby-Smith, a New York-based market research company that the pool industry has hired to develop more accurate ways to track sales and market share. \"All you need to be a pool installer is a pickup truck, two large persons and a shovel.\" **********Though huge multinational corporations like Olin and Du Pont (which make chemicals used in pool maintenance) are part of the industry, there is no truly national pool retailer or construction company. **********\"There's no brand identity in pools,\" said Mr. Sterling. \"We're still in that growing-up stage, like a teen-ager. If we had something called USA Swim, for example, a lot of small family competitors would be very frightened, but it would probably be very good for the industry.\" **********One of the better-known pool names is Esther Williams, made by the Delair Group Inc. of Delair, N.J. But even its best-selling above-ground brand carrying the swimmer-actress's name accounts for only 36 percent of Delair's six poollines, said Carston Jensen, Delair's director of marketing. Delair also makes Johnny Weismuller Pools. **********Mr. Smith agreed that a brand leader would help raise the profile of pool ownership in general, but added, \"One of the problems has been that most in-ground pools are locally produced. They're not shippable or manufactured centrally.\" Local builders, like car salesmen, are of mixed repute and can actually end up as a deterrent to the consumer in the long deliberative process (\"Up to five years,\" said Mr. Smith.) that typically precedes a pool purchase. **********Other negative image factors, such as cost, maintenance, space and the potential hazard to children, have also not been addressed by the industry as a whole.Above-Ground Gains Moderate Prices Prevail Over Image **********Florida and California accounted for 40 percent of all in-ground pool sales in 1991, not too surprising in states where pool ownership seems almost mandatory for individuals and apartment complexes. Behind them was the North Atlantic region (Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, as defined by the National Spa and Pool Institute). **********New York on its own, however, with 414,000 units installed, is the clear leader in above-ground pool purchase. New York's total is almost twice that of any other state, but the institute's figures are probably underestimates. \"You don't need a permit for an above-ground pool,\" explained Dave Gottshall, vice president for sales and marketing at Doughboy Recreational, based in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., a major manufacturer of above-ground pools. **********Priced from $600 to $5,000 and mostly designed for self-assembly, above-ground pools began in the Northeast. Doughboy, Mr. Gottshall claims, made the first ones just after World War II and the market has been a good one ever since. \"Even during the economic downturn we've seen good increases,\" he said. **********In the South, above-ground pools have also increased in number as people migrated from the North to the Sun Belt. \"There used to be snobbery that said if you had an above-ground pool down there you couldn't afford an in-ground,\" said Mr. Gottshall, \"but now people just do what they want.\"Reaching Out Cable TV Ads And Referrals **********This self-described teen-ager of an industry has recently taken a step toward maturity. It was just four years ago that the National Spa and Pool Institute commissioned some research on customers' needs and motivations. Competition for the discretionary \"fantasy dollar\" was clear: cruises, recreational vehicles, second homes -- the kinds of industries that are \"seductively communicating with us all the time,\" said Mr. Smith of Oxtoby-Smith. **********The research was used to develop two short-term cable television commercials. In the fall of 1991 and spring this year, N.S.P.I. advertising expenditures hit $620,000, and the N.S.P.I. recently started a referral program to allow members to follow up on consumer inquiries. **********More aggressive companies are supporting the N.S.P.I.\"s search for a clearer identity, although contributions to the institute's advertising coffers are still described as slim. **********\"Those with vision in the industry are going to have to take the lead or petulantly die with those who haven't,\" predicted Mr. Smith.  PEGGING BUYERS BY THEIR GENDER **********One fact that turned up in recent research commissioned by the National Spa and Pool Institute was that women made most calls to companies inquiring about having a pool dug into the backyard. **********The decision to buy a pool takes from 18 months to five years to make and regularly involves the whole family, the institute found. But the research also indicated that while men most often raised negative arguments, women typically argued in favor of the purchase, making them the natural ally of the swimming pool industry. **********\"Basically, our target market for pools is women between 24 and 45\" who are fairly well educated and live in a household with a high socioeconomic level, said Jack Cergol, the institute's communications director. The institute, based in Alexandria, Va., is an industry-financed association of 4,200 companies that build or sell pools, spas and hot tubs. **********To capitalize on its findings, the trade group had commercials made that emphasized some of the themes that women had indicated were important to them. **********For instance, Mr. Cergol said, women apparently viewed buying a pool as an investment for family happiness, but were quite concerned about the safety of their small children, who might accidentally fall in. **********Thus, the advertisements concentrate on the supervision of children, health and \"family enjoyment, to enhance their life style within the home,\" he said. **********Despite all the warm and fuzzy overtones, though, the ads carry a pretty basic slogan: \"Beating the Heat.\" **********The industry is also working on ways to overcome consumers' feelings that pools just are not affordable. \"People have a perception they can't afford it until they start doing some research,\" said Dave Gottshall, a vice president of Doughboy Recreational, a California company that is a major manufacturer of above-ground pools. **********Although sales did not rise substantially after the ads began airing last fall and this spring, the pool institute's followup studies said they had increased consumer awareness and appreciation of pools. **********As for men, the studies found on they were more likely to initiate the research into spas and usually fell in the age range of 25-54. Mr. Cergol noted that the institute's spa commercial \"had a more intimate message: stress reduction, relaxation, time together, privacy, that kind of thing.\" **********A man with a love for electronic gadgetry can prepare for that promised relief by commanding his spa from a speeding car to turn on and heat the water to just the right temperature by the time he gets home."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/02/world/president-angrily-contests-charges-over-loans-to-iraq.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Wines", "pub_date": "1992-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 889, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "President Angrily Contests Charges Over Loans to Iraq", "print_headline": "President Angrily Contests Charges Over Loans to Iraq", "body_text": " **********President Bush made a bristling defense of his prewar policy toward Iraq today, saying the White House had no evidence in 1989 that President Saddam Hussein was misusing federally guaranteed bank loans to buy nuclear-arms technology illegally. **********That suspicion, still unproved, had been raised in State Department documents and has since become the focus of investigations by Federal prosecutors and a House committee. **********In sharp comments during an appearance on \"CBS This Morning,\"Mr. Bush appeared to contest Congressional testimony by a State Department official, Frank Lemay, last week.

And for the first time, they injected the President personally into a political dispute that is gaining visibility as an election-year issue. **********Several House and Senate committees are investigating charges that the White House ignored President Hussein's thirst for power and advanced weaponry in the late 1980's in a quest to make Iraq the bulwark of American policy in the Persian Gulf. **********The Administration has conceded that it sought to lure Iraq into \"the family of nations\" with diplomatic and financial incentives and that the policy ultimately failed. **********The loan guarantees at issue were given to Iraq and other developing nations in the 1980's by the Commodity Credit Corporation, an Agriculture Department agency. The agency effectively agrees to co-sign loans, which the nations then promise to use to buy American farm goods. **********From 1983 to 1990, Iraq became one of the program's biggest borrowers and a major customer for American farm goods, obtaining $5.5 billion in loan guarantees to buy wheat, rice, corn, chickens and other products. **********In late 1989, Mr. Baker overrode concerns about the creditworthiness of Iraq and its military programs and, citing national security concerns, asked the Agriculture Department to extend an additional $1 billion in loan guarantees. **********Iraq eventually received $480 million in new guaranteed loans. It defaulted on them and $1.3 billion in previously guaranteed loans when it invaded Kuwait 10 months later. **********Most of the lenders have since been repaid with taxpayer money. **********Today, the State Department refused to say whether Mr. Baker received a warning about Iraq's potential misuse of the loans from Mr. Lemay's boss at the time, Under Secretary of State Richard T. McCormack. Mr. McCormack, now in private business, declined in a telephone interview to discuss his dealings with Mr. Baker. **********However, he added, \"Mr. Lemay's representations to the committee were entirely accurate.\" **********Mr. Bush today called critics of his early overtures to Iraq \"a bunch of people who want to redefine something that was noble and good -- Desert Storm -- and make it bad\" for election-year gain. **********In response, one House Democrat called the White House's courtship of Mr. Hussein an affront to \"basic American values.\" **********The Congressman, Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, whose House Foreign Affairs subcommittee is examining American exports of military technology to Iraq, made public declassified documents today showing that the Pentagon warned seven years ago that Baghdad \"continues to actively pursue an interest in nuclear weapons.\" **********\"The large number of Warsaw Pact nationals in Iraq makes diversion in place a real possibility,\" one of the 1985 documents said, referring to the prospect that military technology sold to Iraq might easily make its way to the old Soviet bloc. \"In the past, Iraq has been somewhat less than honest in regard to the intended end-use of high technology equipment.\" **********Mr. Gejdenson asserted today that \"even if you accept everything the Admininstration did -- which you shouldn't -- the Administration cannot point to a single instance where they told Saddam Hussein that there was a degree of violence and barbarism that would bring down the wrath of the American Government on him.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/13/business/viewpoints-dont-forget-women-at-the-summit.html": {"writer_name": "Heidi Hartmann", "pub_date": "1992-12-13", "snippet": "THE policy makers and business leaders who gather in Little Rock, Ark., tomorrow for the economic summit meeting must consider women as economic players.

Women today are 45 percent of the work force. Policies intended to restore competitiveness and get America moving again that do not take into account women's vital economic roles will not succeed. **********President-elect Bill Clinton surely understands that in making economic policy he must take the view that women matter. He supports many policies of special importance to women, such as the proposed Family and Medical Leave Act, which will require businesses to provide job security for workers who must leave work temporarily to meet family-care and medical needs. Much more must be done, however, to transform the economy from one that assumes \"women's work\" -- the care of the family and the home -- will somehow get done, to one that makes meeting human needs a central source of strength and growth. Only when that happens will women's -- and men's -- full productive potential be released. **********Biases against reorienting the economy around human needs are enormous. To paraphrase Marx, capitalism assumes that workers' survival can safely be left to the workers themselves. He really meant that it can be left to women. **********As Hillary Clinton's remark about tea and cookies revealed, women are rejecting tending to business as usual.

Seventy-four percent of the mothers of school-age children work outside the home for pay. They are rejecting the role of the full-time unpaid volunteer. By their actions, they are saying that society must take more collective responsibility for meeting human and community needs, valuing them enough to pay for them. **********This is the message the leaders at the summit meeting need to hear and translate into policy alternatives, public and private. Some corporations are getting the message, investing in child care and adopting flex-time and leave policies and seeing them pay off. But there are too few such companies, so the public sector must step in. **********A healthy \"social infrastructure\" is key to increasing economic productivity. Quality programs at community health centers, youth facilities, child-care and elder-care centers and schools will help businesses and families. Building and operating people-care facilities in our neediest communities would provide the kind of job creation we need for unemployed women, as well as men. **********Only where the basic needs of families and communities have been met can people be educated and trained for a new, more productive economic future. In the past, women met these needs, enabling men to be more productive in the workplace. That division of labor no longer works. Women seek to contribute in the broader economy. They are arming themselves with education and training and demanding that their skills and talents be used and fairly compensated. Men may still monopolize some of the better jobs, particularly in economic policy making to judge from the array of Mr. Clinton's current advisers, but they do not have a monopoly on brainpower. **********President Clinton will ignore this basic truth at his peril. The women of the baby-boom generation, the ones working outside the home in record numbers, elected Mr. Clinton.

Charles Schreger, the vice president of HBO Enterprises, said he could envision as many as five HBO movies playing subsequently on NBC each year. **********The film the networks have agreed to share is called \"Blindside.\" HBO has produced the movie and has scheduled it for mid-January. Under the agreement, NBC can broadcast the film as early as April. Seeking to Cut Costs **********Each network said the impetus for the alliance was cutting programming costs. \"The motivation is financial,\" Mr. Schreger said, \"the economics work for both of us.\" NBC executives said that the high costs of production were compelling new business partnerships. **********HBO usually pays between $5 million and $7 million to produce an original movie and charges subscribers a special monthly fee. **********HBO sought a broadcast partner for \"Blindside\" as a way to defray some of the production costs. One of the markets it has relied upon for financing the 12 movies it produces each year -- syndication to individual broadcast television stations -- has all but dried up in recent years since the Fox network began supplying programming to stations that formerly purchased a lot of movies.  Pointing to the Stars **********Mr. Schreger said he believed the networks would be interested in a suspense thriller like \"Blindside\" because it had stars more associated with theatrical films than television: Rutger Hauer, Rebecca De Mornay and Ron Silver. **********\"HBO is only in 17 million homes. That leaves another 75 million homes that haven't yet had access to the movie,\" Mr. Schreger said. **********NBC expressed immediate interest in the concept, Mr. Schreger said, because licensing the film from HBO would cost far less than producing a new movie on its own.

One film on Showtime moved to CBS, and a movie made by the Lifetime channel, which is partly owned by ABC, had a second run on that network. **********But both NBC and HBO executives said this deal could be the start of a continuing relationship if \"Blindside\" proved successful. **********\"We have already exchanged further material with them,\" Mr. Schreger said. \"I don't believe we would ever see all 12 movies that HBO makes each year move to NBC.

Ten of the 13 historically fractious cities in the valley are already committed. **********The man behind the fund is David Packard, chairman of the Hewlett-Packard Company, who had tired of the many fund-raising pleas from scores of local arts groups. Shouldn't it be possible, he asked, to create a one-stop giving program that would distribute money more fairly and give these groups more long-term financial stability? **********The idea fell on fertile ground with local arts groups, which, though normally competitive, are suffering in one of the worst recessions in decades. Under the aegis of the area's Community Foundation, a community-service organization that is manager of the fund, 10 nonprofit organizations with revenues greater than $1 million a year -- including the San Jose ballet, opera and symphony and arts groups from other communities -- began to meet. They were joined by the Arts Council of Santa Clara County, which represents smaller arts organizations. **********The idea was just as appealing to the business community. Hewlett-Packard, for example, had never given more than a few thousand dollars or some company computers to local arts groups. For the Silicon Valley Arts Fund, it put up a prompt $250,000. **********\"I think the main reason was the leadership of the campaign,\" said William E. Terry, an H-P executive vice president. (Let it be noted in this context that Mr. Packard, a big charitable giver locally, leaves his company and its officers to their own devices in causes ranging from the arts to politics. For example, an outspoken Bush supporter, he found H-P's chief executive, John A. Young, equally outspoken for the Clinton cause.) **********Mr. Terry went on to explain: \"The approach always used to come from the arts people themselves, or from their trustees, most of whom weren't business people. Groups were always coming around, hat in hand, saying, 'We've got to save the ballet, symphony, etc.' This group was different. They talked our language.\" **********Indeed they did. The structure of the fundreflects its Silicon Valley origins. Fifteen percent of the money will be designated as \"bridge funding,\" to help participating groups pay off existing deficits. Seventy-three percent will go to create the endowment, meant to provide a predictable source of capital for the groups, good times or bad, and to signal to the community that these institutions are truly established -- a crucial factor in their independent fund-raising. The final 12 percent is for a \"venture fund\" to allow the groups to support new activities through interest-free 12-month loans. **********H-P gave so much, Mr. Terry said, for two reasons: a growing recognition that most of the area's cultural organizations were in financial trouble and, again, business. \"I can't quite put my finger on it,\" he said, \"but certainly the valley, as manufacturing is moving out, is becoming increasingly filled with professional people. This group, with its greater discretionary income, tends to put the arts high on its value list.\" So, by supporting cultural institutions, he expects to cultivate employee loyalty. **********Steve Kirsch, vice president and co-founder of Frame Technology, a software company in San Jose, had a different reaction to the pitch. \"Basically,\" he said, \"I got this thing in the mail inviting me to a reception. I went not knowing what to expect. One of the most impressive things for me was a fellow got up from the Knight Foundation.\" It was giving $1.05 million, the largest donation to an arts organization in its history. **********\"As it turns out, this is the largest donation    I've    ever made -- $100,000 over five years,\" Mr. Kirsch said. \"And no way it was a business decision. That was the farthest thing from my mind. I did it because I feel a sense of pride in being able to contribute in some small way.\" **********To be sure, not everything is perfect in this philanthropic paradise. As currently structured, about $2 million will go to the Arts Council of Santa Clara County. Spread out over 350 organizations, these shares don't amount to much. And there has been some grumbling, albeit only on a not-for-attribution basis, among heads of these smaller groups that the Silicon Valley Arts Fund may actually hurt their own fund-raising programs and starve local diversity by skimming off the big donors. **********Stung by this criticism, the fund has gone to great lengths to show solidarity with the Arts Council members and to urge donors to continue helping smaller groups. **********But its case is undermined by comments like this one from Mr. Kirsch: \"This one contribution is going to pretty much blow my arts philanthropy budget for the next few years.\" **********Still, there may be some validity in the fund's argument that building a spirit of philanthropy in what has been a notoriously tight community can only help. Certainly its novel strategy and early success have caught the attention of other communities. **********Barbara Beerstein, consulting director of the fund, says she has had inquiries from groups as far away as Virginia and Delaware and thinks the program will provide a useful model for fast-growing cities that have been in the shadow of more established neighbors.

'It Won't Be Easy' **********Or would it? After listening politely and nodding in seeming agreement, the senior officials of the ministries that keep this country plowing ahead despite perpetual political scandals were widely and anonymously quoted in the nation's biggest newspapers, asking who this Miyazawa fellow thought was running Japan, anyway. **********\"It won't be easy,\" Kazuya Taguchi, the assistant director of the personnel division of the Prime Minister's office and a 1980 graduate of Todai, said with some resignation the other day when a visitor inquired how he would begin to put the new rules into effect. **********\"Can you imagine wanting to be a bureaucrat and going to Waseda?\" he said, referring to one of Japan's most exclusive private universities. \"Unthinkable.\" **********Ever since the Emperor Meiji created Tokyo Imperial University a century ago, the university, particularly its law school, has been the breeding ground of Japan's governmental and business leadership. **********Todai graduates plotted Japan's strategy in autos and computer chips. They set foreign policy and industrial policy, rising in lockstep with their \"class\" on rungs of the government ladder. And despite a lot of talk about how quickly Japan is changing, the Todai tradition seems in little danger. **********Of the 24 new graduates who survived this year's grueling competition for a spot on the \"elite track\" of Japan's Ministry of Finance -- the ministry where Mr. Miyazawa began his career five decades ago -- 22 are Todai graduates. So are 59 percent of those accepted for the fast track at the Education Ministry, the Telecommunications Ministry, the Trade Ministry and other centers of power. **********Last year 14,836 students took the test for the \"elite track,\" and 508 passed, more than half of them Todai graduates. Of those, 310 accepted Government posts; the others, presumably, were lured away by higher salaries in private industry. **********\"The first thing that people know about you when you enter a ministry is whether you went to Todai or not,\" a young official of the Foreign Ministry, who did not, said the other day. He added that \"in a lot of ministries, there are many jobs you can forget about\" if you graduated from someplace else. Symbol of Greater Ills **********For years social critics here have complained about this system, finding it at the root of some of Japan's worst ills. Mr. Kato seemed to echo those complaints at a news conference the other day, saying \"the concentration of University of Tokyo graduates in Government ministries is a symbol of the academic-oriented society that has spawned the 'exam hell' phenomenon,\" the years of preparation for Japan's all-important university exams. Nothing makes a Japanese mother happier than if her child passes the Todai exam or, failing that, marries a Todai graduate. **********So complete is Todai's hold that many are skeptical that Mr. Miyazawa really wants to tinker with success. Some say he is merely grandstanding, hoping to win the hearts of the vast majority of Japanese who resent Todai's monopoly on power. **********\"You have to assume that it is just an effort to win some popularity,\" said Taichi Sakaiya, a former high official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and a member of the Todai class of 1960. Others say that Mr. Miyazawa's intentions are pure, but that he stands about as much chance of changing the way Japan works as Detroit stands of driving Toyota into bankruptcy. **********Indeed, Mr. Miyazawa is attacking not only Todai's hold on power but, curiously, Tokyo's hold as well. Though it is a national university, the vast majority of students attending the University of Tokyo come from the capital or its immediate surroundings. Few come from Japan's outer islands of Hokkaido or Okinawa. No Academic Boasts **********Similarly, young women often report that they view Todai as a hostile place, and not surprisingly, they too are vastly underrepresented in the senior levels of the bureaucracy. No one has suggested, however, that quotas or targets be set for women or others who have traditionally been excluded from the high reaches of the government. **********Curiously, very few people -- even the university's graduates -- argue that vastly superior academic achievement accounts for Todai's standing with the government. In recent years the newspapers have been filled with reports questioning the university's academic standing, and faculty members report an institutional insecurity about whether the place is up to snuff. **********\"There is no proof that Todai students are better than non-Todai students,\" Mr. Sakaiya said. \"And the number of very good professors at Todai is small. But Japan is based on brand-name goods, and Todai is the brand name.\" **********At Todai, the faculty has taken this all in stride. The president of the university, Akito Arima, said that \"of course, monopoly is bad, but I cannot approve government control\" of the quotas. A senior member of the law faculty said the whole thing would be \"sort of ignored, unless it takes any real effect.\" **********Meanwhile, the Todai graduates in government also seem fairly relaxed. Japan changes prime ministers with great regularity and little effect, but its bureaucrats stay behind their battered gray desks forever."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/17/business/your-own-account-shedding-the-fear-of-speaking.html": {"writer_name": "Mary Rowland", "pub_date": "1992-05-17", "snippet": "Communication is an important skill for getting a job or a promotion or selling a business idea.

Amerman, chairman of Mattel Inc., the toy maker based in El Segundo, Calif., and himself a graduate of a communications skills course. **********More and more companies offer this kind of training. The oldest and largest, Communispond Inc. in New York, offers seminars on presentation skills, selling skills and writing skills. A two-day seminar costs $1,150, said Edith Feldmann, a spokeswoman. **********How good are such seminars? Pretty good, judging from a two-day seminar in New York last month offered by Decker Communications Inc., based in San Francisco. This particular course, Effective Communicating ($975), had eight participants and two trainers. Each participant was videotaped nine times and given three one-on-one \"coaching\" sessions. All eight showed considerable progress in two days. **********For example, the participants' first assignment was to give impromptu two-minute talks about themselves. One nervous young man named Chris said, \"I'm just sweating and stammering so much up here that I don't think I can think of anything to say.\" But 24 hours later, he gave a well-thought-out and funny five-minute presentation. **********Those who teach communications seminars often cite the research of Albert Mehrabian, a professor in the psychology department at the University of California in Los Angeles, who did some of the early research on \"body language.\" **********Professor Mehrabian found that when a speaker gives conflicting signals -- the words say one thing but the tone of voice or facial expression says another -- very little of the content of the words got through to the audience and was believed. **********As it happens, though, Professor Mehrabian is not entirely pleased with the way his research has been used over the years. He intended to study \"the subtle ways we communicate, the qualities of the voice, the rate at which we talk as well as the inconsistencies between what we say with our words and express in other ways,\" he said. **********He believes that his work too often has been used by image consultants to create cardboard cutout characters who are drilled in communicating convincingly even though they have no ideas to deliver. \"In our political system, the way candidates are groomed is to look good and say as little as possible,\" Professor Mehrabian said. **********The fact of the matter, though, is that most of us are not polished orators attempting to bamboozle our audience. Many of us are good at what we do, but self-conscious and ineffective when we talk about it to a group of people, and we need training to do better. **********That was the case with Charles Schwab, chairman of Charles Schwab & Company, the San Francisco-based discount broker. He signed up for a Decker course because \"the fear of speaking was right at the highest level of stress for me,\" he said. \"With the video feedback and the understanding I have now, my stress level has gone down 99 percent.\" **********Good training should not make you look artificial and contrived. In fact, Bert Decker, chairman of Decker Communications and author of \"You've Got to Be Believed to Be Heard\" (St. Martin's Press, 1992, $21.95), argues that people are not believable unless they are natural and that listeners either connect with speakers or turn them off based on some instinctive response. **********Mr. Decker and his trainers do not believe that you can be effective if you stand behind a lectern and read a prepared speech in a wooden tone. Instead, they advocate moving around the stage or the room as much as possible, making eye contact with as many people in the audience as you can for several seconds each, pausing to allow listeners to grasp your ideas and using visual aids like charts and graphs to make your point. **********One of the most helpful parts of the seminar is the grid system the trainers suggest for preparing a presentation. You begin with your topic, which you jot down on a Post-it note and place at the top of a sheet of paper. Next you identify the \"cornerstones\" of your speech. First is your point of view. Second, the demographics of your listeners. What do they know about your subject? What is their point of view? Third is the action that you want them to take. Finally, the benefits to them if they take action. **********All the ideas you want to convey about your topic can be jotted on stickers and organized into a grid with three key points in the first row to support your idea and three subpoints under each one. Once you have organized the presentation, you should practice it one to three times, preferably with a video camera. You can take the \"grid\" of your presentation and set it on the lectern to refer to if you get stuck. **********When Mattel's Mr. Amerman has a presentation to make, he prepares an outline in his head as he is driving to work in the morning. Before he took the Decker course, he said, \"I worked so hard at making sure the words were absolutely superb and then read my way through it.\" But, he added: \"It just didn't work. The important thing is to stand up and say what's on your mind in a confident way.\"HOW TO PREPARE ON YOUR OWN **********Even if you cannot go to a communications training class, there are some things you can do to improve your effectiveness as a speaker. **********Prepare your presentation in outline form.

Smith, senior vice president in charge of operations, spoke informally about the earnings charge and layoffs, which he had said two weeks ago were likely. Digital announced then that it had lost $294 million for its third quarter. **********Mr. Smith spoke today after Digital announced a significant technology partnership with the Microsoft Corporation to allow Microsoft's new Windows NT operating system to run on computers using Digital's new Alpha microprocessor. The company's stock gained 25 cents today to close at $45.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Mr. Smith said he expected Digital to cut at least 10,000 to 15,000 more employees in the 1993 fiscal year, which begins July 1. Of the 4,000 being cut this quarter, 3,000 are taking an early retirement plan. He said the cuts would be \"front loaded,\" meaning most would come early in the fiscal year. Mr. Smith said the cuts would go across the entire company but the focus would be on areas that have grown the fastest during the last four years, the sales and support organization. **********Mr. Smith, who has said he does not expect the company will become profitable within the next two quarters, said the huge cuts forecast for 1993 would save the company $500 million. Digital has already taken $1.65 billion in restructuring charges in the last two years. The company still has nearly $700 million in reserve, but Mr. Smith said that would be used up this quarter. **********Digital's president, Kenneth H.

Soon afterward it began infiltrating the French language itself with words like \"le weekend,\" \"le blue-jean\" and \"le sandwich.\" **********The revenge of the tourist was not long in coming. First, many of the French came to realize that if they wanted to be understood by foreigners, speaking French no longer sufficed. Then came the de facto surrender: if they could not beat English, well, they might as well learn it. Significant Shift **********Last month, citing both public demand and the need to compete in a fast-integrating Europe, the French Government decided to give new importance to the teaching of foreign languages in primary and secondary schools. And English is overwhelmingly the language of first choice. **********It is not a great reversal in policy because language teaching is already extensive. But it represents a significant shift in emphasis in a country that still spends heavily on keeping the French language alive in its former colonies and stolidly defends its use in international organizations. **********Under the new plan, French children will start learning a first foreign language at the age of 9 and should be fluent enough to carry on a conversation by the time they are 12. From the age of 13, they will be required to study a second foreign language, in practice usually German or Spanish. **********The main change is that foreign language teaching will start two years earlier than before and that a second foreign language will become obligatory throughout high school. But there is another difference, too. **********\"Until now, language teaching was perhaps too theoretical, too focused on grammar,\" said Claude Lambert, the Education Ministry official who developed the program. \"Now we're going to stress communication skills by hiring 3,500 native speakers to work in the classrooms.\" **********Certainly in the past, here as in so many countries, students would spend several years learning a foreign language, usually English. But they would leave school unable to make themselves understood. And within a few years, their rudimentary knowledge of the language would fade for lack of use. **********Today, though, English is so present in daily life here that young people have both incentive and opportunity to become fluent. They hear it in movies, television programs and popular music. They need it to communicate with, say, Germans and Japanese, and they know that command of the language will help them find a good job. **********In fact, English is so fashionable among French teen-agers that the use of English words and phrases has created a sort of \"Franglais\" slang peppered with the likes of \"cool et clean,\" \"good et fun,\" \"le look destroy\" and, as the French Academy must feel as it tries to defend linguistic purity, \"c'est too much.\" **********So, while their French may be worse, today's French teen-agers already speak far better English, and other languages, than their parents' generation. A recent poll showed that 89 percent of those between the ages of 15 and 19 had some understanding of a foreign language, compared with 42 percent of those 50 or more years old. **********Nonetheless, French youths are lagging behind many of their Western European counterparts, according to a poll carried out by the European Community's Eurobarometer unit that showed that the region's most polyglot teen-agers came from Luxembourg, Denmark and the Netherlands. These finding were not unexpected. People from small countries with languages that are not widely used are obliged to learn those of their larger neighbors. **********Across the community, English is by far the most dominant foreign language, with French usually second. Only in Portugal is French still spoken more than English, but this is a result of the large number of Portuguese immigrants in France. In contrast, German ranks second to English in Denmark and the Netherlands. The popularity of German is also growing quickly in Eastern Europe, although even there English is still the first language to learn. Even the Waiters Cave In **********In announcing France's new plan to start 670,000 9-year-olds in a foreign language, Education Minister Lionel Jospin pointedly avoided mentioning English as the main beneficiary. But by now even Parisian waiters have accepted this reality and can manage a bright \"Good Morning.\" **********Perhaps surprisingly, given Germany's growing political and economic weight in Europe and Bonn's determination to have its language used more widely at international organizations and in meetings, Spanish is preferred here to German as a second foreign language. It is generally considered easier to learn than German. Under the new program, though, senior high school students in France will now also have the option of learning a third foreign language. **********French pragmatism, it seems, has finally won out. Even the prestigious Pasteur Institute has begun publishing its main scientific journal, Annales, in English so French research can become known, and win recognition, abroad. And now the Government is responding to what parents and students want. **********\"It would be just as pointless to oppose the international use of English today as it would have been to oppose the worldwide use of French in the 18th century,\" Maurice Allais, a French economist and Nobel laureate, wrote in Le Monde some time ago. \"We must take the world as it is and not as we would like it to be.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/02/world/israeli-arab-shelling-ends-lull-in-lebanon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 269, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israeli-Arab Shelling Ends Lull in Lebanon", "print_headline": "Israeli-Arab Shelling Ends Lull in Lebanon", "body_text": " **********A fresh outbreak of artillery exchanges in southern Lebanon shattered a weeklong lull today as the pro-Iranian Party of God vowed to step up its armed struggle against Israel. **********But accounts of the fighting differed.

Abortion is not permitted in Ireland unless a mother's life is at stake. **********It was the ban on travel, imposed by the Irish Attorney General's office, that touched off much of the controversy. The ban seemed to run afoul of stipulations by the European Community, of which Ireland is a member, allowing its citizens the right to travel freely within the community. **********The girl, whose identity has not been disclosed, says she was made pregnant in December in a rape by the father of a friend. The girl's family told the Irish police that it planned to obtain an abortion in London, where the procedure is legal. It asked the police if they wanted forensic evidence from the operation to use in their investigation of the case. No charges have been brought. **********But the nation's Attorney General, Harry Whelehan, a vigorous opponent of any sanctioning of abortion, intervened, telling the family that it would be breaking Irish law if the operation was performed. The girl and her parents, who had gone to London in the meantime, returned to Ireland, and an uproar broke out here and abroad about the law, and about the rights of the girl and of the fetus. **********Today's decision freed the girl to leave Ireland to have the abortion, but did not overturn the abortion law, which is supported by Article 8 of the Constitution. A number of questions on the issue remain unanswered, and after the court announces the basis of its decision, the Government may face a decision on whether to try to revise the Constitution. **********The new Prime Minister, Albert Reynolds, expressed delight at the ruling, adding that \"the family is now free.\" Mr. Reynolds, who took office a few weeks ago, had been embarrassed by having the case pushed to the top of his agenda. **********Desmond O'Malley, the head of the Progressive Democrats, whose votes enabled Mr. Reynolds and his party, Fianna Fail, to lead the coalition Government, said: \"I rejoice. I think it's marvelous news. I think it's great news for the whole country.\" **********In the first hours after the decision, the anti-abortion members of Parliament were relatively silent. One said that the purpose of Article 8, which was approved by 69 percent of the voters in a 1983 referendum, had never been to prevent travel, but only to prevent abortion in this country, which is 95 percent Roman Catholic. The Constitution also forbids divorce and strictly limits the distribution of condoms.  Many Risk Breaking the Law **********The laws notwithstanding, an estimated 4,000 women from the Irish Republic traveled to England in Wales in 1991 to obtain abortions. A total of about 180,000 abortions were performed there last year. **********Although the identity of the Irish girl's family has not been made public, details of what happened have come to light through friends and news reports. **********The girl said she was raped in December in a middle-class Dublin suburb. She told her parents on Jan. 27 that she had been raped by the friend's father, and she was confirmed pregnant three days later. On Feb. 5, her family informed the police of their intention to get an abortion in London. **********As soon as the family was informed that it was violating Irish law, it returned to Ireland, where an order forbidding the girl to leave the country for nine months was issued on Feb. 7. The High Court upheld the order on Feb. 17. **********The police say they questioned the suspect, who denied the girl's story. There has been no indication of whether or how the police might further pursue the case. **********The Dublin Government is said to be worried that it might have to call for another divisive national referendum on abortion. This is because in a recent treaty setting the ground rules for a unified European Community, there remains a protocol that appears to permit Ireland to prevent women from traveling abroad for abortions. Loss of European Aid? **********The treaty, signed in the Dutch city of Maastricht in December, is to be voted on in Ireland this year, possibly in June. The Government wants popular approval, partly because the European Community gives hundreds of millions in subsidies to Ireland. If the abortion issue became involved in the debate, the treaty might be defeated by this country. **********The reaction in other European Community countries was sharp. Opponents saw the Irish action as an extension of Irish law and an attempt to prevent a citizen of a European Community country from using a service that is legal in another community country. **********There were proposals to bring the issue before the European Court in Luxembourg, where the publicity could build opposition to the subsidies that Ireland receives as one of the community's poorer countries. **********In announcing the decision today, Chief Justice Thomas Finlay said, \"The court is satisfied that this appeal should be allowed and that the High Court decision should be set aside.\" **********The High Court had ruled that Article 8 forbade the girl to leave the country to get an abortion, as the Attorney General contended in his order. The article says: \"The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees by its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable by its laws, to defend that right.\" Suicide Deemed a Possibility **********Opponents of the prohibition against travel, presumably including the girl's lawyers in court, held that the phrase \"as practicable\" provided justification for her going to Britain. Under Irish law, abortion is permitted only when a mother's life is threatened. News reports said doctors who examined the girl said she was capable of suicide if compelled to have the baby. **********While there seemed to be more public sentiment in favor of letting the girl travel than against it, the country was by no means unanimous. Some callers to talk radio shows, for instance, suggested that she might have seduced the child's father. In any event, it is illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor in Ireland. **********Anti-abortion groups also suggested that the case was set up by pro-abortionists. There were demonstrations outside Parliament, mostly by students who favored letting the girl travel. One protester carried a sign saying, \"If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament.\" **********In the debate, the Catholic Church was virtually inaudible. The powerful Irish Bishops' Conference issued no statements. A spokesman said everyone knew of the church's position on abortion and noted that during the 1983 referendum the bishops had said people were free to vote the dictates of their conscience. **********Because of another editing error, the article misstated the basis for Irish restrictions on the use of condoms. The restrictions are statutory, not constitutional. The article also misidentified the section of the Irish Constitution dealing with abortion.

In comparison with Japan and America's other major trading partners, the United States is less protectionist -- but many barriers to imports remain. **********Quotas double the price of sugar in morning coffee and limit imports per American to no more than seven peanuts, a pound of dairy cheese and a lick of ice cream each year. Fresh cream and milk are banned; frozen cream may be purchased only from New Zealand. And the Customs Service recently turned back a shipment of buttered croissants from France because it violated a quota on French butter shipments. **********Imports of men's heavy and worsted wool suits are capped at 1.2 million, the equivalent of one for each male manager and professional every dozen years. The Commerce Department has imposed punitive duties on martial arts uniforms from Taiwan, awning window cranks from El Salvador and the tiny pads for woodwind instrument keys from Italy after determining that they were being sold, or \"dumped,\" at unfairly low prices. Sprawling and Inconsistent **********This sprawling and inconsistent collection of quotas, tariffs and other barriers reflects lobbying by many industries, as well as the occasional national-security concern. A result has been higher prices for American consumers and fewer opportunities for millions of people in developing countries to escape poverty by growing crops or stitching clothes for people in wealthy countries. **********The Reagan and Bush Administrations have limited imports of steel and computerized factory machines, created customs processing fees for incoming merchandise and tightened controls on imports of sugary foods and natural-fiber clothing. **********\"There is so much hypocrisy and deception shot through our whole trade law system,\" said James P. Bovard, a Washington trade analyst and author who studies United States import barriers. \"The extent of American protectionism is much worse than many people believe.\" **********Administration officials acknowledge that there is little rhyme or reason to the nation's trade barriers, but contend that these barriers pale by comparison with others. \"It's hard to say any country that's enduring a $65 billion to $70 billion trade deficit is a protectionist country,\" said J. Michael Farren, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade.  \"It's absolutely absurd to say that this market is closed or restricted. We have the most open market in the world.\" **********Economists at international organizations tend to think that the United States, while far from pure, at least has a somewhat better record than its major trading partners. According to the World Bank, for example, Japan has high trade barriers covering a quarter of its imports. The United States and the European Community have such barriers only for a sixth of their imports. **********The European Community's record is also worse than these figures might indicate, said Alexander J. Yeats, the principal economist in the World Bank's international trade division. Much of the European Community's imports enter duty free from allies in Africa and Europe, so that the brunt of the community's protectionism falls on the United States, Japan and other developing countries, he said. **********Yet Americans still pay as much as $75 billion a year more for goods thanks to import fees and restrictions -- a sum equal to nearly a sixth of the nation's annual import bill of $490 billion. **********Individually, the costs pile up slowly -- here a couple of extra dollars for a Hong Kong garment, there a few extra pennies for sugar from the Indian Ocean nation of Mauritius. But taken together, the losses to American consumers are significant because of a political system that tends to tax the majority to help the few who are hurting. The Mechanics  Rag-Tag Group Of Trade Laws **********The United States has 3,600 product quotas, mostly for apparel and agriculture, and a few tariffs that run as high as 458 percent, Mr. Bovard said. But most industrial products are subject to only a modest tariff. **********A succession of international trade agreements has made it harder for the United States and its major trading partners to impose quotas or high tariffs on industrial goods. The response, both in the United States and overseas, has been to devise laws and regulations that keep out specific products from a few countries for social policy as well as for economic reasons. **********Federal contract rules setting aside money for minority businesses exclude foreign companies. And environmental groups have won a court decision banning imports of low-priced tuna from several dozen countries because they buy tuna from three countries that kill a lot of dolphins. **********A Federal labeling regulation prevents Italy and Spain from labeling their bubbly wine as champagne because it does not come from the French region of that name, but allows American wineries to do so. **********American law also allows companies, labor unions and the Federal Government to file legal cases against foreign producers charging that they get unfair government subsidies or are dumping goods at unfairly low prices in the United States. As a result of such cases, the United States has imposed special tariffs on pistachio nuts from Iran, residential door locks from Taiwan and frozen french fries from Canada. **********These cases are easy to win and therefore more often filed when the dollar's value is high, as it was in the mid-1980's, or during an economic downturn, as occurred a decade ago. After a low of 29 cases in 1989, the number of trade case filings rose in 1990 and again in 1991 as the economy weakened. **********The rag-tag collection of trade laws is a constant cause for complaint both by free-trade economists, because of the artificially high prices the restrictions produce, and by economists who advocate Government assistance to industry. Economists favoring government intervention say the rules should help high-technology, high-wage industries rather than just any industry with hired legal help and political muscle. The Theory  Efficient Trade And How it Works **********Most of the arguments between the two schools revolve around the often mentioned and seldom explained concept of comparative advantage. **********First detailed by David Ricardo in 1817, the theory of comparative advantage holds that countries should export products that they can produce relatively more efficiently than other countries and import products for which they are relatively high-cost producers. **********Free trade economists typically contend that comparative advantages occur naturally from the available labor, capital and natural resources available in a given country. Interventionist economists contend that the government can choose industries that will thrive and give them subsidies and protection. **********The unresolved question in this debate is whether government-assisted industries take away resources that a free market might otherwise send to new industries. **********Take the case of Judith J. Meadows, a 19-year employee of a small-town blanket mill in North Carolina. She is an example of how people sometimes stay in protected industries instead of moving to more competitive businesses. After years of interest in nursing, she finally enrolled two years ago in part-time nursing courses at a local community college. She wants to become a licensed practical nurse and leave the shrinking textile industry even though it has been protected with trade barriers. **********\"People are just unsure of what's going on,\" Ms. Meadows said, and so are starting to look to other industries for job security. **********Her new field, health care, has relatively few protections; it also does little to help the nation's trade deficit. And the Federal Government offers little retraining and relocation assistance to hundreds of thousands of American workers in industries that, unlike Ms. Meadows's, have not been given decades of protection to adjust to foreign competition. The Pressures  Powerful Lobbies, National Security **********Few industries have been as successful as America's sugar producers in keeping prices two or three times above the world price with Washington's blessing. Sugar currently sells for 8.5 cents a pound internationally. But food processors that use sugar cannot import more than a quarter of the nation's consumption, and must pay 21.5 cents a pound in tariffs and foreign grower fees even for that. **********For decades, the nation's big sugar producers and large users, led by the Coca-Cola Company, used to meet every year at the Sheraton-Carlton Hotel in Washington and strike deals on how much sugar each state would produce, how much sugar would be imported and what the price would be. \"Then they'd go into Congress with their agreement and the bill would pass late one night,\" said Dalton Yancey, the chief Washington lobbyist for Florida and Texas sugar growers. **********Legislative changes abolished that system in 1974. But the sugar growers' lobbying methods today run the gamut of techniques used by trade lawyers from many industries. They have hired a former senior Agriculture Department official specializing in trade issues to lobby for international agreements that will help the American industry. **********They have enlisted the support of the corn sweetener industry, whose product is more expensive than imported sugar but less costly than domestically produced sugar. Six separate sugar-industry groups now lobby Congress, each promoting different regions and cps but all promoting protection from imports. **********Japanese officials have repeatedly cited American protection of the sugar, peanut and dairy industries to justify their ban on rice imports and high tariffs on beef and orange imports. **********American farmers have not been alone in obtaining protection. America's increasing dependence on high-technology imports has raised national security concerns and allowed other industries to seek trade barriers. **********Last December, the Government renewed so-called voluntary restraints on imports of computer-controlled metal-cutting tools from Japan and Taiwan as a way to protect America's machine tool industry. **********In a speech Jan. 24 to counter criticism of the move, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said: \"The machine tool decision was not taken through the Trade Policy Review Group but rather through the national security review, which was chaired by the National Security Council, and defense policy considerations weighed in very heavily.\" **********The Pentagon's concern was that military contractors were losing the ability to set up factories for important weapons without relying on foreign equipment. But restricting equipment imports also forces up the costs of American factories, making other American products less competitive in world markets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/31/business/economists-shifting-priorities.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1992-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1266, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economists Shifting Priorities", "print_headline": "Economists Shifting Priorities", "body_text": " **********Prodded by three years of economic stagnation, a growing number of prominent economists are putting aside their criticism of the budget deficit as the worst of economic evils. Instead, they are advocating a temporary rise in the deficit to generate spending for public works that would put idle people and machinery back to work. **********The latest evidence of the new priority appeared yesterday in an open letter made public in Washington and signed by more than 70 economists, some of whom said they would not have signed it even four months ago. Although a surge in retail sales has raised hopes that a recovery is finally under way, many economists say that without an injection of public spending, the recovery might not endure. **********The letter, addressed to the Administration, Congress and the Federal Reserve, called for the quick outlay of $50 billion a year in Federal aid to state and local governments.  Effort Would Finance Projects **********The money would be borrowed by the Federal Government to expand education and to finance local public works projects that were halted or cut back for lack of local tax revenue. The right projects would pay for themselves, the letter said, \"since the economy has idle resources of labor and capital available to meet additional spending with additional production.\" **********\"I signed that document because the infrastructure side of it, funneling money to education, highways and the like, is a key to generating solid economic growth,\" said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company Economic Advisers. Until recently, Mr. Sinai had focused on the dangers of the budget deficit, which is expected to reach nearly $370 billion in the current fiscal year. Temporary Shift in Priorities **********But the shift in priorities should be temporary, Mr. Sinai and other converts stress. Once the national economy is growing vigorously again, they will go back to criticizing the deficit as an intolerable burden for future generations -- a view still widely held. **********Nevertheless, for a growing group of mainstream economists, the priority has become the use of deficit spending to make the economy rebound after 36 months of nearly zero economic growth or outright recession. **********\"The right question for economists to ask is how to use resources productively, particularly idle resources, and if that leads to an increase in the deficit, so be it,\" said Allen H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon Institute and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization. \"I have said this before, but perhaps not as forcefully as I could have.\" Spectrum of Viewpoints **********This new emphasis on public spending as an economic stimulant, although by no means unanimous, is nevertheless showing up across the spectrum of economic viewpoints. It was evident in interviews with a dozen prominent economists late last week. All acknowledged the trend, although some, like Henry Kaufman, an economic consultant and the former chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said they themselves had not converted from viewing the deficit as the No. 1 enemy. **********Their view is that deficit spending, by putting more money into circulation, increases inflation. Higher inflation, in turn, or just the prospect of it, prompts holders of bonds and Treasury securities to demand higher interest rates. And as higher rates spread through the economy, companies and consumers are discouraged from buying homes, cars and machinery on credit. **********\"There is a tendency lately among economists to disregard the credit markets,\" Mr. Kaufman said. \"They have an important veto in all this.\" Rather than higher deficits, even temporarily, Mr. Kaufman wants to put pressure on the Federal Reserve to reduce rates another notch. Some Favor a Tax Cut **********So do officials in the Administration, which has also proposed tax cuts for the middle class. Similarly, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the leading candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination, favors middle-class tax cuts -- steering clear so far of the deficit-spending issue. **********Another outspoken opponent of rising deficits, Charles L. Schultze, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter Administration, bases his opposition mostly on concern that a temporary rise in deficit spending would become permanent in the hands of the Federal bureaucracy. But Mr. Schultze is beginning to waiver. **********\"I would like to wait a little longer to see if easier money -- the recent decline in interest rates -- will turn the trick,\" he said. \"If it does not produce a satisfactory recovery, then we might have to do something with deficit spending.\" Survey of Forecasters **********Reflecting this concern, 50 economic forecasters surveyed by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators now rate the deficit as of less importance than in 1988, the last year in which the American economy grew at an annual rate of more than 2 percent -- the minimum considered necessary by economists to raise employment. **********The chief sponsors of the letter made public yesterday in Washington were two Nobel laureates in economic science, Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and James Tobin of Yale University, themselves converts last fall. **********\"Most of us think that for the long run, the huge budget deficit and the inability of the country to reduce it are a serious economic problem,\" Mr. Solow said. \"What has changed is that the recession has lasted a long time and the prospect is for a very slow recovery. Economists are prepared to say that there is a chance we will do more long-range damage by letting people sit in the puddle of economic stagnation than we will do if we have higher deficits temporarily.\" Changes of Views **********The letter encouraging this deficit spending was signed by at least half-a-dozen economists who would have declined to sign it three or four months ago, among them Mr. Sinai of the Boston Company; Jay Woodworth, chief economist at the Bankers Trust New York Corporation, and Roger E. Brinner, director of research at DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc., an economic consulting service. **********Previously, they considered deficit spending for public works -- the view that constructing, say, seaport projects pays for itself by expanding the nation's export capacity -- too uncertain an economic stimulant to justify the risk of running up the national debt. And now they are giving ground. **********\"The deficit is still clearly a huge problem -- that has not changed in my mind -- but I am willing to let it slide up a few billion dollars in the short run, in order to make some progress in overall economic growth,\" Mr. Woodworth said.  'Sense of Urgency' **********And Mr. Brinner added: \"I became very worried during the winter that people have lost faith in the economy, and that has increased my sense of urgency to do something. I would have preferred easier money -- lower interest rates -- rather than deficit spending to restore economic growth, but easier money is not forthcoming, so this is second best.\" **********This new willingness to let the deficit grow is not shared by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who argues that a healthy recovery began to show itself last month in the sharp rise in retail sales and that deficit spending is therefore an unnecessary stimulant. **********Indeed, the support for deficit spending would evaporate quickly if a full-blown recovery developed, said Paul Samuelson, another Nobel laureate, who until recently also opposed an increase in deficit spending. \"No one wants to be caught favoring deficit spending when we are already in an expansion,\" he added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/13/world/hong-kong-scuttles-civil-service-bon-voyage.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Basler", "pub_date": "1992-09-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 697, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hong Kong Scuttles Civil Service Bon Voyage", "print_headline": "Hong Kong Scuttles Civil Service Bon Voyage", "body_text": " **********Every year, newspapers here carry front-page pictures of retiring civil servants waving farewell to the colony from the gleaming white decks of a luxury ocean liner, pictures that enrage most Hong Kong residents. **********Taxpayers here find the pictures wildly provocative because the smiling retirees are enjoying the ultimate perquisite of colonial service in Hong Kong, an all-expense-paid sea passage back to Britain. **********The voyage takes more than a month as the liner visits Thailand, Singapore, the Seychelles, South Africa, Senegal and the Canary Islands, finally docking in Southampton, England. The cost is about $8,650 a person. And most civil servants are accompanied by their spouses and a few by their children too -- all at Government expense. **********This week, however, the Hong Kong Government announced plans to replace the benefit with a flat payment of $1,540 to each of the 1,500 Government workers recruited overseas who are still eligible for the sea voyage home. **********\"We felt the sea passage was a bit archaic and too expensive to justify,\" said David Weeks, principal assistant secretary for the Civil Service Branch. He pointed out that the retirees would be given the flat payment in addition to air fare home. **********Civil servants are angry over the change. Some say they will go to court to preserve their ocean voyage. **********\"I've earned that trip,\" said a senior police official eligible for the cruise, who asked that his name not be used. \"I know I will go to court, and I know many others who will too.\" **********Another senior civil servant said: \"The Hong Kong Government is rich. It can afford to live up to its obligations, and this one was spelled out as part of the terms and conditions of our employment.\" **********Mr. Weeks said the terms were listed in the general conditions of employment set down in Civil Service regulations, and those regulations could be changed. **********\"We are talking about doing away with an outmoded condition of service,\" he said. \"After all, this sea passage is not just transportation home, it's a luxury cruise, a holiday, and that can't be justified as a public expense.\" **********While sea passage home sounds like a quaint holdover from the days when steamships carried colonial officers to and from this distant port, it is a relatively modern benefit. Mr. Weeks said that as air travel came of age, there was virtually no commercial passenger traffic by sea here until luxury liners began to revive it. **********In 1971, a Hong Kong Civil Service advisory committee recommended that the Government make sea passage home a benefit for retiring civil servants, provided they were more than 50 years old when they retired and had served at least 15 years here. **********Neither the Government nor the associations representing Government workers from abroad know exactly why this benefit was conferred. **********\"I assume it was simply another benefit added to enable Hong Kong to attract and keep the best people,\" Mr. Weeks said. **********The only luxury liner making the trip from Hong Kong to Britain is the Canberra of the P & O Lines. It stops in Hong Kong for passengers only once a year, in the spring, and on her last cruise about 40 of her passengers were traveling at Government expense. **********In 1984, the Hong Kong Government announced that the cruise trips would no longer be offered to new workers from abroad joining the Civil Service here. **********Now, said Allan Roger, chairman of the Association of Expatriate Civil Servants, \"they are trying to take this benefit away from those who joined before the cutoff.\" **********When Britain agreed to return Hong Kong to China in 1997, it stipulated that Beijing must honor the pensions and benefits of current civil servants who would be retiring after the handover. **********But as one political columnist here said, \"it strains credulity\" to believe the hard-line Communists in China will continue to pay for luxury ocean cruises for retiring civil servants.

The Administration has repeatedly threatened to veto the legislation, and the 59-to-39 vote today fell 8 votes short of the two-thirds majority that would be needed to override a veto if all senators voted.

Usually the I.B.M. shareholder letters are the dullest boilerplate imaginable.\" **********Advertising campaigns that address corporate problems or try \"spin control\" in the wake of news reports that corporate executives perceive as negative have become increasingly common in the last decade, taking their place as a marketing strategy alongside ads that burnish a company's image or sell its products. **********A prominent recent example were the advertisements by Sears, Roebuck & Company after state consumer affairs officials in California and New Jersey charged that the retailer's auto-repair centers had defrauded customers. **********I.B.M.'s advertisements appear to reflect the sensitivity of the company's top managers to reports suggesting that the company's vaunted technology storehouse has lost some of its effectiveness. **********\"To be more competitive, we have had to close facilities and reduce staff throughout the company,\" the ad states. \"These actions will in no way, however, affect the core research and development our customers have told us is important.\" Sharp Rebuttals **********Questions about I.B.M.'s role as a technology leader have drawn sharp rebuttals from the company's top executives. The day after the Dec. 15 announcement, for example, I.B.M.'s president, Jack D. Kuehler, invited a Wall Street Journal reporter to Armonk to state that the media had overreacted to the company's announcements of cuts in its development spending for 1993. Mr. Kuehler blamed I.B.M. morale problems on negative press reports. **********\"I can understand his frustration,\" said Regis McKenna, a Silicon Valley marketing consultant, and the author of \"Who's Afraid of Big Blue,\" a 1989 book that analyzed the computer maker's woes. \"But it takes 5 or 10 miles to turn an aircraft carrier, and we live in an age of speedboats.\" **********Mr. McKenna said the company was wrong to blame the media for its woes. \"The media doesn't create the market; it reflects it,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/10/business/swinging-the-gm-ax-which-plants-are-next.html": {"writer_name": "Adam Bryant", "pub_date": "1992-11-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 672, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Swinging the G.M. Ax: Which Plants Are Next?", "print_headline": "Swinging the G.M. Ax: Which Plants Are Next?", "body_text": " **********For John F. (Jack) Smith Jr., the new chief executive of the General Motors Corporation, the hard part is just beginning. By the end of the year, G.M. has said it will name four more assembly plants to be closed as part of its strategy to cut its excess capacity. **********The four plants will be in addition to the G.M. mini-van plant in North Tarrytown, N.Y., and Willow Run in Ypsilanti, Mich., where full-size rear-wheel-drive cars are built. These plants were named earlier in the year when G.M. announced 12 of 21 assembly and parts-making factories it planned to close. These were on top of earlier G.M. closing announcements affecting factories like those in Scarborough, Ontario, and the West plant in Pontiac, Mich. **********Predicting the new plants likely to be closed has grown increasingly difficult, industry experts said, as the company has shifted production of models in a way that eliminates some options. \"One must question how serious G.M. is about closing facilities,\" said Clifford J. Swenson, manager of production forecasting for Jacobs Automotive, a consulting firm in Little Falls, N.J. \"They have not been overly aggressive.\" Three at Great Risk **********G.M. officials and the United Automobile Workers union declined to comment, but Mr. Swenson pinpointed three plants with the greatest risk of being closed: one of the two plants in Oshawa, Ontario, that build mid-size cars like the Chevrolet Lumina; one of three plants that build full-size pickup trucks in Oshawa, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Pontiac (at the East plant), and a Detroit plant that builds truck and motor-home chassis. **********Beyond those three, however, a surprise seems in store, perhaps on the order of the stunning news in February when G.M. abruptly announced it would close its only plant that makes mini-vans and instead build a new version at a plant in Doraville, Ga.  The big surprise may be that G.M. will have to drop well-known models. **********It labored over consolidating its rear-wheel-drive car production in Arlington, Tex., or Ypsilanti before Arlington won out, but some experts question whether G.M. should continue to build the large sedans at all. **********Maryann N. Keller, an analyst at Furman Selz in New York, said the large Chevrolet Caprice and Buick Roadmaster models were not making money for G.M. because many were sold to fleets with little or no profit. **********To complicate things, G.M. seems to have eliminated some alternatives.  G.M. once had the option of consolidating production of large, front-drive cars from three plants to two. **********The ones to stay open under that move, Mr. Swenson had predicted, would be Flint, Mich., and Wentzville, Mo., while the plant in Orion Township, Mich., would be closed. But G.M. has said it will shift Oldsmobile 88 production to Orion, which will also build updated models of the Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Toronado. **********Also, its Linden, N.J., and Moraine, Ohio, assembly plants looked like candidates for the padlock but G.M. has signaled that it will reopen the Linden plant to produce a new small pickup truck. Moraine has been promised a new paint system, a hint that it may stay in business. **********The willingness of the U.A.W. to be more flexible may also be an important factor as G.M. considers which plants to close. **********A nine-day strike in late August by workers at a G.M. parts plant in Lordstown, Ohio, led to costly shutdowns of nine assembly plants, including the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn. **********Strikes can wipe out any savings that the company may be able to wring from suppliers as part of its mission to cut costs. **********In another possible move, Corvette production might be shifted from a low-volume plant in Bowling Green, Ky. One option might be to move the Corvette to Ste. Therese, Quebec, where G.M. makes other sports cars. But making the Corvette, an American icon, outside the United States is difficult to picture. \"But then again,\" Mr. Swenson said, \"a new day may be dawning at G.M.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/22/business/uncovered-short-sales-rise-by-7.6-on-big-board.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1992-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1607, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Uncovered Short Sales Rise by 7.6% on Big Board", "print_headline": "Uncovered Short Sales Rise by 7.6% on Big Board", "body_text": " **********The number of shares sold short and not covered between mid-June and mid-July on the New York Stock Exchange rose for the fourth straight month, reaching an all-time high, the Big Board reported yesterday. **********The short positions, which reflect the growing sense of pessimism about the condition of the market among investors, ended the period at 882.6 million shares. That was up 7.6 percent from the 820.3 million shares reported in the previous period and meant that short interest has climbed 27.7 percent since mid-March, when the figures began their recent growth. **********On the American Stock Exchange, where monthly figures are often restated, the results fell far short of the record set in November 1990 of 83.5 million. For the monthly period ended in mid-July, the Amex reported short interest of 69.6 million shares, up 5.8 percent from the 65.8 million shares reported in mid-June. **********To be included in the figures for the most recent period, trades that took place by July 8 and were settled by July 15 were counted by the Big Board and the Amex. **********Traders and analysts said the jump in the results reflected a growing bearishness that extended beyond the professional short-sellers, who borrow and sell the shares of a company they think is poised for a decline and then buy back the shares at a lower price. **********These experts said the continuing trend of increased short selling by hedge-fund managers, who buy securities or sell them short based on their market view, also had a large impact on the monthly results. **********But some analysts expressed some worries that the number of short sales was becoming too high. **********\"There is an awful lot of negative sentiment out there, and that tends to make us nervous\" about having substantial short positions, said Steve Kibbey, a vice president at Centurion Trust. \"When the sentiment is too negative, markets tend to surprise in the other direction.\" **********Among the notable short positions in the last month was Delta Air Lines. Almost 3.5 million shares were sold short, up more than 50 percent from the 2.3 million shorted in the previous period. Shares in the carrier dropped sharply in the period, after it agreed to settle charges of price fixing with three other airlines. **********Although the company's stock price has since recovered, some traders believe it may report significant losses not only because of the settlement but also from the costs of its fledgling European operations. **********The short interest in a number of large financial institutions was cut significantly, making that group one of the sectors with the largest decreases in short sales. Among the companies that saw their short interest drop were the Fleet Financial Group, Citicorp, Comerica Inc., the Shawmut National Corporation, Nationsbank and the American Express Company.

I don't think he takes his marching orders from the U.S. Government.\" **********And in Tampa, Fla., Maj. Marc Martens, a spokesman for the United States Central Command, which is operating the American airlift, said today that the command had not heard any complaints about the operation. **********But Red Cross officials express frustration over the logistical problems, saying plans for the American airlift were made with little practical consideration of the complex and dangerous nature of war and famine in Somalia. **********A widespread fear has been that the dumping of large quantities of food without proper protection could provoke more fighting, over the food itself. The Red Cross officials express irritation that outside parties seem eager to send food to Somalia without providing help for the more difficult task of shipping it to places that need it. **********They assert that little thought was given by American officials over how the food, to be unloaded amid the violence of Somalia's clan-based civil war, would reach the needy. Red Cross Asks Help **********Red Cross officials, saying they have been overstretched in Somalia, have repeatedly called on other organizations, like the United Nations, to arrange security for the American-delivered food. Indeed, American relief officials in Nairobi said today that meetings were being held with the United Nations to try to arrange for the distribution of food once it lands in Somalia. But they said it would take a week or 10 days to work out the details. **********One American official said that so far the United Nations had little logistical capacity in Somalia. **********A Red Cross spokesman in Geneva, Tony Burgenur, said: \"We alerted the world community to this eight months ago. From our point of view it's a little bit hypocritical to put it all on the Red Cross to arrange. It's now up to the United Nations and other international organizations to get their hands dirty inside Somalia.\" **********Mr. Burgenur was especially critical of what he said had been delays in bringing about American involvement. Dangerous, U.N. Says **********\"They've had eight months to do it, and they haven't done it,\" he said. \"To do it in a hurry is dangerous from a security point of view. If you drop these things in Somalia, you know in whose hands they get.\" **********He was referring to the armed gangs that often hijack the relief food coming into ports and airstrips and carried along interior roads by truck convoys. **********American officials themselves appear to have underestimated the difficulties involved. On Wednesday, Brig. Gen. Frank Libutti, director of the American airlift, flew in civilian clothes on a Red Cross plane into the Somali bush town of Baidoa, where more than 10,000 people have died of hunger. He was accompanied by the United States Ambassador to Kenya, Smith Hempstone Jr. Afterward, General Libutti said he had concluded that it was safe for his aircraft to land and unload, American officials reported. **********But today his spokesman, Lieut. Col. Robert Donnelly, said the airlift to Baidoa had to await arrangements by relief organizations for the safe transfer of the food from the airstrip to Somalis. **********\"We are not here to dump food,\" Colonel Donnelly said, referring to fears that the food would simply sit and rot or be stolen at the airstrip. **********Relief officials also said it was not clear whether there would be enough food in the Kenyan port of Mombasa, the base of the airlift, to keep the 11 aircraft and more than 200 American troops operating continuously. Planes Require Emblems **********The Red Cross, which has provided the bulk of the food and logistical expertise during the eight-month-old Somali crisis, said today that it was against its rules for Red Cross food to be carried on planes flown by military personnel or on planes that did not carry the Red Cross emblem. The rule had prevented the American planes from carrying Red Cross food. **********The White House made its abrupt announcement about the airlift on Aug. 14. A statement said that the Pentagon would mount an airlift and that 145,000 tons of American-provided food would be sent to Somalia. But much of the 145,000 tons will not be en route to Kenya for delivery to Somalia until next month, American officials said. Until the announcement, the civil war and the ensuing famine were described by American officials here as secondary issues in Washington.  Plane Lands in Kenya's North **********The airlift, which is also supposed to serve Somali refugees and Kenyan drought victims in northern Kenya, ran into another dispute today when the Kenyan Government asserted that it had not been consulted on the plan to base the aircraft here. American Embassy officials denied Kenya's assertion. The dispute delayed the start of what was supposed to be the easiest and least urgent part of the airlift until after a meeting between the Kenyan President, Daniel arap Moi, and Ambassador Hempstone. **********But after an 80-minute flight from Mombasa on Kenya's coast, the first American C-130 with food arrived in the northern town of Wajir today, carrying 10 tons for Kenyans and Somali refugees, The Associated Press said.. **********The dispute with the Kenyans also resulted from what was seen by American officials here as a rush by the White House to begin the airlift without nailing down the logistics. While the Kenyan Government had been informed and permission had been granted for the American planes to land in Mombasa, there had not been time to touch all the bases in the Kenyan Government adequately, one official said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/29/business/your-money-an-alternative-to-chasing-yields.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-02-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 885, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Your Money; An Alternative To Chasing Yields", "print_headline": "Your Money; An Alternative To Chasing Yields", "body_text": " **********BECAUSE of the plunge in interest rates in the last year, many Americans are searching for investments with higher yields than the 4 or 5 percent that now typifies certificates of deposit, money market funds and similar conservative holdings. But in doing so, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants says, many are overlooking a more useful financial strategy: pay down consumer debt. **********\"Lower interest rates should compel most consumers to pay off consumer debt that is accumulating at double-digit rates, as opposed to collecting 5 percent on savings,\" said Howard Safer, managing partner of Kraft Brothers, Esstman, Patton & Harrel of Nashville, who has earned the institute's accreditation as a personal financial specialist. **********Mr. Safer said that he and other institute members had discovered that this obvious thought did not occur to many people. \"Debt has gotten so ingrained that people do not put it into perspective,\" he said. \"They need to do an overall statement of financial condition\" before deciding how to reinvest a C.D. or whether to move money out of a money market fund. \"Many things that were customary and ordinary in the 80's need to be turned around in the 90's,\" he added. **********Mr. Safer said he first noticed this narrow focus on redeploying savings without regard for outstanding debt when he conducted a workshop on personal financial planning recently. A young couple were concerned about renewing a $5,000 C.D., he recalled. When he asked if they owed any money, it turned out they were making minimum monthly payments on credit card debts, incurring 19 percent interest charges, and had a home-equity loan outstanding. **********He pointed out that paying off the credit card debt and avoiding that interest cost was likely to be far more beneficial than any low-risk savings. \"It was like a light went on,\" he said, \"and it is not only the middle class.\" **********A client of Mr. Safer's who earned $400,000 a year had $100,000 in a tax-exempt money market fund yielding less than 3 percent, \"because he doesn't have the risk tolerance for longer bonds or stocks.\" But he also had a large home mortgage. \"He had become acclimated to the idea that a mortgage is good because the interest is tax deductible,\" Mr. Safer said. **********Yet, even a low 8 percent mortgage costs a taxpayer in the 31 percent Federal bracket 5.5 percent after taxes, almost twice what the client was getting on his savings. Given his aversion for risk, it made sense to pay down the mortgage. **********Of course, Mr. Safer added, \"if you think equities will do double-digits as they have in the past, and you have an 8 or 9 percent mortgage, mathematically you come out ahead\" to be in the stock market. **********The advice to pay down debt before shifting their savings is for people who are constitutionally unable to take risks, fearing stocks can lose ground just as easily as they can gain it. Charitable Trusts **********For upper-income families, estate taxes, which go up to 55 percent, can be more onerous than income taxes. Consequently, people who plan their estates carefully -- facing the unpleasant subject of mortality -- can come out ahead financially, as well as emotionally, by cutting taxes. **********Ilene T. Nadel, president of Creative Philanthropic Resources Ltd., told of a woman who recently set up a charitable lead trust that gives more to charities and to her son and less to the tax collectors. She was advised by Ms. Nadel and Norman D. Altman, the firm's vice president and a partner in the law firm of Drew & Altman, which has offices in Westport, Conn., and New York. **********The donor, a widow, put $1 million worth of securities into the charitable lead trust. Each year, for 10 years, the income from the trust will belong to charity, Ms. Nadel said. The donor serves as trustee and has reinvested the money at a guaranteed 5.8 percent. **********The donor is an alumna of Hunter College, and Hunter will get $25,000 a year for a chair in her name, and $8,000 a year to invest for the chair in the future. Other charities will get $25,000 a year for 10 years. When the trust ends, the $1 million principal will pass to her son, who will owe no tax on it, Ms. Nadel said. **********The tax aspects of trusts are complicated, and must be calculated for each trust. In broad terms, here is how the savings work: Under Federal tax law, a person may give or bequeath $600,000 without tax liability. Any combination of gifts and bequests above that amount is subject to tax. **********Because this trust is to end in 10 years, the $1 million is discounted for inflation. In tax jargon, it has a \"present value\" of $600,976.64, which makes it subject to Federal gift taxes of $361.36, and to New York State gift taxes of $25,558.56. **********Since the trust has used up the woman's limit of $600,000, any assets still in her estate will be subject to estate tax. But she has the security today of knowing that she has provided for both her son and the charities she wants to benefit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/15/world/tribe-s-village-in-india-is-supported-by-a-bordello.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1992-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1024, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tribe's Village in India Is Supported by a Bordello", "print_headline": "Tribe's Village in India Is Supported by a Bordello", "body_text": " **********In this tiniest of villages, the grandest building here, an edifice of real brick and cement, painted brilliantly white, its ornate lintel bannered \"Welcome 1992,\" is a bordello. **********It is here that the women, and girls, of Kuku Ka Bas work, at least some of them, encouraged by the village men and defended by its elders. It is also here, and in villages like this, that the fate of the Nats, one of India's hundreds of indigenous tribes, is being played out. **********\"We were raj Nats,\" explained Mittu Ram, a village elder, as he slouched on the woven rope mat of his charpoy, India's traditional roughly hewn bed. \"Our females used to entertain the males of princes and kings. During the earlier period, one girl in every family was kept in reserve to entertain princes by dancing. The other females would get married.\" **********\"Now that era is gone,\" he went on. \"The small kingdoms gave five villages to the Nats, but wherever we had land it was taken away because we were illiterate. So we have come to the point where we have had to offer our girls in prostitution.\" Most of Village's Income **********As with much of what is spoken here, it is sometimes difficult to separate folklore from a distant and obscure history. What is certain, though, is that a handful of women here earn most of the village's income, and they do it through prostitution. **********\"We only have 10 families here,\" Mr. Ram said, \"about 125 people altogether. Of these, about six girls are engaged in prostitution here. We try to send girls to Bombay or Calcutta to be prostitutes. There, the money is more. We have a little income from agriculture, some milk cattle, and we have this prostitution.\" **********The village men, who lounged about on cots under thatched porticoes on a recent warm afternoon, prod their daughters and wives to work as prostitutes, for the steady, albeit small, income. **********\"I have one daughter,\" Mr. Ram said. \"She is 22. She is in Bombay, working as a prostitute. She sends money, at times 10,000 rupees, at times 20,000 rupees. It's okay.\" That is as much as $740. **********But in fact, along Falkland Road in Bombay, a seemy stretch of dirt-encrusted tenements where the city's prostitutes ply their trade, sex is cheap, with 25 rupees a time a generous fee. Untouchables in Hinduism **********Little has been written of India's tribes. The last census identified more than 1,500 languages spoken in India, many of them by only a few thousand people, and most by India's 60 million tribal peoples. Because tribal people are relegated to the status of untouchables under Hinduism's hierarchies of caste, many tribes have been fertile grounds for Christian and Muslim proselytizing. In theory conversion ejects an individual from the caste system altogether. **********Still, across India, tribal peoples are among the poorest, the least educated and the most discriminated against. And because they are scattered throughout the country, except for those concentrated in the remote northeast, they have increasingly been swamped by the dominant Indian culture, gradually losing both their languages and culture. **********A young woman in a royal blue salwar kameez, a loose-fitting tunic and pants spackled with gold paisley, entered the bordello and spoke of her work to a visitor. Her dark eyes, made deeper by shadows of mascara, betrayed none of the modesty common to most village women when the talk turns to men and sex. **********\"I'm Seema,\" she said, a flat directness tamping down her village Hindi. \"I'm 21, 22. I began as prostitute, four, five years back.\" Time's Passage Is Hazy **********For many villagers in India, time's passage is not clearly marked or strictly noted. Seema's uncertainty about her age, and that of her son -- \"he's three, four years\" -- reflects mostly the lack of sharp junctures in the rural life of a tribal people not bound closely to the annual agricultural cycles. And like the women in Kuku Ka Bas, Seema used only one name. **********\"The first time it happened here, he was a seth,\" she said, referring to a businessman. \"Since then, I've remained here throughout. I'm more than willing to go to Bombay. I'll get more money in Bombay. I'll get decent customers in Bombay. Here, I get one or two customers every day.\" **********Seema bounced her right wrist on her crossed legs, a clutter of glass and gold-plated bracelets jangling quietly in the hollowness of the bordello. It is a plain cement room painted a pale blue-white, with a few movie posters taped to its walls, a vase of plastic flowers on a shelf. **********\"People come here from different places,\" she said. And then, in a statement filled more with fancy than truth, she volunteered, \"I make 500, 1,000 rupees each time.\" That would be up to $37. **********Harsher is the reality along this road traveled mostly by truckers, minor bureaucrats and more often than not, farmers ticking the haunch of the camel pulling a rubber-wheeled farm cart. As she spoke, her fellow prostitutes were trying to seduce a visitor's driver; the opening offer from the prostitutes was 35 rupees, about $1.29, and quickly dropped to 20 rupees. 'Never Heard of AIDS' **********Seema peeked from the bordello, obviously impatient to enter the bargaining fray. \"No,\" she said when asked, \"I've never heard of AIDS.\" And no too, she had never been to a doctor. **********\"Some customers use condoms,\" she said. \"I don't have any objection if they use it or they don't use it.\" **********\"I'm happy doing this,\" she declared. \"I would let my daughter do this if we didn't have any other means to earn a living. It's a good way of life.\" **********Seema abruptly stopped talking and then dashed from the room, scurrying over to the ongoing bargaining with the potential customer. But by then, he had chosen another village woman.

(Jack) Smith Jr., will come today to New York for its first meeting with financial analysts. The analysts are looking forward to the session not so much for important disclosures by the company but rather for the new leaders' willingness to be specific. **********For the last five years, a succession of top G.M. executives, starting with Roger B. Smith, has promised detailed plans to coax healthy financial results out of the nation's largest auto maker. G.M.'s dismal record during much of that period was again recalled on Tuesday when it announced its eighth trip to the equity market in 18 months to raise $1 billion in a new preference stock. **********To lower expectations that today's meeting might produce something spectacular, G.M. said its new top executives would not be announcing any new plant closings, staff cuts or product changes. G.M. closed yesterday at $30.125, down 50 cents, on a volume of almost two million shares. The stock was above $50 as recently as June 1990. **********The meeting's official agenda, the company said, is \"to inform securities analysts of G.M.'s efforts to improve competitiveness and return to profitability.\" That may mean a precise and detailed explanation of what Mr. Smith and his compatriots have accomplished since reorganizing North American operations in April. **********But years of rosy predictions have inured many analysts to disappointment. \"I remember the soiree in Newark in 1987\" for analysts, Maryann Keller, automotive analyst for Furman Selz Inc. in New York, said. G.M. executives announced an \"action plan\" to cut costs that many analysts believed would add $5 a share to yearly earnings. \"The plan turned out to be a fiction,\" she said. **********\"Many promises just haven't been fulfilled,\" Stephen Girsky, automotive analyst of Paine Webber in New York, said. \"I want to know if there are more write-offs coming, but I also want to know how much G.M. stock these guys own and are they going to be compensated in stock.\" **********If investors and analysts are tired of hearing about how G.M. plans to reorganize, they may be forgiven. Kim Cameron, professor of organizational behavior at the University of Michigan Business School, said: \"G.M. has restructured 17 times, including the latest one, since World War II. I hope it is different this time, but the jury is out.\" **********G.M. stock has not grown much since the 1950's, but at least the company paid a healthy dividend until the last year, when it has been cut twice. **********In the view of Ms. Keller, who has written a book on G.M.'s troubles, \"this management has to be candid about the nature of the problems and create some level of confidence that they have a strategy of dealing with them.\" She wants to hear, among other specifics, what marketing strategy G.M. will employ to neutralize the effect that negative news about the corporation is having on vehicle sales. **********Those security analysts who have met Jack Smith tend to like his plain-spokenness and are hopeful that the turnaround in G.M's European operations that happened on his watch will be repeated in the United States. Indeed, many are recommending G.M. stock on the theory that things cannot get any worse than they have been. **********\"We'd like to know whether assets are for sale, and what exactly is the strategy -- to increase market share profitably or just to make money,\" Wendy Needham, automotive analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham in New York, said. She rates G.M. a buy because \"all the bad news is in the stock.\" **********Jack Kirnan, automotive analyst for Salomon Brothers in New York, upgraded his \"hold\" rating on G.M. to a \"buy\" in late October. He applauded the dividend cut that was made on Nov. 2, reasoning that it would help the company win concessions from the United Automobile Workers union in next year's negotiations. **********Mr. Kirnan noted that despite everything that had gone wrong at G.M., gross profit margins -- revenue minus cost of goods sold -- has been a lot stronger this year. When volume comes back and if G.M. gets rid of excess capacity, he predicted, shares could rise to $53. **********G.M. executives will begin their presentation at the Plaza Hotel at 9:30 A.M. By the lunch break, Ms. Needham said, \"analysts should be getting on the phone. **********\"If there are specific answers to our questions, great,\" she said. \"If no one seems to know how much Inaki Lopez is saving with suppliers or what the product strategy is, then I think you'll see the stock go straight down.\" Mr. Lopez is G.M.'s new vice president of purchasing.

Yeltsin returned here today from a successful week in the West and promptly issued a warning about growing Russian impatience with fierce ethnic fighting along the southern rim of the former Soviet empire. **********Ethnic Russians and Russian troops are involved in increasingly serious fighting in Moldova, a small former Soviet republic on the border with Romania, with Moldovan forces reportedly destroying 11 tanks of the former Soviet Army since Friday. Clashes involving Russians also have intensified in the South Ossetia region of Georgia, in the Caucasus region. **********Such wars form one of the most serious challenges to the nations of the former Soviet Union. **********Mr. Yeltsin, already under attack from Russian conservatives and self-styled nationalists for his economic policies and his turn toward the West, cannot afford to allow Russian lives to remain at risk outside Russia's current borders. Nor can he allow conservatives to get ahead of him on an issue as emotive as this one. **********\"We want to settle all matters at the negotiating table,\" Mr. Yeltsin said on arrival today at Vnukovo Airport in Moscow, speaking about the fighting on the territory of Moldova, a fellow member of the Commonwealth of Independent States. \"But when dozens of people are killed and when there is a war going on, we cannot remain idle, especially when it is happening on our borders.\" A Warning to Moldova **********Mr. Yeltsin, directly warning the Moldovan Government, said: \"In this case, we must react to defend people and stop the bloodshed. We have the strength to do that.\" **********The Itar-Tass news agency quoted Moldova's President, Mircea Snegur, as accusing Moscow of imperialist intentions. He also said any intervention by Russia's 14th Army, stationed in Moldova, would mark the start of all-out war in the republic of four million or so people. **********\"The question arises, Aren't the Russian authorities provoking these conflicts in order to preserve their control over the newly independent states?\" the agency quoted Mr. Snegur as saying. \"It is time to tell the truth: Russia is supporting authoritarian, neo-Communist circles.\" **********The Interfax news agency said Mr. Snegur sent Mr. Yeltsin a telegram urging him to show restraint and not to intervene in Moldova's internal affairs. **********On Saturday, the Russian Government issued a strong statement appealing for calm in both Moldova and South Ossetia and called for a cease-fire. On Saturday evening, Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, a former colonel and a loud defender of the rights of Russians outside Russia, said, \"Everyone must keep in mind that Russia will not tolerate such treatment of Russian-speaking people any longer.\" **********The Defense Minister, Gen.

Once representatives of an imperial Moscow, they are now the frightened remnants of a collapsed empire and fear revived nationalisms long suppressed by Soviet force. Villages Reported Shelled **********In South Ossetia, the Russian majority is seeking to secede from Georgia and join North Ossetia, already part of the Russian Federation. Russians were showing up as refugees in North Ossetia as Georgian troops today told residents of the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali, to leave their homes. Russian news agencies said fighting was going on around the city and that nearby villages were being shelled by Georgian artillery. **********Late last week the Georgian leader, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, accused Russian troops of openly supporting the secessionists with helicopter fire, while Russia said the gunships were warning Georgian tanks to stop shelling Tskhinvali. Today, Mr. Shevardnadze called for international observers and United Nations mediation. **********In Moldova, Russians and Ukrainians on the industrial eastern bank of the Dniester River have formed a secessionist republic in a swath of land on the edge of the Moldovan republic and are fighting against the Moldovan majority. **********Fighting has been intense in the city of Bendery, in the breakaway Trans-Dniester enclave, where Moldovan forces destroyed the 11 tanks. A Dniester spokesman said 200 people were killed and 300 wounded over the weekend before separatist troops regained control of most of the town today. But that would equal the number killed since March, and the Interfax news agency quoted the Russian military as saying that 61 had died and 160 were wounded. **********The Itar-Tass news agency reported that a regiment of Russia's 14th Army based in the Trans-Dniester region was attacked by Moldovans on Saturday night. The commander of the 14th Army said he was trying to stay out of the fighting, but would act, as authorized, to defend his troops. Russian Troops Accused **********The Moldovans have accused Russian troops of intervening on the side of the secessionists, who fear Moldova's ties to Romania and want to join Ukraine. Bessarabia, which makes up most of Moldova, changed hands after 1812 back and forth between the Russians and the Ottomans. Then it came under Romanian rule, where it stayed until the Soviet Union annexed it in June 1940 under terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact with Nazi Germany.  More Russians and Ukrainians were implanted to hold the ground. **********The separatist eastern bank has about 730,000 inhabitants, 60 percent of them Russian or Ukrainian and 40 percent ethnic Romanian. About 65 percent of Moldova's people are ethnic Romanian. **********Moldovan officials say they are willing to grant Trans-Dniester wide political and linguistic autonomy, but do not want to lose the industrial heart of their new state. They have warned that they may call on armed help from Romania if Russian troops continue to \"intervene\" on the side of the secessionists.

The move, prompted in part by concern that similar rules would be introduced elsewhere in the nation, would apparently be the first electoral test of whether people think that changes made in gasoline to reduce air pollution are worth the higher price. **********The group plans to ask the California Legislature to put a measure on the ballot that would require another analysis of benefits and costs before proceeding with the rules, which the California Air Resources Board recently approved and are to take effect in 1996. The referendum would be phrased broadly to cover all environmental rules, said a spokesman for Texaco, one company involved. The spokesman, David J. Dickson, said the goal was to address \"structural problems\" in the California economy, which he said was being hurt by high costs for environmental compliance. Conspicuously Absent **********ARCO, California's biggest gasoline marketer, was conspicuously absent. ARCO has voluntarily reformulated some of its gasoline and supported the Air Resources Board in its plans to enforce stricter rules. **********Several factors beyond concern over California's economy appeared to play a role. While the ostensible target of the referendum would be the California rule, many executives of national oil companies say that whatever steps the state takes are likely to be adopted, in whole or in part, in the Northeast and in other parts of the country. Eleven Northeastern and Middle Atlantic states have said they plan to adopt the California standards. **********Texaco, which has only about 7 percent of the California market but a bigger share in the East, has been especially vigorous in arguing against the California rules. **********In addition, according to refining analysts, the cost of meeting new rules will differ substantially from company to company, depending on the age and configuration of their refineries. ARCO, which is predominantly a California company, would find the rules relatively easy to meet, refining experts say. **********The composition of the group that met yesterday was unclear. Mr. Dickson said it was the directors of the Western States Petroleum Association. But a spokesman for the association, Jeffrey B. Wilson, said that the issue was not on the board's agenda, and that it was not addressed while the board was in session. **********Shortly after California passed the new rule last October, the association considered and rejected a proposal to challenge it. Meeting in Sacramento **********Mr. Dickson said other participants in the meeting in Sacramento yesterday included Chevron and Mobil. Chevron referred all comment to the association. A spokesman for Mobil said he was unaware of any meeting. **********But a spokesman for the Air Resources Board, William Sessa, said he had heard some talk of an effort by the companies to oppose the rule. **********At ARCO, Robert J. Trunek, the senior vice president for manufacturing, engineering and technology, said the idea of requiring a cost-benefit analysis was \"just silly,\" because the Air Resources Board's enabling legislation required an analysis before the regulation was imposed. He added that cars contributed more than 50 percent of the pollution, and that \"if you don't do as much as you can on the big emissions sources, you're going to have to do something just ridiculously strenuous on stationary sources.\" The latter are factories and other sources of pollution. **********The California rules, which would take effect in April 1996, require gasoline with less benzene, a carcinogen, and more oxygen to reduce production of carbon monoxide."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/23/world/somalis-assert-marines-have-to-secure-villages.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1992-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Somalis Assert Marines Have to Secure Villages", "print_headline": "Somalis Assert Marines Have to Secure Villages", "body_text": " **********Abdi Ali, his wife, Kadija, and nine children were among the first families to stagger into this wretched camp eight months ago. Since then, thousands have died here of starvation and disease, including four of their sons. **********The arrival of the United States Marines five days ago brought the first realistic hopes of recovery for Mr. Ali, a well-to-do herder rendered dependent on food handouts. The marines brought food. But what impressed Mr. Ali, a tall, elegant man wrapped in a blue checked sarong, was the Americans' show of force on the streets of this bush town, and the retreat of the Somali gunmen who are responsible for Mr. Ali's impoverishment. **********But Mr. Ali's feeling of new security against the local gunmen is not enough to make him and the thousands of other displaced farmers in this camp want to go home and start growing crops and raising cattle again. Mr. Ali is sitting tight in his temporary twig hut, waiting for something more before trekking 100 miles home. **********\"If the Americans don't reach my village, I will stay here in Baidoa,\" Mr. Ali said, chopping one hand with the other in a sign of finality. \"I don't trust my district until the American troops reach there. My district is in Somalia, and the Americans must go there to solve our problems.\" More Than Food Needed **********As the American forces have started to spread out beyond the capital, Mogadishu, and move into the heart of the famine areas like Baidoa, they are beginning to realize that the solution to Somalia's crisis lies not in delivering food and more food. Until people like Mr. Ali go home and resume productive lives, there can be no final resolution of Somalia's problems. **********The Americans stationed in this sun-baked town say they are surprised at how relatively well fed many of the Somalis appear compared with the harrowing pictures from July to October that earned Baidoa the title \"city of death.\" **********Most of the people in those images have died, leaving a diminished population that has survived on continuing relief efforts. Thus, instead of requests for food, the marines are hearing from people like Mr. Ali of demands for more security everywhere, and particularly in the far-flung villages where the farmers earn their livelihood. **********\"We've had some very vocal meetings with clan elders and religious leaders, and they would like us to disarm everyone,\" said Col. Werner Hellmer, who is co-ordinating the Marine efforts in Baidoa with the local population. \"They would like us to go house to house.\"  Marines Stricter About Arms **********Colonel Hellmer said he tells the Somalis that it is beyond the mandate of the American-led mission to play super-cop and hunt down every weapon. But, he said, pressure from the people in Baidoa persuaded the marines to be much stricter about weapons here compared with Mogadishu. **********In the capital, personal weapons are allowed as long as they do not present a threat to the coalition forces. In Baidoa, any visible weapon is seized by the marines or the French soldiers in the coalition. Thus, on the main street of Baidoa, where only last week cars were shot at, people sauntered along today without rifles, an astonishing sight in a place where practically everyone was armed in public. **********But how long it will take for the coalition forces to reach Mr. Ali's home at Tigieglo, 100 miles northeast of here -- or if they will reach there at all -- is not clear. His village, once a garrison town of the Somali Army, is about 50 miles from Hoddur and 80 miles from Belet Uen, two towns that the Americans plan to secure. Mr. Ali is counting on the troops to fan out from the two towns to his village, where millet usually grows so well that one crop would feed his family for two years. **********\"The hooligans are running from the Americans in Baidoa and going to my district,\" Mr. Ali said as he sat on the springs of an iron bed frame inside his twig hut. \"I have information from the market place that the gunners from here are in my district.\" Three Waves of 'Hooligans' **********As Mr. Ali explains the events of the last year that left him bereft of animals, crops and housing, this new wave of \"hooligans,\" as he calls them, are the third wave of looters to sweep through his home. The family, belonging to the Rahanwayn clan, a people best known for agricultural skills, left the five domed thatch huts that composed their homestead when troops of the former President, Mohammed Siad Barre, arrived. Most of the troops were Marehans, Mr. Barre's clan. They forced Mr. Ali at gunpoint to dig up the cache of millet the family had stored. **********\"What could I do?\" asked Mr. Ali, whose clan is probably the most poorly armed in all of Somalia. \"I only had my dagger and they had rifles.\" **********\"They looted all -- 65 camels, 25 cows, 50 goats,\" he said. \"Some people who argued, they killed. Those who obeyed, they didn't hurt.\" **********With his sources of food gone and nine children to feed, the family decided to come to Baidoa. One son died on the way. Returned Home Once **********Mr. Ali said he had journeyed back to his home shortly after arriving in Baidoa, to see if it was safe for his family to return. But he found the five huts destroyed by a second wave of looters, apparently belonging to the forces of Mr. Barre 's son-in-law, Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan, of the Majerteen clan. Mr. Ali has not returned since. **********\"I have my daily bread here,\" he explained. He and his wife split their five remaining children into two groups, and go to separate Red Cross kitchens in the morning for the first meal of the day. They rely on United Nations grain for a second meal, which they cook themselves. **********Mr. Ali said that if he is to return with his family -- depleted by the loss of four more children who died of measles in the camp -- the route home must be cleared of bandits. If he tried to carry food home on his back tomorrow, he said, \"looters will take it.\" **********\"If I go home, I would like to have food for eating on the way and to eat when I get home,\" he said. \"I have to have some seeds. Once I have all this -- and American troops -- I will go back quickly. If not, I will stay here.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/business/advertising-theeeeere-goes-johnny-heeeeere-s-big-money.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 959, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Theeeeere Goes Johnny; Heeeeere's Big Money!", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Theeeeere Goes Johnny; Heeeeere's Big Money!", "body_text": " **********If you listen carefully amid the applause for Johnny Carson as he prepares to leave late-night television after 30 years, you might hear the sound of cash registers ringing. **********Between now and May 22, when the final \"Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" will run, NBC will raise its rates for a 30-second commercial, in stages, about fivefold -- yes, fivefold -- to almost $200,000 for the finale. **********That instant inflation from the regular price of $40,000 will place the show's rates on a par with what marketers like Miller Brewing and Wendy's might pay for a 30-second commercial on a hit prime-time series like \"Roseanne.\" But it is still far below the $850,000 it cost for a 30-second spot during Super Bowl XXVI in January. Second-Largest Audience **********The reason for the hefty price tag for Mr. Carson's farewell, of course, is clear: NBC anticipates that the show's normal audience of about 10 million will swell to about 35 million for the finale, said Curt Block, a network spokesman in New York. That would be the second-largest audience ever for \"Tonight,\" after the 58 million who tuned in on Dec. 17, 1969, to watch the singer Tiny Tim marry his Miss Vicki. **********The transition from Mr. Carson to his designated successor, Jay Leno, has been as carefully orchestrated as the media hoopla surrounding the abdication of the \"king of late night.\" After all, in a medium that has witnessed the cancellation of a series after but a single episode, three decades is more of a reign than a run. Mr. Carson announced his impending retirement last May, followed a month later by NBC's selection of Mr. Leno, who has been his regular substitute host since 1987, as his replacement, effective on May 25. **********Still, advertising and media executives are watching intently for signs of disruption following Mr. Carson's record stint as host of a show that routinely generates annual advertising revenues of $100 million. **********In interviews yesterday, many expressed the belief that ratings for \"The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,\" as it will be called, will slip to some degree compared with Mr. Carson's. But most of them do not expect any giant defections, by viewers or advertisers, to the growing number of late-night alternatives, from rival talk shows like Arsenio Hall's and Dennis Miller's to sexually provocative fare like \"Studs.\" **********\"Jay Leno will hold the baton high and run with it,\" said Robert Ward, advertising services director for the Miller Brewing Company in Milwaukee. Miller Lite Beer is sponsoring a special promotion with NBC that includes spots on \"Tonight\" leading up to, and during, the final Carson appearance, he added, and when Mr. Leno arrives, \"we will continue our participation in the show.\" **********Paul Schulman, president of the Paul Schulman Company in New York, echoed that sentiment. **********\"I want to be in Leno's show just as we have been in Carson's show,\" said Mr. Schulman, who buys $175 million worth of network television time a year for clients like Ralston Purina and the Gap. **********As for speculation that NBC affiliates nationwide might delay broadcasts of Mr. Leno's \"Tonight\" show into the wee hours, threatening the network with advertising revenue losses of $10 million or more, he added, \"Leno will schmooze those affiliates into being in his corner.\" **********One post-Carson possibility advanced by Jack Klues, vice president and media director at Leo Burnett U.S.A. in Chicago, would be that Mr. Leno loses viewers, not to Mr. Hall, or to Chevy Chase's proposed talk show, due next year on the Fox network, but \"just because they'd turn off their sets after the late-night news.\" **********\"We would guess the ratings will slip,\" he added, \"on the basis of when you lose someone of the star magnitude of Johnny Carson, it would not be unexpected. But will there be no 'Tonight' show? We don't paint such a dark picture.\" **********Nor does Steve Auerbach, executive vice president of national broadcast at DeWitt Media Inc. in New York. **********\"It's only natural for the ratings to decline a while until Leno finds his own audience,\" said Mr. Auerbach, whose company buys about $100 million in network time for clients like Reebok International and American Family Publishers. He likened the transition to the replacement of Walter Cronkite by Dan Rather as anchor of \"The CBS Evening News\" in 1981. **********\"Somewhere down the line, you'll get a divvying-up of the audience,\" he added. \"There might be three or four or five shows with ratings of from two to five, versus a five to six rating for 'Tonight' now.\" A rating point represents 921,000 households. **********Mr. Block at NBC said no advertisers had indicated that they would leave \"Tonight\" because Mr. Carson was leaving. **********He also offered reassurance to those worried about the concurrent departure of Ed McMahon, Mr. Carson's foil and second banana, who has served as the show's pitchman, performing commercials \"live on tape\" for sponsors like Alpo dog food. (The phrase refers to television events taped as they happen for presentation later, usually without editing. This accounts for the broadcasting of occasional canine accidents.) **********While that type of spot has diminished greatly in recent years, Mr. Block said, advertisers wanting that option would be able to use Mr. McMahon's successor, the announcer Edd Hall. **********Mr. Carson's departure comes amid a frenzy of finales on the Big Three networks. Tonight, NBC bids goodbye to \"The Cosby Show\" after eight seasons. Last Saturday, ABC reaped its best Saturday ratings since October 1989 with consecutive series finales of \"Who's the Boss,\" \"Growing Pains\" and \"MacGyver.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/24/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-self-promoting-with-a-game.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1992-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Self-Promoting With a Game", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Self-Promoting With a Game", "body_text": " **********Modern Maturity magazine thinks it is time for a new board game, Reaching Maturity.

But for most of the returnees, the most immediate concern remains what most now admit forced them to flee in the first place: poverty and hunger in a country whose modern economy, by many measures, has almost ceased to exist. **********As the returnees filed off the ship and into the hands of the Haitian Red Cross and immigration officials, little hint remained of the stories many had told to the authorities at the United States refugee camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Often vague claims of political fears that many said justified their flight were displaced by vivid tales of hardship illustrated by their thin frames and gaunt, worried features. Even More Miserable Now **********Almost to a person, each of these refugees complained that, unable to scratch out a living, they had been compelled by misery to leave their country. What they could not know, especially those who had been cut off for weeks from news of their country while they waited at the Guantanamo tent city for news of whether they would be admitted to the United States, was that the Haiti they were returning to, already the hemisphere's poorest country, had become a starkly more miserable place in their absence. **********\"We have two children, and we can't even send them to school,\" said Altes Paul, an unemployed 25-year-old who fled a month ago. \"As long as there is no work, I can't tell you I won't leave again.

When the Americans see us like this, don't they have any pity?\" Farmers Eating Seeds **********Back in his home region, which is denuded of trees and suffering an intense drought, the few hospitals and health clinics are now filling with severely malnourished children. International development experts say that to ward off starvation, many farmers have resorted to eating the seeds that would have produced the next crops. **********United States immigration officials, and even some refugee advocates, now say it is becoming increasingly clear that only a fraction of the more than 15,000 Haitians who have been picked up at sea since the overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide had political motives for trying to reach the United States. **********But Mr. Jean-Francois's plaintive question continues to reverberate troublingly, many say. Advocates for the refugees and Haitians themselves still bitterly ask how the United States can justify sending thousands of people back to a country where violence, much of it politically inspired, remains endemic, and the already stinging poverty has been worsened by an international embargo. **********\"Represssion is really severe in the countryside,\" said Guy Bauduy, a conservative Senator who has been a strong backer of the provisional Government that replaced Father Aristide. \"Part of it is politically motivated, but most of it involves people taking advantage of the situation for a settling of accounts.\" General Climate of Violence **********Stung by the alarming stories of violence and repression told by people who fled Haiti twice in the recent refugee crisis, United States officials say they have monitored more than 300 returnees in the capital and the countryside and \"have found no evidence to substantiate and much that contradicts\" allegations of politically motivated attacks, though they acknowledge a general climate of violence. **********Arthur C. Helton, director of the Refugee Project of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, condemned the recent decision by the Justice Department to keep more than 200 Haitians who have met the standards required to seek asylum but who have tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

If it rules that is has, penalty duties will be imposed on the Japanese mini-vans. It would be the first time such duties were placed on Japanese passenger vehicles. **********Dumping occurs when a foreign company sells its goods in the United States below its domestic price or below its production cost plus a reasonable profit. In this case, the Commerce Department concluded that most mini-vans that the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Mazda Motor Corporation sold at home were sold at a loss, so the department instead sought to use their production cost plus reasonable profit as a measure of fair value. **********The Big Three, led by the Chrysler Corporation, invented the mini-van and dominate the market. But they argued that Japan's van makers, who were late with a competitive product, were aggressively selling their mini-vans at illegally low prices to gain American market share. **********The finding of dumping heightened tensions just a day after the heads of the leading American and Japanese auto makers met outside Chicago to try to resolve their differences. Some industry analysts said that in bringing this case in a segment of the car market that Detroit pioneered and dominates, the Big Three showed a new aggressiveness in seeking to protect their turf against Japanese encroachment. **********Some representatives of the Japanese industry said today's decision, coming in an election year, was political and showed that the Administration had concluded that it could win votes by getting tough with Japan's auto makers. They cited the President's trip to Tokyo last December as another political move. **********Representatives of the Japanese industry said it was ludicrous to bring the mini-van case because the Big Three had 88 percent of the market. Chrysler had 45 percent of the 1991 mini-van market, the General Motors Corporation had 26.2 percent, and the Ford Motor Company had 16.8 percent. Imports had 12 percent. **********James Olson, vice president of external affairs for Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., said the decision \"may be politically correct, but it's factual fantasy.\" He added, \"The Big Three's reaction to our modest success\" in the mini-van market \"is like a herd of elephants being stampeded by two mice.\" **********According to the Commerce Department, about 95,000 Japanese mini-vans were sold in the United States in 1990 at a value of $1.2 billion. In 1991, Toyota sold 52,099 of its Previa mini-vans in the United States and Mazda sold 48,056 of its MPV mini-vans. Higher Prices **********Mazda's mini-vans have a base price of from $17,710 to $21,360, so the imposition of 12.7 percent dumping duties could raise sticker prices by between $2,250 and $2,710. The base sticker price of Toyota's mini-vans is from $17,518 to $25,518, so a 6.75 percent duty could raise prices between $1,182 and $1,722. Japan's auto makers said this would provide an umbrella to allow American producers of mini-vans to raise their prices. **********Big Three officials were heartened that today's final determination on dumping found far higher dumping margins than a preliminary decision last December, which found that Mazda's vans were selling at 7.19 percent below fair value and Toyota's at 0.95 percent below. The case involves sales of mini-vans between Oct. 1, 1990, and May 31, 1991, when the Big Three asked for an investigation. **********Today's decision found that all other Japanese mini-vans were selling at 9.88 percent below fair value on average; the preliminary decision had said that they were selling at an average of 4.23 percent below fair value. The Big Three's dumping complaint mentioned only Toyota and Mazda, which are the dominant mini-van importers.  Rise in Market Share **********Thomas Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association in Detroit, said the Big Three had brought the case because they were convinced the Japanese were dumping as their market share increased from 3 percent to about 12 percent in three years. **********\"This product was invented in the U.S.,\" Mr. Hanna said. \"When the American companies saw the rapidity with which the Japanese were penetrating the market, it was alarming. The question is, do you stand back until the segment is decimated by the Japanese or do you ask for an investigation?

A Houston oilman, Ernest H. Cockrell, joined the billionaire, Jay Pritzker, and his son, Thomas, and two other wealthy investors, Dan Lufkin and Mel Klein, in a partnership last week to buy reserves that major oil companies have on the auction block. **********Mr. Cockrell, a third-generation oilman, is in a position that leaves other producers envious. He avoided big losses when prices collapsed in the 1980's by selling most of his family-held reserves in 1983. The move put his Cockrell Oil Corporation near the sidelines, with no debt, lots of cash and large royalty holdings along the gulf coast. He was able to hold on as many producers failed. **********Now, with drilling in the United States at the lowest level in 50 years, Mr. Cockrell thinks it is time again to own reserves. \"You have to have the reserves in the ground when the price increases take place,\" he said. **********That increase could already be under way. The gas contract for October deliveries rose to the highest level of the year last week, to $2.147 per million British thermal units, or approximately 1,000 cubic feet, in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil traded near $22 a barrel. Gas prices had plunged below $1 last February. **********The partnership with the Pritzkers, who head the Hyatt Corporation, and Mr. Lufkin and Mr. Klein, called Cockrell Oil & Gas, L.P., starts with more than $125 million in equity, including $91 million in cash plus several oil-and-gas operations contributed by Cockrell Oil Corporation. **********Paul R. Leibman, an analyst at Petrie, Parkman & Company, a Denver brokerage, said the Cockrell group \"could be the first\" of several groups from beyond the oil patch to come shopping with pockets full of cash. Big Oil has $10 billion or more in reserves up for sale, but few deals have been signed because bidders in the oil patch are short of cash, he said. **********Mr. Cockrell, 46 years old, became Cockrell Oil Corporation's chief executive in 1979, seven years after his father, Ernest Cockrell Jr., died from a heart attack. The younger Mr. Cockrell lacked experience, but he compensated with a textbook rearing for heading a company in the oil patch. **********He earned a degree in petroleum engineering and an M.B.A. from the University of Texas, and often traveled to offshore rigs and onshore drilling sites with his father since his childhood days. His grandfather, Ernest Cockrell, started the business in 1901, finding some big fields along the gulf coast from Mississippi to Texas. **********Cockrell Oil has maps of more than 30,000 wells, mainly in the gulf coast area, and Mr. Cockrell thinks that resource could sharpen drilling successes of other firms. In addition to cash deals with oil giants, he said, Cockrell Oil & Gas can add more reserves through pacts with weakened independent drillers who cannot afford to produce their reserves."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/21/business/business-fraud-of-the-90-s-falsifying-corporate-data.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1944, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business Fraud of the 90's: Falsifying Corporate Data", "print_headline": "Business Fraud of the 90's: Falsifying Corporate Data", "body_text": " **********The names are toppling like financial dominoes: Phar-Mor, the Ohio drugstore chain; College Bound, a school-test coaching service in Florida, and Gottschalks, a retailer in California. In the last year, each has been found to have provided regulators and investors with seriously inaccurate information about its activities. **********They are part of a growing parade of companies sent to the regulatory woodshed in the 90's in what some securities lawyers and regulators say is a sharp change in the type of corporate frauds being committed -- from those involving stock trading to those involving the way public companies are run. **********Solid numbers are hard to come by, since the cases fall across several legal and regional jurisdictions. But in the last year alone, at least 20 public companies traded on national stock exchanges have come forward to disclose serious lapses in their past financial statements ranging from inflated sales and hidden ownership to the possibility of outright embezzlement. **********\"There's no doubt about it,\" said Charles Harper, the chief of the Miami office of the S.E.C. and one of the agency's most experienced fraud fighters. \"We're seeing the serious problems migrating upstream, from the brokers to the issuers.\" **********Cases tracked by Securities Class Action Alert, a research service in Cresskill, N.J., show the same trend. **********\"In the 1980's, most of the lawsuits were takeover related,\" said James Newman, publisher of the service. \"In the 90's, we've seen a very significant rise in suits charging significant fraud and failures to disclose losses or poor earnings.\" Fewer Enforcement Tools **********And these recent cases may pose greater challenges to regulators and higher risks to investors than the previous brands. New laws and a larger force of S.E.C. accountants have given fraud fighters a few new tricks to use against this crime wave. But compared with the recent penny-stock and insider-trading battles, regulators still have fewer tools -- and they are harder and more cumbersome to use. **********What is more, this time more investors are likely to own the affected stocks, either directly or indirectly through mutual funds and pensions.  Damage to Small Companies **********And while fraud occurs in the biggest corporations, it is typically more damaging to the stock of small or midsized companies, which have become Wall Street favorites in the last two years, outperforming the giant blue-chip companies. Such companies are now widely owned, not only by individuals but by institutional investors -- the mutual funds, pension funds and professionally managed accounts that constitute the nest eggs of middle America. **********A case in point is Phar-Mor Inc., the drugstore chain in Youngstown, Ohio, that filed for bankruptcy in mid-August amid accusations by the company that a co-founder had embezzled money and hidden the fact behind a set of fake books. Phar-Mor had no publicly traded stock, but $61.2 million worth of its shares were held in nine mutual funds managed by Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston. **********The funds bought the shares last March from the Westinghouse Credit Corporation, an institutional investor in Phar-Mor. Massachusetts Financial has since sued Westinghouse to rescind the deal. **********What is driving this apparent upswing in \"issuer fraud\" cases? Experts point to the combined effects of a strong stock market, which has enabled often-shaky companies to sell stock to big institutions, and a weak economy, which has made it harder for those companies to deliver on their promises. **********\"That's when you see fraud cases increase,\" said Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the S.E.C. \"People have made projections -- some mixture of hype and dream -- and along comes a weak economy and the results don't measure up. So they 'cook' the books.\" **********Smaller companies also attract less attention from Wall Street analysts, allowing problems to go undetected. **********Harvey Pitt, a longtime Washington securities lawyer and former regulator whose firm has investigated several fraud cases, offered another possibility. \"Maybe we've become more attuned to the scandals,\" he said. \"The standards of morality are rising, and things acceptable years ago are not acceptable today.\" **********Mr. Breeden, the S.E.C. chief, disagrees. His view is that today's spate of issuer fraud reveals that moral standards, far from rising, are slipping. \"I think it's partly a function of the weakening of society's ethics,\" he said. \"Less lying means less fraud.\" Incentive to Keep Stock Prices High **********Michael Murphy, publisher of the Overpriced Stock Service, an investment newsletter in Half Moon Bay, Calif., says the upswing in misbehavior is a result of stock-price temptation. \"Stocks selling for $1 a share in the fall of 1990 are now selling for $12 to $14 a share,\" he said. \"There's a big incentive for executives to try to maintain the price at that level.\" **********Officials at the National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, pointed their fingers at outside auditors. \"They are our eyes and ears,\" said Don Bosic, an association official, \"and in many of the cases of late, the companies have been able to pull something over on the auditors.\" **********Whatever the causes, a review of company announcements, news headlines, investor lawsuits and S.E.C. documents gives the impression of a corporate crime wave in progress. **********Perhaps the most spectacular example was the collapse of Cascade International, a retail chain based in Boca Raton, Fla. Victor D. Incendy, Cascade's founder and chairman, vanished last November after a few analysts questioned the accuracy of his company's financial statements. The company is now being liquidated, and Federal agents continue to look for Mr. Incendy. **********Other widely traded companies whose financial statements are currently under S.E.C. scrutiny include: ***********Fidelity Medical, a medical products company in Florham Park, N.J., which recently revised three years of audits after acknowledging that it had inflated sales numbers in earlier reports. ***********Ross Cosmetics, a maker of low-cost perfume in Duncan, S.C., which is under investigation on charges that it failed to disclose accurately its controlling shareholders and the number of shares it had issued. ***********Gottschalks Inc., a retail chain based in Fresno, Calif., which announced in May that Federal authorities were investigating a tax deduction the company took in 1985. In June, two former officers were indicted, and in July the company pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false filings to the S.E.C. and the Internal Revenue Service. Little Control Over Key Figures **********Mr. Harper, the Miami regulator, noted that the main figures in cases of issuer fraud tend to be a public company's own executives, lawyersor auditors -- people over whom regulators, as a matter of public policy, have little control. **********By contrast, securities brokers, even those who push penny stocks through high-pressure telephone calls, must be licensed by both state and Federal authorities, making it much easier for regulators to monitor their activities. **********But in most cases, there is nothing to prevent someone who has been in chronic trouble with the law from serving as an officer or director of any public company, so long as those past problems are adequately disclosed to investors. **********\"John Gotti, in jail for murder, could form a public company and sell stock, as long as he discloses his background,\" said Joseph Del Raso, a Philadelphia lawyer, a former S.E.C. regulator and the court-appointed trustee for College Bound. \"And the sad truth is, probably a lot of people would buy those shares.\" More Action Against Improper Auditing **********The front-line protection against issuer fraud, of course, is the S.E.C.'s requirement that public companies produce annual audits by independent accountants. Indeed, the agency has the power to bar auditors from practicing before the agency if it believes they have performed poorly -- and it is using this tool more frequently. After barring only 8 accountants in 1990 and 10 in 1991, the agency has barred 23 so far this year. **********But such disciplinary steps usually provoke \"endless\" litigation, Mr. Breeden said, and can take months and sometimes years to put into effect. \"So that may not be seen as an important deterrent,\" he added. **********During that litigation period, securities lawyers agree, a public company would apparently not be required to inform investors that the S.E.C. was trying to bar an accountant who had done its audit. **********The S.E.C. does review the adequacy of the information supplied in initial public stock offerings, and some percentage -- usually about 25 percent -- of the subsequent financial statements filed by corporations, said Elise Walter, deputy director of the agency's division of corporate finance. **********More accountants have been hired in the last three years to help conduct those reviews, she said. But when the market for new offerings is hot -- as it has been in the last two years -- there are fewer resources available to monitor continuing operations, she added. **********One new tool in the S.E.C.'s arsenal, acquired through new antifraud legislation in 1990, is the right to go to court against individuals found to have committed wrongdoings and obtain a court order barring them from any association with a public company, including service as an executive or director. **********Last October, Mr. Harper of the S.E.C. used this new weapon in a case against Paul J. Carvajal, a Miami Beach resident who had served variously since 1986 as president, chief executive and a director of Delta Rental Systems, a Nasdaq-listed company that rented water-sports equipment at resort hotels. The S.E.C. charged that Delta, with Mr. Carvajal's help, had produced false financial statements and audits for three years. **********The company and Mr. Carvajal settled with the S.E.C., without admitting or denying their guilt, by agreeing not to commit any future securities law violations. But at the agency's request, Federal District Judge Edward B. Davis in Miami also permanently barred Mr. Carvajal from \"acting as an officer or director of any publicly held company.\" **********Such bans can only be sought in cases that arise after the law was enacted in 1990, Mr. Breeden said. \"But we certainly intend in the future to seek more court orders against people whose history suggests that disclosure notwithstanding they should not be associated with a public company,\" he said. Tightening Rules But Not the Market **********Securities lawyers, professional investors and scholars suggest that there are other things regulators can do to combat issuer fraud: requiring corporate officers to obtain fidelity bonds, for example, and raising professional standards for accountants doing S.E.C. work. **********But unlike discussions of insider trading or abusive selling practices by brokers, any theorizing about how to fight issuer fraud almost immediately runs aground on the basic regulatory problem: how to prevent fraud without unfairly restricting access to the equity markets. **********This question has acquired strong political overtones in this election year, with the S.E.C. announcing new rules aimed at cutting the red tape involved when small businesses sell stock -- permitting less disclosure, critics say, but still requiring independent audits. **********Mr. Breeden insists that these new rules do not weaken the agency's fight against issuer fraud. But state regulators -- and, privately, some S.E.C. staff members -- are concerned that the small-business initiative sends the wrong message to the marketplace. **********Inevitably, the best protection against issuer fraud is an alert, skeptical investor, said Robert A. Anderson, executive vice president at Southeast Research Partners, an institutional research and brokerage firm based in Boca Raton. **********\"But it's getting harder all the time to detect these things,\" he said. \"If Phar-Mor had been publicly traded, I'd have had all my clients in it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/02/business/hughes-fails-to-fulfill-hopes-of-gm-for-counterbalance.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1992-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 712, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hughes Fails to Fulfill Hopes Of G.M. for Counterbalance", "print_headline": "Hughes Fails to Fulfill Hopes Of G.M. for Counterbalance", "body_text": " **********It was for times like these, when auto sales are slow, that the General Motors Corporation bought the Hughes Aircraft Company six years ago.

What is more, many analysts, though declining to speak for the record, rate the Hughes acquisition a waste of capital, noting that G.M. would be in far better financial shape today if it could spend the $5.2 billion it spent on Hughes on retrenching of North American automotive operations, which lost nearly $8 billion last year. **********\"We had been predicting a G.M. net profit in the second quarter of about $500 million, but now we're looking toward a net loss of about $250 million,\" said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. **********G.M. earned a slim $179 million in the first quarter, after posting a $4.55 billion loss for last year. G.M. will announce its earnings for its second quarter, which ended Tuesday, later this month. **********G.M. bought Hughes six years ago for $5.2 billion in cash and stock, winning an auction against the Ford Motor Company, the Boeing Company and others. **********William Winters, a G.M. spokesman, reiterated the auto maker's stance that it has no intention of selling Hughes, although it is divesting other nonautomotive businesses to concentrate effort and capital on cars and trucks. **********Hughes said the cutbacks will save about $700 million a year in cost and position the company for stronger financial results in the future. C. Michael Armstrong, Hughes's chairman, said he hoped to broaden commercial applications of the company's high-technology abilities. **********Bruce McCristal, a spokesman for G.M. Hughes Electronics, said the subsidiary had earned a cumulative $4.31 billion since the acquisition. But with meager overall profits last year, G.M. has pursued alternative financing, selling $2 billion worth of common stock two months ago to raise cash. **********G.M.'s common stock lost $1 a share today, closing at $43 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares in G.M. Hughes, known as G.M. class H stock, lost $3.25 each, closing at $22.625 on the Big Board. **********G.M. bought Hughes to take advantage of its expertise in high-technology systems integration, optics and other fields that might be useful in automotive research and development. **********But the acquisition, a pet project of Roger B. Smith, G.M.'s chairman at the time, was born in controversy. Ross Perot, then a G.M. director, opposed the acquisition because he said the price was too high, particularly in light of Soviet overtures for mutual arms reduction. Mr. Perot, who left G.M. in 1986, was the lone G.M. director to vote against it. **********Since then, Hughes engineers have helped G.M. automotive engineers on a number of projects, including development of the Impact battery-powered car prototype. Mr. McCristal said Hughes engineers had completed installing half of a satellite network to 9,700 G.M. dealers. It will be complete in two years. **********Still, Hughes Aircraft has failed to produce solid earnings for as long as G.M. has owned it. Analysts cannot calculate precisely how much Hughes has earned on its own because its results are lumped together with those of several Delco Electronics subsidiaries, which G.M. already owned. **********Delco and Hughes were joined as part of the acquisition financing package, which paid the Howard Hughes Medical Institute $2.7 billion in cash and $2.5 billion worth of a new class of G.M. stock, G.M. class H. **********Soon thereafter, the acquisition dissolved into a squabble between G.M. and the medical institute, which contended that class H stock did not pay adequate dividends -- dividends depended on earnings -- and there was an inadequate public market in which to sell the stock. The squabble was settled in early 1989 when G.M. paid the institute almost $1 billion and agreed to buy back much, if not most, of the class H stock."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/28/world/un-relief-official-in-somalia-quits-in-dispute-with-headquarters.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1992-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 985, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

A number of United Nations diplomats voiced concern over Mr. Sahnoun's possible departure and noted that he had conducted long and difficult negotiations over the distribution of food and other supplies in Somalia. ] A 'Complete Disaster' **********Mr. Sahnoun's resignation letter comes as factional violence in Somalia has increased markedly in the last 10 days, delaying food deliveries and dramatically increasing the number of deaths from starvation in a bush town where the death rate had fallen. **********In Bardera, 220 miles southwest of Mogadishu, aid workers said 307 people died of starvation Monday and by 3 P.M. today 97 more had died. **********The International Committee of the Red Cross, which sent a nurse to Bardera two days ago, said the nurse described the scene as a \"complete disaster.\" People were dying as fast as they had been in Baidoa, the town where the Somali famine hit hardest in July, August and September, a Red Cross official said. **********The official, Geoff Loane, relief coordinator for the Red Cross in Somalia, said it was almost incomprehensible that after two months' work in Bardera by the United Nations and CARE, an American-based agency, the situation could have regressed so much. **********\"Why is it like this?\" Mr. Loane said. \"We had crossed Bardera off the critical list.\" **********Answering his question, Mr. Loane said that while the relief situation had improved in some places, the political situation across Somalia appeared to be worsening. That in turn was hampering, and in some cases, shutting down the relief efforts, he said. **********Most of the airstrips that have been the focus of the United States and United Nations airlifts have been closed for days at a time in the last two weeks because of violence. In Kismayo, a major distribution point on the southern coast, gunmen shot at the cockpit of a Red Cross plane delivering food on Saturday, aid workers said. The airport has been closed to food flights since. **********The United States canceled its usual flights to Baidoa on Sunday and Monday after one of its planes was hit by small-arms fire Sunday morning. **********No substantial amounts of food have been delivered to Bardera in two weeks because of fighting between the forces of Mohammed Siad Herse Morgan, who is the son-in-law of the deposed Somali President, Mohammed Siad Barre, and Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid. General Aidid's men were forced to retreat from the town, where about 20,000 displaced people had been entirely dependent on international food aid delivered at the air strips. **********When Mr. Morgan's fighters occupied the town, those who were strong enough fled to the surrounding countryside, those 10,000 or so who were too weak to walk stayed. **********There was in fact enough food in a Bardera warehouse to feed those people when Mr. Morgan occupied the town and aid workers were evacuated for security reasons, CARE said. **********But about 80 percent of the 1,000 tons in the warehouse, organized by CARE, was looted by the forces of Mr. Morgan, Earl Goodyear, CARE's relief coordinator for Somalia, said. **********The remaining 200 tons of food that were not stolen were distributed among the starving people in the last several days by Dr. Whalid Musa, a Sudanese doctor with the United Nations, in a frantic effort to try and stem the tide of deaths, Mr. Goodyear said. **********But Mr. Goodyear said that unless the airlift began again immediately, the death rate would rise even higher. **********The prospects for such an airlift to Bardera were not good, United Nations officials said. A German Air Force plane, delivering the first food in 10 days on Saturday, took off in a hurry after a rocket-propelled grenade was launched near the runway, they said. **********Plans for more planes to go to Bardera have been put on hold pending further investigation of the security situation, United Nations officials said. **********The kind of lawlessness hampering the aid effort in Bardera seemed to be illustrative of the overall problems facing Mr. Sahnoun.

He now accompanies Prince Sihanouk on visits outside Phnom Penh, a role that had been Mr. Hun Sen's. **********Diplomats worry that the shooting of Mr. Oung Phan may have been meant as a warning to Mr. Hun Sen and his allies. Even though he is now a critic of the Government, Mr. Oung Phan and the Prime Minister are old friends, and after the shooting, Mr. Oung Phan was transferred from his hospital bed to Mr. Hun Sen's home in Phnom Penh, out of fear for his safety. **********\"The Government feels it can no longer even keep its own hospitals secure from attack,\" said another Cambodian dissident, speaking on the condition that his name not be used. **********\"We do not know who is responsible for the shooting of Mr. Oung Phan, but it was a signal to all of us that we cannot speak freely,\" the dissident added. \"The Government will not protect us.

But Bellcore has developed a technology for transmitting a single channel of high-quality video over ordinary copper telephone lines. Video on Demand **********The new technology represents a narrower approach than cable television companies currently use in offering video selections to the customer.  Bell officials say that instead of sending dozens of channels to every subscriber, as cable companies do, the technology will make it possible for them to offer movies or programs one at a time, at the customer's request. **********Viewers will not be able to flip casually around the dial between cooking shows, horror movies and reruns of \"Kojak.\" Nor will they be able to watch live television, like the Cable News Network or a World Series game, because the system needs time to convert video images into digital form and store them in a giant \"server\" computer. **********But Bell Atlantic officials say the technology will allow them to introduce a \"video on demand\" service that allows customers to browse from a potentially huge library of offerings and pick precisely when they want to watch their selections. **********From an economic standpoint, the technology allows the telephone company to offer television service without having to rip up its existing wires. Bell Atlantic, whose phone companies provide service in New Jersey and other Middle Atlantic states, as well as Washington, said it would start a test system next summer involving 400 employees. **********The company said it hoped to begin commercial introduction of the service in 1994. In the test system, viewers will be able to pick from a menu of about 100 programs and choose precisely when they want to watch them. **********The new service marks the latest in a frenzy of new experiments to provide video-on-demand over telephone or cable networks. In New York City, the Nynex Corporation recently teamed up with Liberty Cable Television on a plan to deliver video-on-demand by running fiber-optic lines directly to a handful of apartments. **********In Denver, U S West has joined forces with A.T.& T. and Tele-Communications Inc. to test such services over Tele-Communications' coaxial cables. And Bell Atlantic, in a previously announced experiment for Loudon County, Va., is working with the local cable company to test a \"fiber to the curb\" system. **********But the system that Bell Atlantic announced today could speed up the race considerably, if it is successful, because it would allow telephone companies to jump into the fray without replacing thousands of miles of copper wire. **********Yet many questions remain unanswered. No one knows who will make the huge computer jukeboxes that store and provide all the programming, and no one knows how costly they will be.  Demand, and Costs, Uncertain **********The market prospects are also unclear. Cable television systems are using fiber-optic technology to greatly increase the number of channels they can offer, allowing them to approximate video-on-demand by simply repeating programs many times a day. And satellite direct-broadcast services are also on the horizon, further increasing the competition for entertainment dollars. **********Bell Atlantic officials refused to disclose how much money they plan to invest or how quickly they hope to deploy the new technology. Nor have they said which companies they hope will build the equipment or supply the programming. The Federal Communications Commission recently allowed telephone companies to provide what it called \"video dial tone\" service, but F.C.C. regulations still bar them from owning more than 5 percent of a programmer. **********Such uncertainties notwithstanding, Bell Atlantic officials said they were committed to entering the market. **********\"This is the future of our business,\" said Arthur Bushkin, president of the company's Bell Atlantic Information Services unit. \"The level of corporate commitment is complete and total.\" **********As envisioned, video programs would be transformed into digital code using the same mathematical techniques used to store music on compact disks. The material would then be stored on a huge computer, which would in turn be linked by high-speed lines to central office switches operated by the local telephone company. **********Company officials said the key innovation, developed at Bellcore, is a method of sharply increasing the capacity of ordinary copper phone lines for the last leg of the trip, from neighborhood switching stations to individual homes. New communication devices, akin to very high-speed computer modems, would be installed at both the switching stations and in each customer's home. **********But industry analysts remained cautious. \"This is a long process,\" said Daniel P. Reingold, a telephone analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company. \"It's not going to happen overnight.\" **********\"It is very much a black box,\" added Gary Arlen, a consultant in Bethesda, Md., who specializes in so-called interactive television technologies. \"It could be very expensive to develop.

He had been absent from the list for two years. The newsletter estimated that he would make $4.5 million this year from his ad work. **********The rebirth of Mr. Connors's ad career typifies the increased demand among consumer-product marketers and their agencies for older, more mature athletes. Once, younger players set the pace in hawking cereals, sneakers and soft drinks. Now, as the baby-boom generation ages, the ranks of more mature spokesmen like Mr. Connors are swelling.

(Some of those traits earned Mr. Connors a rebuke in the June 8 issue of Sports Illustrated; a columnist, Sally Jenkins, lambasted him as \"a punch-drunk braggart\" who \"played shamelessly to the crowd\" at the French Open.) **********Mr. Connors's ad comeback began with his Nuprin campaign, which, fortuitously, was filmed a week before his surprisingly strong showing at the U.S. Open. **********\"They took one heck of a chance,\" Mr. Connors said, \"and it paid off.\"  Jim Heekin, executive vice president and general manager at J. Walter Thompson New York, Nuprin's agency, said that while \"we certainly ran into some wonderful serendipity,\" which has amplified the impact of the campaign, \"throughout Jimmy's career, even before being an aging warrior, he was known for fighting back, playing through pain, embodying true grit.\" **********While Mr. Heekin declined to discuss plans for this year's U.S. Open, a sequel spot \"is certainly something we have to be thinking about,\" he said. **********Mr. Connors's personal agent, Ray Benton, president of RSB Ventures in Washington, said he was also \"looking generally for some more upscale products\" for Mr. Connors to endorse. **********Asked if he was concerned about oversaturating the market with his presence, Mr. Connors replied, \"It's a good problem to have.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/29/world/hungary-fights-unrest-with-new-social-contract.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 718, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hungary Fights Unrest With New Social Contract", "print_headline": "Hungary Fights Unrest With New Social Contract", "body_text": " **********Nervous about the possibility of unrest, the Government is negotiating a new social contract with its citizens, who are showing increasing concern over their falling standard of living. **********After meetings with labor leaders and employers' representatives, Government officials agreed this week to a new minimum wage, a list of items that would be exempted from a new value-added tax, and ways to deal with the country's steadily rising unemployment rate, which was 11.6 percent at the end of October. **********\"I simply signed an agreement to safeguard social peace,\" Finance Minister Mihaly Kupa said after the Government agreed to the new measures. **********After the fall of Communism and cuts in the wide range of free social services that supplemented low salaries, many Hungarians expected that the advent of a market economy would make life harder for some.

Seventy to 90 percent of pensioners live below the poverty line -- an income of $470 a month for a family of four or $160 for a single person -- and the number of people who have had utility services cut off because they are unable to pay their bills has soared. **********Many in the Government fear that if pushed too far, the middle classes could set off a social explosion, forcing strikes and other protests. **********\"The tempers are there,\" Mr. Mezei warned. \"If the group that is pressed downward becomes the majority, and no one is communicating with them or trying to answer their needs, then this society could stop functioning normally.\" **********The Government, which is struggling to combat a $2 billion deficit in a $12.2 billion budget, agreed to modify the list of goods and services to be affected by the value-added tax, which is be 6 percent on basics like bread and milk and 25 percent on other items. It exempted medicines and household electricity and lowered the tax rate for some items. **********It also agreed to a 15 percent increase in the minimum wage to about $115 a month and a slight increase in pensions for the elderly and supplements to families with children age 16 or younger. **********But some Hungarians vowed to continue their campaign of resistance to the extension of the tax to basic food items that began four weeks ago. Dozens of people around the country are on a revolving hunger strike, taking only liquids and vitamins until they become so weak they are sent to hospitals. **********The goal of the Government as it pushes a new welfare bill and next year's budget through Parliament is to follow the advice of the International Monetary Fund and others to better target social expenditures. The Government will try to support the most needy while weaning others from the old system of state support. **********\"The basic question is what will happen to the middle class,\" Mr. Mezei said. \"Will it be the engine of change it should be, helping society to develop, or will it increasingly be needing that help itself?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/29/business/briefs-617892.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1992-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 207, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt  * Fieldcrest Cannon Inc., Greensboro, N.C., a maker of home textile products, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering of $85 million in senior subordinated debentures due 2004 and for an equity offering of 1.5 million common shares through Kidder, Peabody. *********** Marine Midland Bank N.A., Buffalo, part of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, has filed for a shelf offering for up to $1 billion in mortgage-backed pass-through certificates. **********Common  * First Chicago Corp. has filed for up to eight million common shares through First Boston. *********** Insurance Auto Auctions Inc., Los Angeles, has filed for an offering of 2.1 million common shares through William Blair & Co. *********** Oriole HomesCorp., Delray Beach, Fla., is offering 1.1 million common shares at $10.25 a share through Paine Webber Inc.

She added that most of Sony Music's advertising continued to be handled in-house."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/16/business/patents-a-variation-of-vitamin-d-aids-bones.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1992-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 368, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; A Variation Of Vitamin D Aids Bones", "print_headline": "Patents; A Variation Of Vitamin D Aids Bones", "body_text": " **********Mothers and nutritionists have said for decades that drinking milk, rich in calcium and fortified with vitamin D, can help build strong bones and teeth in growing children. **********Now, a company with roots in the heart of dairy country has patented a variant of vitamin D that shows promise in treating the bone loss of osteoporosis, an illness that weakens millions of middle-aged and elderly women each year. **********The new compound was developed at Bone Care International Inc. of Madison, Wis., which was started by professors at the University of Wisconsin. Based on a form of vitamin D found in plants, the new compound has been licensed by SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. and other drug companies and is now undergoing the second phase of human clinical studies. **********The principal advantage of the new compound, its inventors said, is that it appears to prevent bone loss without causing excessive calcium to build up in the body. Excess calcium can accumulate in the kidneys, causing painful kidney stones and potentially even shutting the organ down. **********The patented vitamin is one of the latest in a long series of advances in vitamin D over the last 60 years at the University of Wisconsin. During the 1920's, Harry Steenbock, a scientist at what was then part of the university's agriculture school, discovered that vitamin D could be produced from a precursor compound by exposing milk to ultraviolet radiation. **********The new compound is based on research by Dr. Steenbock's last graduate student, Hector De Luca, who is now chairman of the university's biochemistry department. **********Dr. De Luca said other variations of vitamin D had been found to prevent bone loss but had been considered unsafe by regulators in the United States and most other countries because of the toxic effect of calcium buildup. Such compounds are used in Japan, where most people's diet is relatively low in calcium and buildup is less of a problem. **********The new variation, called 1-alpha hydroxy-vitamin D2 , is developed from plants. The researchers say it can be given safely in doses 10 times larger than allowable doses of previous compounds. **********Patent 5,104,864 was issued to Dr. De Luca and three other researchers."}}
