Casey, Director of Central Intelligence, to discuss whether the agency has surpassed Congressional limits for the financing, the committee members said. **********''The story is that they have overdrawn,'' a highly placed committee member said. ''They've been transferring accounts in order to be sure that the insurgents could continue on for the rest of the fiscal year.'' **********Another committee member said, ''From all the evidence we have, they've overdrawn.'' He noted the agency's involvement in the mining of Nicaraguan harbors and added, ''Funds for the mother ship alone would have done it.''  Extent of Overspending **********The extent to which the agency had overdrawn its Nicaragua account could not be learned. But one member said the amount was ''significant.'' **********The two committee members said the Senate Intelligence Committee also was looking into reports that the C.I.A. had exceeded Congressional funding limitations in Nicaragua, but this could not be confirmed by members or aides of the Senate committee. **********Such charges open a new issue in the already troubled relations Congres has with the agency, which has been criticized by both the House and the Senate intelligence committees for failing to keep Congress ''fully and currently informed'' of its activities, as required by law. **********The charges come at a time of heightened tensions between the Administration and Congress concerning new funds for covert activities in Nicaragua. The Senate approved $21 million in emergency supplemental money, but the House rejected the aid.   Emergency Aid Bill **********The money is contained in a $1.4 billion emergency aid bill, which also includes $62 million for El Salvador. The Administration has placed this bill on hold, while it seeks to persuade House Democratic leaders to change their minds on the Nicaraguan aid. **********Representative Edward P. Boland, Democrat of Massachussetts, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has expressed a willingness to compromise by providing $4 million to $6 million to ''wind down'' the United States covert involvement in Nicaragua. The Administration has thus far refused to accept any such compromise, however. **********On May 24, the House voted, 241 to 177, to reject the Administration's request for the $21 million to continue aiding the Nicaraguan guerrillas until Oct. 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year. That vote was the House's third party-line vote against United States involvement in the Nicaraguan fighting since last July and demonstrated that the House Democratic leaders were determined to end the covert aid. After that vote, the Administration sought to find ways to continue aiding the guerillas while lobbying Congress for more money in fiscal 1985. **********Anti-Sandinista guerrilla leaders in Honduras said last week that the Reagan Administration had assured continued support for their efforts to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government.

Shultz said today that the United States was ready to discuss a joint moratorium on tests of new space weapons with the Soviet Union, but he ruled out a Soviet proposal for a freeze of such tests in advance of actual negotiations. **********Previously, the Reagan Administration said it was willing to engage in talks with the Russians on curbing the militarization of outer space so long as there were no conditions. The United States had not specifically addressed itself publicly to the moratorium question. **********Mr. Shultz's remarks were apparently meant to convey an American readiness to discuss everything at the table, including a moratorium on future testing, but not to accept any Russian condition - in this case, a ban on tests while negotiations were taking place. The United States is expected to test an antisatellite weapon this fall. **********Soviet Made Offer in June **********In the Administration view, such a moratorium would be unverifiable, and would only play into Soviet hands by delaying an American program without any guarantee of results. **********Other State Department officials said the Russians have been told through diplomatic channels of the American willingness to talk about a freeze on testing of antisatellite weapons at an early stage in negotiations. The Administration, however, is firmly opposed, they said, to the moratorium proposed by Konstantin U. Chernenko, the Soviet leader. **********The Soviet Union proposed in June that the two sides hold talks in Vienna on Sept. 18 on ways of banning the militarization of outer space, and suggested a joint moratorium on space tests as a good-will gesture in advance of talks. The United States agreed to such talks, but, as Mr. Shultz repeated today, said they should also include ways of renewing the negotiations on medium-range and strategic arms. **********Moscow Questions U.S. Sincerity **********The American response led Moscow to say that the United States was not serious. After several public and private exchanges, both sides have seemed to accept the likelihood that there will be no negotiations in Vienna, at least before the November elections. But both sides have continued to say they favored talks and that the lack of progress in relations was due to the other. **********Appearing on the NBC News television program ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Shultz said there was no question that ties were ''cool,'' but he added, ''I don't think that the situation is dangerous, in a literal, military sense.'' **********''The President and all of us working with him have addressed ourselves to this relationship very hard for a very long time and continue to do so to be sure that we do everything possible to see that the relationship is a constructive one,'' he said. **********Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic candidate for the Presidency, said last week that, if elected, one of his first actions as President would be to call for a meeting with the Soviet leader to take place in six months and that he would announce a ''limited moratorium'' on development of new American weapons during that six-month period as an incentive for talks. **********Mr. Shultz, when asked about Mr. Mondale's plan, said: ''I don't think it's a good idea to suddenly turn back our own capability to be prepared and to deter. To stop your own capacity to be prepared and to deter aggression is just as reprehensible as not being prepared to engage in negotiations for peace.''  Meeting With Gromyko **********The Secretary said this did not mean he did not favor meetings with the Soviet leaders. He pointed out that he had one scheduled for Sept. 26 in New York with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko, who will be in New York for the regular fall session of the United Nations General Assembly. **********''The point is not to have meetings but to achieve something,'' he said, asserting that Mr. Reagan had achieved ''a great deal'' by building up American military strength, and having ''stopped'' the Soviet Union from moving into other countries. **********President Reagan, in an interview published in The Sunday Times of London, said his chief goal, if elected for a second term, would be ''the development of a better working relationship with the Soviet Union - one marked by greater cooperation and understanding and leading to stable, secure and peaceful relations.'' **********But a commentator for Tass, the Soviet press agency, said the President was trying ''to delude the world public.'' Anatoly Krasikov said relations between the two countries ''have dropped to the lowest point in their history.''  Question of Treaty Violation **********On the question of the space weapons negotiations, Mr. Shultz said the United States was ready to go to Vienna. He added, ''We think that one of the most threatening uses of outer space in a military way is the use of it for ballistic missiles to go through outer space and to hit other countries.'' **********''So we think it's important to discuss defensive and offensive systems that go through outer space and we said so,'' he said. ''But we're prepared to meet with the Soviet Union, in Vienna or elsewhere, with or without a prearranged agenda, and discuss the problems of outer space, including questions about a moratorium on testing, but not to do it before we have the meetings.'' **********At another point, he was asked if he agreed with a statement by Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, made in an interview on an NBC News documentary on space weapons, charging that the Soviet Union had violated the terms of the 1972 Soviet-American treaty limiting antiballistic missiles. The ABM treaty, as it is known, and since modified, allows each side up to 100 such missiles in one area. The Soviet Union has its site around Moscow; the United States has not deployed a system. **********''Yes, I do,'' he said. But then he seemed to modify his answer by saying, ''They are in the process of constructing a radar that we believe is a violation, if it is put into being, of the ABM treaty.'' **********''It is still under construction, and it has a long ways to go as far as we can see,'' he said. He said the United States had raised its concerns at the special channel provided for by the treaty.   Shultz Clarifies Statement **********Later, after the television show, Mr. Shultz said he had not meant to go further in his reply than the Administration had gone last January when it first publicized its findings. **********At that time, a senior State Department official said the Soviet construction of a so-called large phased array radar near Krasnoyarsk in the central Soviet Union ''is almost certainly a violation of a legal obligation the Soviet Union has assumed.'' **********The treaty bars construction of radars and other equipment that could enhance a country's defense against incoming missiles, except at its borders to serve as an early warning system."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/20/business/pilots-accept-eastern-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pilots Accept Eastern Plan", "print_headline": "Pilots Accept Eastern Plan", "body_text": " **********Eastern Airlines pilots ignored union leaders and approved a salary-for-stock swap that is the key to a $367 million bailout plan for the troubled carrier, a union vote count showed today. **********A preliminary count showed pilots voted 1,784 to 696 in favor of the proposal, which already had been approved by union machinists and flight attendants."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/14/business/union-carbide.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Union Carbide", "print_headline": "Union Carbide", "body_text": " **********The Union Carbide Corporation and Katalystiks International announced that they had signed a memorandum of understanding for the acquisition by the end of May of Katalystiks' fluid-cracking catalyst business by the Connecticut-based chemicals and plastics company.

Monetary officials said one problem was Nigeria's unwillingness to devalue its currency. **********The monetary fund, which is a 146- nation lending agency with headquarters in Washington, declined to comment on the situation. But officials familiar with its operations said it would wait until the new Government decides whether it wants to resume negotiations.    Funds Plays Pivotal Role **********The fund, which has played a pivotal role in the world debt crisis, lends to a host of poor countries, but only on condition that they take action to strengthen their economic performance. **********These include such measures as devaluation, the scaling back of imports, the phasing out of consumer subsidies for food, transportation and the like, the curbing of money supply growth and the freezing of wages. **********President Shehu Shagari of Nigeria, who won a second four-year term after elections last August, had only a fragile political consensus, according to specialists here. They said his political base had been maintained by handing out economic largesse to various tribes. **********Widespread reports of election irregularities in August may also have undermined his position. **********If a country accepts the prescriptions of the International Monetary Fund, the institution also helps to reschedule debts among commercial creditors. It has done this already for Brazil and Mexico. **********The fund requires that banks not only accept a new schedule of payments, but also put up new loans and reduce their interest rates. **********Nigeria's debt of $14 billion is mainly to British and American banks. Because of its formerly substantial oil revenues, Nigeria was considered eligible for commercial bank credits.    Close Links With Britain **********It maintains commercial and financial links with Britain as a former colony. Its ties to the Americans are reinforced by its position as the second largest foreign supplier of oil to the United States, after Saudi Arabia. **********Banking specialists here said it was unclear what would happen now with efforts to reschedule. Much will depend on the position taken by the new Government. **********If it decided to break off financial relations and default on loans, British and American banks would have to write off the debt and see their earnings decline. **********This comes at a time when bank earnings are already under some pressure because of financial difficulties in other foreign countries as well as bankruptcies in the United States. **********On the other hand, a default would hurt Nigeria by destroying its credit rating and ruling out new credits for financing food and other imports. **********Oil is the source of more than 90 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange. According to American analysts, oil revenues this year will be $10 billion, less than half of the $22.4 billion earned in 1980, when Nigeria produced an average of 2 million barrels a day. **********Oil production, now down to a little over 1 million barrels, has been hit both by the slack demand for oil and weakening price levels. **********The global recession has been an important background factor, reducing demand not only for oil, but for Nigeria's other exports, such as cocoa, palm products, rubber, timber and tin. **********Other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have also been forced to cut exports. Saudi Arabia, the biggest OPEC producer, now exports 3 million barrels daily, compared with more than 8 million at the peak of demand. **********The loss of oil revenue has affected Nigeria more than some of the other producers because of its large population, some 85 million people, compared with, say, 5 million in Saudi Arabia. **********Analysts said that $8 billion of foreign exchange reserves had been virtually wiped out before the Shagari Government went to the International Monetary Fund and its commercial creditors for help. **********Negotiations have been under way with a consortium of 26 banks to refinance about $1.5 billion of short- term debt falling due in 1983. In addition, Nigeria opened talks with suppliers of $4 billion to $5 billion of short-term trade credits."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/26/world/french-demonstrate-for-secular-schools.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "French Demonstrate For Secular Schools", "print_headline": "French Demonstrate For Secular Schools", "body_text": " **********Thousands of people demonstrated around France today in favor of a secular, state-run school system and against what many denounced as inadequate Government efforts to bring private schools under state control. **********In large cities and small towns around the country there were 90 marches. **********Organizers said the demonstration in Paris drew more than half a million people; Agence France-Presse estimated the crowd at more than 150,000. people.

The memory of the war is kept alive in art, literature, films and politics as well as in ceremonies that reach their high point each year at May 9 victory celebrations. **********But these remembrances also carry with them persisting bitterness against the German invaders and pride in the belief it was the Russians who held the final line against Hitler, and who suffered the most with an estimated total of 20 million dead. **********Mr. Mitterrand praised the bravery of Russian soldiers who, he said, ''decided the fate of the world'' in Stalingrad - fighting ''street by street, house by house, floor by floor.'' But he also noted that the largest toll of casualties in that battle was borne by the Germans, giving a figure of 150,000 dead.   Victims of a Suicidal System' **********''Let us not forget those soldiers who were then on the opposite side,'' he said, ''but with whom, as survivors, we have become reconciled - Germans, Rumanians, Italians, Hungarians - all those who suffered and fell on this soil far from their homes, absurd victims of a suicidal system.'' **********Mr. Mitterrand awarded Volgograd the Legion of Honor, pinning the medal to a scarlet flag held by Mayor Vladimir I. Atopov. **********He then visited a huge monument complex on Mamayev Hill, overlooking the Volga River. The hill was the site of the fiercest fighting in the Battle of Stalingrad, which went on from September 1942 until February 1943, when the German Sixth Army survivors, surrounded, starving and without ammunition or fuel, finally surrendered. **********The French leader took leave in Moscow from Konstantin U. Chernenko, the Soviet leader, and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko. **********Mr. Mitterrand spoke plainly in Moscow on sensitive subjects, including the plight of Andrei D. Sakharov, the exiled dissident; Afghanistan and Poland. However, the atmosphere of the visit remained cordial and both sides said they believed it had been useful. **********Mitterrand Is Praised **********PARIS, June 23 - The stepdaughter of Andrei D. Sakharov today praised President Francois Mitterrand for speaking up in Moscow this week on behalf of the exiled dissident physicist. But she said she still did not know whether Dr. Sakharov was alive. **********The stepdaughter, Tatyana Yankelevich, told a radio interviewer that although she had urged that President Mitterrand not make his trip to the Soviet Union, she now felt that there were positive results from the three- day visit, which ended today. **********Mrs. Yankelevich, the daughter of Miss Bonner, expressed concern about the fate of the couple because, she said, the Soviet authorities have not provided evidence they are indeed well."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/02/world/nato-issue-when-to-let-its-ships-fire.html": {"writer_name": "Drew Middleton", "pub_date": "1984-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 622, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NATO ISSUE: WHEN TO LET ITS SHIPS FIRE", "print_headline": "NATO ISSUE: WHEN TO LET ITS SHIPS FIRE", "body_text": " **********Military   Analysis **********The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's naval leaders are debating whether to change an element of the rules of engagement to permit NATO ships to open fire first if threatened, alliance officials say.  At present the alliance's ships are restricted to returning enemy fire, in keeping with NATO's defensive strategy. **********Alliance officials in the United States and at headquarters in Brussels emphasize that the present rules of engagement invite attack in an era of long-range, highly accurate missiles. One official said a naval commander is not now permitted to deploy his ships in combat formation until after he has been fired upon and is not allowed to order a pre-emptive strike. **********The alliance is divided over the question. Adm. William Stavely of Britain, the commander in chief for the English Channel, and Adm. Wesley McDonald, NATO's Supreme Atlantic Commander, are said to be pushing for a change in the engagement rules. Admiral McDonald said he did not wish to comment on the dispute. **********British and American officials are said to believe that the present rules make alliance fleets easy targets for a pre-emptive strike by Soviet missiles and bombers, which can attack from ''over the horizon'' ranges. **********West German, Canadian, Danish and Dutch naval leaders are said to oppose any change. Their argument is that firing the first shot would be a serious departure from alliance principles.   A Growing Uneasiness **********Behind the debate lies a growing uneasiness about the security of the North Atlantic sea lanes in any conflict with the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet Union's naval building program, intelligence officials say, suggests that sizable Soviet squadrons would be at sea at the outbreak of war and that they would not hesitate to fire on allied naval ships and merchantmen. **********Another suggestion being discussed in NATO is the creation in a crisis of ''Maritime Exclusion Zones'' comparable to the zone established by Britain in its campaign against Argentina in 1982. Once the zones were created and potential enemies notified, NATO ships would be free to fire on any hostile ship entering such a zone. **********A spokesman for the alliance's Military Committee said the American and British admirals had submitted the proposal for revising the rules of engagement. The next step, he said, would be staff consultations. Any revision adopted by the committee would require the approval of all NATO governments.   Might Take Months or Years **********Diplomats familiar with the problem say they are not optimistic. They suggest that in the present political environment in Western Europe, governments would be reluctant to approve any changes that might appear to indicate NATO aggressiveness. Unless the environment changes, they said, it might take months or years for some governments to act upon the proposal. **********These governments, the officials said, would probably cite the NATO policy announced at the alliance's 1982 meeting in Bonn that says, ''None of our weapons will ever be used except in response to attack.'' **********But the present debate, naval sources said, is not over giving a naval commander the right to instigate a war. Rather, he said, it is about precautionary measures, including ''first fire,'' that would enable a squadron commander to save his ships. Many naval officers, including some from countries opposed to any change in the rules, feel that under the present restrictions a NATO force could be destroyed ''before the commander knew hostilities had begun.'' **********Such an attack would be helped for Warsaw Pact navies by the constant shadowing of NATO naval forces by Soviet intelligence-gathering ships. These ships keep watch on all major NATO naval deployments and are on station off bases in Europe and North America."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/26/business/tax-exempt-issuers-in-rush.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1984-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1250, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TAX-EXEMPT ISSUERS IN RUSH", "print_headline": "TAX-EXEMPT ISSUERS IN RUSH", "body_text": " **********The Palm Beach County Solid Waste Authority was about to plunge into the bond market with a $320 million financing for a trash incinerator when the deal fell apart. **********Fuji Bank's decision on Dec. 7 not to back the bonds with its letter of credit could hardly have come at a worse time, according to Timothy F. Hunt, the authority's executive director. ''We are under a lot of pressure to sell these bonds before the end of the year, when new Federal laws come into effect,'' he said. **********Normally, a bank's backing out or a similar reversal would set back a bond sale by several weeks. But, feeling the pressure of the year-end deadline, the authority was back in the market in 10 days, after obtaining insurance for the issue from the Ambac Indemnity Corporation. **********The Florida county's experience was one of the more harrowing ones as dozens of offerings pushed into the tax-exempt market in recent weeks. They are all trying to get on the market before the Deficit Reduction Act, passed last July, imposes limits on the amount of tax-exempt bonds that state and local governments can issue to help finance projects of corporations or quasi-governmental agencies. **********The most important new restriction is on the amount of industrial development bonds that each state may issue. Another key provision would sharply reduce the profits municipal issuers could earn from investing the proceeds of bond sales in higher- yielding securities. **********The Treasury contends that tax-exempt industrial development bonds deprive the Federal Government of billions of dollars in revenue and unfairly subsidize some borrowers. **********Industrial development bonds are typically sold by a local government on behalf of a private company that will use the proceeds to build a new factory or warehouse. But the definition used by the Treasury includes financings for solid waste resource recovery plants, pollution control facilities and airports. **********The limitations are causing concern for those involved in financing local projects. Jim Caffrey, a spokesman for the Bergen County Utilities Authority in New Jersey, said, ''Under the Federal rule limiting each state's industrial development bond financings to $150 per person, we felt there wasn't any opportunity for us to get financing.'' **********Such worries have also fueled a surge in offerings. The volume of new tax-exempt bonds has been more than $11 billion in each of the last three months, up from a monthly average of about $6.2 billion in the first nine month of 1984. Bonds to finance resource recovery plants were in heaviest supply, with an estimated $2.5 billion of new issues sold in the last two months, or five times the amount sold in the previous five years. **********The flurry of activity has brought not only higher interest rates for some kinds of bonds, but also long hours for lawyers and financial advisers, delayed ratings on new issues, confusion among sales people and investors, and even a few typographical errors in normally letter-perfect bond- sale documents. **********'Pretty Hectic' **********''For a while things were pretty hectic,'' said John T. Feeny, president of Moore & Schley Municipals Inc. ''We got through the supply by putting extraordinarily attractive yields on bonds and selling them to institutions who just ate it up.'' **********In order for the market to digest the recent spate of new issues quickly, many of the offerings provide adjustable interest rates and allow investors to redeem the bonds instantly or with one week's notice. **********Those features helped open a new market for tax-exempts by attracting safety-conscious corporate treasurers with excess cash to invest. Even so, the glut was enough to cause interest rates to rise to about 6 3/4 percent from 5 3/4 percent in mid-November for bonds whose rate is adjusted weekly. **********Because of the Dec. 31 deadline for delivery of bonds, which marks the legal completion of a sale, securities firms are breaking the old rule of thumb that calls for bonds to be sold about two weeks before delivery. And the mechanics of putting out the documents for all these issues has become more complicated. **********''With modern technology and plants across the country, there is no real backlog in the printing of documents,'' said Roy A. Cardia, chief operating officer at the Sorg Printing Company, New York. ''But every surge in this business brings late- night sessions where the lawyers are writing and proofreading at the plant.'' **********Temporary Certificates **********While Mr. Cardia can print official statements quickly, there is a backlog for ornately engraved bonds. To complete new financings before the end of the year, securities dealers are using temporary bond certificates that will be replaced early next year. **********''We knew the supply was coming, but it has still been quite a crunch,'' said Freda S. Ackerman, head of the municipal bond rating department at Moody's Investors Service. ''Everyone may want to do their deal before the end of the year, but the issuers do not always have complete financial information, and that is usually the direct cause of a rating coming in late.'' **********For waste resource recovery plants, the rush to market was even more acute because they will need huge amounts of money; a new plant can cost upwards of $400 million to build. In the future, in order to get tax-exempt financing for such plants, local governments may have to own the facilities outright rather than build them for a private company to own and operate. **********Because construction on new resource recovery plants is not expected to begin for about two years, the recent bonds required special features to attract investors who are normally wary of projects using unfamiliar technology at a site still to be selected. Details vary from issue to issue, but generally the bonds are secured by an escrow account of Treasury securities until construction begins, when the bonds will be backed by the plant revenues. **********'Belts and Suspenders' **********Many issues also carry other guarantees for the preconstruction period. ''The market has seen an incredible variety of bonds supported by a lot of belts and suspenders,'' said J. Douglas Casey, national sales manager in the tax-exempt department at Kidder, Peabody & Company. **********A recent study by the National Governors Association concluded that the new limitations will force 14 states to curtail their offerings in 1985 to below their volume in 1983. **********Most states are setting up procedures that will allocate the allowed amount of financing among local governments and agencies. ''I expect there will be quite a bit of competition to get approval, and a lot of politics,'' said Morgan J. Murray, an executive vice president at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. **********Mr. Caffrey of the Bergen County Utilities Authority noted that the state Economic Development Authority could by itself use all of the $1.12 billion in financing that New Jersey will be allowed in 1985. He also said he found it ironic that some Federal agencies encourage development of waste recovery plants while the Treasury imposes regulations that make financing the facilities more difficult. **********The tax-exempt market also faces potential threats from the Treasury's tax revision proposals. For example, a little-noticed provision in the second volume of proposals disallows a tax exemption for bonds in which more than 1 percent of the proceeds are used by private business; that rule would have eliminated more than 60 percent of all tax-exempt bonds sold in 1983. **********''The Treasury Department has a long history of trying to curb the use of the tax-exempt market, and there is serious concern about the extent to which Congress will impose restrictions beyond those already in place'' said John Schopfer, vice president at Kidder, Peabody."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/28/business/vw-porsche-split.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VW-Porsche Split", "print_headline": "VW-Porsche Split", "body_text": " **********Volkswagen of America Inc., a subsidiary of Volkswagenwerk A.G., said it had been notified that Porsche will not renew its importer and license agreement with VW after Aug. 31.

It urges a modest, step-by-step approach in arms negotiations. **********Several commission members and people close to the commission said the commission'sintention in the report was to create more support for arms control in the center of the political spectrum and to free the arms control process from what they saw as the unrealistic demands of the left and right, particularly with the political pressures of a Presidential election year. **********The report questioned the Administration's heavy emphasis on seeking sharp reductions in nuclear arms and the idea of a nuclear freeze advanced by many Democrats. It concluded that increased strategic stability, ''if it can be achieved at all, will come only after extended and sustained effort over many years.''  General Principles Stressed **********The Commission did not make a particular new arms-control proposal but stressed general principles: step- by-step approaches that take both sides' interests into account, agreement on a way to measure and reduce the destructive potential of dissimiliar kinds of forces and less concern about seeking large arms reductions and more concern about limiting first- strike weapons. **********The report was made public by the White House on March 23.

Gen. Brent Scowcroft, retired, was formed in January 1983. A report was made public in April with full Administration support and news conferences, and Mr. Reagan publicly embraced its recommendations. **********That report insisted on a package of force modernization and arms control: Congressional support for deployment of the new MX missile; a new, mobile and small Midgetman missile, and Administration commitment to serious efforts in the Geneva arms control talks. The final report reaffirmed these positions but advanced a number of new points that have not been well received in the most conservative quarters of the Administration.   Warning on Missile Defense **********In particular, the commission warned the President to proceed with ''extreme caution'' in doing anything that might jeopardize the existing Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. This was intended by the commission and was taken by Administration officials to raise basic questions about Mr. Reagan's so-called ''Star Wars'' speech, in which he called for a program to develop new technology to protect the United States from incoming missiles. **********The report also warned against using current purported violations of arms limitation treaties by Moscow as an excuse to jettison arms control. The commission recommended maintaining ''a system of communication for review and correction of such incidents.'' **********Touching on the complexities of this matter, the commissioners noted: ''There may not always be available, however, effective responses proportionate to the violations themselves.'' According to several commission members, they were trying to say that no violations should be simply ignored or excused but that as a practical matter only continued serious violations should bring serious responses.   Answering Left and Right **********The report, according to some commission members, was addressed specifically to what they saw as a powerful group in the Administration opposed to arms control. To those who argue that the Soviet Union is trying to use arms control to lull the American people into a false sense of security and slow American military programs, the report retorted that the ''very fact of arms control negotiations also has utility,'' that ''arms control should be pursued because the peoples of the world expect it of their leaders'' and that ''careful definition and pursuit of realistic arms control measures'' should prevent Soviet manipulation. **********The commission's most critical comments, however, were reserved for liberal arms control advocates who, in the commission's judgment, make the mistake of believing that arms control can end the threat of nuclear war, reduce casualties and damage ''by itself'' should war occur, or open the door to ''deep or early cuts in defense budgets.'' **********In particular, the report condemned the nuclear freeze idea, which, it said, would be complicated to negotiate, would prevent force improvements that could increase nuclear stability and would do ''nothing to increase stability.'' A freeze, it stated, would also ''lock the United States into a permanent disadvantge in high-yield highly accurate missile warheads.''

CLINES **********WASHINGTON, May 15 - President Reagan and President Miguel de la Madrid of Mexico used a White House welcoming ceremony today to voice their disagreement over Central America. **********The Mexican President cautioned that the ''risk of a generalized war, the scope and duration of which no one can foresee,'' was growing in Central America. **********President Reagan, showing no less candor, told Mr. de la Madrid that ''responsible governments of this hemisphere cannot afford to close their eyes to what is happening or be lulled by unrealistic optimism'' in Central America. **********The flags of both nations snapped in a strong breeze outside the White House as the two leaders shook hands, surveyed the attendant array of diplomats and then punctuated what is normally a ceremony of gentle greeting with a blunt exchange of their differences. **********Reagan Picks Up on Theme **********Mr. Reagan was surprised at a welcoming ceremony in Mexico last August by President de la Madrid's caution about a show of force risking ''conflagration'' in the hemisphere, and he picked up on this theme as he greeted the Mexican President this morning on the South Lawn. **********''The conflagration in Central America appears too close to ignore,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''Like a fire in one's neighborhood, this threat should be of concern to every nation in the hemisphere.'' **********Mr. de la Madrid, in turn, after thanking Mr. Reagan for the ''cordial welcome,'' called on nations to reject ''interventionist solutions of any kind'' and to ''apply the principles and rules of international law established by the countries of the American continent.'' **********Disagreements Are Highlighted **********Their comments, although devoid of direct criticism, emphasized the two leaders' disagreement over Central America. The two Presidents then moved into a 45- minute private discussion that aides said afterward was largely taken up by the same question. A breakfast meeting was later scheduled for Thursday. On Wednesday, Mr. de la Madrid is to address a joint meeting of Congress.  Meanwhile, the White House announced today that President Reagan would meet Monday with Jose Napoleon Duarte, the President-elect of El Salvador. Mr. Duarte is also scheduled to meet with other Administration officials during the visit, which a White House statement described as having been arranged ''in order to carry forward U.S.-Salvadoran cooperation on bilateral and regional matters.'' **********The Reagan Administration has said it feels Mexico is underestimating the threat of what Mr. Reagan today termed a Soviet-backed ''totalitarian coalition'' undermining the hemisphere. **********Mexican officials, however, have questioned President Reagan's understanding of the historic forces of change in Latin America. Mexico has been friendly toward Cuba and Nicaragua and shown support for Salvadoran opposition groups. **********'Warmth and Good Will' **********On a personal level, the Mexican President praised the ''friendly and honorable dealings'' with Mr. Reagan and the support he extended to help Mexico deal with its debt problems. Mr. Reagan expressed ''warmth and good will'' in his welcome and praised ''the trust between us.'' **********''We do not agree on everything concerning this situation,'' Mr. Reagan said of Latin America, contending that the differences were not over ''goals or principles,'' but only over ''the means by which to achieve our goals.'' **********In denouncing ''aggressor regimes,'' he quoted Mr. de la Madrid's own book on constitutional law, saying, ''Liberty and equality are values incompatible with despotism.'' **********Mr. Reagan focused on what he called ''totalitarians'' who, he said, ''have been pouring gasoline onto the fire by pumping massive supplies of weapons into Central America and encouraging tyranny and aggression.'' He said this flow had been accompanied by ''thousands of Cuban and Soviet bloc military personnel'' in the region. **********Focuses on Need for Aid **********Mr. de la Madrid, although cautioning about the risk of widening war, focused on the need for social and economic development. ''Latin America is suffering the most severe economic crisis of modern times,'' he said. **********''Peace has been disrupted in Central America,'' Mr. de la Madrid said, ''and the risk of a generalized war, the scope and duration of which no one can foresee, is growing.  ''Every country on the continent,'' he said, ''must do its utmost to restore peace and avoid war by respecting and upholding the sovereignty of its people to decide their own destiny and by rejecting interventionist solutions of any kind.'' **********He added, ''Let us apply the principles and rules of international law established by the countries of the American continent: self-determination, nonintervention, equality of states before the law, peaceful solution of conflicts and international cooperation for development.'' **********Few Details on Private Talks **********Administration officials had few concrete details on the two leaders' private discussion. The White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, said he did not know whether they discussed such factors as the Administration's decision to suspend United States acceptance of World Court jurisdiction on Central American matters, the United States covert aid in the mining of Nicaraguan harbors and the Administration's warning that Cuba is planning a major offensive in the fall to try to topple the Salvadoran Government. **********Mr. Speakes said President Reagan expressed appreciation to Mr. de la Madrid for encouraging the Contadora group's peace efforts in the hemisphere. He said Mr. Reagan added that if the Contadora principles could be embodied in what Mr. Speakes termed a ''verifiable and enforceable'' agreement, then that would ''satisfy'' Nicaragua's neighbors and have the support of the United States. The Contadora group, comprising Mexico, Panama, Venezuela and Colombia, has been trying to negotiate a settlement of disputes in Central America."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/20/business/145-million-bond-sale-by-jersey.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "$145 Million Bond Sale by Jersey", "print_headline": "$145 Million Bond Sale by Jersey", "body_text": " **********A $145 million issue of New Jersey general obligation bonds was offered with yields ranging from 6.75 percent for bonds due in 1986 to 8.5 percent in 1994 and 9.30 percent in 2004 through underwriters led by Chase Manhattan. **********Proceeds of the bonds, rated Aaa by Moody's and AAA by S.& P., will be used for various programs, including correctional facilities, natural resource projects, land acquisition and water supply. **********Analysts at Prescott, Ball & Turben said the state's financial performance continued to improve, with an expected general fund balance of more than $507.9 million for the year ended June 30, 1984, up from $96.2 million in 1983.

Others, however, see the marketing costs needed to keep up with competition cutting into profit growth of the company, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif. **********''During the next eight quarters there should not be the surprises - both negative and positive - that they experienced in the last five quarters,'' said Adam F. Cuhney, electronics analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. **********After a disappointing 9 percent profit gain in the first fiscal quarter of 1984, Hewlett's per-share earnings in the second fiscal quarter, ended April 30, climbed 28 percent, to 55 cents a share. **********Analysts attribute this volatile earnings pattern, evident for the last two years, to the protracted recession, which significantly restricted management's ability to plan growth, manage assets and introduce key new products. They say that situation has ended and a period of improved production scheduling, easier inventory controls and rising backlogs is beginning. **********''Because of being totally dedicated to self-financing growth, Hewlett tends to have trouble adjusting to recovery business conditions,'' Mr. Cuhney said. ''They keep inventories tight and have a tremendous amount of production scheduling, and outlays for research and marketing.'' **********He said that in the last five quarters the company's gross profit margins had not varied by more than two-tenths to fourth-tenths of a percentage point, despite the fact that sales growth has varied from increases of 6 percent to 33 percent. ''Over the next two years,'' Mr. Cuhney went on, ''the company will better match dollar volume output to overhead expenditures.'' **********Some feel that Hewlett, which is shifting increasingly toward computers, has an identity crisis. ''For Hewlett to keep up with I.B.M. they're going to have to spend more money,'' said John Geraghty, electronics analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. He noted that the company had recently increased its television advertising substantially. **********''People previously thought of Hewlett as an instrument-based company selling to a select clientele,'' Mr. Geraghty said. ''Now we are thinking in terms of a large-scale manufacturing company selling standard products such as personal computers through standard retail outlets where they are not well known. ''This will cost them even more to make their presence felt.'' **********He said that Hewlett, always a big spender on marketing, would have to spend even more now to meet the new competition. The company's marketing budget, he said, averaged 15 1/2 percent of the sales dollar between 1972 and 1982, but it rose to 16.4 percent in 1983 and has been running above 18 percent through the first two fiscal quarters of 1984. **********''Over the longer term, because they are becoming involved in more direct product competition with I.B.M., the premium that they previously enjoyed will probably be reduced,'' Mr. Geraghty said. He feels that Hewlett stock is a good investment for the short term because it is near its 52- week low of $31.25 a share. It closed yesterday at $35.375, off 62 1/2 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********There are other bullish factors that analysts point to at Hewlett. Its soon-to-be-introduced top- of-the-line computer series code-named Spectrum is expected to have a major impact on dollar volume. Prices of the models will range from $30,000 to $500,000. The company's previous top-priced model cost $250,000. **********A second plus, analysts say, is the market courted by Hewlett. According to a recently released Dun & Bradstreet survey, the fastest growth for capital spending by far will be among small and medium-sized companies - those with fewer than 500 employees. Hewlett's base for the 3,000 minicomputer series - a key product - fits this market perfectly, they say. **********The survey shows that companies with 100 to 1,000 employees have a growth rate of 20 percent, while those with 5,000 or more have a growth of only 7 percent. **********A third positive factor, analysts say, is Hewlett's portable computer, which will sell for about $2,995 and will compete against comparable models from Sharp and Compaq. The overall market for the portable computer is projected at 200,000 units in 1984, 300,000 to 350,000 in 1985 and more than 500,000 in 1986. **********''We believe that the company can achieve a portable-computer market share of 25 percent or more over the next 12 months,'' said Mr. Cuhney of Salomon Brothers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/20/business/buyout-talks-seen-at-logan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 189, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Buyout Talks Seen at Logan", "print_headline": "Buyout Talks Seen at Logan", "body_text": " **********Jonathan Logan Inc., one of the apparel industry's largest producers, has scheduled a special board meeting today to consider a leveraged buyout of the company at $32 a share, according to Wall Street sources.

In addition to the usual **********heartache of a marital breakup, the unwary may now find that the Government will take a much larger share of alimony payments than they originally anticipated, and may even be able to assess tax retroactively, years after a split-up. **********The Tax Reform Act of 1984 makes changes in three key areas: alimony, property transfers and dependency exemptions. The law will finally remove a major obstacle to property settlements that often meant husbands were saddled with a large capital gains tax on property that they transferred to their ex-wives as part of the settlement. And it will simplify the wrangling over which parent gets the dependency exemption for any children. **********But it may have some unintended negative consequences regarding alimony payments. ''It will change the whole economics of divorce,'' said Steven D. Kittrell, a partner in O'Connell & Kittrell, a Washington law firm specializing in divorce tax. ''There's just not going to be as much money to go around, because Uncle Sam will be taking more out of every payment.'' **********The basic rule, that alimony payments can be claimed as a tax deduction by the person making the payments (usually the husband) but must be reported as taxable income by the person receiving the payments (usually the wife), remains the same. But almost everything else has changed. **********Under the old rules, payments not designated as child support were considered alimony. But now, any portion of payments linked to a child is disqualified as alimony. For example, if an agreement specifies that alimony payments will drop by $100 a month once a child reaches age 18, $100 a month of the payments will now be considered child support (which is nondeductible by the husband and nontaxable to the wife) instead of alimony. The result is that husbands will be much less inclined to give generous child support payments and place more of the burden on the wife. ''People who are now on the margins may not be able to come up with the money,'' Mr. Kittrell said. **********Moreover, to qualify for the deduction, alimony payments in excess of $10,000 a year must last for at least six years, and they cannot vary by more than $10,000. If they fluctuate by more than that, they are subject to ''recapture'' - a new divorce tax concept introduced by the act. Recapture means that the Internal Revenue Service can go back and tax the early payments that qualify as alimony. The aim of these changes was to prevent large up-front payments that are really property settlements from being disguised and deducted as alimony. **********For example, if a husband makes payments of $25,000 in the first year and $12,000 in the second, then $3,000 (the difference of $13,000 minus $10,000) will be ''recaptured.'' The impact will be to treat excess payments in the first year as income to the husband and as a deduction for the wife. **********Mr. Kittrell, chairman of an American Bar Association committee that studied the problem, said that most matrimonial attorneys he has spoken with oppose the wide sweep of the new law. ''They are angered that Congress has intruded so much on what had been a state jurisdiction.'' **********Sandra K. Lewis, an editor specializing in divorce taxation with Prentice-Hall Inc., a publisher of tax material, said some people may wish to establish alimony trusts as a way to sidestep the onerous new alimony provisions. ''Trusts get you out from the recapture rules, and also allow for payments over shorter periods than six years,'' she said. **********The new law will also give the I.R.S. the wherewithal to track down women who have been receiving alimony payments, but have not been reporting the income on their tax returns. Now, men paying alimony must also furnish the Social Security numbers of their ex-wives. **********THE good news, however, in the 1984 tax law is **********that for the first time, spouses receiving alimony payments can treat them as compensation for purposes of an Individual Retirement Account. The maximum contribution is 100 percent of compensation or $2,000, whichever is less. Under the old law, alimony could be applied toward an I.R.A. only in very limited situations, and the maximum contribution was $1,125. **********The new law will also scuttle old treatment of property transfers connected with divorce. Under prior law, a husband who transferred appreciated property, such as the family home, to his wife as part of the divorce settlement was liable for capital gains tax on the increase in the property's value; the transaction was treated as a sale, even though the husband received no cash. Under the new law, property transfers from one spouse to another are considered nontaxable transactions. But the spouse receiving the property (usually the wife) now assumes the original tax cost of the property, and if she turns around and sells it the next day at a profit, then she must pay tax on the capital gain. **********''The planning for divorce transfers is now similar to the planning for gifts,'' said Sidney Kess, director of tax planning and policy with the accounting firm of Main Hurdman. ''In general, the strategy for the party who is making the transfer is to give property with a low basis and high value to the other spouse.'' **********The new property settlement rules went into effect on July 18, and the new alimony rules go into effect on Jan. 1, 1985. But people who are divorced or who reach property or alimony settlements in 1984 have the option of using the old or the new rules, whichever are more beneficial, providing both spouses agree. However, the new requirement for Social Security numbers applies regardless of whether the recipient is receiving alimony under the old or new rules. **********The new law also simplifies the rules about dependency exemptions. Starting Jan. 1, 1985, the parent who has custody of the child will get the $1,000 exemption, regardless of how much or how little that parent contributes financially to the child's support. The only time the custodial parent will not get the exemption is if he or she signs a written declaration waiving that right. **********The decision about who gets the dependency exemption ''can be changed on a year-to-year basis, depending on who needs the exemption most that year,'' said Paul W. Eldridge, a tax supervisor with the accounting firm of Ernst & Whinney.  Furthermore, he said, both parents can now claim a medical deduction for any medical expenditures they make on the child's behalf, as long as each parent's payments exceed the floor of 5 percent of their adjusted gross income. Previously, only the parent with the dependency exemption was able to claim a medical deduction for the child."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/14/business/ford-earns-a-record-781-million.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1984-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 725, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FORD EARNS A RECORD $781 MILLION", "print_headline": "FORD EARNS A RECORD $781 MILLION", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company today announced a record profit of $781 million, or $4.29 a share, in the fourth quarter, in contrast to a loss of $236 million a year earlier. The previous record earnings were $595 million in the first quarter of 1979. **********Sales for the quarter were up 34.8 percent, to $12.4 billion, from $9.2 billion in the same period in 1982. **********For the full year, aided by tax credits from past losses, Ford posted earnings of $1.87 billion, or $10.29 a share, in contrast to a loss of $657.8 million in 1982. The annual profit was also a record for the No. 2 auto maker, exceeding the $1.67 billion earned in 1977. **********Several Reasons Are Cited **********Philip Caldwell, chairman, said the surge in profitability ''was made possible by a combination of higher industry sales, a strong reception of our new cars and trucks and the cumulative effect of several years of productivity improvement and restructuring actions.'' **********Industry analysts have noted, however, that restraints on the import of Japanese cars have shifted some demand to domestic cars and permitted substantial effective price increases by permitting the ending of rebates and other sales incentives. **********The Ford report follows record earnings of $3.73 billion in 1983 posted by the General Motors Corporation and helps confirm projections that 1983 was a banner year for the domestic auto industry. When the Chrysler Corporation reports, as expected, next week, the Big Three should show combined profits in excess of $6 billion. **********According to the company's financial statements, Ford only paid $270.2 million in taxes for 1983, all of it on income earned overseas. Its earnings in the United States were not subject to income taxes because of losses sustained in previous years. If normal taxes had been paid, Donald Healy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert, estimated, the 1983 profit would have totalled only about $1.22 billion. **********''Nevertheless, it's quite a turnaround, particularly in North America,'' Mr. Healy observed. ''Their operating margins are strong and they've picked up some market share.'' **********Ford's losses from 1980 through 1982 totaled $2.2 billion, primarily on operations in the United States, Canada and Mexico. **********Year's Sales Rise by 19.8% **********Sales for the year were up 19.8 percent, to $44.4 billion, from $37.1 billion in 1982. Unit sales during 1983 reached 5,002,000 cars, trucks and tractors, a 15 percent increase. The greater increase in dollar sales over unit sales reflects the higher effective prices of the company's products and increased consumer interest in larger, more expensive cars. **********In 1983, Ford's net income in the United States totaled $1.52 billion, compared with a loss of $1.1 million in 1982. The company said lower marketing costs were a factor in the recovery, along with increased sales volumes, greater market share and ''a more profitable sales mix.'' **********Outside the United States, the company reported a profit of $351 million, a decline of $109 million, which Ford attributed to the adverse efects of foreign exchange translations in Europe and Latin America and the costs of closing some overseas plants. **********As with G.M., the sizable 1983 earnings will mean good news to Ford employees, who will receive $69 million in profit sharing, or about $440 each. It will also be worthwhile for the 6,200 executives on the bonus roll, who will share a pool of $83 million. Like his counterpart at G.M., Roger B. Smith, it is expected within the industry that Mr. Caldwell's total compensation for the year will exceed $1 million. **********Mr. Caldwell noted that the profit sharing only applied to the 66 percent of the company's operations that are in the United States, while the bonuses will be paid to Ford executives worldwide. **********Stephen P. Yokich, the head of the United Automobile Workers union's Ford department, said in a statement that the company's earnings should strengthen its ''ability to continue moderation in the prices of Ford products for the benefit of consumers, while equitably sharing its economic progress with workers.'' **********But he said he was ''concered that there is a wide gulf between the amount earned by workers and the amounts paid to company executives.''

Some have recently been introduced; others are just coming to market. Indeed, research now being done may make hay fever a malady of the past. Among the companies involved are Merrell Dow, Fisons, Key Pharmaceuticals, and Johnson & Johnson. **********''The basic information on allergies has just burgeoned,'' said Dr. Jordan N. Fink, president of the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology. Many drug companies are developing products for the large international market. **********The benefits span nearly every business: Figures from various Federal agencies indicate that five million workdays a year - worth more than $300 million - are lost by hay fever sufferers in the United States alone, not counting the lower productivity caused by working in discomfort. **********''Hay fever'' is a misnomer. It does not come from hay and causes no fever. The name was coined 150 years ago in Britain, when people associated the runny nose and congestion - symptoms of fever - with the fall hay harvest. Instead, hay fever stems from a complex chemical reaction of the immune system of some people to proteins in pollen released from trees, grasses, weeds and fungi and breathed in from spring to fall. The condition is called ''allergic rhinitis,'' meaning an inflammation of the nose from an allergy.  In most people, pollen proteins are destroyed by the body's defense mechanisms. But hay fever sufferers have an inherited tendency not to destroy the pollen proteins but instead to produce another protein, called immunoglobin E, or IGE, in response. Both the hay fever proteins and the IGE attach themselves to certain body cells called ''mast cells.'' These cells then emit the chemicals that cause runny nose and other allergic irritation. The best-known chemical is histamine, but there are perhaps 10 others. **********Ragweed, which releases pollen in August and September, is the most common cause of American hay fever. It is most severe when heavy spring and summer rains spur ragweed growth and then dry, windy weather spreads the pollen. This year is a little worse than average in the New York area, said Dr. William I. Weiss, chief allergist at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J., and developer of a regional pollen tracking system. **********The first defense against hay fever, medical experts say, is avoidance: staying in an air-conditioned room on bad days or far from sources. Mostly, avoidance is expensive and inconvenient. ''I finally found a case of a woman who goes to Europe every ragweed season,'' said Dr. Dorothy Sgon, allergy and clinical immunology chief at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. There is virtually no ragweed in Europe, although other plants cause hay fever. **********The next defenses are antihistamines - which block the irritation caused by histamines - or decongestants, which reduce inflammation, itching and runny nose. But antihistamines traditionally cause drowsiness as well, and decongestants are progressively less effective after a few days. **********An alternative, oral steroids, also eases hay fever symptoms, but can produce side effects such as higher blood pressure, more facial hair and thinning of bones. None of these drugs stops production of the irritating chemicals. **********Immunization is considered the most effective because it attacks the causes of hay fever. It works somewhat like a vaccine: Pollen proteins are injected and the body gradually becomes immune. Less IGE, histamine and other irritants are produced. **********The problem is that the injected pollen proteins can cause a major allergic reaction, so the process must start with very low doses and gradually be increased. Many dozens of shots are often required over several years: It is costly and can be painful. **********Against this backdrop, research has mushroomed. ''Every company that puts out an antihistamine is involved in new research,'' said Dr. Lynn Britton of Schering-Plough in Kenilworth, N.J. One new product Schering sells is Vancenase, a steroid sprayed into the nose. It acts locally, not systemically, reducing hay fever symptoms without the side effects. Syntex Laboratories of Palo Alto, Calif., has developed a similar product called Nasilide. **********The first antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness have recently been developed. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Cincinnati began selling Seldane in Europe in late 1981 and in Canada in May 1983; the company hopes to begin American sales early next year. Janssen Pharmaceutica, a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary, introduced Hismanal in Britain last year and is testing to obtain Federal approval for American sales. **********The Fisons Corporation of Bedford, Mass., last year introduced chromolyn sodium, which inhibits production of histamine and related chemicals that cause hay fever. It is sold as Nasalcrom, a nasal spray. **********Research sponsored by Key Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Miami has resulted in a new type of immunization that reduces the number of injections to 12 to 15 by linking hay fever proteins together in polymers. The system, developed by Dr. Roy Patterson, allergy chief at the Northwestern University Medical School, awaits Federal approval. **********Dr. Robert E. Reisman of the State University of New York at Buffalo is testing the same basic substance as a nasal spray. At the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Dr. Lawrence M. Lichtenstein and associates are studying other bodily substances that cause hay fever, hoping to more clearly describe the basic process so the malady can be completely neutralized. **********One thing is clear, medical experts say. As Dr. Fink put it: ''Today we can do a lot about hay fever; next year we'll do even more.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/15/business/bell-atlantic.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bell Atlantic", "print_headline": "Bell Atlantic", "body_text": " **********The Bell Atlantic Telephone Companies have agreed to process equipment service orders, both from their own affiliates and from independent vendors, through a single entity, the North American Telecommunications Association said.

The coalition, which is regarded as the political arm of the Basque separatist organization E.T.A. and which campaigned under the slogan ''Punish with your vote,'' came in third. **********These elections, the second regional voting in the Basque area since the area won home rule in 1979, were to expand the regional Parliament from 60 members to 75 with a change in boundaries. The Socialists' gains will affect the Basque Nationalist Party's ability to pursue its goal of securing more powers for the autonomous region.   Relations With Madrid **********It will also change the equation in the often troubled relations between the Basque Government and the central Government. Carlos Garaikoetxea, the 45-year-old Basque Nationalist Party leader who will undoubtedly continue as the region's President, may have to seek more compromise than he would like with the regional Socialists, who are tied directly to Madrid. **********In the outgoing regional Parliament, which was seated four years ago, the Basque Nationalist Party had 25 of the 60 seats but governed with an effective majority because Herri Batasuna, which regards the Parliament as a tame organization under Madrid's domination, refused to take its 11 seats. **********Herri Batasuna has said it will continue the boycott, but even so the Socialists gained enough seats - making deeper inroads than any national party ever in the fiercely nationalistic region - to hold the Basque Nationalists' margin down. **********With over 97 per cent of the vote counted, the Basque Nationalist Party had won 32 seats, the Socialists 19, Herri Batasuna 11, the right-wing Popular Coalition 7, and the leftist, pacifist Euskadiko Ezqurra 6.   Socialists Gain 10 Seats **********In the outgoing Parliament, the Socialists had nine seats. Their rise was seen in part as a reaction to the continuing terrorist violence. Their slogan was simple: ''For peace.'' **********Despite bad weather, with rain over much of the area and snow in the mountains, the turnout among the 1.5 million eligible voters was high, over 68 percent. Security was tight during the balloting, with some 5,000 police stationed near voting areas, but no major incidents were reported. **********Terrorist violence overshadowed the two-week election campaign, which opened and closed with the funerals of victims. **********On the weekend of Feb. 12, police battled Basque separatists who were protesting the killing of suspected E.T.A. members just across the French border by a shadowy right-wing death squad, that calls itself G.A.L., or Anti- terrorist Liberation Groups, and professes to oppose terrorism by Basque separatists.   Riots Follow Killing **********On Saturday, which was supposed to be a ''day of reflection,'' police and demonstrators clashed once again in the streets of San Sebastian, the resort capital of Guipuzcoa province. Youths there overturned and set fire to buses in anger over the most recent G.A.L. assassination, only the day before. **********In a call to the Spanish news agency EFE, G.A.L. claimed to have assassinated Eugenio Gutierrez Salazar, a 30- year-old Basque exile nicknamed ''The Tiger,'' who was thought to be a member of E.T.A. Gunmen shot him Friday from a passing car in the French village of Idaux Mendy. The slaying was the fifth claimed by G.A.L., which has vowed to avenge E.T.A. killings one for one, since the group emerged in December. **********Major parties suspended campaigning in shock and anger over the assassination Thursday of Enrique Casas Vila, a prominent Socialist and senator who was heading the ticket in Guipuzcoa. His death, which was thought to have triggered the G.A.L. reprisal, brought a 24-hour protest strike and highlighted the issue of violence as never before, since he was the first member of Parliament to fall under an assassin's bullet since democracy was restored eight years ago. **********Mr. Casas's funeral, attended by the Socialist Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, turned into an emotional and gloomy demonstration against terrorism, with thousands lining the narrow streets chanting ''E.T.A. assassins'' as the cortege passed.   Anarchist Splinter Group **********The most active, hard-line group of ETA, the ''military'' faction, denied having anything to do with the Casas killing. An anarchist splinter group called the Autonomous Anticapitalist Commandos, whose relationship to the militant wing is not altogether clear, claimed responsibility. **********The effects of the continuing violence, which was perhaps not more widespread than usual but may have been more horrifying because it occurred during an exercise of democracy, were evident in final statements from the parties and in remarks by candidates as they voted. **********''The cycle of death and violence is leading us to a dead end and supports the enemies of liberty who want to push this country into the brink of disaster,'' the Basque Nationalist Party said in a statement. **********Jose Maria Benegas, the Socialist contender for presidency of the regional Government, said, ''All I feel is that at the end of the campaign we've had a climate of terrible violence.''  Socialists' Strength **********The Socialists had been looking to a large turnout to help them consolidate and expand the gains they won in the general elections of October 1982, which swept them into control of the central Government in Madrid. In that year, in the Basque region, they for the first time surpassed Herri Batasuna to become the No. 2 party, behind the Basque Nationalist Party. Nearly half the region's three million people are non-Basques. **********The campaign was marked by bitter exchanges between the Basque Nationalists and the Socialists, which even descended to the level of personal insults. Mr. Garaikoetxea centered his re-election bid on the theme that the region must be given more powers under autonomy statutes negotiated in 1979, arguing that only this could make for an effective, local administration that would undermine support for E.T.A. **********He attacked the Socialists, both in Madrid and locally, for ''foot dragging'' in the complicated devolution of powers over everything from taxation to education and police. **********The Socialists, who have turned toward more effective police measures and cooperation with France to defeat E.T.A., have on occasion hinted that the Basque Nationalist Party is using E.T.A. as a tool to secure more autonomy. Mr. Benegas has argued that a Socialist government in the Basque region would have more success in drawing powers from a Socialist government in Madrid. **********The autonomy debate overshadowed the issue of unemployment in the heavily industrialized area centered in Bilbao, which is running 2.5 percent higher than the national average of 17 percent. The central Government's plans for ''industrial conversion,'' to share down industries to make them competitive with those in Common Market countries, has a deep bite on the Basque steel industry."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/17/world/kadar-doubts-soviet-power-struggle.html": {"writer_name": "John Vinocur", "pub_date": "1984-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 457, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KADAR DOUBTS SOVIET POWER STRUGGLE", "print_headline": "KADAR DOUBTS SOVIET POWER STRUGGLE", "body_text": " **********Janos Kadar, the Hungarian leader, said today that there was no leadership crisis in Moscow and that the Soviet Union was under ''collective, collegial'' control. **********His remarks came at joint news conference here with President Francois Mitterrand.

Rather, he said, there is a ''collective, collegial leadership.'' **********Mr. Kadar's two days of meetings with Mr. Mitterrand were low-key. French officials, in contrast to the West German Government's attitude toward Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conversations with Mr. Ceausescu, made no effort to present the visit by Mr. Kadar as a major event. The reason is that a wide consensus, including both the right-wing opposition and Mr. Mitterrand's Socialist Party, appears to share the assessment that, for all its difficulties, the East-West relationship is not in a critical phase. **********As if to emphasize the French perception, the room in Elysee Palace where the news conference was held was only half-full. The French press has given little attention to Mr. Kadar's visit.   Kadar Calls Visit Meaningful **********The Hungarian leader described his meetings with Mr. Mitterrand as meaningful within the context of East- West relations. In reply to a question about the significance of his visit to France, after the cancellation of planned trips to West Germany by Erich Honecker of East Germany and by Todor Zhivkov of Bulgaria, Mr. Kadar replied: **********''Without trying to exaggerate, I think the talks here have a certain importance.'' **********He said he felt he and Mr. Mitterrand had found some areas of common language that could serve as an example to others.  The two men stressed the importance of resuming arms talks and reducing what Mr. Mitterrand referred to as ''overarmament.'' He said, ''We know that the negotiations must start again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/14/business/jan-1-10-car-sales-rose-31.8.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 483, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAN. 1-10 CAR SALES ROSE 31.8%", "print_headline": "JAN. 1-10 CAR SALES ROSE 31.8%", "body_text": " **********The nation's six major automobile manufacturers today reported a 31.8 percent gain in car sales in the first 10 days of the year, from the corresponding period a year earlier.

Marcos, the biggest construction venture of them all has been a $2 billion nuclear power plant here on Bataan Peninsula, overlooking the South China Sea. **********With completion near, the plant has become a hotly contested issue, uniting opponents of the Government with opponents of nuclear power. **********Moreover, it has become the focal point for a rethinking of the development strategy pursued during Mr. Marcos's 19-year rule. Much of the strategy emphasized large industrial projects that were costly, employed few and relied on sophisticated technology. **********The Government itself, faced with a faltering economy and an inability to keep up on foreign debts, is joining in the re-examination. It is shifting from industrial projects toward export-earning agricultural development, which provides more jobs and consumes less capital. **********And the international lending organizations and overseas banks are also back-to-the-farm enthusiasts. **********A Westinghouse Plant **********Still, the policy change does not alter the fact that the Philippines has huge amounts of money sunk into some big industrial projects, especially the nuclear plant, which was supplied by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. **********The price tag on the Bataan plant is more than three times the $650 million standby credit that the Government says it will obtain from the International Monetary Fund. Looked at another way, the cost amounts to nearly 10 percent of the nation's foreign debt of $25.6 billion. **********Geronimo Z. Velasco, the Minister of Energy, says he has no doubts about the safety of the Bataan plant. ''But for a developing country like the Philippines, I question the wisdom of building a costly nuclear plant,'' said Mr. Velasco, who is also chairman of the National Power Corporation. **********The Philippines is among the poorest of the 22 countries that have chosen nuclear power. Those poorer, such as India, tend to be nations that are believed to have experience with nuclear technology through weapons development. **********Handling an Emergency **********The three East Asian countries that have taken the nuclear path - Japan, Taiwan and South Korea - are far more advanced than the Philippines. Much of the argument against operating the plant, despite all the money spent, is that the Philippines does not have the skill to handle an emergency, should one arise. **********Among those opposed to the plant are some who would oppose anything the Government does, and others convinced that nuclear technology is dangerous under any circumstances. But many others simply question whether a country where the telephones and lights often do not work, where the water service is intermittently shut off, is an appropriate place for a nuclear plant. **********''This Government cannot provide its people with the most basic services reliably,'' says Salvador H. Laurel, president of the United Nationalist Independent Democratic Organization, which includes the main opposition parties. ''So we can't risk letting it try to run something so delicate as a nuclear plant.'' **********For their part, Westinghouse officials in the Philippines say that the plant is safe and that the Filipino operators are proficient. As of late August, the National Power Corporation said it had 35 engineers who had passed a course in the United States similar to that administered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Only 24 certified operators are required to run the plant. **********''We think the Filipino operators here definitely have the capability to run this plant safely,'' said M. W. Walcher, vice president for the Westinghouse International Projects Company. **********Last May, the plant was tested by bringing it up to normal operating temperature and pressure, but using electrical energy instead of nuclear power. It was done efficiently, with no significant problems, according to Mr. Walcher, who said it compared favorably with similar tests in other countries. **********A Product of the Oil Embargo **********The decision to buy a nuclear plant was made in 1974, after the Arab oil embargo and at a time when the Philippines got 96 percent of its energy from imported oil. But since the ground breaking in 1976, the plant has been plagued by cost overruns, delays caused by safety questions and charges of improper payments. **********Meanwhile, largely because of its successful geothermal program, the nation's dependence on imported oil has fallen to 57 percent this year. ''If we knew in 1974 what we know now, we never would have gone ahead with the nuclear plant,'' Mr. Velasco says. **********The plant is intended to supply 15 percent of the power on the nation's most populous island, Luzon. That is the equivalent of six million barrels of oil worth roughly $180 million a year. **********But if the plant never opens, the Philippines would still bear a net cost of $155 million a year, considering interest expenses and other factors. **********Last month, groups against the Bataan plant filed suit with the Supreme Court, calling for public hearings on its safety and cost before the National Power Corporation is licensed to operate it. **********And recently President Marcos directed the Philippine Atomic Energy Commission to investigate the safety of the plant once again."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/06/business/d-h-line-sold.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "D.& H.

The consensus among many professional bond managers is that interest rates will move upward in early 1985 and the bond market will sag. As a result, some managers have shortened the average maturity of their holdings, while others plan to do so in coming weeks and some have sold off holdings and have moved into short-term instruments like Treasury bills and commercial paper. **********These investors are troubled by the recent indications that the economy is stronger than previously thought. They think that the strong economy, coupled with continued credit demands, will heat up inflation and cause interest rates to rise. ''We think the bond rally is about over with,'' said William H. Gross, managing director of the Pacific Investment Management Company in Newport Beach, Calif. ''There is no more juice that the Fed can safely allow to flow into the marketplace.'' **********Of course, it should be noted that many bond managers were asleep at the switch when the bond market burst open last summer. Consequently, they have been as unable to beat their market proxy - the Shearson Lehman Brothers Index - just as their colleagues who specialize in buying stocks have been unable to beat the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index. **********According to S.E.I. Funds Evaluation Services, a Chicago firm that measures 5,300 stock and bond portfolios, only 26 percent of the nation's bond managers beat the Shearson Lehman Index for the first nine months of this year. The median bond fund was up 6.1 percent compared with the 7 percent rise of the Shearson Index for the first three quarters. In a typical comment about this year's bond rally, George Collins, president of T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, which had only 70 percent of its accounts in cash instruments before the rally, said: ''We were non-believers of this whole market.'' **********Nevertheless, many of these professionals are now cautious about the market. One bond firm which has attracted almost $8 billion in institutional funds in recent years is Pacific Investment. According to Mr. Gross, his firm has some $2.5 billion set aside in cash instruments. And in the next few weeks, the firm's managers will be shortening the average maturity of the issues in the client portfolios from 10 years to seven or eight years, he added. (Since when interest rates climb the value of bonds fall, traders, in anticipation of higher rates, tend to sell off their longer holdings, thereby reducing the average maturity.) **********Likewise at the Marine Midland Bank, Wayne Wong, senior vice president and head of the bank's $2 billion fixed-income trust department, reported that he had lowered the average maturity of his holdings from 15 1/2 years to 10 1/2 years. ''We feel rates have pretty much hit bottom,'' he said. About 28 percent of Mr. Wong's portfolios are now parked in cash. And if the market continues to rally, Mr. Wong plans to sell some of his intermediate bonds and go into two- or three-year issues rather than 7- to 10-year bonds. **********At T. Rowe Price, which manages more than $9 billion in fixed income accounts, Mr. Collins said that the average maturity in client portfolios is now 13 years. To lower that to 10 years, he said that the firm's managers will sell some of their 25-year bonds and buy 3- and 4-year issues. ''If you get a discount rate cut, the market could perform well for a week or two,'' he said. But after that, the reporting of strong economic numbers and the pressure to reduce the budget could ''weaken the market,'' he added. **********Of course, there are those who disagree and have put almost all of their clients' assets in long-term issues, primarily Treasury Bonds. One who has been extremely successful this year is S.T.W. Fixed Income Management in Santa Barbara. Its institutional accounts are up 15 percent through November. According to Billy H. Williams, a principal of the firm, almost all of his clients' portfolios are invested in long-term Treasuries issues. ''It looks to me like interest rates are pretty high at 11 1/2 percent,'' he said, explaining his investment posture. ''Inflation is a lot lower than 11 1/2 percent so they seem like a good thing to invest in.'' **********Mr. Williams said that in making investment decisions he does not forecast interest rates or try to determine the direction of the bond market. He said that he simply tries to find the cheapest bonds available and sell them when they no longer seem cheap. Like others, he doubts that anyone could forecast rates. If people actually had that predictive ability they could invest their own assets, Mr. Williams noted, and their ''wealth would be so great that I'd doubt that they'd be managing other people's portfolios. They could have purchased several small countries and be kings instead of money managers.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/24/world/around-the-world-philippine-judge-orders-recess-in-ambush-trial.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Philippine Judge Orders Recess in Ambush Trial", "print_headline": "Around the World; Philippine Judge Orders Recess in Ambush Trial", "body_text": " **********A judge today ordered a week-long recess in the trial of nine churchmen, including three priests, accused of ambushing and killing a mayor and four aides in 1982. **********The nine assert that the military trumped up the charges because they had been organizing farm workers to resist abuses by soldiers and rich sugar planters. **********Prosecutors asked that today's session be canceled because they had other cases that needed attention. **********More than 200 people, including representatives of the Australian and Irish Governments, Catholic bishops and two dozen reporters and cameramen, jammed into the courtroom. **********The Rev.

The 1984 political campaign appears to be driving the candidates further and further apart on how to deal with the looming budget deficits, which the Democratic challenger, Walter F. Mondale, has sought to make the key economic issue of the election. **********During Sunday night's televised debate, Mr. Mondale said that a re-elected Mr. Reagan would have to propose a tax increase. Mr. Reagan, in response, declared that he would not raise taxes. **********Asked by a reporter whether he intended to stand by that statement or qualify it as in the past by saying he would raise taxes only as a ''last resort,'' Mr. Reagan indicated the latter and then defined what he meant by ''last resort.'' **********He said it would require two conditions: (1) if further spending cuts meant the Government would no longer be performing some vital services; (2) if economic growth was providing the ultimate in revenues and still did not catch up with slower-rising spending. But Mr. Reagan said he did not foresee those things happening and therefore was confident he would not seek a tax increase. **********While the Presidential candidates are being driven apart by the combat of the campaign - ''politics ain't beanbag,'' as an old dictum has it, and a Presidential debate is not an economics seminar - a less-noticed consensus seems to be forming among other Republican and Democratic leaders on what to do about the tax system. **********Two potential Presidential contenders for 1988, Representative Jack Kemp, the upstate New York Republican, and Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat, have both introduced bills that would broaden the tax base and reduce tax rates as the key to providing the nation with a tax system that would be more likely to sustain economic growth and to be simpler and fairer. **********The bills differ in their details, but both amount to modified flat-tax proposals. Mr. Kemp is proposing a flat tax of 25 percent, after creating a floor for lower-income taxpayers. Similarly, Mr. Bradley would bring down tax rates to a three-step structure rising from 16 percent at the bottom to 30 percent at the top. **********In their discussion about taxes in The New York Times of Oct. 2 last year, Mr. Kemp, co-author of the Kemp-Kasten ''FAST'' tax bill - FAST being an acronym for fair and simple tax - warmly embraced the Bradley-Gephardt ''Fair Tax,'' saying that the two bills ought to be merged. **********Senator Bradley was more cautious about accepting the Kemp-Kasten bill, presumably because it has less progressivity than his own. Neverthless, a marriage between some version of the two bills is not unthinkable. **********Some Democrats believe that Mr. Mondale made a mistake in calling for measures to impose surcharges, especially on upper-income taxpayers and corporations, but reaching down to families of four with incomes of $25,000 or more. They would have preferred to see him go for the Bradley-Gephardt bill. **********President Reagan has also spoken up for greater simplicity in the tax code, but he has yet to give clear support to the Kemp-Kasten bill. His Treasury Secretary, Donald T. Regan, indicated at a breakfast meeting with reporters last week that, in the report he is preparing for the President, which is to be delivered after the election, he is likely to urge tax reform along flat-tax lines. **********Both President Reagan and Mr. Mondale have understandable reasons to hold back from being specific during the political campaign about how they would go about closing loopholes and eliminating tax shelters, deductions and exemptions. Virtually all of these base-broadening moves are likely to provoke stiff resistance in Congress and political opposition from assorted blocs of voters. **********To get any sort of modified flat tax through after the election, whoever is President would be likely to try to make it revenue-neutral, rather than a big revenue-raiser. Nevertheless, there is a lot of revenue ultimately to be raised from base broadening. The Congressional Budget Office has identified 25 such changes that would raise $90.4 billion annually in tax revenues by the fiscal year 1989. **********Should discussion of these matters be conducted during this electoral campaign, laying the foundation for changes to come? Or is this a fit subject, as the economist Alan Greenspan has suggested, only for a smoke-filled room - after the election? As the debate between the candidates heats up, this key issue may yet emerge into the open."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/04/business/tackling-argentina-s-wayward-economy.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Schumacher", "pub_date": "1984-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2066, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TACKLING ARGENTINA'S WAYWARD ECONOMY", "print_headline": "TACKLING ARGENTINA'S WAYWARD ECONOMY", "body_text": " **********BUENOS AIRES BERNARDO GRINSPUN, Economics Minister of Argentina's two-month old democratic Government, describes one of his critics as a ''worker for dictators'' and calls another ''a crystal ball gazer.'' A third, he says, ''doesn't know what he's talking about.'' **********Mr. Grinspun is what Argentines call a person with no hair on his tongue - he speaks his mind in no uncertain terms. That outspokenness is only one of several traits that set the 58-year-old economist apart from many of his more decorous predecessors. He is also only the third Jew ever to hold a ministerial post in this officially Catholic state, a man of humble origins in a position often held by patricians and an unreconstructed politician doing what in the last decade has been mostly a technocrat's job. **********Whether Mr. Grinspun's unusual background and opinionated manner will have any impact on the Argentine economy remains to be seen. But clearly some break with the past is required: Mr. Grinspun and the fledgling Administration of President Raul Alfonsin, whose election last October followed eight years of military rule, are facing the worst economic crisis in Argentine history.  ''All the economic variables are out of control,'' Mr. Grinspun groaned in a recent interview. ''It's a very tough challenge, but what we want now is to slowly put them back together again, into an understandable scheme, without any traumatic moves that could disturb the social peace and democracy Argentines have just won.'' **********The challenge is formidable. Last year, Argentina's annual inflation rate soared to 434 percent - making it the world's most inflationary nation. Although the economy did grow a bit last year, after a two-year recession, real wages remain far behind what they were a decade ago and a third of the nation's industrial capacity is idle. Meanwhile, in a bountiful breadbasket that is one of the world's leading exporters of beef and grain, childhood malnutrition has grown alarmingly and soup kitchens are thriving. **********These problems are compounded by Argentina's $43 billion foreign debt - the world's third largest, after Brazil and Mexico. The sum is so strapping that the new Government has declared a moratorium until July on the interest payments. The Government has also put off until late summer all refinancing negotiations with international banks. **********Once they do resume, the negotiations are expected to be the toughest yet faced by the bankers, who will be owed $6 billion in accrued interest payments alone by the end of the year. ''Paying is a matter of honor,'' Mr. Grinspun said, although he acknowledged that the resumption of interest payments - nothing has been paid since last October - is not his first priority. And he offered no definitive repayment schedule. When Aldo Ferrer, president of the powerful, state-owned Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires, for example, suggested that Mr. Grinspun limit the country's debt payments to 15 percent of its exports, Mr. Grinspun rejected the idea. ''Why should I pay 15 percent when I may have a trade surplus of 20 percent?'' he asked. ''I want to use everything I can to pay off this debt.'' **********Bolstered by grain exports, Argentina's trade surplus is expected to reach $3.5 billion this year. **********Mr. Grinspun said that reviving the Argentine economy is of more immediate importance than debt repayment. He said he would attempt to stimulate the Argentina economy by simultaneously increasing real wages and slashing hyperinflation. He would do this partly by continuing a price freeze now in effect and partly by reducing the Government's budget deficit. The latter would be achieved through a cutback in spending and a surcharge on consumer goods that would raise new tax revenue. Once prosperity returned, Mr. Grinspun said, enough wealth would be generated to pay the foreign debt. His critics contend that these goals, while laudable, aren't practical. **********MR. Grinspun's self-assurance in tackling Argentina's huge economic problems stems in part from his close relationship with the President. He is a longtime political confidant, friend and economic adviser of Mr. Alfonsin. Before the President and his wife recently moved to the Presidential residence, the two families were regular visitors in each other's homes. **********It is a relationship that dates back three decades, when Mr. Grinspun and Mr. Alfonsin were doctoral students, Mr. Alfonsin in law and Mr. Grinspun in economics, at the University of Buenos Aires. There, they found their respective upbringings and politics a common ground for friendship. Mr. Alfonsin, the son of a country store owner, and Mr. Grinspun, the son a clothing retailer, both worked their way through school and were activists in the Radical Party, now in power under Mr. Alfonsin's leadership. **********Even as a teen-ager, before entering the university, Mr. Grinspun was drawn to the Radical Party, whose slightly left-of-center politics are similar to those of Europe's Social Democrats. He rose to be a student leader and since then he has held a number of party posts, mostly as an economic adviser. In addition to Mr. Grinspun's ministerial position today, he is also secretary general of the party's national committee, a position that gives him clout within the party. **********It was in his early days as a soap box speaker that Mr. Grinspun developed his aggressiveness and his political savvy, said Juan Manuel Casella, a Radical legislator and a friend of the economist since boyhood. ''He is different from the other intellectuals in the Cabinet,'' Mr. Casella said. ''He speaks forcefully, even inside the party, but it's because he is so passionate.'' **********Mr. Grinspun's strong opinions have gotten him into trouble more than once. During last year's campaign, for example, when Mr. Grinspun did not like some of the news stories probing his planned policies, he lashed out at reporters during a news conference, labeling their work ''irresponsible.'' It provoked a backlash in the Argentine press at a politically sensitive time for Mr. Alfonsin. **********Eva Grinspun, his wife of nearly 30 years, is said by family friends to be a calming influence on her husband. ''When she is present,'' Mr. Casella said, ''Bernardo lowers the voltage.'' The Grinspuns have three sons. The eldest works in the Argentine Embassy in Washington and the younger two are university students in Buenos Aires. The Grinspuns are no strangers to the United States. When he worked as a financial adviser to a number of Argentine banks and companies, Mr. Grinspun traveled so often to Washington that he finally bought an apartment there. He has also worked over the years as an economic consultant to the United Nations and the Organization of American States. **********As a Radical Party leader, Mr. Grinspun helped to draw to Mr. Alfonsin the vote of Argentina's Jewish community of 350,000 people, the world's fifth largest. Mr. Grinspun's appointment as Economics Minister, although not viewed as a concession to the Jewish community, is a sign of the growing achievement of Jews in Argentine society. Mr. Grinspun, however, does not think of his rise as a historical benchmark. ''I don't react in this job like a Jew,'' he said. ''I react like an Argentine who wants liberty.'' **********Argentine journalists and political analysts, however, are frustratedwith Mr. Grinspun's refusal to outline his views on economics. When asked his economic persuasion, Mr. Grinspun simply replies ''Radical.'' The party, however, is not known for a definitive economic or political platform, but rather an eclectic mixture of economic measures deemed practical. **********BUT over the years, Mr. Grinspun has proved himself to be an essentially Keynesian economist with a strong social consciousness. He calls himself ''an interventionist, not a statist,'' and points to the policies by the United States and Europe after World War II as precedents he is following to spur consumer spending and the country's economic growth. **********Mr. Grinspun's announced economic plan sets three simultaneous goals: combating inflation, reviving the economy and increasing real income. To combat inflation, he plans to cut the fiscal deficit from 14 percent of the gross national product to 4 percent by the end of the year. He also plans to curb interest rates, stimulate industry and restrain defense spending. These measures, he said, should trigger strong growth in the private sector. Then the Government hopes to sell off some of its state industries. **********In spite of his goal to pare down the public sector, Mr. Grinspun's first acts in office have seemed contradictory. To relieve the financial pressures on working-class Argentines, Mr. Grinspun began a national feeding plan for children, increased construction of public housing and ordered wage increases slightly higher than the inflation rate. The costs of these social programs, say his critics, will offset some of the gains made by cuts in defense spending. Mr. Grinspun's response to charges of inconsistency: ''We're not here to apply an economic theory. This is not an academy; this is a Government.'' **********Argentina's multiple Goverments over the last decade, however, with their stop-and-go policies, have played havoc with the nation's economy. Since the late 1970's, industrial output has crumbled and the deficit has ballooned, due partly to the free trade policies imposed by former Economics Minister Jose Martinez de Hoz. After the military took power in 1976, Mr. Martinez de Hoz introduced an open market by lowering tariffs, a move that unleashed a flood of low- cost imports and drove into bankruptcy a number of Argentine businesses whose products had been protected by the tariffs. He also put into effect restrictive money supply measures to drive up the value of the peso. These policies - carried out by Mr. Martinez de Hoz and the three other Economics Ministers that served under the military Government - failed to promote the economic prosperity that were their goal. Instead, the result was spiraling inflation and economic chaos. The financial strain of last year's war in the Falkland Islands added to the Government's economic problems. **********And then there is the foreign debt. In addition to the $43 billion it owes around the world, Argentina is about $1 billion behind in repaying its short- term trade credits to banks. The country was also unable to pay the $350 million it owed last month on a short-term loan granted by banks last year. The twist is that Argentina can't pay those loans, said Mr. Grinspun, without the disbursals it is due on new loans. The banks are currently withholding payments from a $1 billion bailout loan they approved last August. The International Monetary Fund as well is withholding disbursals from a $900 million loan it approved last year because Argentina is unable to keep pace with its interest payments. **********The Government's failure, so far, to introduce major domestic initiatives - aside from price controls and some tariff barriers that have reduced imports - has raised not only the most stinging criticism, but also new doubts that Argentina's economic platform will be supported by the international financial community. Bankers, businessmen and opposition economists say that Mr. Grinspun's plan is no plan at all, and that it fails to detail how the Government will achieve those goals. The policies, they contend, are a mere continuation of those of the past military Government. ''The targets are a repetition of the inherited disorder, coupled with campaign promises,'' said Alvaro Alsogaray, a member of Congress who served as an Economics Minister in the military Government that was in power in the early 1960's. **********Mr. Grinspun strongly refutes his critics, accusing them of ''bad faith'' for not giving the new Government more time to collect itself. When he came into office he discovered, for example, that there were no accurate data on the size of the debt or who held it, or on the size of the fiscal deficit. He said that the Government will lay out more specific plans in its annual budget presentation to Congress this month. **********But Mr. Grinspun is not the first Argentine Economics Minister to start up with a roar. The position is not known for its longevity. In fact, there has been an average of one Economics Minister a year for the last 44 years. **********Mr. Grinspun, however, quickly dismisses the common prediction here that he will last only six months, and exchanges verbal volleys with his critics with good humor and a sense of enjoyment. After so many years of military rule, ''they are now allowed their freedom of expression,'' he said, ''and I am, too.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/26/world/2-germanys-at-odds-over-leader-s-visit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 542, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 GERMANYS AT ODDS OVER LEADER'S VISIT", "print_headline": "2 GERMANYS AT ODDS OVER LEADER'S VISIT", "body_text": " **********East Germany today accused ''certain forces'' in Bonn of trying to sabotage a visit to West Germany next month by Erich Honecker, the East German Communist Party leader. **********In a commentary, the East German party daily Neues Deutschland attacked Alfred Dregger, the parliamentary floor leader of the West German Christian Democratic Party, who two days ago declared that ''our future does not depend on whether Mr. Honecker pays us the honor of a visit.'' **********The editorial assailed Mr. Dregger, who voices right-wing concerns of his party, and the anti-Communist Springer newspaper chain, saying they ''do not want the possible visit'' to take place. It described Mr. Dregger's remarks as ''scandalous and provocative sallies.'' **********''The campaign of such forces,'' said Neues Deutschland, ''does no small damage.'' It said that in light of the purported campaign, it should be clear that Mr. Honecker ''is not pushing to visit'' West Germany. **********The Neues Deutschland commentary was the first to hint that the visit, which would be the first by an East German party leader to West Germany, might not take place. But officials here noted that the editorial avoided criticism of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who returns from vacation Monday.  Although the visit has not been formally announced, Bonn officials have been fleshing out the details of a busy, five-day swing that would start on Sept. 26. The Neues Deutschland article maintained that ''no date, catalogue of discussion topics or program have yet been agreed upon.'' **********Criticism in Soviet Press **********Since the beginning of this month, the Soviet press has sharply criticized the warming ties between the two Germanys, charging the Kohl Government with trying to undermine East Germany's stability. The press blasts are widely seen as an expression of unease over the implications of the Honecker visit, although Western diplomats express uncertainty over whether Moscow will try to veto the trip. **********As East Germany's links with West Germany have tightened, Mr. Honecker has emerged as an ally of Janos Kadar of Hungary and Nicolae Ceausescu of Rumania in defending broadened ties with the West to spur both economic growth and East-West detente. This line of argument has tended to undercut Soviet efforts to convey a chill in East-West relations in the wake of the deployment of American medium-range missiles in Western Europe. **********This week Mr. Honecker was conspicuous as the sole Eastern European party chief to attend the 40th-anniversary celebrations in Bucharest of Rumania's ''antifascist liberation.''

The slip-up was by no means trivial. The document described some of National's most precious trade secrets, the coin-of-the-realm in the cutthroat competition of the Valley. **********To the horror of James H. Pooley, one of the firm's senior partners, seven of those trade secrets showed up two weeks ago in Microelectronic News, an industry newsletter whose subscribers include every important competitor of National. ''I can only say it was a shock,'' said Mr. Pooley, whose firm has been paid millions by such companies as Tymeshare, Itek and Verbatim to protect their trade secrets. **********The Mania for Secrecy **********If Mr. Pooley was shocked, the Valley at first was highly amused. But the National episode has quickly taken on a broader importance here. It has drawn attention, industry executives and lawyers say, to the corporate mania for secrecy in Silicon Valley that has spawned scores of trade secrets cases. Moreover, National's rushed efforts to prevent others from publishing its secrets have raised serious First Amendment questions. **********The National case is not Mr. Pooley's first brush with trade secrets problems. The 36-year-old author of a standard text on trade secrets already stands accused by the International Business Machines Corporation of disclosing some of the secrets about the computer giant's disk drive technology to a competitor, the Control Data Corporation. A trial in that case, in which Mr. Pooley maintains that I.B.M. was largely at fault, is expected to begin in a few months. **********The National Semiconductor episode, coming on the heels of the I.B.M. suit, is bound to hurt the Pooley firm, another lawyer predicted. ''The Valley will forgive this kind of thing once, but not twice,'' he said.  Unusual Court Order **********In the hours after Microelectronic News printed excerpts from National's court filing, National obtained an unusual court order issued by Judge Marilyn Zecher restraining other publications from printing company trade secrets they may have found in the public record, and forcing them to return their copies of the court documents. ''At that point, there was just panic to get the information back,'' said Linda Baker, a spokesman for National. **********''I was amazed,'' said Jerome M. Ceppos, managing editor of The San Jose Mercury-News, which was served with the court order. ''Prior restraints are presumed to be unconstitutional, except maybe when the utmost national security is at stake.'' Trade secrets, he said, ''are a little different.'' **********The story of how National managed to hand away its trade secrets goes back to 1981, when a group of engineers defected to start up Linear Technology Inc. The new company laid plans to compete with National in the market for specialized microchips commonly used in stereo equipment, automobile engines, and other non-computer applications. **********National sued, charging that the engineers had walked off with proprietary knowledge about chip manufacturing processes. The lawsuit was hardly an unusual event here, where companies sometimes hold a goodbye dinner for a departing employee one night, and serve him with court papers the next day. This suit was quickly settled, with Linear agreeing to let an independent inspector review its manufacturing processes to determine if any National trade secrets were in use. New Suit Filed **********When the inspection was carried out last December, the inspector found 7 reported infringements, out of a list of about 40 trade secrets. National sued again, and in support of a motion in court one of its lawyers - Mr. Pooley declined to identify which one - filed the unsealed inventory of secrets. **********Then three weeks ago, Don C. Hoefler, the publisher of Microelectronic News, received an anonymous telephone call at his home in Carmel, Calif. The caller told him that the trade secrets were available for the price of a photocopy at the Santa Clara County Courthouse in San Jose. **********''It was sitting right there,'' Mr. Hoefler recalled recently, ''and I got it legally.'' Mr. Hoefler printed the paragraph-long descriptions of the 7 trade secrets at issue in the lawsuit, but not the other 30 or so in the court record. **********Mr. Pooley insists he smells a rat, and it is Linear. ''Nothing would have happened if Linear had not gotten Hoefler to send a copy out to his subscribers,'' said the lawyer, who calls Microelectronic News a ''gossip sheet.''  Linear Issues Denial **********Linear's lawyer, Michael A. Ladra, suggests that an embarrassed Mr. Pooley is passing the blame. ''The bottom line is that no one at Linear called Mr. Hoefler,'' Mr. Ladra said Tuesday. **********The issue of motive is critical to Mr. Pooley. In California, and in most states, a trade secret is destroyed if it is generally published. That could threaten National's case against Linear and, experts say, make it impossible for National to use the secrets in any further suits. **********But Mr. Pooley argues that the secrets were never really put in the public domain because Microelectronic News has only a few thousand subscribers. In any case, he maintains, they should not have been published in the first place because all but the top page of the document was stamped ''Company Private,'' and ''Do Not Reproduce.'' Thus, Mr. Pooley suggests, the publication was malicious. **********He blamed Mr. Hoefler, whom he likened to ''a teen-ager who steals a car and joyrides, and says it is O.K. because the keys were left inside.'' National, he said, is contemplating suing Mr. Hoefler for disclosing its trade secrets. First Amendment Issue **********Such a suit, if filed, would likely bring to the fore a First Amendment question that has pervaded the National case: Whether a publication can be barred from publishing legally obtained trade secrets. **********''The First Amendment issue is the most interestisng part of the case to me,'' said Robert A. Spanner, another lawyer in Silicon Valley specializing in trade secrets. ''It is compelling because the value of the trade secrets has widely baeen thought to be destroyed once the secret is published.'' But he quickly added that in some cases secrecy no longer seems required to maintain the validity of a trade secret. **********Others, however, note that anything in the public record is fair game for publication regardless of whether the company maintains that it could be harmed. **********National has demanded that Mr. Hoefler not only return his photocopy of the trade secrets, which he did, but also that he turn over to the company his subscriber list. ''They wanted to serve every subscriber with the court order to return their copies,'' Mr. Hoefler said. **********But Mr. Hoefler refused the demand for the subscriber list, and late last week, in a meeting at National's headquarters, a compromise was reached. He agreed to include a copy of the court order with each copy of his next issue. **********The Mercury-News also returned its copy of the court documents, but only after National went back to court, of its own accord, to get The Mercury-News exempted from the prior restraint order.  'Very Technical Stuff' **********''I'm not quite sure why they backed down,'' said Mr. Ceppos of The Mercury-News, adding, ''We never actually printed the descriptions of the trade secrets anyway, because they were very technical stuff.'' By the time the newspaper returned the court document, he said, ''we had gotten what we wanted from them,'' which was just a brief discription of how the secrets fell into public hands. **********Mr. Pooley, conceding he is angered and embarrassed by the disclosure of the trade secrets, said office procedures were being tightened. But lawyers here say the damage is done. They expect I.B.M. to seize on the National incident in its case against Mr. Pooley. Mr. Pooley insisted that ''the two cases are entirely different.'' **********The I.B.M. suit, which the Valley is following closely, arose from Mr. Pooley's defense of two ex-I.B.M. employees who left to start a firm that is now called Trimedia. A settlement was eventually reached, but Mr. Pooley remained in possesion of some I.B.M. trade secrets disclosed during the negotiations. **********I.B.M. charges that Mr. Pooley, while helping Trimedia attract investors, allowed a Control Data executive to see a confidential document. Mr. Pooley admitted that, but said I.B.M. did not properly warn his firm that the document was confidential. **********If the two cases are focusing attention on Mr. Pooley, he said, ''I would like to think it would not hurt business,'' National does not plan to change lawyers, he added, as he left for his honeymoon."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/26/world/us-hails-grenada-tourism.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 290, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. HAILS GRENADA TOURISM", "print_headline": "U.S. HAILS GRENADA TOURISM", "body_text": " **********The White House called a news conference today for a commercial announcement - the resumption of Cunard vacation cruises with stops at Grenada. **********Reporters from news agencies and television networks were summoned to the office of a deputy press secretary, Peter Roussel, for an announcement, which appeared to promote the service by the Cunard Steam-Ship Company to the Caribbean island invaded by Americans last October. **********The announcement was made by James Coyne, head of the President's Office of Private Sector Initiative.

They were transferred to hospital, where one of them died.'' **********According to Dr. Issa Salti, the director of Ramallah Hospital, the slain youth, Bakr Abdullah, was hit by a bullet in the chest and died on the operating table. Mr. Abdullah, who was 20 years old, was a student at the Ramallah Industrial Secondary School. The wounded youth, Jihad Selim, was hit by a bullet in the thigh, and his life was not considered in danger.   Other Disturbances Reported **********Many shopkeepers in Ramallah closed their stores after the incident but Israeli troops forced them to re- open, several merchants said. **********Meanwhile, smaller rock-throwing incidents were reported in the Jelaila refugee camp near Gaza and in Nablus, but these demonstrators were dispersed without any shooting. The universities of Bir Zeit and Bethlehem closed for the day in mourning for the student who was killed on Wednesday. **********Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin announced late Wednesday night that he had decided not to order Bir Zeit closed in punishment for the incident that day. The Israeli commander in the West Bank, Maj. Gen. Amnon Lipkin, had recommended to the Defense Minister that Mr. Rabin close the school. The previous Likud Government frequently shut down schools after such demonstrations. **********An aide to Mr. Rabin said the Defense Minister felt that quiet and normality on the West Bank would best be served by allowing the students to resume their studies.   Disagreement Over Tactics **********Mr. Rabin's move was criticized by a right-wing member of Parliament, Yuval Neeman, who was quoted by Israeli radio as saying that the ''Arab unversities of Nablus, Bir Zeit and Bethlehem have become focal points for Arab terrorist organizations and should be closed until they are able to teach academic subjects instead of anti-Jewish terrorism.'' **********The student association of Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv also issued a statement today calling for Bir Zeit to be closed down, saying that the university was a ''hornets' nest'' and that solidarity with it was tantamount to ''solidarity with the P.L.O.'' **********The Bar-Ilan statement was in reference to a statement issued Wednesday night, after the Bir Zeit shooting, by the Israeli Committee for Solidarity with Bir Zeit, an ad hoc group made up largely of Arab and Jewish academicians. The group had said that ''an army that shoots on unarmed students is an army that has lost the battle.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/11/world/discord-delaying-report-on-aquino.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1984-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 794, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DISCORD DELAYING REPORT ON AQUINO", "print_headline": "DISCORD DELAYING REPORT ON AQUINO", "body_text": " **********The long-overdue report by the panel investigating the assassination of the opposition leader, Benigno S. Aquino Jr., has been delayed by disputes among the panel members over the findings, according to board officials. **********''You have five intelligent, independent-minded people on the board, so there are bound to be differences of opinion,'' Andres Narvasa, the panel's general counsel, said. **********According to published reports quoting board officials, members have agreed that the military conspired to kill Mr. Aquino, but that has not been confirmed by the board members themselves. The main reason for the delay, board officials say, is disagreement among the members about how high to go in identifying officers responsible for Mr. Aquino's death. **********The citizens' board originally said it hoped to have the report ready by Aug. 21, the first anniversary of Mr. Aquino's death. Since then, several deadlines have been announced and have slipped by. **********Now board officials are saying the report will be made public very soon, within a matter of days. That is what they have been saying for weeks.   The Implications for Marcos **********How high in the military hierarchy the panel's accusations extend is crucial for the Government of President Ferdinand E. Marcos because the more senior the officer, say the board officials, Filipino politicians and foreign diplomats, the more difficult it will be for the President to put distance between himself and the findings. **********Particular attention has been paid to Gen. Fabian C. Ver, Chief of Staff of the armed forces and a close associate of Mr. Marcos. **********Board officials said that in essence, board members must decide whether the general was ultimately responsible for security as Mr. Aquino arrived at the Manila airport after three years of self-exile in the United States. General Ver has supported the military version of events, which is that Mr. Aquino was killed by a lone Communist gunman. **********A finding of a military conspiracy of some type would be a serious blow to the morale of the armed forces. The military, which is estimated to have 170,000 troops, three times the number before martial law was declared in 1972, is one of the most powerful institutions in the Philippines and it has been one of Mr. Marcos's most loyal supporters.   Importance of Reactions **********The investigating panel could accuse the military of conspiring to kill Mr. Aquino without identifying the person who shot him. Mr. Aquino was killed while being accompanied by armed escorts after he stepped off a plane that brought him home from the United States. No credible civilian witness to the crime came forward to testify during the investigation. **********Yet more significant than the details of the report will be the Government and public reactions to it. ''This operates on two levels - one is the strictly legal and the other and far more important is the political side,'' said J. V. Cruz, the Philippine Ambassador to London and a former Cabinet member who has recently spent most of his time in Manila. **********The report is expected to set off more anti-Government demonstrations, but beyond that its political effects on the Marcos Government are uncertain. **********''No matter what the board decides, Marcos loses,'' Rafael Recto, an opposition Member of Parliament, says. **********But a foreign diplomat had another view, saying, ''If Marcos reacts firmly, it may let him take the strategic high ground, appearing to be a statesman who wants to see justice done.'' **********One response, according to a senior Government official, will be to offer the post of special prosecutor to Mr. Narvasa, the respected general counsel on the citizens' panel. **********''It's the best for us,'' the official said. ''Then there can be no accusations of a whitewash or lack of enthusiasm in pursuing the prosecution of those charged.''  Marcos Plans a Response **********The civilian panel is heading by Corazon Juliano Agrava, a retired Court of Appeals justice. Other members are Ernesto Herrera, a labor leader; Dante Santos, a businessman; Amado Dizon, an educator, and Luciano Salazar, a corporate lawyer. **********The President is also preparing to issue a statement as soon as he is handed the report, a top Government official said. **********The President's response will be made, he added, assuming that the report is in line with published reports on its contents that are being received by Mr. Marcos, namely, that the board will charge that a military conspiracy was responsible for Mr. Aquino's death. **********The investigating board has said the President would have no advance knowledge of the findings. **********But an official close to Mr. Marcos said: ''It's ridiculous to think that he does not know. Given all the interpersonal connnections here, all the friends and relatives, all the favors owed and offered, he would have to know.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/29/business/finance-new-issues-mta-revenue-issue-to-yield-up-to-10.839.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 339, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES ; M.T.A.

BOESKY; THE SECRETIVE LIFE OF AN ARB", "body_text": " **********THERE he was, sitting on a park **********bench, out of a job and staring **********into space. Even then, he was impeccably dressed, vest and all, killing time in Central Park, wondering when his chance would come. **********That was just 14 years ago. **********Nobody had ever heard of Ivan F. Boesky, except maybe around Detroit, where in the old days the family name stood above the best delicatessen in town. **********Today, he is known as one of best- informed men on Wall Street, widely feared, grudgingly respected and at the age of 47 probably worth $250 million or more. **********The    ''more''    is what seems to propel Mr. Boesky, the world's most successful arbitrager, and member of a secret clique of audacious professional traders who bet hundreds of millions of dollars on the outcome of corporate takeovers. **********The past few years of rampant merger activity have been big ones for the arbs. But just how big is anybody's guess because their businesses are private. Mr. Boesky, for example, was one of the biggest buyers of Gulf stock before the oil company was bought by California Standard, and was just as big a buyer of Getty stock before it was bought by Texaco. He is reputed to have made between $50 million and $100 million on each of them. **********In essence, what arbitragers do is to buy a company's stock when it becomes a takeover target, betting that they will make a profit if the deal goes through. The art is to measure the risk they face if the deal fails and catches them with stock that nobody wants - either because the target resists, the courts or the Government step in or the deal disintegrates. How much they can find out about a situation often spells the difference between success and failure. **********Some professionals treat arbitrage as their only business, although Mr. Boesky is now moving into other areas such as buying companies. Investment banking firms, such as Goldman, Sachs & Company and Salomon Brothers, treat arbitrage as one of many businesses. **********What separates Mr. Boesky from the rest is not easy to define. The heart of all arbitrage dealings is information, but Mr. Boesky's appetite for minutiae is legendary, and he is willing to pay for every scrap of information, no matter how seemingly inconsequential. **********''He's the best in the business,'' a close Wall Street friend maintained. ''He's made more money than any of us and that makes him the best.'' **********Mr. Boesky's philosophy seems clear enough. It is spelled out on a plaque in his private office. The inscription, by A. Bartlett Giamatti, president of Yale University, reads in part: ''Winning is not everything but it is something powerful, indeed beautiful, in itself, something as necessary to the strong spirit as striving is necessary to the healthy character.'' **********But Mr. Boesky's winning streak was a long time in coming. **********WHEN he was just a few years out of college, his old roommate, Marvin H. Davidson, now an executive with Bear, Stearns & Company, had been telling him about his work in arbitrage. It sounded exciting. **********Determined to try his hand, he came to New York in 1966. Before long he had landed a job at L. F. Rothschild & Company, where he became a stock analyst. Set on getting into arbitrage, he soon joined the First Manhattan Company, where he worked alongside Harry L. Schick, the premier arbitrager, and discovered his calling. But by 1970, First Manhattan decided to de-emphasize arbitrage, so Mr. Boesky left, working for a time in a variety of Wall Street jobs. **********But even when he was spending his time in Central Park, he was convinced that arbitrage was his way to the top. By 1972, his chance came. Edwards & Hanly asked him to create an arbitrage department, and it soon became the company's biggest profit center. Within three years he was in business for himself. **********Even for Mr. Boesky, the perils of being an ''arb'' can make life harrowing. In the first few weeks on his own, he almost lost half his capital. **********And there was the time in 1982, when Gulf backed out of its agreement to buy Cities Service. Mr. Boesky and other arbs had loaded up on Cities Service stock in hopes of reselling it to Gulf later at a huge profit. But when Gulf withdrew, Cities Service shares plunged and Mr. Boesky was left with a bundle of stock. Occidental subsequently agreed to step in but would not pay nearly as much as Gulf. It was enough, however, to cushion Mr. Boesky and others.  These days, Mr. Boesky wins more than he loses. A former associate recalled the other day that a few years ago, after Mr. Boesky had made a killing in the market, he said, ''Ivan, you've already made more money than you can ever spend. What are you    really    after?'' **********''I want to be    rich   ,'' he quoted Mr. Boesky as replying. ''I want to be worth. . . .'' Mr. Boesky mentioned a big number, but the former associate wouldn't repeat it. But he added, ''He's a driven man.'' **********Another close observer thought that money alone was no longer Mr. Boesky's goal, that what he really wanted was ''to establish a name, be a modern Rothschild.'' **********The reference to one of the world's great banking families pleased Mr. Boesky immensely. ''Of course,'' he said softly, ''one has an ambition to succeed.'' The French and English Rothschilds, he said, are his ''very good friends.'' Jacob Rothschild is an investor in his British company and Baron Elie de Rothschild once gave him a bottle of wine for his cellar. **********BUT there is another side to Ivan Boesky, a side that perhaps explains why dozens of millionaire Wall Street executives absolutely refuse to talk about him. Those who do, discuss him from a distance, often with sketchy details and usually only after assurance that they will not be identified. **********''If anecdotes are supposed to be funny, there aren't any about Ivan,'' said Alan C. Greenberg, head of Bear Stearns. ''He's too serious.'' **********Aware that his movements are watched - by other arbitragers who want to buy when he buys and sell when he sells - Mr. Boesky may ask one broker to tell a second broker to buy for him through yet a third. **********But the sheer size and audacity of Mr. Boesky's dealings, unlike anything ever seen on Wall Street, make him stand out almost as if he had a sign pinned on his back. **********''Ivan's buying,'' the word goes out. **********His hunger for every share of stock that money can buy came in for good- natured ribbing the other day at a private dinner in New York's Regency Hotel, given by the arbitrage community in honor of T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman who precipitated the takeover of Gulf. **********An arbitrager who attended the dinner said the host got a laugh when he gave Mr. Boesky, as a joke, an award for buying and selling more Gulf stock than was available. **********He is reputed to be the only Wall Street arbitrager to use a press agent to attract wealthy investors. But he is reluctant to reveal even the most mundane facts. **********He rushed through an interview the other day, glancing several times at his Patek Philippe pocket watch, with individual dials for London, Los Angeles and New York. **********But he once spent an hour posing for Arnold Newman, the photographer who is known for ''environmental portraits'' that identify the subject with his craft. Unlike Stravinsky, who posed with his piano, and Henry Ford, who had the Dearborn auto plants as a backdrop, Mr. Boesky refused to pose in his office with its 300-button phone console and its long, 200-year- old brass telescope. So Mr. Newman photographed him in an anteroom, but without the identifying accouterments the portrait might have been of almost anybody. **********''He can be the most charming guy in the world,'' one Wall Streeter said of him, ''but he's a Jekyll and Hyde, and can be very demanding.'' **********A former partner shot back, ''He makes no demands of his employees that he wouldn't make on himself.'' **********Pointing to Mr. Boesky's predilection for sleeping three hours a night, another former partner said: ''Ivan's no genius. He's bright but he makes up for a lot by working long hours. And then he gets tired and under pressure and is accused of erratic behavior.'' **********IF Mr. Boesky is guarded about his **********business dealings, he is even more **********grudging with the details of his private life. **********He lives on a 188-acre estate in upstate New York, purchased six years ago from John Revson of the Revlon cosmetics family. **********Visitors to the red-brick Georgian home remember maids, cooks, security guards, gardeners, ''beautiful lawns and flowers everywhere you look,'' paintings, statuary, horses, sauna, squash court, tennis court, swimming pool, and a cobblestone courtyard that can accommodate 30 cars. **********Mr. Revson said that the house, one of four on the estate, has five bedrooms, two full bathrooms and two and a half powder rooms - just for the servants. The family has another seven bedrooms, each with bath. **********Then there are the collections - the classic cars, including two antique Rolls-Royces; the fine wines; paintings (including a Renoir nude); sculpture (including a life-size bronze by Maillol), and rare books, Hebraica and Judaica. **********Mr. Boesky finds most of this too private to discuss. He will not speak of his wife and family for publication, although almost everyone on Wall Street knows or has been told by Mr. Boesky that one of his companies, Seemala, is named for his wife, Seema, two others for his children and yet another for his home. Another investment company in Bermuda has been dubbed Farnsworth & Hastings, which sounds something like an aristocratic British company. Actually, he said, it's a street corner in Detroit where his family's deli used to be. **********A few glimpses into the Boesky life style are revealed: He has three phones in the chauffeur-driven car in which he commutes to work. A little white Wheaten terrier named Bibi drives with him daily (some arbs have heard it barking in the background during phone conversations), and another Wheaten named Max stays home. **********It's a far cry from the life of his childhood. His father, William, an immigrant from Czarist Russia, went to work at 12 as a milkman's helper, switching later to restaurants. Young Ivan went into business at 13, selling ice cream from a panel truck. He left ice cream when someone discovered that he was too young to drive. At 15, to stay in shape, he unloaded box cars, soon turning to accounting because he ''knew a lot about numbers.'' A tall, lean and dignified-looking man who is never without a vest, he still stays in shape by playing squash. **********In the early 1960's, he met his wife, the daughter of a major stockholder in the Beverly Hills Hotel Corporation, while he was a student at the University of Michigan and she was at Michigan State. They were married in 1962. **********Two years later he was graduated from the Detroit College of Law and subsequently became law clerk to the chief judge of the United States District Court in Detroit, Theodore Levin, a relative of his wife. Between college and law school he joined the United States Information Agency and taught English literature and language to Iranians in Teheran. **********By 1975, after stints at other Wall Street firms, he had opened Ivan F. Boesky & Company with $700,000 in capital, some of it thought to have come from his wife's family. Three years ago, he reorganized as the Ivan F. Boesky Corporation. Its assets stand at more than $500 million. **********His investors include banks, insurance companies and a number of individual and corporate investors. Among them are Eli Broad, the West Coast real estate executive; Martin Peretz, editor of The New Republic, and the Reliance Insurance Company, owned by Saul Steinberg, the New York financier. **********AS might be expected of a man of **********his means, he is generous.  His donations to Harvard University's School of Public Health amount to more than $100,000, including $35,000 last year to support a fellowship for science writers. He was subsequently named visiting committee member at the School of Public Health, a post that gave him full privileges at New York's Harvard Club. It has become his favorite meeting spot, although he has never attended the university. **********He has also given at least $100,000 to the American Ballet Theatre, and $2 million to the Jewish Theological Seminary for the Ivan F. Boesky Library. In recognition of donations over the years of more than $1 million, he has been named New York City chairman of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies 1985 drive. **********His bonuses are generous, too. Some of his staff - researchers and traders - collected close to $1 million apiece last March. It was a good year. **********ARBITRAGEMINUS THE ROMANCE **********Walking arm-in-arm with her husband down the Champs Elysees in Paris, one evening several years ago, Seema Boesky waxed romantic, as a friend tells the story. **********''Ivan,'' she sighed, ''it's a beautiful evening. Just look at the moon.

They enjoyed substantial ''spreads'' between the price they paid and the price they collected for a stock. As a result, profits were substantial, even though the money committed was far less than it is today. **********''Ivan broke new ground,'' one Boesky watcher said. ''He took arbitrage out of the closet. He took it public, hired a press agent and invited investors to join him,'' thus committing far more money to the game than ever before. **********Above all, he told anybody who cared to listen, arbitrage is a business unto itself - one with high returns. Instead of a sideline, he made it his only activity, although he has since expanded into buying companies. **********His outlay in Esmark, for example, after the company became a takeover target last month, hit $120 million, more than the entire stock portfolio of most other arbitragers. **********His activities, some say, have cut everybody's profit margins by reducing spreads. But his organization has also produced a number of talented arbitrage graduates. Among them are Salim B. Lewis, head of S. B. Lewis & Company; George A. Kellner and Philip F.

Symms of Idaho and John P. East of North Carolina gave the warning in a letter to Mr. Reagan, which they made public. Congressional conservatives have been pressing the Administration to renounce arms-control agreements with the Soviet Union on the ground that Moscow has been charged with violating them. **********New Talks Set for January **********The issue is sensitive for the Administration because Mr. Reagan, who has accused the Russians of cheating, is seeking new arms- control accords with the Soviet Union. Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko are to open arms-control talks early next month in Geneva. **********The Administration was supposed to have supplied Congress with a new report two days ago on purported Soviet violations of arms-control accords, but decided last week to delay it until February - after the Shultz-Gromyko meeting - on the ground that the work was not completed. **********A major complaint of Mr. Symms and Mr. East in their letter to Mr. Reagan was that the United States is living up to the terms of the 1979 strategic arms agreement even though the accord was never ratified by the Senate. Mr. Reagan has said the agreement is not a good one. **********In the letter, they specifically criticized the Administration for what they said was a plan, drawn up under the terms of the 1979 pact, to dismantle 100 submarine-launched missiles that could survive a Soviet attack more easily than the MX land-based missile could. They contended that the Administration was planning to dismantle the missiles at the same time that it was seeking Congressional support for key votes in March authorizing the start of deployment of 100 MX missiles.  The senators said the United States was, in effect, ''appeasing'' the Russians by living up to the terms of the 1979 agreement while Moscow was violating it. **********Because of the Administration's decision in 1981 not to undercut the 1979 agreement if the Soviet Union did the same, the Administration is obliged not to exceed a limit of 1,200 multiple-warhead land-based and submarine- launched missiles. Of that total, there was a sublimit of 820 land-based missiles with multiple warheads. **********When a seventh Trident submarine, the Alaska, starts its sea trials sometime in the second half of next year, the Administration will have to dismantle older missiles to stay within the 1,200 limit. Currently, the United States total of multiple-warhead missiles is just under 1,200. **********Earlier in the year, some liberal senators expressed concern that the Administration might not take steps to keep within the 1,200 limit. **********Senators Symms and East, in their letter, said they had been told ''that your Administration is planning to begin dismantling in June 1985 six perfectly serviceable and highly survivable Poseidon submarines'' with 96 ballistic missiles and a total of 960 warheads. This, they said, was to allow the newer Trident submarines to begin their sea trials.   'Unilateral Disarmament' **********''We do not believe,'' the letter said, ''that it is rational on either military or cost-effectiveness grounds to deploy 100 relatively nonsurvivable MX ICBM's, when at the same time you are planning to dismantle 96 highly survivable Poseidon SLBM's, in order to comply with an unratified, unequal treaty which you have confirmed that the Soviets are violating.'' **********ICBM stands for intercontinental ballistic missile, and SLBM for submarine-launched ballistic missile. **********The letter said that deploying the MX missiles while scrapping the Poseidon missiles ''is ridiculous.'' **********They said this would amount to ''unilatral disarmament'' by the United States ''in the face of Soviet violations'' and ''can only be described as U.S. appeasement of the Soviets.'' **********The Senators said that ''our support for the MX, when it is voted upon in mid-March 1985 may be contingent'' on the Administration's reporting more fully on Soviet violations and on formally withdrawing the 1979 strategic arms accord from the Senate. **********Neither the White House, the State Department, the Pentagon nor the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency had an immediate comment on the contents of the letter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/17/business/washington-watch-freddie-mac-plan-opposed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 465, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Washington Watch; Freddie Mac Plan Opposed", "print_headline": "Washington Watch; Freddie Mac Plan Opposed", "body_text": " **********WASHINGTON EDWIN J. GRAY'S plan to shift ownership of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the quasi-public Government agency, to the nation's savings and loan industry, has hit heavy opposition from an unexpected Administration source: Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan. **********In an effort to strengthen the financial underpinnings of the thrift industry, Mr. Gray announced a plan Dec. 7 that calls for the distribution of 15 million preferred shares in the Mortgage Corporation to more than 3,000 thrift institutions. The stock would have a book value of at least $600 million. **********Mr. Gray serves as chairman of both the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac. He is also widely viewed as one of the few Federal financial regulatory heads with White House clout. Thus, Treasury and Bank Board officials have gone to unusual lengths to insure that the disagreement over the stock transfer not become a public squabble, which could prove embarrassing for both sides. **********Mr. Gray's plan, which he calls a ''paper transfer,'' would mean that the savings institutions would be able to show additional capital and net worth on their balance sheets, although no cash would be transferred. The stock of Freddie Mac is now owned by the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks, which contributed $100 million in capital to the corporation after it was chartered by Congress in 1970. **********In announcing the deal, Mr. Gray stressed that it would not alter the fundamental character of Freddie Mac. ''It is simply a paper transfer that will not change the directions, operations or statutory purposes of the corporation.'' **********But that's the rub, at least from Treasury's perspective. ''It seems to be in direct opposition to the Administration's ultimate goal of 'privatization,' '' said a senior Treasury official. **********''The Administration has consistently defined privitization as private ownership without ties to the Government,'' this official said. **********''At first blush,'' he added, ''it looks like a distribution of the ownership without changing any of the ties.'' **********Adds another Administration official, who said the Office of Management and Budget is also looking into the stock transfer: ''There's a feeling here, that, as a matter of course, we at least ought to have been informed. There are some people who are not too happy'' with Mr. Gray and the plan. **********A third Government official noted that the preferred stock is not scheduled to be issued to individual thrift institutions until Jan. 3, 1985. The implication is that there is still plenty of time to modify or perhaps block the deal. **********According to a Freddie Mac official, Treasury Secretary Regan and Mr. Gray are expected to meet today to discuss the transfer of ownership. **********Asked about the meeting, Julie Gould, an aide to Mr. Gray, answered with a terse: ''No comment.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/25/world/text-of-statement-issued-by-catholic-theologians.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 819, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TEXT OF STATEMENT ISSUED BY CATHOLIC THEOLOGIANS", "print_headline": "TEXT OF STATEMENT ISSUED BY CATHOLIC THEOLOGIANS", "body_text": " **********Following is the text of a statement issued for publication today by Concilium, an unofficial group of Roman Catholic theologians: **********Liberation theology is in the public eye. It has been the subject of comment by high ecclesiastical authorities, of articles in various newspapers and reviews, and of questions put to several individual theologians. We consider it our duty to take a position on this problem. **********1.*Birth of basic Christian communities and of the theology of liberation: **********Since Vatican II, we have witnessed a real renewal in the life of the churches in poor countries. This has shown itself in the flourishing of numerous basic ecclesial communities and of groups of biblical reflection, in a new vitality of faith among the people, and in the involvement of Christians (laity, priests and bishops) in the struggle for the defense of the right of the poorest to life. **********In this way, the church has begun to enter the world of the poor and to share their destiny, while at the same time the people have assumed new responsibilities within its communion. From the moment that the People of God committed itself to this road, there began a critical reflection whose purpose has been to address the problem of the oppressed in the light of the faith and to promote their full liberation. **********Simultaneously, in other contexts but as part of the same vital movement, there has been a process of liberation and reflection among women, finding themselves marginal to the life of society and of the church, and among races and cultures conscious of their position as minorities in church and society. **********2.*Current tensions: **********These developments, and the hopes and claims which they embody, have provoked contrary reactions, incomprehension and even hostility on the part of those who hold political and economic power. We have seen men and women disappear, forced into exile, tortured and assassinated. These things are absolutely unacceptable. Within the church, while some holding positions of authority have sometimes supported and accepted these movements of liberation, we have also seen people defamed, forbidden to teach theology, rendered suspect of infidelity to the Christian message, and accused of substituting ideologies for the gospel, under the influence of Marxism. Against such procedures we register a strong and vigorous protest. **********There are tensions necessary to the life of the church, but today these are exacerbated by integrist and neoconservative groups. Resisting all social change and holding that religion has nothing to do with politics, they fight against movements of liberation and make choices that constitute an offense against the poor and oppressed. **********All of these factors have created a climate which is unfavorable to the search for new ways of being church and of proclaiming the gospel. **********3.*The position of the theologians of Concilium: **********Wishing to remain always faithful to the orientations and inspirations of Vatican II, in line with a preferential option for the poor, and in keeping with its own distinctive theological identity, Concilium expresses its solidarity with these new movements, with the local churches affected by them, and with the theologians of liberation, both within the Catholic Church and in other Christian churches. The theologians of Concilium wish to express our solidarity not only with their theological thought but also with the concrete positions that they take. **********In doing this, we are pursuing an orientation taken within recent years, as evidenced by the creation of new sections (Third World Theology, Feminist Theology) and by the line taken in several recent numbers of the review. A future number of Concilium will be devoted to the ecclesial context within which these tensions have to be situated. **********Certainly, it is not our pretension to possess the fullness of truth, and we are conscious of being but one voice among several, a voice, however, that is fully ecclesial. In fact, it is a sign of the fecundity of the gospel today that it is lived in different contexts and in different ways. Theology is but an expression of, and a reflection upon, this situation, a situation that is cause for joy and not for alarm. This is the dimension of pluralism inherent to catholicity. To fulfill its role, theology needs that freedom of research and expression which we claimed for it in our declaration of 1971. **********4.*Conclusion: **********As these movements are a sign of hope for the whole church, any premature intervention from higher authorities risks stifling the Spirit, which animates and guides local churches. We express our strong solidarity with these movements of liberation and with their theology. We protest against the suspicions and unjust criticisms registered against them.  We firmly believe that the future of the church, the coming of the kingdom, and the judgment of God on the world are tied up with these movements."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/30/business/canadian-coal-output.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 46, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canadian Coal Output", "print_headline": "Canadian Coal Output", "body_text": " **********Canadian coal production rose 24.3 percent in April to 4.6 million tons from 3.7 million tons a year earlier, Statistics Canada said today.

For example, the proposal would not go ahead unless the Delaware Chancery Court upheld an earlier agreement that Pennzoil thought it had with the Sarah C. Getty Trust and the J.

It then sued Texaco and Getty in Tulsa, Okla., on antitrust grounds. **********Yesterday there was conjecture on Wall Street that there could yet be a settlement between Texaco and Pennzoil if the dispute dragged on.

The key question in Labor was whether former President Yitzhak Navon would challenge Mr. Peres for the party leadership. The two men met over a private lunch today; Mr. Navon, who cut short a trip to the United States and Canada to return to Israel on Tuesday, told Mr. Peres that he would announce his intentions on Friday. **********Outcome Is Far From Certain **********Mr. Peres has not proven to be much of a vote-getter, losing twice, in 1977 and 1981, to Menachem Begin. But Mr. Shamir, who assumed the party leadership when Mr. Begin resigned last September, is seen as a bland figure compared with the fiery Mr. Begin and has not been tested at the polls. Consequently, many in Herut doubt Mr. Shamir's ability to conduct an exciting, attractive campaign and thus the outcome of the July election is viewed as being far from certain. **********The latest public opinion polls show Labor defeating Likud, but polls did before the 1981 elections as well. **********Mr. Peres's unpopularity with the electorate has created a significant mood in Labor for a change to Mr. Navon, a moderate who is thought capable of appealing to a broad range of Israei voters. But Mr. Peres has shown no signs of willingness to relinquish his leadership, and any challenge to him could be expected to unleash supporters of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, whose rivalry with Mr. Peres has had a nasty edge for years. Many Laborites fear that a struggle would be so divisive that the party would not have time to heal the wounds before election day.   'Waiting for His Answer' **********Mr. Peres, in an interview on the Israeli Army radio, was asked about a possible challenge from Mr. Navon. ''I hope there won't be,'' he replied. ''Yitzhak Navon told me he would give me an answer on Friday. We had a very open, friendly conversation in a good spirit.'' **********Prominent Labor figures predicted that a place in the party short of the top spot would be found for Mr. Navon. This was the gist of an analysis by Moshe Shahal, Labor's whip in Parliament. The July 23 date, he said, was not far enough away for a full leadership struggle and not near enough to preclude some shifts. Some speculated that Mr. Navon would be offered a place as second or third on the Labor list and possibly a high Cabinet post, such as Deputy Prime Minister, should Labor be able to form a government. **********In Herut, both former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and Deputy Prime Minister David Levy were being mentioned as potential contenders for the leadership. But whether either would make an effort to unseat Prime Minister Shamir remained uncertain. **********Mr. Sharon, glum and uncharacteristically taciturn in the dining room in Parliament, confirmed past declarations of intent to make a challenge, but only with a nod and affirmative mumble, not with the ringing statements that have been his trademark. **********Another Herut member speculated that Mr. Sharon would be satisfied this time around with the promise of a key Cabinet position such as Defense Minister, from which he was forced to resign after a state commission found him and other officials ''indirectly responsible'' for the massacre of Palestinian civilians in Beirut by Lebanese Christian Phalangists. **********One of Mr. Levy's associates, Moshe Katzav, said the Deputy Prime Minister had not decided about a challenge. Mr. Katzav said there would not be time for Herut to recover from an intraparty fight before elections. **********Another former Defense Minister, Ezer Weizman, previously a member of the Herut Party, has announced his intention to run a slate of candidates in the election. Most of those who have joined with him are former high-ranking officers of the Israeli Army. **********The move toward early elections began last week when the Tami Party, which holds three seats, defected from the governing coalition on the question. Two other legislators also dropped away, and the Parliament gave preliminary approval to three bills setting dates in May or June.   Threats and Counterthreats Current law requires elections no later than November 1985. Mr. Shamir sought a date of November 1984, hoping to allow time for an economic recovery. His coalition threatened to hold up the bill in committee, thereby making it impossible for Parliament to take final action before it recessed this week until May. **********In turn, Labor threatened to move every 24 hours to muster the required 30 members needed to call a special session. Days of bargaining ensued, with Mr. Shamir compromising to September and Mr. Peres giving in to June. As of this morning, the difference between the two parties' positions was early July and late July. **********''Labor wanted a much earlier date,'' Mr. Peres said in the radio interview. ''In essence, we wanted the end of June, both to shorten the period of election campaigns, and to cut expenses, and to release the state from an unclear situation.'' **********Another factor was the large number of affluent Israelis, including probably a disproportionately high number of Labor voters, who travel abroad in the summer. There are no absentee ballots in Israeli elections. **********Parliament is scheduled to reconvene in special session early next week to enact the required legislation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/20/business/at-the-beginning-have-you-ever-tried-to-give-your-kids-some-money-sense.html": {"writer_name": "Joyce Maynard", "pub_date": "1984-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1020, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO GIVE YOUR KIDS SOME MONEY SENSE?", "print_headline": "AT THE BEGINNING; HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO GIVE YOUR KIDS SOME MONEY SENSE?", "body_text": " **********I'VE given a good deal of thought to the issue of children and money. I'm not speaking of those depressing figures one encounters that say what it costs to **********raise a child these days - figures that (if I'm to take them seriously) leave my husband and me, with three kids, about a million dollars short. **********What I'm speaking of is the way a parent goes about teaching children the value of a dollar, and about money in general. You shouldn't love it, can't hate it, have to respect it, mustn't worship it. This money-explaining business makes communicating the facts about sex, religion, or the electoral college system, seem elementary. **********A child's earliest relationship with money is oral. Around 12 months (but of course mine were precocious) they start putting coins into their mouths. Now my older son - he's two - likes to put pennies in his big sister's bank, counting as he goes. (One, four, seven, two, nine.) He has been known to tap me on the head at three in the morning with the sweetly voiced request, ''Penny please, mom.''(And in his rowdier moments, to tear through the house, yelling, at top volume, ''Five dollars! Five dollars! Five dollars!'') Clearly, it doesn't take long for a child to grasp the idea that these are powerful words. **********But where Charlie remains happy with any coin (and Willy, at six weeks, oblivious to all), their six-year-old sister has learned about the deceptive value of a dime over a nickel. Her greatest reverence she reserves for paper currency. And when, once, she observed me bent over a stack of bills, in tears, she hustled off to her room and came back a few minutes later to shower me with hand-colored tens, twenties and fifties, all bearing presidential-looking profiles. If money can't buy happiness, she's learned, it can cheer a person up, at least . **********My husband and I - a painter and a writer - collect our dollars pretty haphazardly. Every now and then they rain down on us and we may buy three lobsters or a car. And then comes a drought and, the next thing you know, I'm setting up a tableful of our possessions at the town flea market. We work very hard at being parents our children can rely upon. But as for owning a piece of the rock - the best we can offer are shifting sands. **********Of course, our own hard times bear no resemblance to genuine poverty. For us there is generally an end in sight, the promise of a check in the mail, no fear of being cold or hungry. We don't let our children entertain the notion that doing without this month's Sesame Street magazine has anything to do with hardship. Still, it certainly hasn't hurt them to get the sense, during our leaner times, that my husband's wallet is not bottomless. **********Partly because of the intermittent instability of our situation, our daughter is close to obsessed with the theme of rich people and poor ones. Like parents everywhere, we hold forth when Audrey's making faces over her asparagus and requesting that the crusts be cut off her toast on the hungry children who would give anything for those crusts. Audrey's comprehension seems to come and go. I have found her feeding steak to our dog. But I have also heard her, as she stood throwing away school worksheets at the edge of the town dump, musing on how lucky it is that she did them in pencil, because some poor little girl who can't afford to go to school could now pick them out, erase the answers and do the work all over again. **********I may have gone overboard invoking the picture of good little poor girls and the spoiled ones who waste asparagus. When Audrey plays with her Barbie dolls, the rich girl, in the evening gown and fur stole, is usually mean and speaks in a vain, cruel voice, while the poor one is sweet and humble. And having grasped the meaning of wealth, she is wasting no time in passing on the news to her brother Charlie. At the school she periodically runs, whose classes he has little choice but to attend, a recent lesson was titled ''How to Draw a Rich Girl.'' (With lots of frills on her skirt and a broad smile, that's how.) **********What else are my children learning about money? The concept of inflation seemed to come naturally: At a recent art show held in her bedroom, Audrey's pictures started out with price tags of 1 and 2 cents, but when they started selling like hotcakes (with her father, brothers and me as customers), she began crossing out prices, upping them to 10 cents, even 30, as fast as we could hand over our coins. (When we ran out of money, she promptly opened her bank and distributed its contents so we could keep on buying.) **********I try all the time, but pretty lamely, to make sense of the world for our children. I explain the nightly news to Audrey as best I can, during the commercials, reducing to a six-year-old's terms the idea of money for defense versus a nuclear freeze. But I know that, however much information my husband and I give our kids, the world of finance and economics (ours, theirs, Reagan's) must seem more than a little surreal. What we have are a two-year- old son who, at the mention of Jesse Jackson, starts dancing wildly around the room and singing ''Beat it'' or ''Thriller,'' and a daughter who believed, after my wallet was stolen in New York last fall, that now we'd be poor. **********And here am I, trying to untangle things for them, while our checking account stands mysteriously overdrawn again. After a four-year correspondence, we have just come to terms with the I.R.S. over the disappearance, from its computer, of several years' worth of our joint tax returns. All this time, it turns out, I had been writing down in the appropriate box a composite of my Social Security and telephone numbers. **********Joyce Maynard is working on a book called ''Domestic Affairs.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/14/world/400-foes-of-hanoi-said-to-face-trial.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1984-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 638, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "400 FOES OF HANOI SAID TO FACE TRIAL", "print_headline": "400 FOES OF HANOI SAID TO FACE TRIAL", "body_text": " **********Vietnam appears to be starting a public campaign against dissidents at home while it steps up military activities against the Chinese on its northern border and rebel forces in Cambodia. **********According to diplomatic reports from Hanoi this week, the Vietnamese are preparing to put on trial in Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, a group of at least 100 people accused of plotting to overthrow the Hanoi Government.  Some Western reporters are being given permission to go to Vietnam for the trial, according to Vienamese diplomats here. **********Reports from Hanoi this week quoting foreign diplomats there, said that the dissidents were being described as rebels trained and armed in China and Thailand. The Thais have denied any involvement in or knowledge of such activities. **********The Vietnamese Government radio has at the same time been reporting new fighting near the border with China.   Border Is Strengthened **********On Wednesday the Vietnamese press agency said the country's six northern provinces were being strengthened against ''an eventual large-scale invasion'' from China. It said 100 Chinese troops were killed in 40 clashes along the border in the last week in November. **********The reports of clashes with Chinese troops come at a time when Vietnamese forces are stepping up military pressure on Cambodian guerrilla forces seeking to overthrow the Vietnamese-installed Government in Phnom Penh from bases along the Thai border inside Cambodia. **********Since mid-November, Vietnamese troops have been shelling and occasionally overrunning camps belonging to the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, a non-Communist faction within the loose coalition of groups that is fighting against the Cambodian Government of Heng Samrin. **********Hanoi is thought to have between 160,000 and 180,000 troops in Cambodia, which it invaded in late 1978 to overthrow the Khmer Rouge Government under Pol Pot.   Anti-Government Forces **********Arrayed against the Vietnamese are a surviving Khmer Rouge army of about 30,000, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front force of about 15,000 and a smaller army of 7,000 who are followers of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. **********In the recent attacks on border camps the Vietnamese have concentrated on the Khmer People's National Liberation Front and have not mounted attacks on the Khmer Rouge camps. **********Some Thai and foreign specialists who have followed the patterns of fighting in Cambodia since Vietnam installed the present Government in early 1979, suggest that Hanoi has the capacity to destroy the Khmer Rouge camps, but does not do so because the presence of the Pol Pot forces provide an excuse for prolonged Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. **********Further, experts say, as long as the Khmer Rouge remain the strongest element in the three-part opposition coalition called Democratic Kampuchea, Cambodian and foreign opinion would not be in favor of returning the coalition to power. The Khmer Rouge, who were originally backed by the Vietnamese, are thought to have killed more than a million Cambodians during their years in power in Phnom Penh from 1975 through 1978. **********Recruits to the Khmer People's National Liberation Front are reported to be increasing. That organizaton, and the Sihanouk faction, would be more popular within and outside Cambodia than the Khmer Rouge as an alternative government to Heng Samrin, diplomats and Cambodian refugees say, and this may be causing concern in Hanoi. Cambodian refugees are now telling reporters that Vietnamese troops are making it more difficult for would-be defectors and refugees to reach the front's camps. **********Interviews with Vietnamese refugees along the border area over the last few months lend some credence to Hanoi's charges that there may be at least a small armed uprising within Vietnam itself. Former inmates of Vienamese prison camps say that they believe increasing numbers of dissidents are being arrested, some on charges of possessing illegal weapons."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/27/business/briefs-corporate-notes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 78, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": " Corporate Notes", "print_headline": "BRIEFS;  Corporate Notes", "body_text": " **********Midlantic Banks Inc., Edison, N.J., said it plans to offer $50 million in convertible subordinated debentures due 2009 through a syndicate of underwriters. ***********  Ohio Edison Co., Akron, Ohio, filed an offering of $75 million in first mortgage bonds due 1994 through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & Co. ***********  Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, is raising $200 million through a public offering of 25-year, 9 percent convertible subordinatd debentures through underwriters led by Shearson Lehman/American Express."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/27/world/reagan-aide-s-quip-not-funny-in-boston.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reagan Aide's Quip Not Funny in Boston", "print_headline": "Reagan Aide's Quip Not Funny in Boston", "body_text": " **********President Reagan's chief of staff, James A.

Greene of **********Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & **********Smith Inc. navigated his 1983 black Cadillac to a roadside motel where the Business Roundtable of Boston was holding a breakfast meeting. Its members were not exactly the heavyweights of Massachusetts business, but Mr. Greene accepted an invitation to speak anyway. **********The gamble paid off. Not only was Mr. Greene able to distribute his name and phone number to more than 30 potential investors, but he found one man in particular who was interested in talking further. **********''The other fellows will be getting in at 9 A.M., and I already have a customer,'' Mr. Greene said, looking pleased, as he returned to his neat 33d-floor office in Boston's financial district. Sure enough, a week later, Mr. Greene reports, the man bought $250,000 in municipal bonds. **********Such hustling for new customers is typical of the way Mr. Greene does business, and associates say it is key to his long-running success at Merrill. Last year, the 50- year-old broker brought in commissions totaling $4.2 million - he gets about 40 percent - and ranked second among Merrill's 9,000 retail brokers. His business is off 20 percent this year, but in third place, he still ranks high. **********''While some perceive him as sort of insensitive and hard-nosed, in fact, he has pretty much done away with the concept of horsing around at work,'' said Samuel E. Bane, a broker who worked at Merrill before moving to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. ''Month in and month out, he constantly prospects no matter how successful he gets.'' **********Added Jeffrey K. Wilgus, a former Merrill broker now with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.: ''Every day, for years, he's had a face-to-face meeting in the morning on the way in. That's more than the average guy would ever do.'' **********Nonetheless, Mr. Greene's oratory is not what wins new customers. His pitch to the Roundtable was short and somewhat flat. But, he says, his success comes from listening, not talking. **********''People like you when you listen to them,'' he explained. Listening also lets him glean valuable bits of information - like the fact the Roundtable member might have money to invest. **********A cigar smoker with a Boston accent and distinctly Irish face, Mr. Greene grew up in Brookline, Mass., the son of a teacher and a blue-collar worker with the telephone company. A graduate of Boston University with a degree in business and accounting, he was flying for the Air Force when he opened his first account with Merrill Lynch in 1956. He bought 100 shares of American Motors at 7 5/8 each. ''I sold at 9, and watched it go to 120,'' he recalled. ''I said, 'This is a good game, but maybe I don't know how to do it right.' '' **********BEFORE seeking the answer, Mr. Greene worked as a cost accounting trainee with United States Steel in Trenton. ''I had been there four months,'' he related. ''I said, 'Is this all there is?' '' **********So, he answered a Merrill advertisement, had four interviews and was hired as a broker. Within four years, he was the top producer in Manhattan, staying there until 1972, when he transferred to the Boston area with his wife and four children. With the fourth child now on his way to college, Mr. Greene and his wife live in a downtown Boston apartment during the week. On weekends, they go to their Cape Cod house, which he said has ''all the capitalistic tools,'' including a Jeep and power boat. A small airplane is the next purchase, he said. **********Mr. Greene's days at work move rapidly. He sits in a large corner office with four assistants whose Merrill Lynch salaries he supplements with bonuses. The assistants deal with routine transactions, place calls and keep the paperwork straight. Mr. Greene, meanwhile, constantly makes and receives client calls, snapping his fingers at one of the assistants to signal his readiness for the next call. The client roster is a hefty 500 names long, and he talks to all of them at least every two months, although only 150 accounts are active. They include individuals, pension funds, profit-sharing plans, charities and a well-known rock band, whose name Mr. Greene did not want published. Individual accounts range from $10,000 to $20 million, and his accounts total about $300 million. **********Although he makes strong recommendations, Mr. Greene said he does not accept money to manage at his own discretion. ''It's good discipline on my part if I have to explain why I'm doing what I'm doing,'' he said. ''You can't get referrals'' with discretionary money, he added, because ''people don't know why they bought what they bought and can't tell the next guy at the country club.'' **********Also contrary to custom for some big brokers, Mr. Greene does not insist on a minimum account. ''I don't think you can forget the big clients you have, how much money they started with,'' he said. ''Many times large accounts will deal with you because you handled their secretary's money, and treated her right.'' **********Mr. Greene is known for taking large positions in relatively few stocks. ''Ten securities is diversified,'' he said. But, he said, his stocks are generally in conservative companies that are No. 1 in their business, have a strong balance sheet and are involved in a ''long-term concept.'' **********HIS favorites now include American Telephone and Telegraph, which he says will ''get its game together,'' and which has ''   the    franchise in the U.S. for long distance.'' He also likes International Business Machines and some savings and loan associations, because their prices have been so depressed. But his biggest bet now is on falling interest rates. He is buying long-term Government and A.T.& T. subsidiary bonds now selling at large discounts from par, which would skyrocket in price if rates fell. **********''I buy good quality things,'' he said. ''Before I buy anything, I say, 'If I'm wrong, how bad is it going to hurt?' If you invest that way, you'll make money, because you won't have any big hits on the downside.'' He insists on taking a long- term approach - one reason, he said, why he can take ''a lot of vacation,'' including a trip to England next month. He is fond of saying, ''Time must go on in order to make money,'' adding, ''I don't buy things that have to work out in 15 seconds.'' **********If prices do sometimes turn against Mr. Greene's clients - and it happens, of course - he does his best to keep them encouraged. He spent a recent morning calling clients for whom he bought El Torito Restaurants. Since its purchase, the stock fell to about $10, from $13. But the earnings reported that morning were strong. **********''Everyone needs some good news,'' he told a client cheerfully before reciting the earnings. ''The reasons we bought it are falling in line,'' he continued. He acknowledged that the earnings report did not do much for the stock price that morning, but added, ''If the earnings weren't good, we could be watching it at 5.'' **********Later, he said, ''My biggest problem is making sure I keep myself up so I can keep my clients' morale up.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/10/business/castle-cooke.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Castle & Cooke", "print_headline": "Castle & Cooke", "body_text": " **********The United Financial Corporation told the Securities and Exchange Commission that it intends to increase its stake in Castle & Cooke Inc. to more than 15 percent of the company's outstanding shares.

''I can count on one hand the number of times our customers have gone the fixed-rate route,'' Steven Edging, vice president and general manager, said. ''Variable- rate loans are here to stay.'' **********John R. Gilker, Ford's manager of marketing and credit, said Ford's move was ''an experiment to test the market reaction; this is an idea that's taking hold in certain parts of the country, and we want to be competitive with the marketplace.'' **********In a fixed-rate loan, borrowers know how much they will repay at what interest rate. But in an adjustable- or variable-rate loan, whether for a house or car, the interest rate, and thus the final cost, may change. **********At stake for lenders and borrowers are billions of dollars in interest costs. Auto loans made up $142.4 billion of the $396 billion in consumer installment loans made last year, according to the Federal Reserve, which said that, as of July of this year, the average amount of a new- car loan was just under $9,400 and its term was just over 48 months. **********The variable-rate loan was popularized in mortgage lending at a time when high interest rates were scaring off potential home buyers. By offering a loan rate that could be adjusted, lenders were hoping to entice borrowers with the prospect that they would not be locked into the high rates. At the same time, the lenders were protecting themselves: Since the banks have to pay changing market rates on deposits, they believed borrowers should pay changing market rates. **********In auto loans, supporters say, the practice marks a fundamental change, one that makes the risks of borrowers and lenders more equal. **********But some consumer advocates and economists argue that the arrangement shifts the interest-rate burden onto the borrower. ''Interest fees are already supposed to pay for the risk of the loan; that's what they've always done,'' said Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board. ''Variable-rate loans may put consumers in the position of paying for that risk twice.'' **********In variable-rate loans, the lender is in effect gambling that rates will go up, while the borrower is gambling they will rise. And lately the borrowers have been winning, as a drop in rates overall has begun to filter into the consumer marketplace. **********Enthusiastic Response **********Precise statistics on the prevalence of variable-rate loans are not available. But officials of the American Bankers Association and the National Auto Dealers Association say the practice, which began about three years ago, has met an enthusiastic response among lenders and consumers. Where available, consumers appear to be choosing the variable-rate loan in far greater numbers than the traditional fixed-rate car loan. **********According to data gathered by the bankers association, 20 percent of the 14,000 banks in the United States - and 34 percent of banks with more than $500 million in assets - now offer variable-rate loans. **********Lenders, including the Chase Manhattan Bank and Marine Midland Bank in New York and Connecticut Bank and Trust, are among those that offer the loans, or plan to do so soon. **********Further, a statute permitting variable-rate financing for all consumer loans is being considered by the New Jersey Legislature. **********The variable-rate concept received a strong endorsement when the Ford Motor Credit Company, a subsidiary of the auto maker and the second- largest finance company in the world, recently began offering variable-rate auto loans at 500 Ford dealerships in Indiana, Kentucky and Texas. **********Still, many lenders remain unconvinced of the depth of the variable- rate program's attractiveness to consumers. And neither the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the world's largest finance company, nor the Chrysler Finance Corporation has plans to offer variable-rate loans, according to company spokesmen. **********In addition, Citibank, Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust, three of the biggest banks in New York, said they had no plans for variable-rate consumer loans, either. **********One reason variable-rate loans are proving attractive is that their initial interest fee is usually set at one to two percentage points below that for a fixed-rate loan. **********For example, the Merchants National Bank and Trust of Indianapolis offers those loans with an intial interest rate of 13 1/4 percent. By contrast, the interest rate on the bank's fixed- rate auto loan is 14 3/4 percent. James D. Madigan, Merchant's executive vice president, described that bank's experience with the loans as ''excellent,'' saying that variable-rate loans now make up 65 percent of its car- loan portfolio. **********The response has been similarly positive at California's Crocker National Bank, which began offering variable- rates in March. Robert L. Lowe, vice president for business planning and development, said 75 percent of new- car loan customers since then have chosen the new loans, accounting for about $100 million in loans. **********Loan Rate Pegged to Other Rates **********The interest on a variable-rate loan is not permanently set, as in a fixed- rate loan. Rather, it is pegged to a particular floating index, such as the rate for six-month Treasury bills, or some other easily-verifiable financial instrument. The rate is reviewed on a fixed schedule, such as every six months or once a year. **********For example, Marine Midland Bank of New York offers variable- rate car loans at 13.95 percent for customers and 14.95 percent for non-customers. The rate is pegged to the sixth-month Treasury bill. Thus, a borrower's interest payments would be higher if that index rises, or lower if the index falls. **********The difference between a fixed-rate car loan and a variable one can be seen as follows: **********- The borrower of an $12,000 auto loan, with a fixed rate of interest at 15 percent over 48 months, would repay the $12,000, plus interest of $7,200, for a total of $19,200. **********- The borrower of $12,000 at variable rates, in which the rate remained at the initial 13 percent, would pay $6,240 in interest; a total of $18,240. But should the rate decline, to, say, 12.5 percent the second year, 12 percent the third and 11.5 percent in the final year, the borrower would pay about $5,880 in interest - or a total of $17,880. **********- Conversely, if rates rose one-half of one percentage point a year over the course of the loan, the borrower would pay $6,600 in interest costs, for a total of $18,600. **********All examples assume the same number of payments and no amortization of principal. **********For competitive purposes, banks and other lenders often structure their variable-rate programs to appeal to consumers. At Marine Midland, for example, interest fees on the variable-rate loan cannot be increased more than two percentage points from one adjustment period to the next, nor more than six percentage points over the life of the loan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/19/business/northeastern-air.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 37, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Northeastern Air", "print_headline": "Northeastern Air", "body_text": " **********Northeastern International Airways said that it had laid off more than 100 of its 1,500 employees and had stretched out airport fee payments because of a seasonal slowdown in air traffic."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/06/business/corporate-phone-lists-to-be-auctioned-by-mail.html": {"writer_name": "Lee Daniels", "pub_date": "1984-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 854, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CORPORATE PHONE LISTS TO BE AUCTIONED BY MAIL", "print_headline": "CORPORATE PHONE LISTS TO BE AUCTIONED BY MAIL", "body_text": " **********How valuable are the telephone directories of some of the nation's top banks, investment and accounting firms, insurance companies and corporations - especially those that include not only direct office numbers for managers, but also home addresses and phone numbers and, in at least one instance, such data for summer homes? **********Steven Olsen is counting on their being worth a great deal. **********Mr. Olsen said his firm, Corporate Information Services, plans to sell copies of directories for such companies as the General Motors Corporation; the RCA Corporation; Chase Manhattan Bank; Goldman, Sachs & Company; Arthur Andersen & Company, and Booz, Allen & Hamilton, the management consulting firm. **********Semiannual Auctions Planned **********Prospective buyers are told to write to a box number and ask for a catalog detailing what Mr. Olsen said would be a package of directories for 250 companies from around the world.

Indeed, company officers often give the directories to clients and friends in other companies. But a systematic attempt to sell directories, as Mr. Olsen is doing, apparently is unique. **********During an interview last week, Mr. Olsen said he was 24 years old, but he generally declined to disclose details of his background, or that of his partner, Sheldon Copeland.

The new theater is being built on a site that includes a hotel, which the Loews Corporation owned for several years, and a former parking lot that the company acquired once the multiscreen movie house was planned. **********Loews 84th Street is the company's first ''sixplex'' in Manhattan and the second multiscreen theater to be constructed by Loews Theaters Inc., a division of the Loews Corporation. Loews 34th Street Showplace, a 1,600- seat triplex between First Avenue and Second Avenue, opened in 1981. **********Until then the company's four other multiscreen facilities in Manhattan resulted from renovations of existing auditoriums into two- or three-screen houses. The cutting up of large auditoriums, including many of the movie palaces built in the 1920's and 1930's, was the theater owners' way of competing with television. **********''When TV became big, we found ourselves operating these huge theaters with 3,000 or more seats for an audience of 300 or 400 patrons,'' said Bernard Meyerson, president of Loews Theaters and executive vice president of the Loews Corporation. ''It just was not economical.'' **********In 1968 Loews converted the 57- year-old Loews State on Broadway at 45th Street to a twin-screen theater at a cost of about $40 a square foot. **********''Today the same renovation costs $100 per square foot for the average theater,'' Mr. Meyerson said. ''But it is worth it because the multiplex allows us to show a variety of movies for what is the same basic cost of operating one large house. The concept not only was a lifesaver for the movie- theater and movie-making industries but also saved many historical structures.'' **********Construction costs for the average multiscreen theater, Mr. Meyerson said, start at $3 million, and his company is spending $5 million to build Loews 84th Street. The new West Side theater will have between 2,600 and 2,700 seats. Two auditoriums will hold approximately 600 seats each, and the four smaller screening rooms will each have between 350 and 425 seats. **********Held & Rubin, the Long Island architectural firm responsible for several Loews multiplexes throughout the country, has designed a building that will seem from the outside to have just one story, but its interior will have three levels. Patrons will enter the lobby on Broadway and find three theaters on a level below the street and three auditoriums on a balcony level. The main waiting area and refreshment stand will occupy space on the same level as the street. **********Mr. Meyerson, who has been in the industry for some 45 years, says the new theater, in its way, will be as luxurious as yesterday's movie palaces. He is not just alluding to the chandelier and handpainted murals that will adorn the Loews 84th Street. **********''Luxury in Manhattan is space,'' Mr. Meyerson said, discussing the project from his Loews Corporation offices at 666 Fifth Avenue. ''Patrons will not have to stand in line outside. For the waiting areas, we have allocated four square feet for every theater seat.'' **********Despite the emergence of cable television, Mr. Meyerson said, movie theaters are stronger now than they have been in years. **********''A couple of years ago I did not think we would be constructing theaters in Manhattan,'' he said. ''And the West Side has become a new hub for the city.'' **********Loews Theaters, meanwhile, is negotiating for a site at Avenue of the Americas and Sixth Street, where it hopes to rebuild the Loews Sheridan, the movie theater that was closed in 1970 after the property was sold to St. Vincent's Hospital. **********Mr. Meyerson is not alone in his confident assessment of the current strength of movie theater properties. Peter Elson, executive vice president of Guild Enterprises, which owns and operates eight screens in five Manhattan theaters, said scouting for potential sites had become a continuing practice for his company. **********''A good many movies that are being made today - like the 'Star Wars' series - have to be seen in theaters where there are large screens and special sound systems,'' Mr. Elson said. **********''At one time it seemed that cable would be a serious threat, but we are finding that people still want the magic of seeing a film in a movie theater.'' **********While staying alert to potential development sites, Mr. Elson said, Guild Enterprises will convert its 450- seat theater in Rockefeller Center, at 33 West 50th Street, into a twin some time before the end of the year. **********The conversion will result in one 275-seat auditorium and a theater with 375 seats.

The 53-year-old economist, who has spent more than 25 years in Washington working for such agencies as the Office of Management and Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers, was the first women to serve as a Fed governor. **********Mrs. Teeters was appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1978, when she was chief economist for the House Budget Committee, and was seen as one of the more liberal members of the Fed. In her more than five years on the board, she often disagreed with monetary policy decisions, particularly when she thought the Fed was pushing interest rates too high. **********However, despite her dissents, she generally went along with the central bank's tight monetary policy of the early 1980's, having decided that the less stringent Fed policies of the 1970's had not been successful in curbing inflation. **********Her term as a governor ended last month, and Mrs. Teeters plans to leave as soon as her replacement is appointed by President Reagan and confirmed by the Senate. In an interview last week, she reflected on her years at the Fed. Excerpts follow.   Q. How would you describe yourself as a Federal Reserve Board governor? **********A. I was probably more concerned than the other governors about the impact of very high interest rates in 1980 and 1981, and the possibility of causing a great deal of damage to both the domestic economy and then later on to the international economy. If you look at my voting record, it was usually when the rates started getting very high that I would dissent on policy decisions. I don't really have any basic disagreement with the thrust of the policy. It's just that I think we could have accomplished the same thing without the rates going over 15 or 16 percent. **********It may have taken a little bit longer, but I think that you would have gotten essentially the same result without the extraordinary high rates.  Q. Do you think, though, that the Fed's anti-inflation policy has worked? **********A. Yes. And I think it was almost inevitable, given the very sharp price increases that had occurred both in the mid-70's and again in the late 70's, that a major adjustment was necessary in order to force inflation out of not only the United States economy but the world economy as well.  Q. Do you think it's better that it happened even if the adjustment was severe? **********A. It's better that it happened. You always have a hope that you'll be able to break the back of an inflation without causing a recession. As you look back, it's very depressing to conclude that we've never been able to do it since World War II. Moreover, we really had to stop the inflationary spiral in the decade of the 70's or we would have had more severe consequences later on. I think it was the right policy. My reservations were always on the degree.  Q. Do you think that the projected budget deficits threaten to undo the Fed's accomplishments on inflation? **********A. They certainly are a major threat. The structural deficit (the deficit that remains after the economy has achieved full growth at low inflation rates) is going up. And we're going to end up with structural deficits that we haven't seen since World War II.  Q. What does that mean? **********A. It means a lot of pressure on the credit markets, which at present I don't think has shown up. Well, it has shown up because I think the whole level of interest rates is higher than it ever was in a recovery. But it hasn't reached any sort of unmanageable proportion because the rising corporate profits have provided a very substantial cash flow for the corporations to meet their investment requirements. One of the sources of financing that I certainly didn't anticipate being available to us is this very large flow of international capital to the United States. And for the richest nation in the world to be a major importer of capital does not strike me as acceptable.  Q. Is there reason to believe, as some people suggest, that the dollar will turn around soon and that this capital flow may disappear? **********A. We've been expecting the value of the dollar to drop for 18 months. The deepening current account deficit would indicate that there should be some downward pressure on the dollar, and there should have been some downward pressure on the dollar for quite some time now, except it hasn't developed.  Q. Do you believe that the economy can grow at the 4.5 percent rate that the Fed, the Administration and most private forecasters expect this year with a $180 billion deficit projected for 1984 and again for 1985? **********A. I think our current interest rates are high and we're getting a substantial recovery even with fairly high levels of interest rates.  Q. Does that mean that deficits are not that bad? **********A. No, I think it's a matter of the deficits catching up with us at some point. Very high deficits, which were heavily cyclical up until, say, this year, were not a major problem because you didn't have very much private demand for credit. But when you get a rapidly recovering economy on a growing deficit base, you're going to have more demand for credit than is domestically available. And as the foreign capital backs out, then the pressure on the domestic markets - by that I mean including the interest rates - is going to be even stronger. **********I'm much more concerned about 1985. I sat down to do my economic forecast and was surprised that, independently, I had the same view as the Fed staff of what a drag our net exports are going to be. Net exports are a vulnerable sector in the economy, and greatly depressed exports is something we have never had any experience with. It's quite possible that we'll have some sort of very unpleasant surprise.  Q. So is the President's three-year $100 billion reduction enough for this year? And what happens by waiting for further major cuts in the deficit until 1985, after the election? **********A. My opinion is we should be doing more sooner. We should never have gotten into a position of a high and rising structural deficit and so the quicker we correct them the better off we will be.  Q. Can you put a finger on what that translates into? **********A. Getting the deficit down to $50 billion by 1989 would fit my rule of thumb.  Q. Given the projected deficits, what do you think the economy looks like after 1984? **********A. I would guess that what you're going to have is a continued sluggish housing market, and a continued slowdown in the rate of business fixed investment.  Q. Another recession? **********A. You might have another recession, or you just may get down to very low rates of growth. Now, theoretically, you face the idea that you could come down to low but sustainable rates of growth in the future. Historically, it's never happened that way. It either goes up or it goes down.  Q. Is it important to have a woman on the Fed? **********A. I think it's been important to have a woman on the board but not particularly for feminist reasons. I think it's important as a breakthrough of equality of access to jobs. We don't get a lot of feminist issues around here really. But the fact that women are as qualified as men to serve in appointed jobs, it seems to me, is important.  Q. Do you think your successor should be a woman? **********A. My successor should be a person who's very well qualified for the job. I hope that turns out to be a woman.  Q. It seems that the Fed is beginning to pay more attention to the specific growth in the money supply. Is this good? **********A. I'm speaking again for myself. I think the behavior of the economy is more important than any measurement or particular component of it. Basically, what monetary and fiscal policy are aimed at is maintaining an acceptable real rate of growth which absorbs our labor force and produces a rising standard of living for our people with as low an inflation rate as we can get. **********The monetary aggregates always have to be an intermediate target because we can't give instructions to the trading desk at the New York Fed to achieve a certain gross national product in the second quarter of 1984. So you have to express those instructions in a number of ways, and in the past, we've used different ways of doing it. In the 1960's we focused on crude reserves, in the 1970's we focused on Federal funds. From 1979 to 1982, we focused on the aggregates. All of them are imperfect. If I had my druthers, I would have some sort of amalgam of all of these because I think they are all important. And to judge whether you have the right policy or not you have to see what the effect of it is. **********I think fluctuating interest rates that are associated with strict monetarism did cause a lot of damage. And I would be reluctant to go back to them. I would be equally reluctant to go back to pinpointing the Federal funds rate. **********So, I guess the one thing that I have learned is that there are no simple rules for running monetary policy, much as the outside world would like to think. There have been so many times the board has done this or that and something completely different happened. **********When you don't have rules, then you have to rely on the judgment of the people who make the policy. That doesn't bother me as long as policy makers have to explain their decisions to Congressional inquiries. But I have not yet spotted a rule that is a replacement for judgment.  Q. It appears that Fed policy since December has been aimed at holding the line and that the main worry of the Federal Open Market Committee is that the economy might begin to grow too fast. How do you feel about that? **********A. We had two back-to-back quarters of very rapid growth. If that had continued, then I would have begun to worry. But I fully expected that the rate of growth would drop off to something that was much more sustainable, like 4 percent. **********Now I think what's going to be difficult to interpret over the course of 1984 is whether this is happening. Very rarely do you get a very nice even 4 percent rate of growth. **********When you look back to the 1975 experience, at the time in the recovery of 1975 and into 1976, the current numbers in the G.N.P. see-sawed by quarters. You'd have a good quarter, then you'd have a bad quarter. But nonetheless, it seems to me that we're more likely to have a continuation of economic data that is hard to interpret.  Q. So where is the Fed now? **********A. Every individual member has a different position, and my position right now is to wait and see what happens. What I would like to see is for the rate of real growth to come down to something in the 3.5 to 4.5 percent range.  Q. How crucial was Paul Volcker to the policy of the last four and a half years? **********A. Paul has provided a lot of leadership, but it really is a collegial group. First of all, the level of staff analysis is excellent. And we're all basically working off of a common base of information. **********At an Open Market Committee meeting, the members of the committee, including the nonvoting presidents, give their views as to what they think ought to be done. With a few exceptions, the chairman usually speaks last. And one of his functions is to develop the consensus - take into account all of the advice and information, and then to develop a consensus as to what the policy should be for the next period of time. He's very good at that.  Q. What are you going to do now? **********A. Look for a job.  Q. What do you want to do? **********A. Well, I don't honestly know. There are a number of possibilities. I'm an economist by training and I do enjoy it, so I suppose it'll be in the general area of economics.  Q. More government? **********A. I doubt it. **********VOLCKER'SVAGUE PROMISES **********WASHINGTON **********Some of the people who monitor the actions of the Federal Reserve most closely suspect that its chairman, Paul A. Volcker, would acquiesce under White House pressure to aid President Reagan's re-election. Senator William Proxmire, Democrat of Wisconsin and ranking minority member of the Senate Banking Committee, tried to examine the question with Mr. Volcker last week during testimony. The following is a transcript of their discussion. Proxmire: Chairman Volcker, some have argued that the Federal Reserve has historically tried to help the incumbent in the White House in a Presidential election year by easing monetary policy. There was one conspicuous exception to that. **********In October of 1979, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve Board (adopted) a policy of slowing down the greatest increase in the supply of money, and I don't think Paul Volcker could argue that Paul Volcker did anything helpful to Jimmy Carter in 1980. **********Do you have any understanding with the Administration explicit or tacit that will involve accommodative policies in 1984? **********Volcker: No sir. **********P: Do you agree to report to this committee and to the House Banking Committee any instances of the Administration bringing pressure on the Federal Reserve to relax its policy?  V: I don't know what context you're thinking of exactly. We have close contact with Administration officials and we discuss fiscal policy and in many cases we discuss monetary policy. I don't interpret that as pressure. I don't assume you would interpret those continuing discussions as pressure. **********P: What I'm talking about (is what they) are saying to you privately or in public statements . . .   V: For political purposes? **********P: For political purposes. It's 1984.   V: I understand. I will not make a commitment that everytime I have a conversation with somebody in the Administration that I make a report on what the nature of those conversatioins were because we have a continuing discussions on various aspects of . . . **********P: I mean pressure when you see it.   V: That's why I make a distinction between a kind of continuing discussion which I think is normal and something one would interpret as part of the election campaign. I think sometimes I can tell the difference. (Laughter) **********P: Well how about letting us in on it. Will you do that?   V: If I can see the distinction.

Officials here say the real question is whether he can turn his personal popularity into a working majority in Parliament. **********It is a tantalizing question in a country grown weary of minority governments and seven elections in the last 13 years. **********The 54-year-old Prime Minister has been selling the country on a stringent cost-cutting program that he says is the only way Denmark can ultimately protect its high standard of living and one of the most generous welfare systems in Western Europe. **********He said that in his 16 months in office, Denmark's annual balance of payments deficit had been halved to about a billion dollars, inflation had been reduced to 6 percent from about 10 percent and Government spending cuts had helped turn around the flagging economy. **********Thirteen parties will be on the ballot, and surveys indicate that Mr. Schluter's four-party coalition may win 80 of the 179 seats in Parliament, a 15- seat improvement over its current 65. Even with a 15-seat improvement the Government would still be 10 seats short of a majority. If the Radical Liberal Party, which is moderate despite its name, adds one seat to its current 9, Mr. Schluter may try to form the country's first majority coalition in more than a decade.   Blocking an Opposition Majority **********However, the secret of governing in Demark, one of Europe's more stable societies, is not the creation of a working majority, it is making sure no majority is working in opposition. **********Therefore, in the view of people in Government, the Prime Minister may be content to proceed without formally bringing the Radical Liberals into the coalition. The party has already assured him that it will support his Government on the vital issue of austerity in public spending. **********Mr. Schluter called the election after his budget package for 1984 was defeated in Parliament last month. It called for deep cuts in the social welfare system. **********Mr. Schluter did not resign, a tactic that will keep him in power even if his Conservative People's Party runs second to the Social Democrats on Tuesday. **********If he falls short of his goal of stitching together 90 votes, his Government could run into more stormy times on the budget, although it is doubtful that the Social Democrats would invite public anger by forcing another election through a no-confidence vote or another determined stand against cuts in spending. **********According to a poll published today, Mr. Schluter's party is expected to take 46 seats in the new Parliament. It now has 26. The Social Democrats, with 59 seats, are expected to lose several.   Fears Within the Coaliton **********Another projected big loser is the right-wing Progress Party, the antitax party that splintered traditional Danish politics in 1973 when it entered Parliament with 28 seats. Now the party has 16 seats, its leader, Mogens Glistrup, is serving a three-year prison sentence for tax fraud, and recent polls predict it will lose 9 seats in the election. **********In the coalition, the Liberals, the Central Democrats and the anti-abortion Christian People's Party are worried that the Prime Minister's soaring popularity will draw votes away from their candidates and that their influence in the coalition will be reduced if candidates from Mr. Schluter's Conservative People's Party ride his coattails into office. **********One possible victim, officials say, could be Henning Christophersen, a Liberal who as Minister of Finance is the second most powerful figure in the Government. Paradoxically, Mr. Christophersen is regarded as the architect of the Government's fiscal strategy, and his political home is in the North Zealand area above Copenhagen where these policies are broadly welcomed by suburban commuters in the vaguely defined middle class. They, like dairy farmers and businessmen and white-collar workers who support the center-right parties, say that the country can no longer afford programs that were introduced during long years of prosperity when the country had full employment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/04/world/nicaragua-links-copter-victims-to-the-cia.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1984-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 689, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NICARAGUA LINKS COPTER VICTIMS TO THE C.I.A.", "print_headline": "NICARAGUA LINKS COPTER VICTIMS TO THE C.I.A.", "body_text": " **********The Nicaraguan Defense Minister today dismissed reports that at least two of three men killed in a helicopter over northern Nicaragua Saturday were independent mercenaries. **********''Nobody is going to believe that story,'' said the minister, Humberto Ortega Saavedra, at a news conference this afternoon.

He said the raid was part of a plan that could lead to direct American military intervention later this year or in the first months of 1985. **********''These actions can generate situations that cannot be discussed easily, but they could be very tense and difficult,'' Mr. Ortega said. ''We expect that in September and October the situation will be more tense than it has been up to now.'' **********Mr. Ortega said that three Honduran military bases at which Americans are regularly stationed, those at Jamastran, Palmerola and Aguacate, have been used as support bases for anti-Sandinista insurgents. He said that planes flying from the bases ''carry out constant aerial reconnaissance over Nicaragua to collect information that is used by the C.I.A. to plan attacks like the one at Santa Clara.'' **********At today's news conference, reporters were shown several items said to have been removed from both the helicopter and the rebel transport plane that crashed inside Nicaragua a week ago. They include burned pages from a flight manual as well as charred pieces of machinery. **********Mr. Ortega also displayed a large and detailed map of the border area that he said was used by the helicopter pilot for navigation. He said markings on the map indicated that the craft had taken off from the base at Jamastran. **********According to reports published in the pro-Sandinista press today, the four civilian victims of the air attack on Santa Clara were a 40-year-old man and three young girls who were picking fruit when the rockets began to hit. Three small planes were said to have flown with the helicopter that was shot down. They were apparently able to return safely to their base. **********Mr. Ortega said all three men aboard the plane had died either at the moment of impact or before. He said that Sandinista troops in the north are under orders to capture insurgents alive if possible and that if anyone had emerged alive from the crash, an effort would have been made to apprehend him. **********The official Sandinista newspaper, Barricada, asked in the caption accompanying the picture of the dead man thought to be an American, ''In which American state was this mercenary assassin of children and peasants born?'' **********Reporters were permitted to view the man's body at the city morgue today. It did not appear to be that of a typical Nicaraguan or Central American. **********The victim had been stocky, tall and fair-skinned. What appeared to be a bullet hole was visible in the right temple. The body was clothed in olive- green pants and a camouflage shirt. **********Mr. Ortega said the Foreign Ministry would ask the American Embassy here to assist in efforts to identify the man.

He was also asked how the United States knew that Mr. Yermishkin would be involved in activities not connected with the Olympics. **********To all these kinds of questions, he had no comment. **********The visa denial, he said, ''was a matter of internal security, the nature and details of which I am not at liberty to discuss.''

Before the Great Depression, there were more than 500 of these estates on the North Shore, according to ''The Mansions of Long Island's Gold Coast,'' a book by Monica Randall. **********As these estates, or parts of them, have been broken up and sold off, builders have been getting government permission to create new developments that are necessarily denser but in some sense true to the old uses of the land. **********Gerald and Elliot Monter, a father- and-son development team on Long Island, are builders who seem to have found a successful formula for doing that. **********In the late 1970's they purchased the former Orin Lehman estate in Jericho and built the Hamlet, an 86- acre development of 320 condominiums that were priced initially from $130,000 to above $200,000. **********Now the Monters are clearing a 76- acre tract off Shelter Rock Road in North Hills that once belonged to the Grace family for a new development of 128 single-family homes. It will be called the Hamlet Estates. **********One question is why the Monters chose to repeat the Hamlet name. (They are also building a 162-unit town house condominium development in Jericho called the Hamlet East. Units there will cost from $215,000.) **********In a recent interview, Elliott Monter explained, ''The Hamlet drew such a tremendous response, we wanted to capitalize on the name association.'' He added that he and his father also wanted to capitalize on ''the concept behind the Hamlet, which people have seen, understand and are attracted to.'' **********Part of that concept was housing designed not in the conservative colonial style common to Long Island but in a contemporary style of cathedral ceilings, open staircases and upstairs halls that overlook lower rooms. **********Despite their contemporary style, the units at the Hamlet are clustered in a way that gives privacy to the owners of each unit, but the profile of each cluster echoes the shapes of the great estate houses. **********Mr. Monter said the concern's approach to building on former estates also involves adapting principles of estate planning to tract development. **********The buildings are designed to fit onto the site, with as much of the original landscape as possible retained to preserve the characteristically rolling terrain of the North Shore. **********Mr. Monter said these were the Hamlet's general guidelines, which is what he and his father intend for the Hamlet Estates, too. The houses will range in size from 3,300 to 4,700 square feet and will be set on a minimum of two-fifths of an acre. **********They have been designed in contemporary style by Robert Swedroe of Miami. There are six basic types, and buyers may choose among several exterior colors and materials - cedar shingles or brick or stone veneer. **********The interiors will feature at least two cathedral ceilings, master bathrooms done in marble and large expanses of glass. The development will have two tennis courts, a swimming pool and a gatehouse at its own entrance on Shelter Rock Road. **********With their large dimensions and Gold Coast location, the houses are expensive, costing from $440,000 to $620,000. **********Although construction of the first phase of 47 houses will not begin until next fall, however, all 47 have already been contracted for.

Another agreed that investor demand was far less than on last Thursday, when prices began rising sharply, and added that ''a lot of other dealers seem to have decided that the Fed is not going to tighten and they want to own some securities.'' **********At the same time as price gains of up to 1 7/8 points reduced yields as much as a quarter of a percentage point for Treasury issues due in seven years or more, interest rates on short- term securities were mixed. **********6-Month Bill at 10.57% **********In the Treasury bill market, the rate for the outstanding three-month issue rose slightly as investors shifted funds from low-risk, short-term instruments into longer-term issues where prices were rising. At the regular weekly auction of new Treasury bills, the three-month issue sold at an average rate of 9.90 percent, up from 9.83 percent last week, and the six- month issue sold at 10.57 percent, down from 10.62 percent. **********While investor demand for interest- bearing Treasury notes and bonds was modest, investment bankers appear to have spotted demand for non- interest bearing, or zero coupon, Treasury issues. **********Several market participants said yesterday that Salomon Brothers was in the midst of arranging a large issue of Certificates of Accrual on Treasury Securities, or Cats, which is its name for zero-coupon Treasury issues. An official at Merrill Lynch, who asked not be be identified, acknowledged that they were preparing a large issue of Treasury Investment Growth Receipts, or Tigrs, to be created from $750 million face amount of 13 1/4 percent bonds due in 2014. **********To satisfy demand for zero-coupon issues, securities firms must purchase Treasury bonds. Those purchases, or the realization that the purchases have been made, helped raise the 13 1/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2014 to an offered price of 99 7/8, to yield 13.27 percent, up from 98 to yield 13.53 percent late Friday. Last Wednesday,the bellwether Treasury bond traded as low as 94 22/32 to yield 14 percent. **********Interest Payments 'Stripped' **********Zero-coupon Treasury issues are created by 'stripping'' the semiannual interest payments from the principal, or face amount, of a Treasury issue. Each of the semiannual interest payments can be sold as a zero-coupon security, as can the principal. Although the price of zero-coupon issues is more volatile than regular, interest bearing issues, the non-interest-bearing securities have been very popular with investors in the last two years. **********Contributors to an individual retirement account can use zero-coupon issues to ''lock in'' a high interest rate. Since there are no interest payments to be reinvested - perhaps at lower interest rates than those now prevailing - the yield of a zero-coupon issue is guaranteed by the United States Government if it is held to maturity. **********Elsewhere in the note and bond market, prices rose by a point or more for most Treasury isseus due in seven years or longer. The 13 7/8 percent notes due in 1989, which sold last Wednesday at an average price of a about 99 5/8 to yield 13.93 percent, were offered at 102 1/8 to yield 13.26 percent. **********Despite an increase in the rate for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market to 11 percent from 10.53 percent Friday, the belief was widespread that the Federal Reserve would not tighten monetary policy or encourage higher interest rates until it had more information about economic activity for May and June. The Fed temporarily supplied reserves to the banking system yesterday with one-day purchases of securities. **********Later this week, some analysts said, the Fed may make permanent purchases of Treasury notes and bonds to supply reserves that are drained from the banking system as currency in circulation rises during the summer holiday season. Another technical factor encouraging higher prices is the light schedule of Treasury financing, with no note or bond auctions until June 20. **********Many analysts continue to describe the three-day rally as a short-lived phenomenon in the midst of a longer- term trend toward higher interest rates. ''Long term, we are still looking for higher interest rates,'' reflecting strong credit demands and a Fed move to tighten monetary policy in 1985, said Bernard Markstein, a financial economist at Chase Econometrics. **********Following are results of yesterday's auctions of new three- and six- month Treasury issues:  (000 omitted in dollar figures)  3-Mo.

The group has carried out scores of similar murders in its campaign for independence for Spain's four northern provinces. **********Slain in Front of Home **********The victim, Lieut. Gen. Guillermo Quintana Lacaci, who was 67 years old and semiretired, was gunned down on the sidewalk in front of his home on Romero Robledo Street in a fashionable residential district of the capital shortly before 1 P.M. **********His wife, Elena Ramos, 50, was slightly wounded in the attack, receiving a bullet wound in the leg. A retired colonel, Francisco Gil Pachon, 64, was grazed by two shots. **********General Quintana, a veteran of the Franco forces in the 1936-39 civil war and of the Blue Division that fought alongside Nazi German forces against the Soviet Union in World War II, was a conservative military man but also a defender of the post-Franco Constitution. From 1979 until 1982 he held a key position as commander of the Madrid military region. He was instrumental in persuading officers in the strategically situated command to obey King Juan Carlos and refrain from joining an attempted coup in February 1981. **********General Quintana was the sixth army general assassinated since 1978 and the first since the Socialists took office in December 1982.   Getaway Car Is Found **********The assailants fled in a white Renault driven by an accomplice and then transferred to another car. The Renault, bearing Madrid license plates, was found by the police in a nearby street. **********Although no group had taken responsibility for the assassination by tonight, the police and officials said the attack had the markings of an E.T.A. operation. **********In particular, police sources said that 13 bullet shells recovered in front of the general's house, a building for military officers, were of a type customarily used by E.T.A. assassins. General Quintana was shot three times in the head and died instantly. **********Among the blows that have set back the Basque terrorist organization recently was a decision by the French Government to remove E.T.A. activists from southern France. According to the Spanish Government, E.T.A. leaders and militants have used bases in southern France for years to plan and execute assassinations, kidnappings and extortion across the border.   French Police in Crackdown **********In mid-January, several weeks after the problem was discussed at a meeting between Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and President Francois Mitterrand, the French police began rounding up E.T.A. activists. So far at least seven have been moved to northern France and six have been expelled from France to Guadeloupe in the Caribbean and then to Panama. **********After the French crackdown, Spanish authorities began an antiterrorist sweep of their own in the northern region. Five days ago, 14 people, including a policeman from the town of Tolosa, were arrested on charges of having links with E.T.A., whose initials in the Basque language stand for Basque Homeland and Freedom, **********At the same time, Basque refugees in southern France and suspected E.T.A. members in Spain were frightened by the actions of a shadowy organization called G.A.L. The group has vowed to retaliate in kind for every E.T.A. killing and is believed responsible for the disappearance of several E.T.A. members, **********The Socialist Government's tough stand on Basque terrorism is codified in new legislation that will permit detention without trial for up to two and a half years, increase penalties for acts of terrorism and expand police powers in searching homes, making arrests without warrants and tapping telephones. **********But it is accompanied by the stepped- up application of a year-and-a-half-old program that allows E.T.A. members abroad who renounce violence to return to Spain and pay token fines if they are not wanted for acts that shed blood. A group of four such people returned only last week.   Dramatic Exploit Expected **********It is widely believed here that the pressures closing in on E.T.A. from all sides have serverely, though perhaps not indefinitely, hampered its operations. Many expected it to engage in some dramatic exploit to show that it is still a force to contend with. Ten days ago, the police tightened security in Madrid after reports that an E.T.A. hit squad was in the capital. **********It is questionable whether the killing of General Quintana will be seen as dramatic enough. Although a high- ranking officer, he passed into semiretirement in April 1982. He was an easy target since he was not accompanied by bodyguards and often followed the same routine, attending mass at the Sacred Heart Church near his home at the same time every Sunday. **********By contrast, the previous army general killed by E.T.A., Gen. Victor Lago Roman, gunned down inside a car on Nov. 4, 1982, was still in a command position, heading the elite Brunete First Armored Division outside of Madrid. **********After the slaying today, the police mounted roadblocks around Madrid and tightened security at Barajas airport. King Juan Carlos cut short a visit to Barcelona and Queen Sofia visited the general's widow in Generalisimo Hospital."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/05/world/for-tiny-land-s-ruler-home-is-1788-rooms.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Trumbull", "pub_date": "1984-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1168, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOR TINY LAND'S RULER, HOME IS 1,788 ROOMS", "print_headline": "FOR TINY LAND'S RULER, HOME IS 1,788 ROOMS", "body_text": " **********Sultan Muda Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei rules one of the smallest independent countries, but his new 1,788-room palace on a partly manmade 100-foot hill overlooking this capital is believed to be the largest royal residence in the world. **********An informant here with intimate knowledge of the project put the cost at about $300 million, twice as much as it cost to build Madison Square Garden when that structure was completed in 1968. Other palaces may be taller or more ornate than the Brunei building, which reflects chaste Islamic taste in architecture, but none eclipses the 37-year-old Sultan's new home for sheer size. **********The four interconnected three-story buildings, topped by two globular domes encased in shining gold leaf, occupy about 50 acres and are the centerpiece of a landscaped garden that covers 300 acres, more than one- third the size of New York's Central Park. **********This magnificence will be the seat of power, with four thrones in case a foreign king and queen come calling, in a land of only 2,226 square miles, about the size of Delaware. The 500- year-old sultanate was carved out of virgin rain forest on the northern coast of the huge island of Borneo, the rest of which is divided between Malaysia and Indonesia. **********The two larger countries showed interest in absorbing tiny Brunei and its great oil wealth in the late 1950's and early 1960's. But Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin, father of the present ruler, declined an invitation to join a Malaysian federation. At his request, Britain sent Gurkha troops here under a defense treaty with London to put down an an abortive rebellion backed by Indonesia. **********Brunei is now on friendly terms with its larger neighbors, officials say. **********On Feb. 23 the new palace will be the scene of a delayed celebration of Brunei's assumption of full sovereignty on New Year's Day, when the young Sultan formally broke his state's last political links with Britain. It is expected that Britain's Prince Charles will attend the event, along with the Kings of Nepal and Tonga and diplomats and other notables from around the world. **********The polo-playing Sultan, who has supreme authority under the state's Constitution, controls revenues from oil and gas amounting to $4 billion a year, and accumulated investments abroad of about $14 billion, equivalent to about two-thirds of the foreign reserves of the United States. With such resources at his command, a $300-million palace puts no strain on the state budget.   Palace Has 1,800 Rooms **********The imminent opening of the Sultan's new palace seems to call for some revisions in the Guinness Book of Records, which lists the Vatican as the ''largest residential palace.'' The papal residence has 1,400 rooms, compared with nearly 1,800 in the Sultan's new home.  The Vatican is compressed into 13 acres, 3 acres smaller than the area of the Brunei palace's marbled floors alone, which would cover all of New York's Washington Square Park. **********For a major function like next month's independence festivity, the Sultan's palace can put 8,100 people under roofs, while more thousands will be able to view the proceedings going on inside on closed-circuit television screens mounted on numerous pillars. The public banquet hall can hold 4,000 people, 2,000 more can be accommodated in the throne room, 1,000 in the main reception hall, 500 in a ceremonial dining room, 300 in the royal banquet room and an equal number in still another reception space. **********A walking tour around the palace the other day with Alexander P. Castro of the Ayala Corporation, the Philippine contractor for the project, afforded stunning glimpses of the blended traditional and modern designs achieved by the Filipino architect Leandro Locsin. **********Moorish arches, among other features, reflect the state's Islamic character. Peaked roofs simulate the longhouses in which indigenous tribal people live, while long, smooth planes in white concrete recall Mr. Locsin's modern designs for the new Philippine Cultural Center. **********The smaller of the two golden domes caps the Sultan's private miniature mosque for worship. On the roof close by is a heliport where the ruler can land one of the craft that he likes to pilot himself. There is an underground parking area for 800 automobiles, including 100 spaces reserved for the Sultan, a motor buff, who owns about 40 sports cars.   Personal Recreation Center **********At the northern end of the quadrangular group of interconnected buildings is the Sultan's personal recreation center with a swimming pool, courts for tennis, squash and badminton and a practice field for polo. **********The whole estate is enclosed by a high fence of discreetly ornamental ironwork like the one that surrounds Buckingham Palace in London. That residence of Britain's royal family has 614 rooms, nearly 300 fewer than the 900 alloted as private quarters for the Sultan and his extended family of about 20 people, including his three brothers, their families, and the Sultan's father, who abdicated in 1967 in order to give his son training. **********The connection between the Sultan and the Ayala Corporation, one of the biggest companies in the Philippines, is the result of a long and warm friendship between the company's head, Enrique Zobel, and the Sultan, who met on the polo field when the industrialist brought a Philippine team here to play a Brunei team led by the Sultan. **********The ruler first mentioned his plan for a new palace to Mr. Zobel on Sept. 19, 1980, Mr. Castro recalled, and the contract was approved on three months later.   30 Subcontractors Hired **********Mr. Zobel went right to work, eventually hiring 30 subcontractors and 20 consultants for various phases of a job that soon had 5,000 workers on the site. ''We stopped counting the different nationalities involved when we passed 15,'' Mr. Castro said. **********A Japanese group did the landscaping. Dale Keller, an American formerly based in Tokyo and now working out of Greece, was the interior designer. The crystal chandeliers were ordered from Vienna and the carpets and fine hardwoods from the Philippines, which also supplied the bulk of the labor force.  A crew of 14 artisans from Yugoslavia is still laying down the last of the marble tiles made in Italy. The furniture was purchased in New York and Chicago. The Bechtel Corporation of the United States was engaged to construct the 3.5 miles of paved road on the palace estate. **********Brunei is thoroughly up to date in high technology, Mr. Castro said. Computerized electronic surveillance gear will function throughout the complex, ready to trigger instant countermeasures for any mechanical flaw that may develop in the elaborate mechanization, such as the air-conditioning system that will keep the huge palace cool in the worst of the subequatorial heat. **********As for the abundance of rooms, Mr. Castro said, ''this palace has been built for future generations of grandchildren.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/30/business/unc-litigation.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNC Litigation", "print_headline": "UNC Litigation", "body_text": " **********UNC Resources Inc. said an out-of-court settlement appeared to be near in its litigation involving contracts with the General Atomic Company. **********A trial, which began last week in a New Mexico state court, has been suspended pending completion of the settlement, UNC said.

THATCHER", "body_text": " **********Margaret Thatcher is the second most famous person to have grown up in this quiet market town in Lincolnshire, but you could drive into town, do some shopping, have a bite of lunch and leave without ever knowing she came from here. **********The roadside signs outside Grantham tell you it is ''twinned'' with Sankt Augustin, a town near Bonn in West Germany, but they make no mention of the fact that Britain's, indeed Europe's, first Prime Minister who is a woman was born above her father's grocery store on North Parade, at the edge of the downtown area, on Oct. 13, 1925. Nor are many of the people here likely to mention the fact unless they are asked. **********''The average person in Grantham is proud of her as a Grantham success story,'' said John Hare, the chief reporter on The Grantham Journal, a weekly. ''But she left town at 17 to go to Oxford, glad to get away, as I hear it, and she hasn't been back much. I don't think many people around Grantham know her.'' **********At W. G. Harrison Ltd., a big stationery shop on High Street, they sell a booklet called ''The Glory of Grantham,'' but it is not about Hilda Margaret Roberts Thatcher, local girl made good; it is about St. Wulfram's Church, whose handsome 14th-century crocketed spire can claim, at 272 feet, to be the sixth loftiest steeple in the realm. Harrison's stocks no books about the Prime Minister, and a clerk there commented, ''We'd be more inclined to think better of her if she put in an appearance once in a while.''  Visited Once Since 1979 **********Mrs. Thatcher has been here only once since taking office in 1979 and only twice since taking over as leader of the Conservative Party in 1975. She has never made a campaign speech in Grantham; her constituency is Finchley, in the northern suburbs of London. **********But the Prime Minister talks constantly of Grantham, its country common sense, and the values she learned here. On her last visit, in February 1982, she stopped at the grammar school where she prepared for Oxford, the Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School, and told the students that she had learned there a sense of discipline and duty - ''a marvelous foundation.'' **********A country, she often says, can no more live beyond its means than could her family in the days when she sliced bacon and weighed beans in the shop. With evident pride, she once told a national television audience that her father, Alfred Roberts, earned only 12 shillings a week when he came to Grantham, of which he spent 10 shillings on food and housing, putting aside a shilling as ''spending money'' and saving a shilling. He was finally able to buy the shop where he worked, and he later served as Mayor. **********It is the Roberts shop that provides the only visible memento of Mrs. Thatcher's life here. Derelict for years - ''The most famous eyesore in town,'' The Journal called it - the shop was sold three years ago to Rodney Cloke, a businessman from southern England, who turned it into a restaurant called The Premier. The shop's windows and the reception area have been restored to their appearance during the Prime Minister's girlhood, with cans and packages from that era carrying the prices that were charged in those days.   'They're Typically English' **********Victoria Buckley, the manager, says the restaurant's first year ''has been very good, considering the recession,'' and she says customers come from all parts of England and from abroad to eat where the Prime Minister was born. But the town, she said, ''doesn't seem to take much notice - they're typically English, reluctant ever to blow their own trumpet.'' **********Grantham's only visible tribute to its famous daughter is a tiny slate plaque, high up on the outside wall of the shop, invisible to all but the most observant passer-by. Another is in the Guildhall. **********The man the locals brag about is Sir Isaac Newton, the mathematician and philosopher, who was born at Woolsthorpe Manor, seven miles south of town, where he is said to have deduced the law of gravity from watching an apple fall from a tree. He went to the King's School in Grantham, leaving behind his name carved on a windowsill. **********A statue of Newton, holding a mathematical diagram in his left hand, stands in front of the Guidhall, and Grantham boasts a Newton pub, road and school, plus a spanking-new, $15 million Sir Isaac Newton Shopping Center.   The Gold Yawn Award **********Not a great deal happens here these days. As a matter of fact, when a BBC radio disk jockey conducted a contest to find the most boring town in the country, it was Grantham that was given the ''Golden Yawn Award.'' **********Such tourists as come to Grantham come mostly because of the Newton connection. Last summer, said Doreen Cubitt of the local tourist office, only about 15 of the 350 inquiries she averaged each week came from people asking about the Prime Minister. The mimeographed sheet she hands out for those wanting to make a tour describes St. Wulfram's and Grantham House, where Margaret Tudor stayed on her trip to Scotland to marry James IV, and the George Hotel, which is mentioned in ''Nicholas Nickleby,'' and even the working beehive outside the Beehive Inn. **********It says nary a word about the Prime Ministerial birthplace. **********Nor has Mrs. Thatcher's success meant new jobs for Grantham. Unlike some American Presidents and members of Congress, British Prime Ministers do not favor their birthplaces with military installations or other big government centers. **********But Grantham remains loyally Tory, saving the Prime Minister the embarrassment of having her hometown voting for the opposition. The local Member of Parliament is Douglas Hogg, scion of an old Conservative family whose father, Viscount Hailsham, is in his second term as Lord Chancellor. **********The town also has several pubs whose names include the Tory color, blue - The Blue Pig, The Blue Bell, and so on. But that reflects the local politics of the 17th century, not the 20th. The pubs ''turned blue'' to match the allegiance of a powerful local squire, the Earl of Dysart."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/18/business/felec-contracts.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Felec Contracts", "print_headline": "Felec Contracts", "body_text": " **********Felec Services Inc. received two Air Force contracts totaling $278.8 million to operate early warning facilities, the Defense Department said.

He is preaching cooperation - between companies, states and countries - as the solution. His Minneapolis-based company has helped set up a research program with the State of Minnesota and the University of Minnesota and has also helped establish a joint research venture between several computer companies. **********Q. What about the challenge from Japan? **********A. The Japanese are taking advantage of us. They're living off our technology. That has to be addressed but in a totally constructive way that's good for them as well as for us. It's not in their best interest to continue relying upon our technology. The situation can be improved by furthering access to technology on an equitable basis. Their access here is far better than our access over there. **********Q. What do you urge to ease that situation? **********A. First, the states should cooperate among themselves by setting up research institutes in different fields - advanced materials, acid rain, toxic materials. There's a host of technologies that are very high-risk, very long-term and will not be addressed by the private sector unless there's a partnership with government. Many states are setting up innovation centers or research institutes, but it would be much better to pool their resources. **********Q. Do you think a regional approach would **********be better than a Federal one? **********A. Yes, because the Feds can't get their act together. You can't get a consensus from Congress on damn near anything or in the executive branch of the Government. There are just too many diverse interests. This country was blessed - I guess it's turning out to be a curse - with economic activity so high that everybody could go off in his own direction and we still prospered. But we didn't have to reckon then with foreign competition. As you know, 70 percent of our domestic market is exposed to imports, and we can't afford everybody going in his own direction any longer. **********Q. What other cooperative measures are you **********calling for? **********A. Another thrust is to get cooperation from other countries. We're thinking in terms initially of two countries: Japan and Britain. The idea is for Japan also to participate in those research centers and for the United States and the regions to participate in centers in Japan. The reason for picking Japan is the serious inequities regarding access to technology. The reason for picking Britain is that it is the second most productive country in technology research. They're very inventive, but they don't carry it on through the innovation process. It would be in their best interest to have a close working relationship with the United States. **********Q. Why would Japan give up information it **********might want to keep for itself? **********A. Another part of our concept is that there should be a balance in the technology exchange. We're planning to set up a technology bank, which will keep track of technology flows. If a company feels it has to sell some technology to improve its cash flow and it gets an offer from the Japanese for a couple of hundred thousand dollars, it would sell the technology to the technology bank. Then the bank will make sure that we get an appropriate exchange of technology from the Japanese. **********Q. What about the Administration's efforts **********for licensing computer exports to Europe? **********A. Even if you can't sell technology, it will seep out from under you, for one thing. A more appropriate approach is to set it up on the basis of, for instance, when the Soviet Union gets some technology from us, we get something back from them. And boy, they've got plenty of it. It's not in a commercialized form - it's research results. And that's really the most important thing of all. **********Q. Wouldn't that hurt us militarily? **********A. If we get technology from the Soviet Union that's equivalent to what we give them and it's not any of this exotic military stuff, I think that's a fine deal for the United States, and I think it would not change the military picture. After all, the Russians don't seem to lack much when it comes to military capability, in spite of all the controls we've had. **********Q. Control Data is pushing public-private **********ventures in Minnesota. Is that creating jobs? **********A. It's starting to. The discouraging aspect is that you don't create jobs overnight, and most politicians have a pretty short time span in office. They want results now, so it's hard to get support for long-term projects like job creation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/12/business/putting-the-disabled-to-work.html": {"writer_name": "N.

He picked up a small lens that was wired to a device that resembled a tape recorder. It was called an Optacon. He deftly ran the lens over a computer printout while he stuck his left index finger into the tape recorder-like device. As the lens swept over sentences, the device vibrated. Mr. Wiggins has been trained to translate the vibrations into words. **********Mr. Wiggins, 49 years old, works as a computer programmer here in Wilmington for E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. Late in 1972, a benign tumor was removed from his optic nerve. Ever since, he has been blind. **********W. J. Schaffers, Mr. Wiggins's boss, estimated that Du Pont had spent about $19,000 on adjustments for his handicap. He considered it a trivial expense. ''His attitude is remarkable,'' Mr. Schaffers said. ''Just close your eyes and see how you feel. With the sun outside and everything, and the man has no sight. He's a tremendous influence on all of us with his attitude.'' **********Discrimination against the handicapped has been one of the simmering civil rights issues of the 1970's and 1980's. Du Pont has attracted attention for its willingness to treat the disabled like anyone else and to make the physical and mental adjustments necessary for the handicapped to work for the company. **********''There are a number of major corporations - not too big a number - that are willing to stand up and be counted in their employment of the handicapped, and Du Pont is one of them,'' said Bernard Posner, executive director of the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped. ''It's among the Alps in this area.'' **********A Terminal That 'Talks' **********In addition to his Optacon ''reader,'' Mr. Wiggins proudly shows off his new ''talker,'' an electronic machine called the Vert 6000. Plugged into any computer terminal, it could make the terminal ''talk.'' Mr. Wiggins typed some sentences onto the screen. Out of a small speaker, through the wonders of voice synthesis, words emerged. The pronunciation was not the best, but Mr. Wiggins seemed able to figure it out. **********He uses earphones so co-workers won't be disturbed. ''I don't always like the earphones,'' he said. ''They get a little warm on your head when you have them on all the time. My co- worker here gets used to the noise - my Vert talking and my Optacon buzzing.'' **********And other co-workers include James Prettyman, a blind spin pump mechanic for Du Pont in Seaford, Del. By touch, he services dozens of pumps a day. There are Bill and Barbara Monaghan, both mentally retarded. They met at a school for the handicapped, fell in love and married. Now they work as messengers at Du Pont's headquarters. **********Du Pont's sensitivity to the handicapped dates to the company's early years. Its business then was gunpowder, made in mills that perched along the banks of the Brandywine River in Wilmington. In the middle 1850's, an explosion at one of the black powder mills killed a number of employees and maimed others. **********Du Pont points to that episode as the trigger for the first pension plan of an industrial company. It provided compensation for the families of those killed and found jobs for the disabled. Ever since, Du Pont has been attuned to safety and continuation of employment. **********Periodically, Du Pont produces a statistical portrait of how the handicapped perform. It is an unusual study, important because there is so much mythology about how well the handicapped hold down jobs. **********The most recent report, in 1981, showed that Du Pont employed 2,745 handicapped workers, about 2.4 percent of its work force. Its handicapped employment grew by 89 percent from the 1973 level, while overall employment climbed 13 percent. **********In job performance, supervisors rated 92 percent of handicapped workers as average or above, compared with 91 percent for nonimpaired employees. Some 85 percent were average or above in attendance, compared with 91 percent for the able-bodied. In safety, 96 percent of the handicapped were average or above, while 92 percent of the others were in that category. **********''The bottom line is we've got a job to be done,'' said Mark Suwyn, Du Pont's vice president for employee relations. ''And we need to find people who are 150 percent enthusiastic and have the ability to do the job. And we find that there are a lot of handicapped people who can do that.'' As for failures, he said the only case that came to mind was an epileptic who was unable, mentally or physically, to handle his work. **********Brian Hennessey, a draftsman in Du Pont's engineering department, is 27 and has been deaf since birth. He wanted to explain what the attitude of his co-workers has been like. His hands worked nimbly. He wore an easy smile. His thoughts were conveyed by an interpreter. **********''I'm really like a normal person,'' Mr. Hennessey said. ''Just if they have a meeting they have to prepare notes for me. And if there's a really important meeting that requires dialogue, then they hire an interpreter.'' **********''Here I am,'' Elrey McCann said. He was wheeling down the hallway in what appeared to be a hopped-up scooter. Mr. McCann is 41, a research chemist. He suffers from multiple sclerosis. **********He puttered into his office and sat down in an amply-cushioned chair. ''I'll take the best seat,'' he said. He talked about life at Du Pont since his affliction began to hamper his mobility five years ago: **********''I have difficulty walking. That's how it started. They began by giving me my own private parking place. Then they put up railings outside on the sidewalks to make it easier for me. Then it got worse. In 1982, they got me this motorized wheelchair to allow me to get around the building better.'' **********''Du Pont then built a special ramp that allows me to drive up the parking lot,'' he continued. ''There was this grassy hill. This thing doesn't go up grassy hills very well. So they built me this concrete freeway. Then there's another handrail that they built for me out front. Special grab bars were built in the washroom. The other thing is, everyone I work with doesn't hesitate to help me. Everyone I work for treats me like everyone else. I'm not some poor soul.'' **********He chuckled, then added, ''I met a fellow in the hospital several years ago whose employer said that if you can walk up this flight of stairs and get to your office and then walk down at the end of the day, you can have your job. Otherwise, forget it. He had to forget it. Here, you don't have to forget it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/14/business/business-people-alexander-baldwin-names-new-president.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 299, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ALEXANDER & BALDWIN NAMES NEW PRESIDENT", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; ALEXANDER & BALDWIN NAMES NEW PRESIDENT", "body_text": " **********Michael S.

Crocker, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, will leave on Wednesday and fly to South Africa to confer with officials there, before going on to Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique, and possibly other African nations, officials said. **********Meanwhile, Mr. Crocker's senior deputy, Frank G. Wisner, has just met with Angolan officials in Cape Verde, after they in turn had conferred with South African diplomats. Mr. Wisner is now in Lisbon, but will fly to Luanda, the Angolan capital, if the Angolan leaders decide to continue the diplomatic effort that is under way, State Department officials said. **********''We want to explore with the Angolans the potential for moving forward on the whole issue of regional security in southern Africa,'' one department official said. ''That is a code word for implementation of Security Council Resolution 435 on Namibia, circumstances in which there will be parallel movement on the Cuban troop issue.'' **********There are some 25,000 Cuban combat troops, as well as about 2,000 Soviet and 5,000 East German advisers in Angola. They are helping the Government there protect itself from attacks from the opposition group known as the Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, led by Jonas Savimbi, as well as from South African military incursions into southern Angola. The South Africans recently carried out a major military action in Angola aimed at the Namibian rebels who are based there, the South- West Africa People's Organization. **********The Reagan Administration has given the Namibia issue a relatively high priority, and in 1981 then Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. was optimistic that a solution could be worked out soon. But the United States, working with its allies, was unable to persuade Angola to agree to a parallel withdrawal of Cuban troops. **********The Angolans have been insisting that the South Africans pull all their troops out of Angola and accept the provisions of Security Council Resolution 435, which calls for the entry of United Nations troops into Namibia, the withdrawal of South African troops and elections for a constituent assembly. Only then, the Angolans have said, would they ask the Cubans to leave.   'There Is Cautious Optimism' **********But State Department officials said the Angolans and their backers have to understand that there will not be a solution unless the South African concerns about the Cubans are taken care of. **********''We are underscoring the point,'' one official said, ''that there is no change in the American position on the importance of parallel movement. It is our clear understanding that the South Africans will not bend on that.'' **********''I would say that there is cautious optimism,'' one official said, in speaking about the new effort. **********This is because, in part, the Angolan Government has suffered from military defeats at the hands of the Unita forces and from the South African incursions. Another factor, officials said, is that the United States has offered to establish diplomatic relations with Angola once the Cubans are gone. This would carry with it an implicit promise of American economic aid.   Rains Slow Military Activity **********The rainy season in Angola will last through March, making military activity difficult. This is seen by officials here as giving the diplomats at least that much time to work with before the strife is likely to break out again. **********After his talks in Africa Mr. Crocker will fly to Europe to meet with the four Western ''contact'' countries, Britain, Canada, France and West Germany, that together with the United States have acted as a kind of intermediary."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/10/business/citicorp-shakes-up-chicago.html": {"writer_name": "Winston Williams", "pub_date": "1984-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1071, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CITICORP SHAKES UP CHICAGO", "print_headline": "CITICORP SHAKES UP CHICAGO", "body_text": " **********The executives sent here six weeks ago by Citicorp to merge the $4 billion First Federal Savings and Loan Association into the bank holding company have barely unpacked, but already there are signs of the changes they promise to bring to banking here. **********In a series of moves aimed at building the ailing thrift unit into a major banking force in Chicago, Citicorp officials have cut its mortgage lending rates, raised deposit rates and aggressively promoted a wide range of new and traditional services. At the same time, a well-coordinated advertising and public relations blitz has kept Citicorp's name before the public as First Federal's new owners. **********The moves appear to be paying off. Citicorp officials say that First Federal's mortgage loan applications are up sharply and that new deposits are on the rise. And competing bankers concede that Citicorp has quickly won high visibility in the Chicago market. **********''They've come in as strong competitors,'' said William Kundert, vice president-personal banking at the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company. ''They've had a heavy focus on advertising and community involvement.'' **********'Expandable' C.D.'s **********Citicorp's most dramatic move yet, however, came with its heavily promoted introduction two weeks ago of a new ''six-month expandable certificate of deposit.'' **********The certificates, which have set Chicago banking circles abuzz, permit depositors, after an initial investment of $1,000, to increase their investment by $100 increments until maturity. The interest rate at sign-on is guaranteed for any subsequent deposits. **********''They're taking a big chance on this product,'' said Edmond Shanahan, president of Bell Federal Savings and Loan. ''I'm surprised they didn't put some limits on it. They could lose a bundle if rates go down.'' **********Taking risks on consumer banking has become characteristic of Citicorp since the late 1970's, however, when it made a strategic decision to rapidly expand its consumer deposits. In the last few years, that strategy has made it a leader in the movement to win approval for interstate banking. **********Monitoring State Banking Laws **********Citicorp has a staff of hundreds that monitors state banking laws and lobbies legislatures for changes in favor of interstate banking. Since last year, Citicorp has acquired three big thrift units from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board: Fidelity Savings of Oakland, Calif., Biscayne Federal of Miami and First Federal. **********When it became known for certain that Citicorp would be coming to Chicago, bankers here studied its operating habits in California, where Fidelity Federal became profitable within a year of being acquired. **********The locals apparently did not learn the extent of Citicorp's eagerness to get into the Chicago market. Other local bidders for First Federal, including Sears, Roebuck & Company and many of the city's larger banks, were caught flat-footed by Citicorp's willingness to spend. **********Purchase Price Criticized **********Area bankers said later that the $120 million Citicorp paid for First Federal was far too much for an institution with a negative net worth of $470 million. **********''We paid what we think the future of First Federal is worth,'' said Barry Burkeholder, who was sent from Citicorp's mortgage lending subsidiary in St. Louis to become chairman of First Federal. **********''It fits in with our long-term strategy of serving consumers,'' he continued. ''Consumer financial services is a rapidly evolving market. There are a lot of big names that have decided that this is where it's at in the 1980's and 1990's, and this is just part and parcel of that.'' **********Citicorp's revenues from consumer banking activities rose by 26 percent last year, to $2.4 billion, while income from consumer banking soared to $202 million, about one-fifth of total profits, from $66 million. The holding company aim is to generate one-third of its profits from consumer activity. **********Challenged By Attorney General **********Citicorp's arrival here has not been an unalloyed success. Neil Hartigan, the Illinois Attorney General, is challenging First Federal's takeover in Federal court in an effort to get the F.H.L.B.B. to disclose more details about the bids that it rejected. In the meantime, a cloud of uncertainty hangs over the merger. **********Another incident illustrates how an out-of-town outfit can make embarrassing mistakes when dealing on unfamiliar territory. **********Two weeks ago, Citicorp Information Services published a rosy outlook for the Chicago area's economy and its commercial real estate markets. The study, which generated good television coverage and a banner headline on page one of The Chicago Tribune, was almost immediately refuted by local real estate experts. The analysts contended that Citicorp's assumptions on commercial office space contained gross errors. **********Chagrined, the bank admitted its errors to the press - but stoutly defended its conclusions. **********Reversing Prior Image **********While looking for a grand strategy, the thrift unit is concentrating on getting bigger. And growing, in this case, means offering higher rates on deposits and lower rates on loans. **********''Any consumer who shopped the market place would not have come to First Federal,'' Mr. Burkeholder conceded in a recent interview. **********But mortgage rates have now been cut. Interest rates on 30-year adjustable mortgages have fallen to 9.875 percent from 10.9 percent; there is a 2 percent cap on monthly increases, where there was none before, and a new 15-year fixed mortgage has been introduced, at 13.25 percent. **********First Federal, with 61 branches, already enjoys a considerable advantgage over its commercial bank competitiors, most of which are limited by state law to three deposit-taking locations. Still, the thrift unit's new managers are trying to become part of an automated teller network that has outlets in 270 Jewel food stores. **********First Federal says it will now sell more of its mortgage loans in the secondary market, a practice virtually ignored by previous management. It intends to actively seek loan business from small entrepreneurs and professionals. And consumer services in areas only recently authorized for thrift units - auto loans, Visa cards and checking accounts - will receive special emphasis. **********But Citicorp is also courting a reputation for civic-mindedness here, as it did in the San Francisco area, as one way to earn acceptance in this market. It promises a ''dramatic'' announcement concerning Dearborn Park, a downtown residential redevelopment that is its initial civic project. **********In the Bay area, Citicorp executives contributed their expertise to such nonprofit groups as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the United Way, and to neighborhood housing rehabilitation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/28/business/key-rates-082881.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 104, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/24/business/dollar-sale-explained.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 169, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dollar Sale Explained", "print_headline": "Dollar Sale Explained", "body_text": " **********Contary to widespread belief, the dramatic sales of dollars by the West German central bank last Friday was not part of a grand European plan to drive down the price of the United States currency, according to German bankers attending the annual meetings here of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. **********The move, in which the Deutsch Bundesbank sold about $450 million of dollars, was designed to stabilize the foreign exchange markets and to earn a profit by selling dollars when the price was particularly high, the bankers said. **********''The Bundesbank regarded the hectic upward movement of the dollar as disorderly,'' said Walter Seipp, chairman of the Commerzbank, one of West Germany's three largest commercial banks.

The reason: Many of the fired brokers have become ''introducing brokers,'' and they are generating even more business for the discounters. **********Introducing brokers, or I.B.'s, as they are known in the trade, are not a new phenomenon. What is new and promises to radically change the futures and options brokerage business is the large numbers of experienced account executives who are becoming I.B.'s. **********Herbert Young, president of Lind-Waldock & Company, the largest futures discount broker, explained: ''The growing number of I.B.'s are one of the major reasons discounters have been getting larger shares of the futures business. These are people with the kind of experience you can't go out and buy. And they don't clear their clients' business through firms like ours just because they are mad at their former employers.'' **********Lind-Waldock, for example, has attracted hundreds of former account executives, many of whom work out of their homes, by offering them legal help in registering as I.B.'s. Depending on the I.B.'s past record, the company will advance the $25,000 guarantee fee, and, if the I.B. generates enough business, the discounters will provide equipment that allows the I.B. to transmit orders from a home or office directly to the exchange trading floor through the discount house's own computer systems. **********Another reason why the discounters cultivate the I.B.'s is that they, not the brokerage house that clears the trade, are responsible to the client. **********''For the I.B. to make a living, he has to offer competitive commissions,'' Mr. Young continued. ''With the rates charged by discounters, the I.B. can offer competitive rates, tack on something for himself and still give his client a lower commission than that offered by the full-service houses. Right now, we have 771 I.B.'s. A year from now, we think there will be more than 5,000, and they will all be clearing through discount houses.'' **********Until the Futures Trading Act of 1982 became law, the typical I.B. was a small-town agent who would execute his client's commodity futures business through the nearest branch of a major brokerage house. As an agent, they were not liable for any mistakes in execution of orders, only the clearing brokerage house was. The 1982 law shifted that liability to the agent or I.B. **********To become an I.B. now requires passing stringent competency examinations and registration with both the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures Association, an industry self-policing group created in 1982 with the blessing of Congress. **********Last week, Susan Philips, chairman of the regulatory agency, said in a telephone interview: **********''The N.F.A. has done such a great job in helping us process I.B.'s and A.P.'s, or persons associated with the I.B.'s, that we plan to turn over the whole responsibility to it by Dec. 3. We will then be able to use our resources to crack down on shady operators as well as perform the other oversight duties mandated by Congress.'' **********Robert K. Wilmouth, N.F.A.'s president and former chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, the nation's largest futures exchange, said the agency had given his group the responsibility for policing and registering ''about 90,000 futures account executives, commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisers, futures commission merchants and others involved in the industry.'' **********''Our two-year-old association has done a fine job policing our industry, thanks to the help of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement groups,'' Mr. Wilmouth noted, ''to the point that I doubt any of the many our group has barred or expelled can ever deal in futures again.'' **********Thomas A. Russo, partner in the Wall Street law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and one of the writers of the first regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission a decade ago, observed; **********''For better or worse, the N.F.A. is now the most powerful regulator in the commodity industry, and I must say that thus far it has been a force for good. But the N.F.A. has also greatly speeded up and facilitated the process of becoming an I.B. How they are going to police the tens of thousands of potential I.B.'s is something else.'' **********How does an industry get to regulate itself? Faced with growing demands for stricter Government regulation of the futures business, the industry persuaded Congress in 1982 to give it the opportunity to police itself at its own expense, and Congress agreed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/05/world/with-a-sir-at-stake-floridan-wins-the-day.html": {"writer_name": "Jo Thomas", "pub_date": "1984-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 996, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WITH A 'SIR' AT STAKE, FLORIDAN WINS THE DAY", "print_headline": "WITH A 'SIR' AT STAKE, FLORIDAN WINS THE DAY", "body_text": " **********To hundreds who have not actually met him, he is the frail, white-haired steward who on a Saturday or Sunday once showed them to a seat in Canterbury Cathedral. He has been a banker and a British Army officer. In childhood, his mother introduced him as ''the little baronet.'' **********This week, 91 years into his life, he finally had to concede that he would never be a baronet, only William Henry George Dunbar of Kilconzie. **********The venerable title of Dunbar of Mochrum rests securely in the hands of Colonel Dunbar's American cousin, the 13th baronet, Sir Jean Ivor Dunbar, according to a ruling last week by Lord Lyon, King of Arms, who decides on matters of nobility in Scotland. **********''Oh I'm a bona fide baron all right,'' said Sir Jean, a 66-year-old retired jockey. ''That bum tried to challenge my title.'' The baronet, who says he once rode for Al Capone, spoke to an interviewer last week at his apartment in Pembroke Pines, Fla., where he moved to be close to Calder Race Course. **********''The judgment is bitter, I assure you,'' said Colonel Dunbar, whose pursuit of the baronetcy has cost him three years and $14,000 in court costs and attorneys' fees. ''But as a soldier, I say good luck and good fortune - let him proceed.'' **********Succession Is Challenged **********Colonel Dunbar's half-brother, Richard, had held the title, but died within days of inheriting it. It then passed, not to the colonel, but to Sir Jean's father and then to Sir Jean. The colonel, who was disqualified because he was illegitimate at birth, subsequently challenged the succession under a 1968 law that says an ille gitimate child whose parents eventually marry can inherit a title under certain circumstances. **********Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, praised the decision, saying: ''If it had gone the other way, it would have opened a Pandora's box for the genealogical world because it would mean that any illegitimate member of a noble family could instigate a claim, spurious or otherwise, for a title,'' . **********The tale of the two cousins is worthy of Dickens. **********Sir Jean, according to Mr. Brooks- Baker, was born in the United States and had to fend for himself after the death of his mother, who was Belgian and considered by her husband's family to be socially inferior. His father went home to Scotland, married well and had two more sons. The son he left behind became a jockey when he was a teen-ager. **********When it became clear that the jockey would become the next baronet, Mr. Brooks-Baker said, the family sold off the family silver and a huge family estate, complete with the family ghost, an ancestor named Jacobina Copland, whom the 10th baronet said he once saw and whose footsteps he reported often hearing.   Lineage Is Verified **********Hugh Peskett, the senior genealogist at Burke's Peerage, found Sir Jean's birth certificate and his parents' marriage certificate, which gave him both the family title and the family trust fund. **********Colonel Dunbar and Sir Jean are first cousins once removed. The colonel's father and Sir Jean's grandfather were brothers. **********Colonel Dunbar, unlike his cousin, was brought up in a comfortable home and educated at the best schools. He was 12 when his mother learned, to her shock, that his father had another family, which he had abandoned, that the first wife was still living and that her son was therefore illegitimate. **********Although his parents legitimized him by marrying again when he was 19, his claim to the title was ruined. Instead of spending his twilight years as a baronet, he has spent them as a pensioner. **********''Everyone knows that William the Conqueror was a bastard and that of the 25 nonroyal dukes in England today, five are descended from Charles II's bastards,'' said Mr. Brooks-Baker. ''Most English monarchs and every single English noble family has a large number of illegitimate members. Burke's Peerage is not against illegitimacy. The point is that when there is a legitimate heir, he must take precedence over an illegitimate one, because his rights are somewhat greater.''  'I'm Strictly United States' **********From the sitting room of Greenways, where his rose garden lies a few hundred yards from the shore in Herne Bay, Kent, Colonel Dunbar conceded that he didn't know his cousin very well, although he remembers his cousin's father, Sir Adrian. **********''I went up to his place in Scotland,'' he said. ''He wasn't quite the person to hold a baronetcy. He didn't know the behavior patterns. So of course he didn't have many friends.'' **********The colonel, who has written three books about the Dunbars, explained that the family traces its line to the younger son of Crinan the Thane, who died in 1045. Crinan's older son, Duncan, was murdered by Macbeth. **********''I'm strictly United States,'' said Sir Jean in his Florida apartment as he talked happily of his career as a jockey - he won 601 races in 22 years. ''I was born here, and I intend to die here.'' **********After his career as a jockey, he worked as a cloth cutter in the New York garment district for $200 a week. **********''I'm one of the best cutters in the country and I'm one of the best riders,'' he said. He added that his life had been threatened when he rode horses owned by Al Capone in the mid-1930's in Chicago. **********Although he is happy that people now know his title is authentic, ''I don't want to be called sir. **********''Just call me plain Jean,'' he said. **********Lucy Breznikar, a former neighbor, was one of several who said she hadn't believed he was a baronet. ''He told me that,'' she said. ''I thought maybe he was dreaming, just like I do sometimes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/10/business/no-headline-055881.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 658, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********TUESDAY, JULY 10, 1984 **********Companies **********Eastern Airlines touched off a fare war by announcing a major cut in its New York-Florida price.

The Latin American network now reaches the embassies in Buenos Aires; Rio de Janeiro; Caracas, Venezuela, and San Jose, Costa Rica. **********For Mr. Kissinger's news conference, there was simultaneous interpretation into Spanish and, for the transmission to Brazil, into Portuguese.

If the manner of our approach was wrong, we apologize publicly for that.'' **********Despite the words of conciliation, however, a source familiar with the Register company characterized the participation of the two executives in the buyout offer as ''a palace coup'' motivated in part by their loss of confidence in Mr. Kruidenier and their concern that the company was vulnerable to a takeover. **********The company has tentatively scheduled a board meeting for Dec. 10 to make a decision about the offer.

He said American naval and air forces off the coast would now attack any units behind Syrian lines that were firing into the Beirut area. That would break with the practice of firing only when Americans were threatened. **********The decision to move the marines and to intensify naval and air action was taken after an intensive review of the worsening political and military situation in Beirut in recent days. **********On Capitol Hill, lawmakers from both parties praised Mr. Reagan's move, but many said the decision was an acknowledgment that his policy in Lebanon had failed. (Page A11.) **********White House and Pentagon officials said after the President's announcement that it might take as long as a month for the marines to turn over the task of guarding the Beirut airport to the Lebanese Army before moving to ships offshore. (Page A8.) **********Some Personnel to Remain **********Mr. Reagan said some American military personnel would remain in Lebanon to continue training and supplying Lebanese armed forces and to protect the remaining personnel. **********The shift in the location of the marines and the new battle orders were announced in a printed statement handed to reporters after Mr. Reagan arrived at the Point Mugu Naval Air Station near Santa Barbara, Calif., where he has gone on vacation for the rest of this week. **********Mr. Reagan said Britain, France and Italy, who with the United States form the multinational force in the Beirut area, had been ''consulted.'' But it appeared that the allies could not have had more than a few hours' warning. **********Italy Urges 4-Nation Meeting **********The Italian Foreign Minister, Giulio Andreotti, in an urgent message to Secretary of State George P. Shultz today, asked for a meeting of foreign ministers of the multinational-force countries to discuss the future of the force. Mr. Reagan's statement seemed to assume that the allies would keep their forces in the Beirut area while the Americans were moved to ships, but it was unclear what the others would do. **********In London, senior officials said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was on the verge of ordering Britain's 115-member military contingent out of Beirut. The British attitude became known a few hours before Mr. Reagan's announcement. (Page A11.) **********Mr. Reagan also said President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon had ''requested'' the steps that he announced. It was not immediately clear when that request was made. **********Moslems Hold West Beirut **********The steps were taken after Moslem militias took control of West Beirut from the Lebanese Army and President Gemayel's Cabinet resigned. Mr. Reagan, however, did not describe the moves as a retreat but as ''decisive new steps'' aimed at demonstrating American resolve to continue to back the Gemayel Government. **********Mr. Reagan said in the statement that even before the latest outbreak of violence in Beirut, ''we had been considering ways of reconcentrating our forces and the nature of our support in order to take the initiative away from the terrorists.'' **********The decision to redeploy the marines away from the Beirut airport, where they had been since September 1982, came as a surprise. The Administration had been vigorously resisting calls by House Democrats for the marines to be removed from Lebanon. Spokesmen for the Administration had said that pulling the marines out of Lebanon now would be tantamount to giving in to terrorists, and they had vowed that the Administration would not ''cut and run,'' in the words of Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the No. 3 man in the State Department. **********The move to the ships, however, was a proposal favored by Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, who had publicly called for it last October after 241 American servicemen were killed in a suicide truck bombing at the Marine headquarters at the airport. **********According to White House aides the President tentatively agreed to these steps on Sunday, but gave his final assent only today.  Senior Administration officials and diplomatic sources in Washington said earlier that the rapid political and military deterioration had been caused by the refusal of some 30 to 40 percent of the Lebanese Army to fight in recent days and the continued refusal by Syria to cooperate in a political solution.   Declines Television Appearance **********In the past, Mr. Reagan has personally addressed the nation on important Middle East developments. He did so when the marines were sent to Beirut and he did so after the killing of the servicemen in Beirut. But tonight he chose not to speak in front of television cameras in announcing a decision that may be interpreted as a retreat in Lebanon, although he went out of his way to describe it as a strengthening of resolve. **********Mr. Reagan said the moves were consistent with the agreement reached with Congress last fall to keep the marines in Lebanon for no more than 18 months. That accord said the size and mission of the Marine force could not be changed without Congressional approval. It seemed as if the increased military role to be played by American naval and air forces might reflect a change in that understanding. **********Congressional leaders were kept informed as today's events unrolled. Senate Howard H. Baker Jr., the majority leader, said he had talked to Vice President Bush ''off and on all day.'' **********''The first conversation with him was early this morning, and in the course of the day he's kept me apprised of the situation,'' he said on Cable News Network. **********Mr. Baker said that late in the morning Deputy Secretary of State Kenneth W. Dam briefed him and Senator Robert C. Byrd, the Democratic leader, and that in the afternoon ''I received a call from the Vice President indicating that the President would make a statement about 5:55 or 6 o'clock.'' **********The decision, he said, ''was clearly being considered'' at the time of the briefing by Mr. Dam. **********The decision to use naval and air power against any forces attacking Beirut will be welcomed by Mr. Gemayel, whose own forces have been set back badly by the refusal of Moslem soldiers and officers to fight in West Beirut.   'We Will Stand Firm' **********Mr. Reagan said, ''I have authorized U.S. naval forces, under the existing mandate of the multinational force, to provide naval gunfire and air support against any units firing into greater Beirut from parts of Lebanon controlled by Syria as well as against any units directly attacking American or M.N.F. personnel or facilities.'' **********''Those who conduct these attacks will no longer have sanctuary from which to bombard Beirut at will,'' he said. ''We will stand firm to deter those who seek to influence Lebanon's future by intimidation.'' **********Mr. Reagan also said that when Lebanon had a ''broadly based representative government,'' the United States would ''vigorously accelerate'' the training and supply of the Lebanese armed forces. He said there would be particular emphasis on antiterrorism. **********In describing the redeployment of the marines, Mr. Reagan said, ''I have asked Secretary of Defense Weinberger to present to me a plan for redeployment of the Marines from Beirut airport to their ships off shore.'' **********A senior White House official said the first stage of withdrawal, of about 500 of the marines, should be concluded within a month. **********The official said American armed forces would remain in small numbers to protect the embassy personnel and those training the Lebanese."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/05/business/advertising-fortune-confirmation-of-y-r-resignation.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ADVERTISING ; Fortune Confirmation Of Y. & R.

According to other summit participants, there was little discussion of such issues here. Because of the dollar's strength and volatility, currency questions have occupied the major industrial countries for more than two years. **********Scheduling a major monetary-reform conference, which French President Francois Mitterrand has sought for years, has been impossible without American participation because of the power of the American economy and the key role of the dollar. **********The American official's comment, however, does not mean that the Reagan Administration supports a radical change in currency-management policies. But it does signal a softening of the Administration's view that currencies and exchange rates are better managed by the marketplace than by laws and institutions. **********On related summit issues, the official said an agreement expressed in the communique to ''continue to act together'' to assure adequate oil supplies reflected an informal, but unstated, agreement to stay out of the spot oil market. Doing so, he said, would avert the hoarding and panic buying that worsened the shortages during the oil crises of the 1970's and forced prices above those set by the Middle Eastern oil-producing countries. **********The official also belittled some of the statements in the communique issued by the seven nations at the close of their conference, especially those statements endorsing easier payment terms for developing-country debtors. **********The summit countries agreed to encourage commercial banks and their own financing agencies to extend the payment terms on loans to countries that have succeeded in strengthening their own economies. Such multiyear reschedulings of debts, many of which are one- and two-year loans, would reduce the annual payment burdens. **********Providing such terms, however, would require substantial changes in the regulations governing American commercial banks. These banks, unlike those in Europe, are held to tight schedules of quarterly reporting, and losses on nonperforming loans must be disclosed sooner than is required in other countries. **********The other summit countries, the official said, argued that the regulations, and not the the performance of the borrowers, create false payment crises. **********''We said we'd point this problem out to our regulators,'' the Washington official said. Nevertheless, he defended the regulations. The quarterly reporting requirements, he said, have helped prevent failures like the one that the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company faced last month. **********Other people in the Administration seem less skeptical of the multiyear rescheduling proposal. George P. Shultz, Secretary of State, an economist and a former Treasury Secretary, said at a news briefing Saturday night, ''I think it's fundamentally a proper idea.'' **********Critical of Debt Conversion **********The official who met with reporters this morning raised questions about another summit statement, one that supported conversion of some short- term loans to the developing world into longer-term debt for investors to add to their portfolios. **********''Who's going to buy that lousy debt?'' he asked. He said the United States had opposed the proposal but was been voted down, 6 to 1. **********Some economists say that many of the problems related to third-world debt - currency exchange rates, interest rates and trade - could be prevented by a reform of the monetary system similar in dimension to the one that was agreed upon at Bretton Woods, N.H., in 1944 but different in detail. **********At the summit conference just ended here, the leaders of the seven participating countries - the United States, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada - urged their finance ministers to press ahead with studies into monetary reform. **********At last year's conference in Williamsburg, Va., the Reagan Administration opposed even undertaking the studies but went along to appease President Mitterrand, who insists that the volatility of the dollar is linked to the debt crisis. At a meeting of finance ministers last month, the Administration succeeded in delaying completiton of such studies, initially expected at the London conference, until next May. **********Accord at Bretton Woods **********But the problems are such now that the Administration has begun to look in the same direction as France and the developing countries for solutions. **********The Bretton Woods agreement established order in world trade and the values of major currencies by linking them to the dollar and the value of the dollar to the value of gold, which was fixed at $32 an ounce. **********By the 1960's the system was proving too rigid for countries to handle. As inflation spread and imbalances in countries' trade developed, governments would announce huge devaluations of their currencies. Finally, in August 1971, President Nixon ended the dollar's convertibility into gold, which removed a standard and left currencies free to find their own levels in the marketplace. **********Since then, the United States and Japan have allowed their currencies to float, while most of the leading European nations have adopted a system that allows exchange rates to float but only within narrow limits. **********But the free-floating dollar plays havoc with the world monetary system. Because each of the currencies are linked, the dollar tends to push them all up or down when it rises or falls in relation to just one. **********What worries other countries more than the strength of the dollar is its volatility and the certainty, in many economists' view, that it must fall back into line with other currencies. The turmoil that accompanies a sharply falling or rising currency troubles a nation as much as an overvalued but stable currency. **********So a conference on monetary reform, in these countries' view, could eliminate the linking and could stablize the currency markets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/06/world/unesco-reported-to-move-away-from-issue-of-licensing-reporters.html": {"writer_name": "Alex Jones", "pub_date": "1984-11-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 873, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNESCO REPORTED TO MOVE AWAY FROM ISSUE OF LICENSING REPORTERS", "print_headline": "UNESCO REPORTED TO MOVE AWAY FROM ISSUE OF LICENSING REPORTERS", "body_text": " **********A longtime critic of the communications policies of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization said yesterday that the agency's Director General had sent him a statement of Unesco policy that represents a ''significant shift'' away from involvement with the issue of licensing journalists. **********The letter comes only weeks before President Reagan is scheduled to review his decision to withdraw the United States from Unesco as of Jan. 1, 1985. When he announced the decision last December, Mr. Reagan said it was subject to change if Unesco made changes this year in areas such as management and its policies on the free flow of information. **********The policy statement was contained in a letter dated Oct. 20 from Amadou- Mahtar M'Bow, Director General of Unesco, to Leonard R. Sussman, executive director of Freedom House, which has monitored Unesco policies on the press. **********In the letter, Mr. M'Bow described guidelines for a policy that, according to Mr. Sussman, would seem to rule out Unesco sponsorship or financing for meetings on the working conditions or safety of journalists - subjects considered by many Western press organizations to include the licensing issue - unless asked to do so by ''all parties concerned,'' including the Western press.   Defusing Criticism **********Mr. Sussman, who has been a critic of Unesco's communications policies for many years, said he viewed Mr. M'Bow's letter as ''categorically'' leaving such issues to professional organizations of journalists, thus defusing part of the criticism that has been leveled at Unesco. **********Mr. M'Bow's statement was a response to a letter from Mr. Sussman about Unesco's possible involvement as a sponsor or source of financing for a journalists' conference scheduled to be held in Mexico City in March. The planned meeting has been denounced by several Western news organizations, including the American Newspaper Publishers Association, as a likely forum for promoting the licensing of journalists. **********But some other journalists and Government officials expressed reservations about the precise meaning of the guidelines in Mr. M'Bow's letter. **********''It's possibly encouraging, but falls short of setting every fear to rest,'' said Dana Bullen, executive director of the World Press Freedom Committee, which has also monitored the Unesco debate on the press. Mr. Bullen noted that the letter did not explicitly state that Unesco would not take part in any way - as an observer, perhaps - or provide any financing for the Mexico City meeting.   Broad Concept **********Many Western news organizations view licensing as a means of exerting government control on journalists and the flow of information under the guise of improving safety conditions for journalists. The issue has come to be associated with a ''new world information order,'' a broad concept that includes increasing technical and professional assistance to developing nations. **********According to Doudou Diene, a Unesco spokesman in New York, the statement by Mr. M'Bow was an ''important clarification'' of Unesco policy, but was not a change in policy. Mr. Diene added that it was hoped by Mr. M'Bow that the ''clarification'' would ''have an impact on the press perception of what Unesco is.'' **********The proposed meeting in Mexico City has become an important test of Unesco's attitude regarding communications issues, according to Gregory J. Newell, an Assistant Secretary of State whose area of responsibility includes the Unesco withdrawal. **********The meeting is being sponsored by five organizations: the Prague-based International Organization of Journalists; the Latin American Federation of Journalists, which is described by Mr. Bullen as the sister organization to the Prague-based group; the Brussels- based International Federation of Journalists; the International Catholic Journalists Union, and the Union of African Journalists.   Meeting in Geneva **********A group including the sponsoring organizations met in June in Geneva to discuss the feasibility of a conference on ''working conditions,'' and, according to Mr. Diene, Unesco representatives were there only as observers. Unesco did provide $10,000 to finance the meeting, according to Mr. Diene, but not directly. Each year, Unesco gives $10,000 to the Consultative Committee of Unions of Journalists, Mr. Diene said, and it was the committee's decision to use the money for the Geneva meeting. **********At a later meeting in Prague in late September, no Unesco representatives took part, and Unesco provided no financing for the meeting, according to Mr. Diene. **********But the official minutes of that meeting indicate that the participants were anticipating significant financing for the proposed conference from Unesco. The minutes refer to contributions from Unesco of $20,000 for working papers, $20,000 for travel of participants and up to $10,000 for a meeting of working journalists to take place at the same time as the conference.   Statement Last Month **********Challenged on the apparent contradiction, Mr. M'Bow issued a statement in early October that ''Unesco's program does not include the organization of such a conference and its budget does not provide for any financial support for it.'' **********In his letter to Mr. Sussman, Mr. M'Bow expanded on the earlier statement, declaring that ''all parties concerned with the working conditions of journalists should participate in any undertaking in this field'' and mentions ''publishers, broadcasters and news agency'' representatives.

Holders of the bonds are presumed to be the owners. On presenting the certificates to an issuer or paying agent, the holders are entitled to receive interest and principal payments without identification. The Treasury has not issued bonds in bearer form since the 1960's, a spokesman said. **********New Tax Bill **********But the $50 billion tax bill aproved last month by Congress and awaiting President Reagan's signature gives the Government and corporations new authority to issue bonds in bearer form - provided they are sold only to foreign investors with safeguards to prevent them from falling into the hands of American tax evaders. **********Investment bankers believe that selling bearer bonds overseas could save the Treasury money in financing the Federal deficit because many foreign investors are willing to accept a lower interest rate if they are able to buy securities without revealing their identity. **********But concerns have been expressed about whether it is appropriate for the Government to depart from its longstanding practice of requiring its bonds to be registered with the owner's name at a time when the Administration and Congress have escalated efforts to curb American tax evasion and solicited the cooperation of other nations. **********The BackgroundThe Treasury, whose borrowing needs have been swollen by giant budget deficits, has been taking a close look at overseas markets, where bonds can often be sold at lower rates than in America. Despite their worldwide reputation as the safest and most liquid securities, United States Government bonds have not sold as well abroad as their reputation would suggest. **********The reasons, according to investment bankers and Treasury officials, is that American bonds now carry a 30 percent withholding tax on interest paid to foreign investors and require buyers to reveal their identity. Bonds sold by many other governments and corporations carry no tax and can be bought in anonymity. **********While Government bond sales may have been inhibited by the tax and registration requirements, American corporations were able to take advantage of the lower financing rate available overseas by issuing bonds through offshore tax havens, where the tax was effectively eliminated and bonds could be sold in bearer form.   Changes for Foreign Investors **********The new tax bill, however, would eliminate the 30 percent withholding tax on new bond issues sold to foreign investors and allow the bonds to be issued in bearer form. The Treasury was assigned the responsibility of drafting regulations to govern the sale of bearer securities with safeguards to prevent their sale or resale to Americans. But the Treasury was also given the authority to bar the issuance of bearer bonds. **********According to a senior Treasury official, the agency has to decide whether to permit issuers to sell bearer bonds, how the issues could be sold, and whether the Treasury itself should issue bearer bonds. **********The discussions center on the financial prospect of being able to borrow overseas at lower rates, versus the concerns that bearer bonds will provide a new means for Americans to evade taxes and for foreign investors to launder money overseas and evade their own country's taxes. **********For Bearer BondsBy most accounts, the Government would reap savings on its borrowing costs by selling tax-exempt bonds overseas. By doing so, this should help ease pressures on interest rates in the United States, where the Government's huge borrowing needs have helped keep interest rates high. **********But most investment bankers believe that for the Government to successfully market its bonds overseas and reap the greatest savings, the bonds must be tailored to the market. Even with the 30 percent wihholding tax eliminated, investment bankers familiar with the market say that many investors will be deterred from buying American bonds if they are required to reveal their identities.  ''We don't make markets, we just respond to them,'' asserted Stuart McFarland, chief financial officer of the Federal National Mortgage Association, a quasi-Federal agency that is eager to sell some of its $40 billion a year in debt obligations overseas. ''The only way you can sell debt in Europe is in bearer form.'' **********H.J. Runnion Jr., the chairman of a Government securities dealers advisory group to the Treasury, said that issuing bearer bonds would open new markets. ''There are certain investors that insist on anonymity and just won't buy registered securities,'' said Mr. Runnion, who is also chief financial officer of the Wachovia Bank and Trust Company of Winston-Salem, N.C. ''But just how big a group that is, I couldn't tell you.'' **********Proponents contend that restrictions can be placed on the method of sale and payment of interest on the bearer bonds to limit the number of bearer bonds outstanding and make it difficult for them to fall into the hands of Americans seeking to evade taxes. **********Further, even Treasury officials have noted that there are already so many other opportunities for Americans intent on evading taxes to do so, that the withholding-tax repeal and the issuance of bearer bonds is unlikely to increase evasion. **********Against Bearer BondsMany in Congress worry that if few limits are placed on the issuance of bearer securities, tax evasion will increase sharply. They contend that Americans would have the opportunity to buy the bonds through secret bank accounts abroad or by otherwise posing as a foreigner. Since the tax would no longer be withheld for foreign investors, an American buyer posing as a foreigner could evade taxes by not reporting the interest income, and the Internal Revenue Service would have no records to trace. **********Further, there is concern that bearer securities would increase tax evasion in other countries, since there would be no record of the foreign investor's income for other governments to trace. This, critics contend, could thwart American efforts to win the cooperation of foreign governments in helping curb tax evasion by American citizens. **********''It would be undermining the enormous progress we've made in the last four or five years on tax compliance,'' said Peter Barash, staff director of the House subcommittee of Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs. ''The United States would join several other countries as among the worst tax havens in the world.'' **********While many foreign governments also issue bearer bonds to be sold outside their borders, Mr. Barash questions whether the United States should contribute to the international flow of illegal money that can readily be laundered through bearer securities. ''Even if other countries issue bearer bonds, it wouldn't necessarily make it right for the United States to do it,'' said Mr. Barash. **********Importance Questioned **********From a financial point of view, there is uncertainty about how important the bearer form really is to foreign investors, and thus how much more savings could be reaped. **********''It's perceived to be a big, big, big deal,'' said Nicholas Rey, managing director of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. But, he said, big overseas institutional investors are generally not concerned about registration requirements. And, he said, many foreign investors have lived with registration requirements in their own countries for years and may not find the bearer form important. **********Further, by selling a separate bearer class of bonds strictly from overseas points, there is the concern that the market for Government bonds would be less liquid since there would, in effect, be two segmented trading markets - one overseas and one in the United States. **********OutlookTreasury officials say they expect to announce a decision later this month or in early August. One Treasury official indicated that bearer securities probably would be permitted. But he said the questions about how they could be sold and whether the Government itself would sell bearer bonds are still unresolved. **********Doug Barnard Jr., Democrat of Georgia and chairman of the House Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs subcommittee, said his committee would hold hearings if the Treasury regulations do not contain adequate safeguards to prevent the tax-free debt obligations from being sold to United States taxpayers ''masquerading as foreigners.'' **********In a letter sent last week to the I.R.S. Commissioner, Roscoe L. Egger Jr., Mr. Barnard expressed concern over reports that the Treasury may be willing to ''sacrifice hard- won tax-compliance gains'' achieved by Congress and the Administration in recent years ''to faciliate the marketability to foreign persons of U.S. Treasury and corporate debt obligations.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/13/world/soviet-press-agency-assails-us-on-missile-interceptor.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Press Agency Assails U.S. on Missile Interceptor", "print_headline": "Soviet Press Agency Assails U.S. on Missile Interceptor", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union said today that the successful testing by the United States of a ballistic missile interceptor was a step toward ''the militarization of outer space.'' **********The official press agency Tass said the interceptor system is intended as ''one of the elements of a multitier defense system which would guarantee a high effectiveness of antiballistic missile defense'' and would include space- based systems. **********''The United States has made yet another step along the lines of the militarization of outer space,'' the agency said. **********Tass was referring to the successful test of an experimental United States Army system that uses an interceptor to ram a ballistic missile head-on and destroy it before it can reach its target."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/31/world/2-dominicans-defend-rebuff-to-imf.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1984-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 725, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 DOMINICANS DEFEND REBUFF TO I.M.F.", "print_headline": "2 DOMINICANS DEFEND REBUFF TO I.M.F.", "body_text": " **********Two Government ministers said today that the Dominican Republic would have faced full- scale civil strife last week if it had agreed to demands from the International Monetary Fund to raise the price of gasoline and other oil products as a condition for new loans. **********Foreign Minister Jose Augusto Vega and Economic Planning Minister L.

The slogans can be summed up as ''I.M.F. get out of the country.'' **********(A spokesman for President Jorge Blanco announced that the Government had ordered a 25 percent cutback in Government fuel use and imposed other austerity measures, The Associated Press reported. It said the new directives also called for a suspension of most official travel abroad, the banning of weekend and off-duty use of official vehicles and an order that public buildings be left dark at night and street lights turned off in the early dawn. **********(The President was also reported to have ordered the administrator of the Government-owned Dominican Electricity Corporation to study the establishment of a nationwide energy conservation plan and to have named a special committee to prepare a cost-reducing plan for the public sector, The Associated Press said.).  Mr. Haza, the Economic Planning Minister, said that the quest for better terms from the I.M.F. did not mean ''that we are unwilling to put our house in order. It means that we want to keep our house and not let it go up in flames.'' **********The Economic Planning Minister added that ''I think we faced full-scale civil strife'' if the Government had met the I.M.F. demands and not listened to the internal protests. **********However, he acknowledged that the suspension of negotiations with the I.M.F. has cut off practically all new loans to the country.   Commercial Loans Triggered **********When the I.M.F. approves credit for a country, commercial bank loans for much larger amounts than the amount borrowed from the I.M.F. are usually triggered. **********In this case, Mr. Haza said, the only fresh money coming into the country now will be from a $50 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to help finance industrial imports and raw materials. **********Because of low prices for the sugar, cocoa, coffee, and tobacco that it sells abroad, the Dominican Republic is running a heavy deficit in trade accounts. **********The country owes about $2 billion to foreign creditors. **********''We feel that the only way we can pay is if we produce - not if we get into a deep depression,'' said Mr. Haza. **********''The I.M.F. has its rules,'' he continued. ''The I.M.F. mission could not accept anything that went beyond the rules.

Later, it was argued that acidity was more widespread and potential problems were cited in the South, in high Rocky Mountain lakes and in the Los Angeles basin. More recently, acid rain has been blamed for dying forests in parts of this country and West Germany. Whatever the environmental problem, the prescribed cure never varies:legislation to place strict new controls on coal-fired plants. **********During the past four years, intensive research on acid rain has been conducted by the National Academy of Sciences, the Environmental Protection Agency, universities and hundreds of individual scientists. The findings have been far from conclusive. Sulfur dioxide emissions in the Middle West have not been proven to contribute significantly to lake and stream acidity. Nitrogen oxides and ozone - the primary emissions from automobiles - and not sulfur dioxide, have been identified as the most likely suspects in the few observed instances of forest decline. No evidence supports the hypothesis that acid precipitation is endangering either crops or human health. Local sources of pollution, rather than distant emissions, are the more likely culprit in damage to certain kinds of materials. **********Despite the lack of even a credible scientific basis for legislation, Congress is still being asked to decide whether to impose costly new controls to further ratchet down emissions or to continue our current course under the Clean Air Act. The most often ignored or least appreciated aspect of the acid rain debate is that the United States has implemented the world's most effective air quality management program. **********As a result of the Clean Air Act, **********nearly every county in the country currently meets the standards set to protect people's health. Total sulfur dioxide emissions fell 26 percent between 1973 - the peak year - and 1983. Electric power plant emissions alone were down 17 percent although coal use grew by 53 percent. The cost of this effort have been equally impressive. According to the E.P.A., the capital, operating and maintenance costs to comply with existing Federal air pollution control standards on electric utilities totaled $20.9 billion between 1970 and 1978, about $2.9 billion a year. For the next three years, 1979-81, we spent another $21 billion, about $7 billion a year. Over the following eight years, 1982- 90, another $88.3 billion, or about $11 billion a year in 1981 dollars, will have been spent. **********THE call for acid rain control legislation, requiring additional sulfur dioxide reductions of 10 to 12 million tons a year in 31 eastern states, must be considered against this backdrop of solid progress. Proponents would impose additional costs totaling hundreds of billions of dollars in hopes of attaining by 1995 what the current Clean Air Act will achieve by 2010. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed legislation is uncertain. Researchers at M.I.T. have estimated it would produce a barely measurable change in the acidity of the problem areas. **********Nevertheless, there are those in the Congress ready to impose such controls. The so-called Waxman/Sikorski bill, calling for a 10 million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide by 1995 from 1980 levels will cost $7.9 billion a year. And this is on top of what we will be paying under current law. Furthermore, the costs are unequally distributed throughout various states. **********Efforts to spread the costs through a fund derived from a national tax on electricity generation have not proved popular. In the states that would receive the most money from such a fund, compliance costs would be reduced 25 percent, but they still would pay higher costs than other states. Finally, other areas of the country that consider themselves removed from the controversy, such as the West, are reluctant to participate in the scheme. **********It is precisely this sort of haggling that has stymied acid rain control legislation. **********Much more cost-effective and proven methods are available to remedy the observed effects of acidity in the environment. For instance, the total cost of liming the fishless acidic lakes in the Adirondacks - to neutralize the acid - is approximately $1 million. The liming would have to be repeated every few years to maintain acceptable balance, but the results would be certain and the cost far less than that of acid rain control legislation. **********When Congress returns, newer members will realize that the call for acid rain controls is little more than a facade for imposing drastically tightened emission limits. They will also realize that the costs are great and certain, while the benefits are small, uncertain and attainable through cheaper means.  Veterans of past Clean Air Act debates will recognize the issue as another effort to shunt the nation onto the road of severely constrained economic growth, a road whose byways would be littered with the debris of shattered hopes and stillborn jobs. **********Carl E.

''This is the time, fundamentally, to focus on capital spending,'' the First Boston Corporation said recently. **********Commenting on this growth in business investment, the Merrill Lynch Market Letter said: ''Inflation-adjusted spending in the final quarter of 1983 jumped almost 13 percent from the year- earlier period and a gain of 16 percent appears likely to occur in the first quarter of this year.'' **********For all of 1984, economists at Merrill Lynch forecast a 12 percent increase in capital spending, which would mark the sharpest recovery since 1966, when expenditures rose 13 percent. **********This spending boom is being fed by prospects for improved earnings and increased cash flow in a variety of companies. Meanwhile, the nation's plant utilization rate has climbed to around 80 percent - a level that encourages outlays for new factories and equipment. **********In the current economic cycle, the main spending thrust has centered on technology stocks, according to John R. Groome, senior vice president of the United States Trust Company. ''International Business Machines is king of the hill in this regard,'' he said, ''but other beneficiaries range from Perkin-Elmer, Teradyne Inc. and Cipher Data Products to National Data and Hewlett-Packard.'' First Boston said its primary recommendation in capital spending, ''assuming a stable market,'' would be Caterpillar Tractor. Caterpillar lost money in 1982 and 1983, following a string of highly profitable years. It is described by Standard & Poor's as the largest manufacturer of earthmoving machinery and equipment, as well as a major producer of diesel and natural gas engines and turbines. **********''Within the current cycle, Caterpillar is projected to earn $3 a share in 1984, all in the second half,'' according to First Boston. ''For 1985, the current earnings estimate of between $6 and $7 a share could prove low by $1 to $2 a share if the economic recovery continues. As Caterpillar traditionally sells on future earnings expectations, especially coming out of a recession, now is the time to buy the stock.'' **********When First Boston recommended Caterpillar in mid-March, the stock was selling at 49. Yesterday, on the New York Stock Exchange, it eased 1/8, to 50. On Monday, the stock traded as high as 50 3/4, equaling its highest price over the last 52 weeks. **********Both Caterpillar and Joy Manufacturing appear on the recommended list at Oppenheimer & Company. Within the capital goods industry, Oppenheimer accords an even higher rating to Cummins Engine and Kennametal Inc., which are carried on the firm's emphasis list, as well as its recommended list. **********Insights, a market advisory letter written by Justin Mamis, has recommended both Caterpillar and the Harnischfeger Corporation, chiefly because of prospective expenditures in road construction. Harnischfeger has lost money in its last two fiscal years. Mr. Mamis also favors certain cement stocks. **********The recovery in capital spending was initially centered in the military sector along with high technology. Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch points out that the pattern of increased business investment has broadened to include virtually every area except petroleum, aviation, and marine and railroad equipment. **********''We look for sales of producers' durable equipment to be especially strong in 1984, rising nearly 16 percent,'' the firm said. ''We think the accelerating pace of capital spending will insure several good years of profits growth for producers of capital goods. **********''Rising order rates and expanding backlogs suggest that these companies will be well situated to ride out any temporary slowdown in economic growth that may develop toward the end of 1985.'' **********Accordingly, the firm's market letter has selected four issues it regards as ''particularly attractive.'' One recommendation is Clark Equipment, a leading manufacturer of materials-handling equipment - primarily forklift trucks - as well as construction equipment, axles and transmissions. **********Another recommendation is the Dover Corporation, which makes machinery and equipment used in the building, petroleum and other industries. Rounding out the four stocks are Parker Hannifin, whose hydraulic and fluid power components are used in a variety of industrial products, and Rexnord Inc., a broadly diversified manufacturer of industrial machinery, components and fasteners."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/29/world/nicaraguan-insurgent-group-stages-rally-in-new-orleans.html": {"writer_name": "Frances Marcus", "pub_date": "1984-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 632, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NICARAGUAN INSURGENT GROUP STAGES RALLY IN NEW ORLEANS", "print_headline": "NICARAGUAN INSURGENT GROUP STAGES RALLY IN NEW ORLEANS", "body_text": " **********Nicaraguan insurgent leaders, seeking support for their United States-backed military effort against the Government in Managua, held a rally today in the central business district here. **********It was part of a weekend conference described as ''the first national meeting'' of the Honduran-based Nicaraguan Democratic Force.

Yet annuity agreements can also be drawn up among private parties and can be a potent tool for reducing income and estate taxes. They are, in essence, quid pro quo arrangements that allow elderly individuals to shift the ownership and management of substantial assets to younger relatives while keeping the family wealth within the family. **********''A private annuity is kind of a super gimmick, but it isn't for just anyone,'' said Julian S. Bush, partner in charge of the estate planning department at the New York City law firm of Shea & Gould. While such arrangements are not common, they can be very useful for people with sizable assets whose heirs are likely to face a large estate tax bill. A private annuity is ''simply a sale of property in exchange for an annuity,'' said Mr. Bush, but because of many uncertainties about the economics of the transaction it is also ''a piece of very aggressive tax planning.'' **********While the mechanics of a private annuity are complex, the basic idea is simple. A person called the annuitant, often an elderly person such as a parent, transfers ownership of appreciated property such as stock, real estate or an interest in a closely held business to a person called the obligor, typically a younger relative such as a child. In return, the child promises to make periodic payments to the parent for the rest of the parent's life. ''Generally, it's a one-shot transaction between private parties who normally don't write annuities,'' according to Prentice-Hall, a publisher of tax materials for professionals. **********As long as the parent completely divests himself or herself of all interest in the transferred property, the property is not included in the parent's estate. If, for example, a mother transfers stock worth $200,000 to her only son in return for a lifetime annuity, $200,000 would be removed from her gross estate, even if the stock had cost her only $50,000. In effect, the arrangement ''freezes'' the value of the transferred property, so that all future appreciation of the property is removed from the parent's estate as well. **********Moreover, the mother can transfer the large block of stock to her son without incurring a gift tax as long as the present value of the annuity - that is, the value in today's dollars of the mother's right to receive the payments in the future - equals the value of the transferred property. Outright gifts, by contrast, escape gift tax only if their value is $10,000 or less. **********The value of the annuity is determined by actuarial tables drawn up by the Internal Revenue Service and depends upon the annuitant's age; the older the annuitant, the larger the payments that must be made. **********A private annuity can be particularly helpful in cases where the parent does not expect to live as long as the average life expectancy built into the I.R.S. tables. Prentice-Hall gives the example of Susan, a 50-year-old widow who is very ill and does not expect to live as long as the tables predict. So she transfers $200,000 of property to her only child, Rosella, in return for a yearly annuity of $15,900. (New actuarial tables proposed by the I.R.S., however, would require a larger annuity payment.) Susan then dies a year later. **********Since Susan dies only a year after making the transfer, Rosella's payments end much earlier than projected in the actuarial tables. ''In effect, Rosella received $200,000 of property in exchange for a single payment of $15,900,'' commented Prentice-Hall. **********However, it warned that a parent who is very ill should not wait too long before setting up a private annuity. If death is ''clearly imminent'' - say, likely to occur in less than a year - the I.R.S. may not permit the use of its estate and gift tables to value the annuity and may instead treat part of the transaction as a taxable gift. **********Another advantage of a private annuity is that the annual payments received by the parent may well lower his or her income tax bill. The reason is that part of the payment is considered a tax-free return of capital, representing the parent's original cost of the transferred property prorated over the parent's life expectancy. **********The rest of the payment is taxable as capital gains on the appreciated property, ordinary income, or both, depending on individual circumstances. But the parent does not have to pay the entire capital gains tax up front when the property is transferred in a private annuity arrangement; instead, the capital gains are spread out over the parent's life expectancy. **********''The annuitant, in effect, has the benefit of an interest-free Government loan repayable, in periods of inflation, with 'cheaper' dollars,'' said Commerce Clearing House Inc., a tax publisher. Had the annuitant wanted to purchase a commercial annuity from an insurance company instead, it added, he or she would have had to sell the property first, pay capital gains tax on it, and then use whatever proceeds remained to buy the annuity. **********BUT there are several drawbacks to private annuities. For one thing, the parent unconditionally transfers property to the child in return for an unsecured promise that the child will in turn pay the parent a set amount for the rest of his or her life. Thus, the parent's income depends upon the child's trustworthiness and financial security. If the child encounters financial difficulties, the parent may not receive the payments as promised. **********''The private annuity can be useful in selective situations, but a lot depends upon the feelings that the older generation has about the younger generation's ability to make the payments,'' observed Philip T. Temple, a partner in the New York law firm of Prerau & Teitell. **********Moreover, even though annuity payments have an interest element in them, the child making payments to a parent is not permitted to claim an interest deduction for the payments because they are not considered a tax-deductible debt. The net effect is that the child makes the payments with after-tax dollars. **********In addition, if the parent lives longer than his projected life expectancy, the child may wind up paying more for the property - by making annuity payments for a longer period than expected - than he would have, had he bought the property outright. **********For this reason, said Prentice-Hall, the prime candidates for private annuities are individuals with shorter-than-average life expectancies. It noted that the children of such individuals get a ''bargain purchase'' in that their annuity payments are likely to end sooner than the actuarial tables project."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/16/business/advertising-needham-is-watching-hamburger-campaign.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Needham Is Watching Hamburger Campaign", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Needham Is Watching Hamburger Campaign", "body_text": " **********For Needham, Harper & Steers, with its main bastions in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, the place to watch these days is Washington.

Adjusted for splits, the stock soared to a record high of $32.75 in July of last year, just as a speculative market boom reached its peak. **********But the other half of that adage, ''Cut your losses,'' somehow seems harder for many investors to follow. Last week, for some hapless shareowners, stock market losses continued to mount in the holding company of the nation's largest thrift institution. Financial Corporation shares finished Friday at $4.75, their price cut virtually in half from the previous week's close of $9.37 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. Early this year the stock traded as high as $24.37 1/2. **********Forced by the Securities and Exchange Commission to revise its accounting methods concerning $2 billion of mortgage-backed securities, the Financial Corporation announced on Wednesday an unanticipated loss of $107.5 million for the quarter ended June 30. This loss is believed to be the largest reported for a single quarter by any American thrift institution. **********Although industry observers consider the Financial Corporation's situation to be unique among thrift units, one analyst said, ''It served to tarnish the group just as the problems at Continental Illinois tarnished all commercial banks.'' **********This was a reference to the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company, which once ranked as the nation's seventh-largest bank. Last month the Government put into place a $4.5 billion rescue package for the Continental Illinois Corporation, the holding company for the Chicago bank. **********Suffering mainly from an increase in short-term interest rates, stock prices of thrift institutions have been declining for about a year. Reflecting the developments at the Financial Corporation, the savings and loan group monitored by the Standard & Poor's Corporation fell 12.9 percent in the week ended last Wednesday, in contrast to the six-tenths of 1 percent gain for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. So far this year, the thrift group has dropped 42 percent in value while the S.&P. 500 has edged downward by 1.3 percent. **********On Friday security analysts were divided in their assessment of the thrift sector. ''I've had a sell recommendation on these stocks since March of this year,'' said Jerome I. Baron of the First Boston Corporation. ''I expect interest rates to continue to rise. As a result, I believe the cyclical earnings peak for the thrifts will be the second or third quarter of 1984.'' **********In San Francisco, Allan G. Bortel of Shearson Lehman/American Express took the view that values have been created for certain thrift institutions that are restructuring their balance sheets. His four recommendations are H. F. Ahmanson, Golden West Financial, First Federal Savings and Loan of Arizona and Home Federal Savings and Loan in San Diego. **********The setback in the Financial Corporation's stock, together with the resurfacing concern about the health of financial institutions in general, helped to subdue investor enthusiasm for equities last week. The stock market's recent stampede pulled back, as the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 6.11 points, to 1,211.90. Over the three previous weeks, the indicator had amassed a gain of 116 points, responding primarily to improving prices and declining yields in the bond market. **********Volume on the Big Board contracted to 416.5 million shares last week from the previous week's record of 754.6 million shares. **********Home Depot's Plunge **********On Friday institutional investors served notice once again that they have little tolerance for earnings disappointments. After Home Depot Inc. estimated flat earnings for its quarter ended July 31, money managers rushed for the exits, sending the stock tumbling $6.12 1/2 a share, to $16.12 1/2, on a turnover exceeding 2.5 million shares. **********The Atlanta-based company, which operates a chain of warehouse-type stores selling building materials and home improvement products in the Sun Belt, said that adverse weather conditions last month affected passenger traffic and store sales. **********Pension funds and other institutions own about 43 percent of Home Depot's 24.8 million common shares. A steady increase in institutional ownership previously was reflected in the price of the stock. It went from $1.50 a share in 1981 to a high of $31.75 by mid-1983, adjusted for splits. At one point last year, the stock sold at 77 times earnings. **********But no matter how stock prices fare, market optimists can always find reasons to remain bullish. Last week, in a memo meant for internal use, one professional adviser made this observation: ''For the last two months, brokerage houses have drastically reduced their personnel. This has always been a positive stock market indicator.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/18/business/merrill-fights-deposit-rule.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 781, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MERRILL FIGHTS DEPOSIT RULE", "print_headline": "MERRILL FIGHTS DEPOSIT RULE", "body_text": " **********Merrill Lynch & Company has begun a grass- roots lobbying effort to overturn a regulation proposed by Federal banking regulators that would limit the availability of insurance on deposits placed by brokers. **********At issue is a regulation, proposed in separate but coordinated actions last month by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, that would sharply curtail the protection those agencies provide for brokered deposits - money raised from financial middlemen rather than from individual investors. **********If the regulations become final, they would deny insurance on deposits in excess of $100,000 placed by any broker at any one insured bank or savings association. **********'Sledgehammer Rule' **********On Feb. 10, Merrill Lynch mailed letters to more than 500,000 of its customers who have purchased certificate of deposits, and urged them to write their Senators and Representatives and, in the words of the letters, ''make them aware that you are against the sledgehammer rule.'' **********The big securities firm has also been trying to recruit other brokerages that have retail customers across the country to join the campaign. At the same time, a number of smaller money brokers are gearing up to wage a lobbying campaign against the proposed regulations. **********Last year, a similar lobbying effort led by commercial banks forced Congress to repeal withholding taxes on dividend and interest payments. **********Although the target of the curb appears to be the small but growing corps of money brokers, the action would make it all but impossible for stockbrokers to offer their customers federally insured certificates of deposits. Offering such certificates would be unwieldy, and perhaps unprofitable, because they would have to be scattered among a large number of banks to absorb all of the funds seeking such investments - possibly more banks than would be interested in the business. **********Stake for F.D.I.C.'s Chairman **********It also appears that the future of William M. Isaac as chairman of the F.D.I.C. may be intertwined with the outcome of the regulatory issue. Mr. Isaac's term expires March 15, and neither the White House nor Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan favors reappointing him to another six-year term, according to an Administration aide who asked not to be named. Secretary Regan, in a rare public difference between financial agencies, opposes the proposed restriction on brokered deposits. Before becoming Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Regan headed Merrill Lynch. **********The President would like to replace Mr. Isaac with Richard Heldridge, a former California banker who is a director of the United States Export- Import Bank, the aide said. Mr. Heldridge has been interviewed by Secretary Regan and deputy secretary R. T. McNamar.  However, Mr. Isaac, a 40-year-old lawyer and former banker, would like to serve as a lame duck for another year or so, his friends say, in hopes that Congress will enact his proposal to let the F.D.I.C. charge higher deposit insurance premiums to banks that make high-risk loans. **********By law, Mr. Isaac can stay on as long as the Senate has not confirmed a successor. With the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Jake Garn, Republican of Utah, threatening to bottle up a Heldridge nomination, Mr. Isaac appears to have a chance to stay on, especially if he modifies the brokered deposit rule to the satisfaction of the Treasury. **********Three Other Possibilities **********Others mentioned within the Administration as possible successors to Mr. Isaac are two former Republican Representatives, John H. Rousselot of California and James K. Coyne of Pennsylvania, and Doyle L. Arnold, a senior deputy comptroller of the currency. **********As for the proposed regulation, a Merrill Lynch executive, Edwin H. Hall, director of financial products marketing, said ''we feel strongly about this issue.'' He added that Merrill Lynch has been meeting weekly with representatives from Shearson/ American Express, Dean Witter Reynolds, and Prudential-Bache. **********''We have urged them to make similar appeals to their customers. This is definitely a consumer issue,'' Mr. Hall said. **********Congress is mindful of the analogy to the withholding campaign in 1983. But House Banking Committee aides cautioned that there are significant differences between the withholding and money broker issues. ''The money brokers are not lobbying against legislation, they're lobbying regs,'' said one aide. **********Among smaller brokers, Thomas M. Coan, president of the Federal Insured Savings Network of Washington, said his company plans to make a mass mailing soon to all its customers about the proposed rule. **********''We're financial intermediaries brought on by deregulation, and we hold a valid place in the economy,'' he said, adding: ''This is simply a form of re-regulation.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/16/world/around-the-world-syrian-forces-ordered-to-help-find-reporter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Syrian Forces Ordered To Help Find Reporter", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Syrian Forces Ordered To Help Find Reporter", "body_text": " **********President Hafez al-Assad has ordered Syrian security forces to help find a Reuters correspondent who disappeared in Lebanon 17 days ago, a Government spokesman said today. **********The President has ''issued instructions to the competent Syrian security authorities to exert all possible efforts to help find his abductors, free him and return him to his family,'' a spokesman for Mr. Assad said. **********The correspondent, Jonathan Wright, a 30-year-old Briton, disappeared Aug. 29 after he left the Reuters office in Beirut to visit the scene of an Israeli air raid against Palestinian positions in a Syrian-controlled region of eastern Lebanon.

Hamilton of Indiana and Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, as Congress returned from its recess, with Lebanon likely to be a major topic. **********Donald Rumsfeld, the special envoy, returned from his Middle East mission to brief members of Congress and the Administration on his failure to persuade Syria to cooperate in a Lebanese security arrangement. **********Iran Put on Outlaw List **********In another development, the State Department said that Iran, because of its purported role in the bombing of Marine headquarters in Beirut and of the United States Embassy in Kuwait, had been placed on a list of nations that have ''repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.'' **********Nations on the list, which is maintained in compliance with an act of Congress and includes Syria, Southern Yemen, Libya and Cuba, are barred from importing some American equipment. **********The inclusion of Iran was described by officials as symbolic of the United States' anti-Iranian policy. Washington has favored Iraq in the war against Iran, even though no arms are being sold to either side. In 1982 the United States removed Iraq from the terrorist list when relations improved. **********On Sunday, Secretary Shultz said the United States was prepared to make pre-emptive strikes if there were signs that Iranian planes might attack American ships. There have been reports of pilots being trained in Iran for suicide missions. **********Meanwhile, a joint American-Israeli committee began putting into effect an agreement on enhanced military and political cooperation announced in November. The committee will work out arrangements for joint maneuvers, the storage of American equipment in Israel and other planning. **********The letter of Representatives Hamilton and Aspin to Mr. Reagan on Dec. 13 said that, although they had supported the Congressional decision to allow the marines to remain in Lebanon for 18 months, they said the commitment ''should not be open-ended.'' **********The letter said Mr. Reagan had ''overstated our stake'' in Lebanon by blaming the Russians for the problems in the area, and had failed to push for a political settlement. **********Mr. Reagan, in his reply, said Lebanon was ''a flash point of confrontation between Israel and Syria - and potentially the United States and the Soviet Union - and has been for several years now.'' **********The marines are in Lebanon, he said, ''to support our goal of diplomatic solutions which are agreeable to the parties concerned.'' **********''Our forces should not and will not be there permanently, but we cannot simply withdraw unilaterally without raising questions about the U.S. commitment to moderation and negotiation in the Middle East,'' Mr. Reagan said. **********The 18-month period for the marines allows the Gemayel Government ''a breathing spell'' to extend its authority, Mr. Reagan said. **********''There is no question about the complicating role of the Soviet Union, Syria and Iran,'' he said. ''The Lebanese could already have had a new national reconciliation government on Syria's terms, but the presence of the multinational force allows Mr. Gemayel to produce a truly Lebanese government.'' **********Iran Warns Against 'Adventures' **********TEHERAN, Iran, Jan. 23 (Reuters) - Iranian leaders today warned the United States against any ''adventures'' after Secretary of State Shultz said there might be pre-emptive strikes to prevent suicide attacks on United States forces. **********President Ali Khamenei said Iran would reply to any ''adventures,'' and the Speaker of Parliament, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, said United States interests would be endangered."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/28/world/judges-giver-freer-rein-in-case-in-argentina.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 646, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JUDGES GIVER FREER REIN IN CASE IN ARGENTINA", "print_headline": "JUDGES GIVER FREER REIN IN CASE IN ARGENTINA", "body_text": " **********Nine members of former Argentine juntas accused of murder and torture will be tried under unusual legal procedures that will open the proceedings to the public and allow judges freer rein in ruling on evidence, the chief judge in the case says. **********The judge, Jorge Torlasco, said in an interview here that the civilian court would use the military code of justice. **********Under the civilian code, he said, the proceedings would have been recorded and sessions would have been closed to the public. Moreover, the prosecutors would have had to present specific evidence to prove their case. **********But under the military code, Judge Torlasco said, the six judges who will try the case can determine for themselves what evidence is necessary to reach a verdict and will not have to use a specified list of evidence. **********The public trial, which will begin within a month, is expected to attract considerable attention from international legal and human rights groups. **********President Raul Alfonsin has charged the nine officers, including three former Presidents, with ordering the murder and torture of thousands of Argentines during the antisubversive campaign in the 1970's. A presidential commission concluded last month that some 9,000 Argentines disappeared during the so-called ''dirty war.''  Likely Defense **********The defendants have indicated in earlier judicial proceedings that they are likely to base their defense on the argument that they were carrying out orders by the Government of Isabel Martinez de Peron to ''neutralize and annihilate'' the country's ''subversive elements.''

He said the court would not allow the trial to become a ''show.'' **********The civilian court can use the military code to try the officers because of a special law approved by Congress this year. Few officials had expected the law to be used, since the military was responsible for trying the cases and the civilian courts were only supposed to review the decisions made by the military tribunals. But after the military court said in late September that it could not meet an Oct. 11 deadline, the appellate court decided against granting an extension and instead assumed jurisdiction of the cases. **********The first stage of the trial will take five days, Judge Torlasco said.

Premier Zhou would later tell him, ''Your handshake came over the vastest ocean in the world - 25 years of no communication.'' **********With one handshake, America and China each turned a new page in their histories. I believe history beckons again. We have begun to write a new chapter for peace and progress in our histories, with America and China going forward hand in hand. **********We must always be realistic about our relationship, frankly acknowledging the fundamental differences in ideology and institutions between our two societies. Yes, let us acknowledge those differences. Let us never minimize them, but let us not be dominated by them. I have not come to China to hold forth on what divides us, but to build on what binds us. I have not come to dwell on a closed- door past, but to urge that Americans and Chinese look to the future, because, together, we can and will make tomorrow a better day. **********I believe if we were to ask citizens all over this world what they desire most for their children, and for their children's children, their answer, in English, Chinese or any language would likely be the same: We want peace. We want freedom. We want a better life. **********America and China are both great nations, and we have a special responsibility to preserve world peace. To help fulfill that responsibility, the United States is rebuilding its defenses, which had been neglected for more than a decade.   'We Threaten No Nation' **********But we threaten no nation. America's troops are not massed on China's borders and we occupy no lands. The only foreign land we occupy, anywhere in the world, is beneath grave sites where Americans shed their blood for peace and freedom. Nor do we commit wanton acts, such as shooting 269 innocent people out of the sky for the so-called cause of sacred airspace. America and China both condemn military expansionism - the brutal occupation of Afghanistan, the crushing of Cambodia - and we share a stake in preserving peace on the Korean peninsula. **********How did America, which began as an improverished country and a melting pot, attracting immigrants from every corner of the globe, pull together and become the leading economic nation in the world? **********Well, we are people who have always believed the heritage of our past is the seed that brings forth the harvest of our future. And from our roots, we have drawn tremendous power from two great forces, faith and freedom. America was founded by people who sought freedom to worship God and to trust Him to guide them in their daily lives with wisdom, strength, goodness, and compassion. **********These great principles have nourished the soul of America. And they have been enriched by values such as the dignity of work, the friendship of neighbors and the warmth of family. Like China, our people see the future in the eyes of our children. And, like China, we revere our elders.   Trusting the People **********Trust the people. These three words are not only the heart and soul of American history, but the most powerful force for human progress in the world today. **********Today, China's economy crackles with the dynamics of change: expansion of individual incentives for farms in your new responsibility system; new bonuses for workers and more disciplined management in terms of profits and losses; improved methods of market distribution; opening your economy to the world through China's membership in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and through your invitation to trade and invest, and your commitment to attract capital and scientific knowledge to create a high technology base for the future. **********We Americans have always considered ourselves pioneers, so we appreciate such vitality and optimism.

Non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (S.A.R.'s) and ''phantom stock'' promise some of the profits of I.S.O.'s with far fewer restrictions. **********How do corporations pick and choose in this alphabet soup of possibilities? ''Most companies use a combination of I.S.O.'s and non-qualifieds,'' said Mr. Tilghman. The trend is to use I.S.O.'s where possible, he noted, substituting non- qualifieds when managers are stuck with underwater options that would be unprofitable to exercise. **********But the employee will pay more tax for the extra flexibility. With non- qualified options, the holder pays ordinary income tax, not capital gains tax, on the increase between the grant price and the market price when he exercises the option. If the executive in the earlier example had chosen non-qualifieds over I.S.O.'s, for instance, his tax bill would rise to $10,500 from $6,000, reflecting the extra tax bite on the $15 gain between the grant price and the market price, assuming he is in the 50 percent income tax bracket. **********Companies fare better with non- qualified options than with I.S.O.'s, however, since they take deductions equal to the executive's taxable gain. Assume that an executive who is granted a non-qualified option at $40 exercises that option when the stock price hits $55. The corporation takes a $15 deduction, realizing $6.90 in savings, assuming a 46 percent tax rate. The company can take no deduction with an I.S.O. **********Stock appreciation rights (S.A.R.'s) and ''phantom stock'' are incentive plans that also give better tax breaks to the company than to the employee.  But they offer a big plus for executives who can reap profits without putting up their own cash. **********An S.A.R. entitles the recipient to an amount equal to the difference between the grant price and the market price on the day that he exercises his right. Suppose an executive is granted 1,000 S.A.R.'s when the stock is selling at $40, for example; if the stock rises to $45 and he decides to cash in, the executive pockets a $5,000 profit without buying a single share. **********''Phantom stock'' is not stock at all, but an unfunded, unsecured corporate promise to pay an executive deferred compensation measured by the market share price. In effect, the company sets up an account with a specified number of hypothetical shares, paying over the appreciated value of those shares at a future date, as with an S.A.R. With phantom shares, however, the recipient is entitled to the value of the accrued dividends, as well. **********Unlike I.S.O.'s, both phantom stock and S.A.R.'s generate charges that reduce the company's earnings. And since their value rises with the market price of the shares, the company cannot control the cost either when the liability is carried on the balance sheet or when these rights are cashed in. Accordingly, S.A.R.'s and phantom stock are usually awarded only to key managers. **********Executives reaping the rewards of S.A.R.'s or phantom stock pay ordinary income tax on their gains, not the lower capital gains tax. However, since they never invested any money of their own, all the profits are, in effect, a risk-free windfall."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/25/world/pentagon-tightens-control-on-aides-central-america-statements.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Taubman", "pub_date": "1984-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 509, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PENTAGON TIGHTENS CONTROL ON AIDES' CENTRAL AMERICA STATEMENTS", "print_headline": "PENTAGON TIGHTENS CONTROL ON AIDES' CENTRAL AMERICA STATEMENTS", "body_text": " **********A senior Defense Department official has directed Pentagon officials to clear in advance with his office any communication with Congress about American military activities in Central America. **********Pentagon officials said the order reflected concern in the Reagan Administration about increasingly assertive efforts by Congress, particularly Democratic lawmakers, to examine whether the Pentagon has established a permanent military presence in Honduras without Congressional authorization. **********Administration officials, including Secretary of Defense Caspar W.

Even on the Administration's own optimistic assumptions of strong, steady growth for the next five years, the budget the President will present to Congress next week will show deficits of $180 billion in the fiscal year 1985, $177 billion in 1986, $187 billion in 1987, $151 billion in 1988 and $122 billion in 1989. **********But those projections are contradicted by the steeply rising deficits foreseen by the Congressional Budget Office. Now headed by Rudolph Penner, a conservative who was formerly chief fiscal economist at the American Enterprise Institute, the budget office estimates that the deficit will climb to about $325 billion in 1989. It will release its new analysis of the budget about a week after the President sends his budget to Congress. **********The budget office's deficit projections are bigger than the President's primarily because it expects higher interest payments on the public debt and higher inflation in the cost of virtually all Government programs. And the budget office expects less real growth and more inflation than the Administration does. **********Curiously enough, Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, agrees with Congress. He has now disowned the Administration's economic projections as inconsistent with the deficits envisioned in the President's budget. When he signed on to the economic assumptions for the budget in December 1983, Mr. Feldstein assumed lower budget deficits, but the President rejected his case for higher taxes and bigger budget cuts. **********The White House, however, is holding to the original economic assumptions. These call for the 91-day Treasury bill rate, currently a little below 9 percent, to fall to 5 percent by 1989. Mr. Feldstein thinks that is too low. **********The Administration says inflation will come down to 3.5 percent by 1989, but Mr. Feldstein now believes that is too optimistic. **********And the Administration projects real economic growth at 4.5 percent in the calendar year 1989 and 4 percent a year from 1985 through 1989, but the Administration's chief economic adviser - and the Congressional economists - believes that is too high. **********An inside joke in earlier administrations about the budget process used to go: ''The Treasury controls taxes, the Office of Management and Budget controls expenditures and the Council of Economic Advisers controls the deficits.'' But now Mr. Feldstein has walked away from the economic assumptions and hence the deficits. **********Similarly, David Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, seems to have abandoned hope of controlling expenditures. In an interview with Fortune magazine, Mr. Stockman said the Reagan Administration had already cut so much out of Federal spending that further cuts were almost a political impossibility. ''There are a lot of dreamers,'' Mr. Stockman said, ''including in the Administration,'' who think the White House can get Congress to slash the costs of entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Federal and military pension programs, as the Presidential commission headed by J. Peter Grace recommends. **********Like Mr. Stockman, old Congressional hands think the White House and Mr. Grace are dreaming if they think huge cuts in those benefit programs are politically feasible. **********During this election year, Mr. Reagan has forcibly rejected tax increases. But Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan said yesterday that after the election the Administration would consider simplification of the tax system and ''temporary'' adoption of a consumption tax - presumably some sort of sales tax. This may give the President an opportunity in his State of the Union address tonight to parry Democratic charges that he is being irresponsible about budget deficits. **********Is Mr. Reagan suddenly shifting his ground on a tax increase or is this a new political ploy? If, as many economists and businessmen expect, the economic expansion starts to weaken in 1985, a big tax increase would aggravate the downturn. **********And a temporary consumption tax would do nothing to alter the big deficits projected for the out- years unless the tax increase was not so temporary. The ''temporary'' in Secretary Regan's statement would appear to be a way of getting around President Reagan's opposition to tax increases. **********The President has also made it abundantly clear that he will fight against any military budget cuts, or rather any Congressional slowing of the rate of increase in military spending.

Before that, he had sought to buy into the St. Regis Corporation in a big way, but St. Regis proved coldly unreceptive. **********In neither instance was Sir James entirely disappointed. In the St. Regis episode, the group he headed accepted a $50 million profit for its 9 percent of the company's shares. His stake in Continental yielded an estimated $35 million profit when he bowed out after losing to Peter Kiewit Sons Inc. and David H. Murdock, the West Coast millionaire. **********Now Sir James has apparently set his sights on two other corporate giants: the Colgate-Palmolive Company, the big household products producer, and - most recently - the Crown Zellerbach Corporation, a forest products company with vast timberlands. His adviser in these deals is Rothschild Inc. of New York. **********Not Showing His Hand **********Typically, Sir James is not showing too much of his hand. His interest in Colgate became known to that company (but not the public) when Sir James sought Federal antitrust clearance to buy more than 15 percent of Colgate. Neither Colgate nor Sir James chose to say anything publicly for weeks, but when Sir James sought similar clearance for Crown Zellerbach, that company immediately announced the move and declared it would fight. **********Sir James has not disclosed his holdings in either company, which implies that he does not yet own 5 percent. If he did, he would be required to disclose that fact within 10 days. **********People who know Sir James say that if he landed Colgate, he might sell off operations outside its mainstream, such as the manufacture of shoes, clothing and crystal. And the key to his interest in Crown Zellerbach appears to be forest land, a subject he knows well. **********Four years ago, after a hotly contested battle, he seized control of the Diamond International Corporation, a big paper and forest products company. He broke it up and sold off the pieces - for a profit of more than $500 million - but kept one piece: more than a million acres of American forest lands. Crown Zellerbach, however, owns almost twice as much as Sir James does. **********Sir James has proved, on several occasions, to be a scrapper, with bulldog determination. **********''You only have to take his batting record,'' one friend, Sir Gordon White, head of Hanson Industries in New York, a British-owned conglomerate, remarked. ''He is is not only incredibly successful, but very willing to fight for what he believes in.'' **********But some of his friends say Sir James may have mellowed. The financier was said to have felt offended several months ago when Wall Street traders pegged him as a ''greenmailer'' for selling stock back to St. Regis. The implication was that he had sought only a quick profit and had never intended to take over St. Regis. **********''St. Regis,'' Sir James remarked, ''was a failure, not a success.'' He proposed merging his forest lands into St. Regis, raising his stake to 25 percent, joining the board and settling down to become a model citizen. St. Regis refused, so he got out. **********Sir James has one of the more unusual resumes in world financial circles. More than 30 years ago, as a moneyless 20-year-old socialite, he made headlines around the world when he defied Antenor Patino, the Bolivian tin king, and eloped to Scotland in a borrowed Rolls-Royce with the Bolivian's 18-year-old daughter, Isabel. She was to die tragically within months, following the birth of their daughter, also named Isabel. **********Sued Gossip Sheet **********Seven years ago, he sued Private Eye, a British gossip sheet, winning an apology and substantial damages after he was accused erroneously of being a business associate of Roberto Calvi, the controversial Italian banker. Mr. Calvi, sometimes called ''God's banker'' because of his association with the Vatican, was found hanged under Blackfriar's Bridge in London two years ago in a mystery yet to be solved. **********Sir James is reputed to be worth as much as $900 million, but there is no way of knowing because of his penchant for secrecy. **********His two main companies apparently, are Cia. Financiera Lido of Panama, of which he owns 40 percent, and the Brunneria Foundation of Liechtenstein, which owns the rest of Lido. These, in turn, own other companies in Hong Kong, France, Britain, the Bahamas and the United States. **********Most of them do little more than own other companies. But it seems clear that Sir James, whose operations are now concentrated in this country, controls the Grand Union Company, owns considerable acreage left over from the dismemberment of Diamond International, commands oil reserves in Guatemala, plus a smattering of publishing companies in France and gambling interests in Britain. **********'A First-Class Person' **********Laurence A. Tisch, head of the Loews Corporation and a director of the Grand Union Company when Sir James bought the food chain years ago, remarked: ''We found him to be a first-class person to do business with, honorable and decisive. I have great admiration for his ability.'' **********He controls, for example, 40 percent of the Aspinall casinos in Britain, owned by his friend, John Aspinall. He also owns L'Express, the largest news magazine in France, the newly started Paris Express, a city magazine somewhat in concept like New York, and Lire, the largest literary magazine in France. **********Except for Continental, his biggest project to date has been converting Grand Union to one of the most exciting food stores in the country. A hundred of them now stock not only staples, but also such gourmet fare as duckling glazed with honey or soy sauce, and live trout swimming in a tank. **********One of two sons of a British father and a French mother, James Michael Goldsmith was born in Paris in 1933. The Goldschmidts, as they were known earlier in Frankfurt, had been wealthy German Jewish bankers as far back as 1790. But because of Prussian anti-Semitism in the 1860's, the family gave up banking, moved to England and changed its name. **********His father, Frank, had been a major in the British Army and a Member of Parliament. Later he became a hotel operator, and while not wealthy, sent his sons to fine schools: James to Eton and Edward to Magdalen College at Oxford, where he himself had studied. **********Joins British Army **********At 17, James dropped out of Eton and took a cook's job at the famous Palace Hotel. At 18, he joined the British Army, entering as a private and emerging two years later as a lieutenant. **********At 20, with $200, he bought the French rights to a British rheumatism cream and started a company. Three years later he sold the company for $500,000, using the money to begin a dietary foods concern. The young Goldsmith was already building a reputation for creating new ventures on the profits of earlier ones. **********Widely known as Jimmy, despite his knighthood, Sir James stands 6 feet 4 inches tall, weighs more than 200 pounds and is baldish. **********His friends describe him as charming, outgoing and easy to know but also somewhat rumpled, with his shirt often half out and his tie askew. **********He is the father of six children, Isabel, 30, being the oldest, and Benjamin, 4, being the youngest. His second marriage, to Ginette Lery, was dissolved, and he is now married to Lady Annabel Vane Tempest Stewart. Once exceptionally open about keeping a mistress, he rarely talks of such matters today and friends say he has become ''very private'' about his personal life. **********Clio Goldsmith, the actress who played the sex-kittenish title role in the film ''The Gift,'' is the 26-year-old daughter of his brother, Edward, now a leading British environmentalist and scholar. **********Voracious Reader **********Sir James regards publishing as his main hobby, plays tennis badly and reads voraciously. **********While he does not own a yacht, he has a house in Paris and another in London, and one of his companies maintains a house for him in the fashionable East 80's in Manhattan. He brings his butler with him when in town and rents a car to get around. In London, he is chauffered in a company Ford; in Paris it is a Peugeot. **********Sir James is nothing if not optimistic. Consider his investment in Grand Union. ''We've taken big risks in Grand Union,'' he remarked in a phone interview from London earlier this year. ''It's not yet proven, but I believe it's going to be our biggest success.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/15/world/fire-put-out-on-gulf-tanker-but-ship-remains-in-danger.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 411, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FIRE PUT OUT ON GULF TANKER, BUT SHIP REMAINS IN DANGER", "print_headline": "FIRE PUT OUT ON GULF TANKER, BUT SHIP REMAINS IN DANGER", "body_text": " **********A fire aboard a gas tanker damaged by missiles in the Persian Gulf was put out today, but the Greek-owned vessel remained in danger, shipping officials here said. **********The vessel, the Gas Fountain, was attacked Friday by unidentified warplanes after taking on a load of propane and butane from the Saudi Arabian port of Ras Tanura. **********The shipping officials said Philippine and Dutch firefighting experts had put out the flames.

At yesterday's close, the spot April aluminum contract was quoted at a nominal 67.60 cents a pound, up 0.15 cent for the day. **********Metal brokers said they expect trading in the new aluminum futures market, which opened last Dec. 8, to remain sluggish until more traders become convinced that the long slide in cash prices is nearing an end. **********But what interests metal traders more is that this young market has quietly attracted a surprising number of commercial users of aluminum. This became evident with the expiration of the March contract on March 27, when about 1,000 contracts of 40,000 pounds each, one-fourth of the open interest, were exchanged for metal rather than offset by trades, as is usually the case in futures markets. **********Comment by a Specialist **********David L. Moison, specialist in base metals at Merrill Lynch Futures, observed, ''While the older London Metal Exchange aluminum market was much more liquid, we see a steady and healthy rise in the number of hedgers and speculators using the Comex futures, albeit in small quantities.'' **********The latest tally of aluminum stocks registered at the Comex was 42,000 tons, compared with 199,450 on the London Metal Exchange, long the dominant market for aluminum futures. **********The exchange stocks reflect the continuing global reduction in primary ingot aluminum since the peak of 2,169,000 metric tons last August, when prices began to slide from 76.41 cents a pound. The global stocks then fell to 1,955.000 tons in November before rising to just over 2 million tons on Jan. 31, the latest reporting date. **********''By June 30 the stocks should be down another 150,000 to 200,000 tons,'' Mr. Moison said, ''because the use of aluminum rises and falls with the temperature.'' **********Aside from the increased use of aluminum in food and beverage containers and for construction, the industry is also expected to benefit from the general improvement in the American and overseas economies. ''It is significant that the L.M.E. aluminum stocks have been slowly but steadily falling since since last August,'' Mr. Moison said. **********Si Wakesberg, vice president-commodities at the National Association of Recycling Industries, said: ''Aluminum's basic problem was that producers were overly optimistic about the strength of the recovery. Last year they produced too much too quickly, and their primary stocks began to rise with the seasonal downturn in demand that often occurs after Labor Day. With primary supplies falling and the fact that aluminum scrap supplies have grown tighter in recent weeks, we think primary and recycled aluminum prices may turn upward, at least until the fall.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/17/business/penn-square-settlement.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 206, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Penn Square Settlement", "print_headline": "Penn Square Settlement", "body_text": " **********A settlement has been reached by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation with one of six former officers and directors of the Penn Square Bank who were blamed for the bank's failure in 1982. **********Terms of the accord call for Carl W.

In June, for example, the New York State Assembly approved a bill that would allow state- chartered savings banks to invest in and control real estate development. **********Move Follows One on Securities **********Today's action was the second time this month that the F.D.I.C. has moved to set new rules in an area that has been generally regarded as the exclusive jurisdiction of the states. **********On Nov. 19, over the strenuous objections of the securities industry, the F.D.I.C. adopted a regulation that would allow subsidiaries of about 9,300 state-chartered banks to underwrite corporate securities. **********As he did today, William M. Isaac, the chairman of the F.D.I.C., insisted then that in adopting the securities underwriting rule, the agency was not breaking down barriers in banking; it was only seeking to clarify existing rules.

In the past, the agency has taken as much as two years before voting on whether it should adopt a regulation. If finally adopted, however, the rule would require banks to place those activities in a ''bona fide'' subsidiary that would operate separately from the parent bank. **********Mr. Isaac insisted today that the rule was ''neutral; it does not authorize or restrict; it does not add new powers, it does not subtract.'' **********But state banking officials strongly disagreed. Lawrence E. Kreider, executive vice president of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, said the F.D.I.C.'s action amounted to a Federal intrusion into an area traditionally managed by the states. **********''What they would do here is really destroy or seriously dilute the state's flexibility to experiment,'' Mr. Kreider said. ''Clearly, it's a reregulatory, not a deregulatory, move.'' **********Saul Klaman, president of the National Council of Savings Institutions, also criticized the new regulation for being ''unusually restrictive.'' **********''It has an adverse impact on institutions that have been doing this for a long time.'' Mr. Klaman said.

However, the agency said it cannot ignore that such expansion may increase the risk to the deposit insurance system. **********According to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, 13 states now allow state-chartered institutions to offer some form of real estate underwriting, 8 allow securities underwriting, 3 permit full-service brokerage activities, 12 permit management consulting and 15 permit banks to offer travel services."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/18/business/loans-to-argentina-cut-citicorp-profit.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Barnes", "pub_date": "1984-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 868, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LOANS TO ARGENTINA CUT CITICORP PROFIT", "print_headline": "LOANS TO ARGENTINA CUT CITICORP PROFIT", "body_text": " **********Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding company, said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings were reduced by $11 million because of loans to Argentina. Citicorp is Argentina's second-largest American bank creditor. **********In the last full quarter under the leadership of Walter B. Wriston, chairman, the company's earnings fell 1.9 percent, to $206 million, from $210 million. On a per share basis, Citicorp earned $1.49, down from $1.59 a share last year. Mr. Wriston retires from Citicorp on Sept. 1. He will be succeeded by John S. Reed, a vice chairman. **********Also reporting yesterday, the Bankers Trust New York Corporation said earnings rose 4.3 percent in the second quarter despite a $1.7 million after-tax reduction in profits from loans to Argentina. Also, Mellon Bank said earnings fell 19.8 percent in the period, but attributed the decline mainly to domestic lending and higher operating expenses. Wells Fargo & Company said that, excluding a one-time gain a year earlier, profits were up 16.9 percent for the period. **********Analysts said that despite the decline at Citicorp, Mr. Wriston would be leaving the bank in solid financial shape. **********Earnings for all three of the company's major divisions - consumer banking, corporate and government lending, and investment banking - fell slightly in the second quarter. Analysts were surprised, however, at the strength of the bank's corporate and government lending operation, which managed to post profits of $159 million, down 10.2 percent from last year's $177 million, but high in light of domestic and foreign loan problems and a decline in foreign exchange trading profits. **********Robert Albertson, banking analyst for Smith Barney, said without volatility and aberrations in bond and foreign exchange trading and unusual adjustments to loan loss reserves, the company probably would have earned about $1.75 a share for the quarter. **********''I'd call that a record,'' Mr. Albertson said. **********A senior Citicorp executive who asked not to be named said of Mr. Wriston's final quarter: ''We made $429 million in the last six months in a tough environment. I would say he was pretty pleased.'' **********Still, return on total assets, an important measure of the bank's performance, slipped in the quarter to 0.58 percent, from 0.67 percent in the comparable quarter last year. **********In June, the Federal Reserve Board told banks to adopt tougher accounting rules concerning loans to Argentina, but said they did not have to go into effect until the third quarter. The rules limit the amount of interest income banks can report as earned. **********Many banks have chosen to make the adjustment in the second quarter, however, to build credibility with investors and customers, analysts say. Other banks, including Citicorp, have been using the more conservative reporting method all along. **********Mellon Bank, which made the adjustment during the period, said the effect was ''insignificant'' because the bank placed most of its $124 million in loans to Argentina in the nonaccruing catagory in the first quarter. Wells Fargo and Bankers Trust, which both also have relatively few loans to Argentina, also adopted the new rules in the second quarter. Wells Fargo also said the impact was ''not significant.'' **********Citicorp **********Citicorp said net income in its consumer banking division fell 7 percent, to $52 million, from $56 million in the comparable quartera year earlier. At the same time, profits from investment banking operations, which include such activities as bond trading, fell 9 percent, to $31 million, from $34 million. **********The company said second-quarter results were also reduced by $3 million because of acquisitions and absorption of losses from its newly purchased savings and loan associations in Florida and Illinois. **********Citicorp increased its provision for loan losses to $139 million, compared with $99 million at the end of the second quarter in 1983. Problem loans rose to $2.4 billion, from $2.3 billion. **********Bankers Trust **********Bankers Trust, the nation's 10th-largest banking company, said profits rose to $72 million, from $69 million. On a per share basis, profits rose to $2.25, from $2.29 a share. The company had 1.7 million more shares outstanding in the second quarter than in the perioda year earlier. Profits for the period include a $2 million after-tax gain from the sale of upstate branches, while the period a year earlier includes a $7.2 million gain from the sale of upstate branches and from a debt-for-equity swap. **********Bankers Trust increased its provision for loan losses to $40 million, compared with $10 million a year earlier. Problem loans rose to $604 million, from $463 million a year ago. **********Mellon **********Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank, the nation's 12th-largest banking concern, said profits fell to $39.4 million, from $49.1 million a year earlier. Per share earnings fell to $1.40, from $1.90. **********The provision for loan losses rose to $30.4 million, from $9.7 million a year earlier. Nonperforming loans fell to $506.5 million, from $584.9 million. **********Wells Fargo **********Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, said it earned $40.9 million in the second quarter, up slightly from $40.6 million. On a per share basis, earnings were $1.63, against $1.56 a share.

And if John N. Carpender were a bit taller and less stocky, Mr. Pfaff might be accused of cloning. **********Not that they are perfect lookalikes. It is really just the skin tone and the way they have their white hair cut, quite short and parted on the left. **********But the similarities do not end there. There is a shared love of advertising and of money. And both are 1951 graduates of lesser-known Ivy League schools. For the chairman it was Dartmouth and his new associate, Brown. And both are former Navy officers. **********The big difference is that Mr. Pfaff is dedicated to the creation of advertising and Mr. Carpender to account management. **********The new president is in the Pfaff penthouse offices at 185 Madison Avenue mainly because after years of contentment at the $10 million to $12 million billings level, Warren Pfaff, the one-time J. Walter Thompson copywriting executive, decided about six months ago that he wanted to double the agency's billings. **********Why?  ''More excitement. More fun. And more money,'' he said quickly and surely. **********The agency has eight clients, eight employees and farms out all of its media buying, research work and public relations needs. Generally new business has come to it. There has been little organized new business activity. **********Enter Mr. Carpender, who sees new accounts coming in in three ways: from pitching a list of some 110 or so companies in various fields that he and the boss put together; by referrals from giant agencies that really do not want to be tied to smaller accounts, and the friends Mr. Carpender collected during his years in the package goods field. **********He plans to use the old let-me-work- on-your-worst-brand tactic. Or is it, give your dog a new home? He does have the contacts. **********Before joining Caravatt Communications two years ago, he had been senior vice president of marketing services at the W. E. Long Company, a cooperative association of baking companies; was director of marketing at Abbott Laboratories, maker of such things as Selsun Blue and Murine, and worked for Revlon and Chesebrough-Pond's. Also nestled among his work experiences is a 10- year tour with the Carl Ally agency, where Paul Caravatt was his boss for the first time. **********Mr. Pfaff had talked to some 27 candidates for the job, described in trade press classified ads as a ''top account-management position.'' It was done at lunch or cocktails, generally at the Park Ten Restaurant down the block on 34th Street. **********He had four sessions, each more than three hours long, with Mr. Carpender before he popped the question. The prospect never saw the ads, but he did pick a message off the grapevine, which, like the classified, said nothing about a president's title. **********As a matter of fact, the founder did not have it firmly in mind until he met the man from Caravatt. **********''The president thing was vaguely in back of my mind,'' Mr. Pfaff confided, ''but I really didn't think I'd find a guy that would fill the bill. **********''When we reached an agreement about his joining, he said, 'What will I be called?' **********''What would you like to be called?' I asked, and he said, 'Director of account services,' and I said, 'What else?' and he said, 'Vice president? Senior vice president?' **********''I said, 'I have something else in mind. President.' '' **********All accomplished with a certain amount of flair. Mr. Pfaff has a certain amount of that, certainly. While he was in his late teens in Great Neck, L.I., he had a flair for sports, particularly baseball, and in fact played the infield for the Olean Oilers, a St. Louis Browns farm team in upstate New York. **********Out of college he had other interests and went to Paris to study painting, only to come back to the States and decide on an acting career, but only if he could support himself and a wife. He could not, so the stage's loss was advertising's gain and he started as an art director with the old Bryan Houston agency. **********Five months later he got calls on the same day from J.W.T. and N.W. Ayer, both of whom had interviewed him earlier. He picked Thompson and stayed for 12 years, mostly as a copywriter, deciding on the business without loving it and then falling in love with it, just like in the stories of arranged marriages.

As interns, they must spend at least one day a week working on projects at the Shawmut Bank of Boston, Honeywell Inc., the Kendall Company, the Computervision Corporation, the Foxboro Company, Massachusetts General Hospital and the State of Massachusetts.

The source said the Republican leaders believed the chances for passage were good. **********The proposal for a moratorium on sea-based cruise missiles was offered by Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr., Republican of Maryland, who noted that the deployment was scheduled to begin this month. At a cost of $3 million apiece, he said, the missiles have ''macabre appeal'' as a bargain. But he said they endangered prospects for verifiable arms control. **********Senator David Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota and a co-sponsor of the amendment, said that ''unlike MX, the issue is timing, not technology.'' He was referring to the prospect of renewed negotiations with the Soviet Union after the Presidential election. **********He added, ''It would be tragic if we limited the chance for a post-November agreement with hasty action in June.'' **********Speaking on behalf of the Administration, which opposed the amendment, Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, called it a ''unilateral moratorium.'' **********Mr. Mathias and Mr. Durenberger dropped the tougher language in their amendment and accepted a compromise measure offered by Mr. Cohen that expressed a nonbinding sense of Congress that the President should seek negotiations on the nuclear cruise missiles with Moscow and advise the Kremlin of the necessity of ''intrusive on-site inspection procedures.'' The Senate agreed to this compromise on the amendment by a vote of 97 to 0.   House Acted Last Month **********Last month, the House of Representatives passed an amendment to its version of the military bill that would ban the deployment of new sea-launched nuclear cruise missiles unless the President certified that the Soviet Union had deployed similar weapons. **********A spokesman for Mr. Durenberger said that Senate proponents of a moratorium realized that they could not obtain a restriction similar to the House's. By accepting the Cohen substitute, they were assured that the Senate would at least hold some position on cruise missiles from which to negotiate later in committee conference. **********Both the Senate and the House measures were aimed at nuclear-armed models of the Navy's Tomahawk missile. The Administration requested $593 million in the fiscal year 1985 for building nuclear and conventional types, calling them the ''cornerstone of our effort to increase and diversify the striking power of our fleet.'' **********Need for Missiles Challenged **********The missiles are designed to be fired from surface ships or submarines. The nuclear version reportedly can carry a warhead with the explosive power of 200,000 tons of TNT to within 300 feet of a target 1,500 miles away. About $225 million of the total Administration request is for nuclear Tomahawks. **********Mr. Mathias also challenged the need for the missiles on the Senate floor last year, urging as he did today that they be included in strategic arms reduction talks with Moscow. A motion to kill his amendment was approved last year by a close vote that showed bipartisan support for a restriction on the Tomahawk. **********In their authorization reports, the Armed Services Committees of the Senate and the House both approved the full Administration request. The Senate committee noted that its ''serious concern'' about the Tomahawk program before 1983, when more than 50 percent of all Tomahawk tests were failures, had been largely addressed by the Navy.  On another arms-control issue, the Senate, by a vote of 82 to 17, passed an amendment offered by two Democrats, Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, that would reinforce the current American policy of not undercutting provisions of the second strategic arms limitation treaty with the Soviet Union. **********''This expresses for the first time the will of more than two-thirds of the Senate that SALT II should not be undercut,'' Mr. Leahy said, referring to the fact that a two-thirds majority is required for Senate approval of treaties. **********Although the Senate has never approved the treaty, which was signed by President Carter and Leonid I.

In fact, post- election blues have soured investors on stocks every four years since the election of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. **********But this year could be different. ''The fear of the market going into the tank after the election is overdone,'' said Charles H. Brunie, chairman of the Oppenheimer Capital Corporation, which manages $3.5 billion in equities. **********He pointed out that the causes of the market downturns in the first six months of the year following the last five elections were higher interest rates and a slowing of the economy caused by Federal Reserve Board's tightening of the money supply. This time around, private credit demand and the economy have already cooled off on their own. **********''If anything, the Fed may try to get things moving again by loosening up on the money supply,'' Mr. Brunie said. For the last six months, the money supply has grown at an average 2 percent annual rate, in contrast to an average of more than 7 percent for the similar periods prior to the last five Presidential elections. **********Growing Spirit of Optimism **********Indeed, despite the indecisive tone to the market of late, there is a growing spirit of optimism that stocks are poised for a longer rally than the market has seen in the choppy trading of the last year and a half. Such a burst of activity would take the Dow Jones industrial average beyond the 1,287 record level of last November. The Dow closed yesterday at 1,216.65, gaining 11.70 points for the week. **********The kickoff, however, for the market's next big move up may still be a few weeks, if not a few months, away, market strategists and money managers say. They are not looking for the market to start flying in the next few days if President Reagan wins the election, for instance. **********A big Reagan victory is already expected by the market, said Suresh Bhirud, market strategist for the First Boston Corporation. About the only way the market will get a shot in the arm from a Republican victory is if a Reagan landslide is large enough to turn control of the House of Representatives over to the Republicans, he said. **********But sooner rather than later, ''There is another big surge coming in the market when investors reflect on the Reagan victory and the fact that the economy is O.K.,'' said Barton Biggs, chief investment strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company, reflecting Wall Street's assumption of a Reagan victory. He expects the Dow to be in a range of 1,400 to 1,500 by next spring. **********Mr. Bhirud added that ''the psychology of the market will shift when it realizes that the economic recovery is sustainable in 1985.'' The market could get ''an extra kicker,'' he said, from a further decline in oil prices and a stronger export climate because of a topping out of the dollar's strength. **********Lower Interest Rates Help **********''Things are beginning to fall in place,'' said Thomas Williams, senior vice president of Kemper Financial Services. Most important, he said, the decline in interest rates in the last month makes stocks more attractive investments compared with short- or long-term fixed income securities. And it could spur more consumer and business spending, thus pumping new life into the flagging economy, analysts say. **********Further, Mr. Williams sees the possibility after the election of a cut by the Fed in the discount rate for the funds it lends to member banks. And he expects further downward pressure on rates coming from pension funds, which will move to lock up current rates on long-term bonds before they fall further. **********How long will a market rally last? Richard Hoffman, a market strategist who advises institutions out of his own firm, R. J. Hoffman & Company, believes the gains will ''be short but sweet.'' By next April or May, he expects investors to turn bearish because the economy will have become overheated and little will have been done to curb the Federal deficit. **********To be sure, there is still a tug-of- war between investors who fear the slowdown in the growth of the economy will lead to a recession and those who believe the more modest growth rate can be sustained well into 1985. It is what has kept the market in a state of fits and starts for the last few months. **********18% in Cash Investments **********Andrew Furtak, portfolio manager in charge of the $1.4 billion IDS Stock Fund, for instance, is ''staying loose,'' as he puts it, by setting aside a relatively high 18 percent of his portfolio for short-term cash investments. **********''There are just too many crosscurrents,'' he said. ''The market is so volatile. It can go 50 to 70 points either way.'' He believes it will take further cuts in interest rates, so that money market funds, for instance, will be less appealing, before the retail investor returns to the stock market. **********Institutional investors are already fairly heavily invested, said Dudley Eppel, managing director in charge of trading for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ''If the market gets going, it will have to do so on its own,'' he said. **********More trouble lies ahead before that happens, according to Steven Kroll, chief investment officer of Hutton Asset Management, which manages $1.2 billion of mutual funds. ''After the election, people are going to realize that corporate earnings estimates will continue to come down,'' he said. The market, he added, has not ''discounted the earnings shortfall'' that will result from a slight decrease in sales coupled with corporations' inability to raise prices in a non-inflationary environment. **********Nonetheless, the good news about interest rates outweighs that risk, says Robert Hill, executive vice president of Favia, Hill Inc., the money management subsidiary of the Chemical Bank. In the last few weeks, his firm has moved $200 million out of cash investments into stocks. ''Consumer confidence is high and capital spending will accelerate with the decline in interest rates,'' he said. ''We view the current malaise in the market as a lag in appreciation of a decline in interest rates.'' **********'The Stage Is Set' **********''The stage is set for an enormous rally,'' said Robert Chamine, head trader at Wertheim & Company. ''I think the market is going sky-high.'' With lower interest rates and the expectation for continued low inflation, ''there's isn't a negative on the horizon,'' he said. Institutional investors, he added ''want to buy stocks; they just need a catalyst.'' **********The stocks that institutions are buying these days reflect the current lower interest rate, low inflation environment. Many money managers, for instance, have moved more aggressively into the so-called interest- sensitive stocks, such as banks and savings and loan associations that stand to benefit from lower costs of funds. They also like utilities because their high dividends compare more favorably with fixed-income investments now. **********Mr. Hill of Favia, Hill has been a recent buyer of Northern States Power as an interest rate play, and he also favors a number of consumer product companies, such as Pillsbury and Squibb. They should perform well, he said, because they are enjoying ''high unit growth'' and do not need large increases in the price of their products to show good earnigns gains. **********A ''major theme'' of recent new investments for Mr. Furtak's IDS Stock Fund has been stocks that will benefit from a topping out of the strength in the dollar due to less demand by foreigners for dollar-denominated fixed income securities. Multinational stocks, such as the drug companies and General Electric, have caught his eye, Mr. Furtak said, because of the likelihood of stronger United States exports and a more favorable atmosphere for foreign earnings translations. **********If the market does take off, a far broader list of stocks than the current favorites will start hopping, of course. These could well include the much beaten down technology stocks, which Mr. Williams says ''nobody loves, nobody even likes right now.'' He believes they may well be among the strongest performers next year because of their current depressed levels and because even in a modest growth economy they will turn in above-average earnings gains. **********Like Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Biggs of Morgan Stanley expects that by early spring the surging market will be at a crossroads. But ''whether the runup will be the last leg of the bull market or just a beginning,'' he said, ''depends on declining oil prices and if Reagan takes a big whack at the deficit.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/11/business/company-news-retailers-seek-growth-ideas.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1984-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 631, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS Retailers Seek Growth Ideas", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS Retailers Seek Growth Ideas", "body_text": " **********With the year's sales outlook already robust, retailers at a national convention in New York yesterday pushed for new ideas that could provide still more strength. **********In session after session at the annual convention of the National Retail Merchants' Association, new tools for merchandising, credit, competition and marketing were suggested. **********''Marketing has finally come to retailing,'' said Samuel J. Cohen, a management consultant. **********'A Golden Era' **********''Retailing will be coming into a golden era, when the biggest buying segment, the 25- to 45-year olds, becomes the principal population segment,'' said Austin Kiplinger, editor in chief of the Kiplinger Washington Letter, speaking to a luncheon of the association's independent store unit at the New York Hilton Hotel. **********America's retailers should emulate the airlines and promote customer loyalty with ''frequent shopper'' programs similar to ''frequent flier'' plans, said Alfred Eisenpreis, vice president for retail marketing of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau. **********''A frequent shopper's cumulative purchases could be tracked through the year with bonuses on reaching different purchase levels,'' he said, adding that incentives could be built in to stimulate shopping on slow days or for slow-moving merchandise. **********Time to 'Rehumanize' **********Criticizing cuts in salespeople, Mr. Eisenpreis said it was time to ''rehumanize the retail selling floor,'' adding: ''First we got rid of the phrase, 'May I help you?' Then we got rid of anyone who could help. The decline in manufacturing jobs has created a new labor pool. If we reposition store work as a rewarding career, practice outreach, provide effective training and discipline, we can create a new sales floor environment.'' **********What should long-established stores do when the bottom falls out of their area's economy? David A. Horr, president of Marting's Department Store in Portsmouth, Ohio, told a session that when the local steel mill closed permanently three years ago, idling 5 percent of the labor force, his century-old store decided to chart a new plan for the future. The result was short-term and long-term strategies developed from a professionally conducted attitude survey. **********'Get on With It' **********But the biggest hurdle, he said, was to finally stop planning ''and get on with it, probably the most difficult phase of all.'' He added: ''Plans should be reassessed from time to time. They need to be kept realistic and must involve as many employees as possible. Our lesson learned from hard times is - plan, plan, plan - it will give you control of the business.'' **********In another session, Stanley Marcus, chairman emeritus of Neiman-Marcus, Dallas, said retailing was insufficiently creative, often leaving it to the smaller operators. ''I suspect that most retailers are so busy buying goods, taking care of markdowns and so on that they have too little time to give thought to creativity,'' he said. ''It seems to me that the most creative people are shunning retailing and going into scientific and technological fields where creativity is encouraged, rather than sat upon.'' **********More Creativity Urged **********Mr. Marcus said retailers should study new methods of ''editing and putting together merchandise and how they display them in their stores.'' He added: ''Since merchandise creativity is hampered by the reluctance of manufacturers to do special things for an individual store, it might be well to increase purchases in foreign markets more able to accept innovative ideas.'' **********His suggestion, coincidentally or not, was endorsed by a unanimous vote taken by the association's executive board. That group yesterday approved a program to fight the Administration's tightened regulations of textile and apparel imports, which the retail group said cost its member concerns $600 million in lost business last year. The program calls for a campaign of political and legislative action, legal effort, international lobbying, public relations and research to fight the effort to stem curbs on buying abroad."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/28/world/arafat-and-hussein-discuss-convening-palestine-council.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 88, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arafat and Hussein Discuss Convening Palestine Council", "print_headline": "Arafat and Hussein Discuss Convening Palestine Council", "body_text": " **********Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, left here on Friday after talks with King Hussein over the convening of the Palestine Liberation Council, the Palestinian parliament in exile. **********Mr. Arafat said at a news conference that the Council would have to meet before the end of next month.

Seventeen were arrested Friday and today, and one person wanted in at least six murder cases was said to have been killed by the police in Jullundur district. **********Residents of Amritsar arriving here, along with Indian reporters, said the climate of fear that had gripped the city for months had eased. **********Nearly 600 people, according to official reports, and perhaps more than 1,000, according to other estimates, were killed during the army's invasion of the Golden Temple compound, which militants had turned into a fortress. Among the dead was a Sikh leader, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.   Half-Hour Visit to Temple **********Mrs. Gandhi, accompanied by Government radio and television reporters, spent half an hour in the temple. She touched her shrouded head to the floor of the gold-sheathed inner sanctum, tendered an offering of rupees and, while musicians chanted prayers, she took a mouthful of the mush that is used in what corresponds to communion for Sikhs. **********The scene was televised, apparently as part of an effort to mollify Sikhs angry over the invasion of the temple. **********During the visit, Mrs. Gandhi was told that some Sikh scriptures had been damaged during the battle. Giani Sahib Singh, the head priest, demanded that the army be pulled out and that worshippers be allowed to use the temple during fixed hours. **********The Punjab Government said it would soon begin taking busloads of pilgrims to the temple to quell misgivings about its condition. **********The head priest also urged Mrs. Gandhi to bring about an early release of innocent people arrested during the temple raid and in army sweeps through the Punjabi countryside. Some official sources say that perhaps 200 of the nearly 1,600 people arrested in the temple raid are innocent pilgrims and that more than 100 are temple employees. More than 4,000 have been reported arrested in all, and many of them are expected to be released after screening.   Lower Estimate Being Offered **********Some Government officials have now returned to an estimate, made before the army moved into Punjab on June 2, that no more than 400 to 500 militants were operating from the temple. The identity of the others is unclear, though they are presumed to include criminals, fugitives, and fringe members of the Bhindranwale group. **********As normal traffic in and out of Punjab picked up, a longtime Sikh resident of Amritsar arrived here Friday and reported that ''in general, there is a very, very big sense of relief in Amritsar.'' **********Just before the army action, he said, Sikh militants capitalizing on the situation had created a climate of fear throughout the city and its surrounding villages. **********The resident said Sikhs and Hindus alike felt the relief, although a residual fear remained that militants might still seek revenge on people who were not with them. **********At the same time, the Amritsar resident said, ''people are afraid that when the army leaves, there will be further looting and killing.''  Soldiers Are Called Courteous **********The resident also said that, according to preliminary reports, army troops in both the city and the countryside were behaving with restraint and courtesy. Although the soldiers searched houses at will, first reports said, there was said to be little or no brutality. **********Some people were reported killed in curfew violations, however. **********A team of reporters from the Press Trust of India, a news agency, also reported from Amritsar that there were visible signs of relief among citizens and that, while there was uneasy silence, there seemed to be no tension. **********Business and social activity was said to be reviving rapidly, in contrast to the weeks before the army crackdown, when militants struck at will, business in some places came to a halt, and people began to stay indoors. **********Foreigners, including reporters, are not allowed into Punjab, which for all the reported signs of normalcy still remains essentially under martial law."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/15/business/dividend-meetings-010582.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "print_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "body_text": " **********Following is a partial list of dividend meetings for the week of Oct. 15, 1984:  MONDAY Dana CorpJohnson & JohnsonEastern Utils AssocLilly (Eli) & CoFlorida Pwr & LtSouthern Co  TUESDAY Bearings IncInter First CorpBemis CoK Mart CorpCBI IndusScott PaperChase Manhattan Southern Ind G & EDonaldson Lufkin Stauffer ChemicalFleming CosTexas Commerce BancGt Western FinlTexas IndusHoneywell IncVF Corp  WEDNESDAY Alberto-CulverIntl Min & ChemBanc Texas GroupMagic ChefBarnett Banks FlaMelville CorpCessna AircraftNewhall Land & FarmConrac CorpPNB Mtge & RltyContinental GroupSunstrand CorpDow Jones & CoUnidynamics CorpEquitable GasWisc Pwr & LtHillenbrand Indus **********THURSDAY   Alagasco IncNatl Can CorpArcher-DanielsNiagara Mohawk PwrArizona Pub ServOwens-Corning FiberBell & HowellPotomac Elec PwrBlack & DeckerPublic Serv N HCoca-Cola CoReynolds (RJ) IndCollins & AikmanSouthern UnionDiamond ShamrockStandex IntlFirst Wisc CorpTECO Energy IncGeneral SignalThomas IndusGillette CoTransamerica CorpIowa-Ill G & ETull (JM) IndusKollmorgen Corp **********FRIDAY Acme ElectricIllinois Tool WksAmericana Hotels Mass Mutual InvestBundy CorpMay Dept StoresCentl Louisiana ElecMcNeil CorpFlowers IndusWachovia Corp"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/17/business/insurance-sales-begin-at-2-citibank-brances.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 514, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INSURANCE SALES BEGIN AT 2 CITIBANK BRANCES", "print_headline": "INSURANCE SALES BEGIN AT 2 CITIBANK BRANCES", "body_text": " **********Citibank, which has said that it wants to add insurance to its array of financial products, began offering life insurance policies yesterday through an insurance company at two of its New York City branches. **********Under the arrangement, term, universal and whole-life policies will be sold at Citibank by salaried employees of the American International Life Assurance Company of New York. The company, a member of the American International Group, which took in more than $1 billion in life insurance premiums last year, has leased space in Citibank branches. **********Leasing Terms **********A spokesman for Citibank, Susan Weeks, said that the bank would receive a flat rate or a percentage of sales, whichever is higher, for the use of its space. She declined to say what the rate or the percentage would be, adding that the bank had made no sales projections. ''We were primarily interested in giving customers a chance to buy insurance in a one- stop environment,'' she said. **********The first two branches to offer the service are at 42d Street and Madison Avenue, and at 86th Street and Broadway. Citibank said that six more branches in the New York area would add insurance centers by the end of this year, and that the program would be expanded to more branches in 1985. It also said that in the next year, the centers would introduce policies for cars, homeowners and renters.  Citibank has long expressed an interest in developing an insurance business. Last year it was one of several major banks that applied to buy state-chartered institutions in South Dakota, which permits such banks to sell insurance. However, at the request of the Federal Reserve Board, which said that banking's entry into insurance should be addressed at a national level, the banks withdrew their applications. **********Separately, Citibank makes life and health insurance available to its Mastercard and Visa cardholders under another arrangement with insurance companies.

Pending further deregulation, Mr. Soter said that making space available for an insurance office is ''a way to get customers even more reliant on a bank for all their financial services.''

Pension fund money that has traveled abroad runs into billions of dollars. Most of that money, of course, has been invested overseas for some years. **********A relative newcomer to this league, and admittedly a small player, is Wardley Marine International Investment Management. Based in London, Wardley Marine is a part of the huge Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and was formed by Wardley Investment Services Ltd. and Marine Midland Banks. Its specific aim is to tap the pension fund pool for equity investing outside the United States. **********Stephen M. Swift, managing director of Wardley Marine in London, talked about investments abroad during a visit this week to New York. **********''We expect Japan to continue as the largest segment of an overseas fund since it offers liquidity and, next to the United States, is the largest of all stock markets,'' he said. ''Currently, 45 percent of our portfolio is in Japanese stocks. **********''Last year, our investments were oriented mainly towards those Japanese companies, often of a technological nature, ranking as major exporters. Typical examples would be Fanuc Ltd., a manufacturer of numerical controls, and Matsushita Electric Industries, a leading maker of consumer electronic products.'' **********At present, however, Wardley Marine's holdings in Japan are more closely related to that country's domestic economy. **********''We are buying basically two types of stocks,'' Mr. Swift said. ''One consists of insurance companies, such as Sumitomo Marine and Fire, and Tokio Marine and Fire. The other includes cyclical and basic chemical issues, such as Sumitomo Chemical and Mitsubishi Petrochemical.'' **********European countries represented in the portfolio are typical: Britain, West Germany and the Netherlands. Holdings in Germany include Siemens, which makes electrical and electronic products, while Royal Dutch Petroleum is a leading investment in the Netherlands. As for Britain, the favorites range from British Petroleum to the General Electric Company P.L.C. (which has no connection with the United States company). **********Mr. Swift's experience as an international money manager includes stints in Hong Kong and Singapore. He was asked to name several stocks that appear to be attractive investments, anywhere in the world, over the next year or so. **********''In Japan, I would suggest Mitsui Chemical as a basic industry company and also Nippon Oil in energy,'' he replied. ''In Europe, there's a little Belgian stock trading at a ludicrously low price- earnings multiple. This is Bekaert, a producer of specialty steel for radial tires.'' **********There is no way for American investors, big or small, to buy into Wardley Marine itself. However, shares of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking are traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and on the over-the-counter market here in the form of American depository receipts. **********In its research coverage of foreign stocks, Merrill Lynch carries an ''O.K. to buy'' opinion on shares of the bank. On the basis of investor suitability, the stock is rated ''speculative,'' the brokerage firm noted, ''because of the political uncertainty in Hong Kong.'' This is an allusion to the future of the British colony, one of the most aggressive and successful trading centers in the world, after 1997, when Britain's lease from China on 90 percent of the territory expires. **********Elsewhere, the Securities Industry Association has reported that no fewer than 12 foreign stock exchanges chalked up bigger gains last year in dollar terms than the United States equity market. **********''The boom of stock markets worldwide sent U.S. investors on an unparalleled buying spree,'' the brokerage firm trade group said. ''Net purchases of foreign securities reached a record $3.8 billion,'' compared with the previous high of $2.1 billion in 1980. **********American investors of all types were net buyers of $1.1 billion of British stocks last year.

Account And Insurance **********WHEN a bank offers an Individual Retirement Account, as thousands around the country do, any edge over its competitors' products could lure many additional customers. And one such marketing tool that hundreds of banks and savings institutions are offering these days is free life and/or disability insurance under a concept generically known as I.R.A. completion insurance. **********The name is actually a misnomer, because the insurance does not necessarily guarantee the completion of an I.R.A. program. What these programs do, though, is give one or both types of insurance - frequently of an amount only up to the annual allowable investment of $2,000, or $2,250 for a couple with a nonworking spouse - at no charge to the investor. **********Typically, the insurance will pay to the I.R.A. holder or beneficiary the amount that would have been accumulated if deposits had continued on the same basis. The customer thereby gets something for nothing, while the institution gets an add-on that helps it compete, not only against other banks but against individual retirement annuities sold by insurance companies as well. **********''If I saw an I.R.A. plan at a bank that gives you this thing, I'd say sure, take it, it doesn't hurt,'' said W. Wesley Howard, editor of the IRA Reporter, a Cleveland-based newsletter that follows this field. ''It really is group term life insurance.'' **********''The pitch is that, instead of shopping rates only, the consumer is also shopping benefits,'' said Kelly Green, first vice president of Financial Institution Services Inc., a Nashville service company that has set up an insurance program for 100 banks and other institutions. ''We can show that a bank may not have the highest rate in town, but consumers say that it has the best benefits.'' **********In addition to these programs, there are others through which financial institutions sell insurance to holders of their I.R.A.'s. But although the price of such insurance may be lower than the individual would pay elsewhere, this type of I.R.A. completion insurance has not been as popular among consumers as the kind provided free. **********Most of the free programs, moreover, are created by insurance companies, insurance brokers or service organizations that originate the plans and sell them to participating banks and thrift institutions. If the cost of the insurance is paid by the institution, however, it is limited by Internal Revenue Service regulations covering the value of giveaways in connection with retirement accounts. **********These rules - which apply to other items that may be offered in connection with I.R.A.'s, such as cameras or toasters - set dollar limits to the value of such premiums. The maximum value permitted is $10 for deposits up to $5,000 and $20 for deposits over $5,000. **********The impetus for the I.R.A. completion insurance programs came in 1982, when I.R.A.'s were opened to all working people with earned income of at least $2,000 a year. Since then they have grown, faster in some areas than others, as more and more banks recognize the need to retain I.R.A. customers who might otherwise move accounts elsewhere in search of higher rates or other considerations. **********For example, the Citizens Community and Savings Bank in Flint, Mich., offers free $25,000 common-carrier coverage and accidental death protection equal to the account balance, with a maximum of $25,000. This insurance is available to I.R.A. customers with a minimum balance of $500. **********''It helps us to differentiate our product offerings from other institutions,'' said Alex Bese, assistant cashier. ''We're the only institution in our local market area that has something like this.'' **********Another version of I.R.A. completion insurance is offered by the Franklin Savings Association of Ottawa, Kan., in such a way that it is not covered by the Federal premium limitations. I.R.A. customers who are under age 59 1/2 can purchase a combination disability and life insurance policy for the amount of their deposit up to $2,000 or $2,250 at an annual cost of $30. But when they pay for the insurance, their accounts are credited with bonus interest of the same $30. **********''Roughly 50 percent of the eligible customers have taken advantage of it,'' said Edward Barnes, vice president for marketing. ''Some people say, 'It sounds too good to be true, what's the gimmick?' '' **********Some of the completion insurance programs have as features other advantages besides the insurance, also presented free to the customer as an extra incentive to obtain and retain accounts. These benefits include a discount telephone shopping service, a discount on hotel rooms, emergency cash services and financial newsletters. **********Among the reasons cited for the development of I.R.A. completion insurance is that there are enough financial institutions that would rather compete in the marketplace by offering that feature than by changing their interest rates to match the highest ones advertised locally. **********For the public, whenever this insurance is tied to a rate that is close to the best in the area, it is well worth considering when selecting a location for I.R.A. funds."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/03/business/sherpa.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1984-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2568, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Question", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SHERPA", "print_headline": "SHERPA", "body_text": " **********The word conjures up images of a rugged, agile Tibetan guide leading adventuresome British climbers up the face of Mount Everest.

Half of the meeting time in London will involve only the seven leaders - no finance ministers, no foreign ministers, no sherpas attending. It will perhaps be in those times that the bluntest expressions of concern over United States eco nomic policy will be voiced and where the sherpa's preparations could be most severely tested. **********What follows are answers to questions asked Mr. Wallis during a recent visit to New York.  Q. What does the Administration  hope to accomplish in London? **********A. It will have two broad goals. One will be to emphasize that the recovery is here and that the problem now is to strengthen the recovery, make sure that it lasts, make sure that it is non- inflationary and make sure that it spreads to the rest of the world as rapidly as possible. **********The other big goal will be to strengthen the world trading system and finance system by keeping markets open and opening some that never have been open, such as in the developing countries and in Japan.  Q. What objections will the other  countries raise to American eco nomic policy? **********A. I don't think there will be really basic disagreements on major issues. I think there will be differences about how to achieve various goals. For example, the United States is convinced that it is important to get a firm decision as soon as possible from the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) on launching the work for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. Q. Which would do what? **********A. Well, it would have to deal with a lot of issues that the preceding rounds have not dealt with. The other ones were confined largely to tariffs on manufactured products. Now, we need to consider such physical restraints as quotas, which have come to replace tariffs in recent years. We need to limit them in some way. We also need to open up more markets for agricultural products and services. **********The modern economies are becoming more and more service-oriented and there is no provision in the GATT for maintaining open markets for services - things like banking, insurance, management consulting, engineering services and so on. **********And then they need to deal with Government subsidies, such as the European subsidies for agricultural exports, which have become more important in international trade than tariffs used to be. **********It is going to take a lot of work even to start a round. That is, you cannot start a round like that until you get pretty good agreement on what the problems are and what the range of possible solutions is that people might agree to.  Q. How far away from a new round  of international trade talks do you  think you are? **********A. We would hope that the GATT would decide by the end of '85 to launch the work for a new round. But even if they do it, I doubt that they can start the negotiations before '87.  Q. So what can the summit hope to  accomplish? **********A. We would like to get the heads of state to urge the GATT to make a decision by the end of '85 on going ahead with a new multilateral trade negotiations.  Q. Do you think you will have a  problem getting them to agree to  that? **********A. Well, some countries want to and some don't. Q. Who would be against it? **********A. That is fairly public information. In the European Economic Community, France and Italy are resistant. The Japanese first floated the idea. We welcomed it. The Germans do. The British do.  Q. Why would the French oppose a  new GATT round? **********A. Well, France has always been quite a protectionist country, although they deny it. And I think they have the feeling that they have lagged in modern high-technology products, behind the Japanese and the United States - and I guess they have. So they probably feel they would be at a competitive disadvantage if we started major talks on breaking down trade restraints. **********The French have not said, ''No, we'll never do that.'' If they had, we would not be considering it seriously. They'll consider it. But they'll have some arguments against it, which will show just how slow you have to go in starting a new trade round.  Q. Are you expecting strong objec tions from the other countries as to  the size of the United States Federal  budget deficit? **********A. Not a lot, because that is the pot calling the kettle black. The other countries are going to be sensitive to the fact that their deficits as percentages of their gross national products are on the whole as large as ours. I think they will be a bit concerned. They will be saying that the deficit has pushed interest rates and the dollar up. As you know, Marty Feldstein thinks that is a factor. But I don't think deficits cause rates to rise and other economists around in Washington don't seem to share that view either.  Q. You're talking about the Admin istration's economists, aren't you? **********A. Yes, but it does not matter. High interest rates are without a doubt a problem because they increase the problem of debt service for the less- developed countries. But they are not caused by the deficit. I think a large factor in the rise of interest rates is the boom in economic activity - the demand for resources to invest is pushing rates up. **********At the same time, however, the boom in economic activity is expanding the market for exports of the industrial nations and the less-developed countries, and that is very much to their advantage. We have made some preliminary calculations that show in the case of one L.D.C. that a 1 percent increase in its exports sparked by economic expansion will probably more than offset the effects of a 1 percent rise in interest rates.   Q. But does that justify high inter est rates? **********A. Of course they would be better off if they could have the increase in exports and a decrease in interest rates. All I am saying is that before you say the increase in interest rates is going to throw them into a tailspin, you want to look at what is associated with it. The rise in interest rates is a consequence of the big increase in economic activity, which in turn increases their export markets, which in turn makes it easier for them to service their debt problem.  Q. What will Mr. Reagan say if the  other nations want to talk seriously  about lowering interest rates? Will he  say there is nothing the United States  can do but just let the market oper ate? **********A. I don't know what he will say. I would say for myself that I would like to know what the other countries have in mind. If they think having the Fed increase the quantity of money would lower interest rates, I think they have got it backwards. Nowadays, the interest rate market is supersensitive to the prospects for inflaton. Even though inflation is under control, the markets just don't believe it is going to stay under control. **********So the markets are going to be very sensitive to anything that suggests there is going to be an increase in inflation. Once they see the money supply growing fast, they immediately get jumpy and that tends to raise interest rates.  Q. Will the United States be pressed  to intervene more frequently on cur rency markets? **********A. No. The most the other countries do now is say that in disorderly markets we should maybe intervene to smooth them out. And once in awhile we do that in a small way. But nobody knows whether when something starts in the currency markets it is a temporary turbulence or a permanent change setting in. And the market knows that better than the Government will ever know it - and the market knows it faster.  Q. In light of the collapse of the Con tinental Illinois Bank, do you think  the other leaders will voice concern  about the international banking sys tem? **********A. Oh, I don't think that will come into the discussion at all. The bank's problems did not arise out of international debt. Q. But could not the lack of confi dence that plagued Continental arise  from a similar confidence problem in  banks holding large amounts of third  world debt? **********A. If someone thinks that, then the lesson is that the Continental problem did not disrupt the domestic financial system. The lesson would be that we seem to have devices that can move in and take up a problem like that. **********I am not saying that nobody is apprehensive about the banking system. There are major problems in some of these debtor countries. But it looks as if the system is working. We think that if people stick to the policies, it will work out. But any idea that people are relaxed or complacent or saying that problem is solved is completely wrong.  Q. What is the role of a sherpa in an  economic summit? **********A. It is really to prepare for the summit. When the President goes, he would like to know which subjects are going to be discussed. And beyond that, he would like to have some input beforehand into deciding what subjects are going to be discussed. And also, he would like to know what are the attitudes of the other countries. Some of the same questions you are asking me. He wants to know that before he gets there, so that he is prepared to carry on an intelligent discussion, and not say, ''Gee, I never heard that before. I'll have to go off and think about it.'' **********So basically the work of the sherpas is to find out. You meet with your head of Government and tell him what the others have said, and he reacts to that and at the next sherpas' meeting you react to what is going on according to the reaction you got at home. **********So it is basically an elaborate effort to make sure that the time at the summit is most efficiently used, and to know where the areas of disagreement will be.  Q. Is there no pre-agreed  communique this year? **********A. No. There was no pre-agreed communique at Williamsburg and there will not be one this year either.  Q. Why did the President dispense  with that last year? **********A. Usually, as I understand it, the seven countries began to meet about four months before the summit and they wrote the final communique. The President told me that when he went to his first summit in Ottawa, he was flabbergasted. The first thing they did was pull out the communique and start to go through it word by word. Is this the right word? Is this the idea? And is that the right punctuation? The communique just dominated the whole meeting, so they did not get this free-for-all, give-and-take that they wanted. Q. How closely do you work with the  President? **********A. The closer you get to the summit the more time you spend with him. Last year we did have a couple weeks when we were meeting several times during the week. Q. And who participates in those  meetings?  A. Well, the other members of the sherpa team - Beryl Sprinkel (Under Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Affairs), and Douglas McMinn, who is a senior staff member and trade specialist at the National Security Council. Then there is a White House summit team of which the co-heads are Michael Deaver, the Deputy Chief of Staff, and Robert McFarlane, head of the N.S.C. Q. George Shultz? Donald Regan? **********A. Almost always Shultz and Regan, because the Secretary of State and Treasury Secretary always go to the summit. But sometimes other Cabinet members on issues that may come up there. Just basically whoever has something to contribute that will help enlighten the President on all the issues he may run into. There are a hundred things that could be sprung on him there.  Q. Do you think the other countries  could rightly accuse the Reagan Ad ministration of stepping up protec tionism over the last year? **********A. Not really. Again, it would be the pot calling the kettle black. We are about the least protectionist country that there is, unless you think of Hong Kong. In the last year, they have all taken additional protectionist measures, especially the Common Market. They will not bring that up just because they will be too vulnerable themselves. **********Q. It seems that this is not going to  be an eventful summit. **********A. In a way, summits should never be big treaty-signing dramas. It is not what they do there that counts, it is what you do after the summit that means something. Moreover, there is a sense in which they do not ever talk about the really important economic issues. Should you really have free trade? Should countries be buying and selling internationally, and so on? Because what they discuss are points of friction that arise when you do have a lot of trade."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/01/business/boston-stock-exchange-tie.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 89, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Boston Stock Exchange Tie", "print_headline": "Boston Stock Exchange Tie", "body_text": " **********The Boston Stock Exchange said today that it had agreed to link its trading floor electronically with the Montreal Exchange. **********The agreement is intended to make the two small exchanges more competitive with their larger rivals, said Charles Mohr, chairman and chief executive of the Boston Stock Exchange.

Memos leaked this week suggested that Mrs. Thatcher and the Government were far more involved than previously acknowledged in the handling of the strike by the state-owned National Coal Board. **********The memos showed the Government to have ordered British Rail to increase its pay offer to railway workers to keep them from joining the miners in a strike that could have paralyzed the nation. This contradicted Mrs. Thatcher's repeated assertions that negotiations by state-owned enterprises were left to professional managers.   10 Downing Street Spruced Up **********During the Commons debate this evening, Mrs. Thatcher played host for the heads of state at 10 Downing Street - dressed up this week with the addition of several new paintings and a Henry Moore statue - instead of facing tough questioning from political opponents. **********In addition to taking the spotlight away from the miners, politicians suspect that the summit meeting may pay political dividends for Britain's Conservatives by allowing Mrs. Thatcher to play the role of a world leader and eminent European in the days before next week's European Parliament elections. **********Although the European campaign has left most British voters bored, the results will be closely analyzed for signs that the Labor Party has rebounded under the leadership of Neil Kinnock from last June's crushing election defeat, which left Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives with a 144-seat overall majority, the largest since Clement R. Attlee's 147-seat margin in 1946. Recent polls show Labor trailing the Conservatives by only one or two percentage points. The European election is also viewed as a crucial test of the Social Democratic Party/Liberal Party Alliance. **********'She Certainly Is Fortunate' **********''It's frustrating,'' said Simon Hughes, a Liberal Party Member of Parliament, in reference to the coverage Mrs. Thatcher's week is garnering. ''She certainly is fortunate.'' **********The summit conference does hold risks for Mrs. Thatcher, too. She will be anxious to observe the unspoken rule of summit meetings - never embarrass a candidate - but she can ill afford any appearance of subservience to President Reagan. **********President Reagan's decision to invade Grenada, a Commonwealth member, despite British opposition, dented Mrs. Thatcher's reputation here. **********Mrs. Thatcher's critics are also attacking her efforts to play down the importance of any action at the summit talks. **********''It would be better if the summit had been held at Madame Tussaud's,'' said Denis Healey, the Labor Party's spokesman on foreign affairs, referring to London's famous wax figure museum. ''It is clear that the heads of government there will be waxworks. They will not make an attempt to act on any problem.'' **********A number of groups are hoping to turn the deliberately deflated expectations for policy actions at the talks into a political liability for Mrs. Thatcher. They are staging competing events to draw attention to their own policies.   Other 'Summit' Conferences **********A group of Labor Party members will be meeting with Socialists from other countries and with economists who argue for coordinated increases in government spending and transfers of wealth as the best policy for summit nations at one ''countersummit.'' **********Separately, a ''green'' philosophy is being presented to 120 participants at the ''Other Summit,'' where Britain's Ecology Party and other groups are arguing that the leaders at the summit meeting and the Socialists have mistakenly focused solely on growth as a solution to economic problems. **********In addition, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament is planning large demonstrations here Saturday to protest cruise missiles. **********Mrs. Thatcher has planned her summit talks so that the visitors are unlikely to encounter such events. The summit meetings and meals will be held in a handful of tradition-rich sites well screened from the public by a huge police operation. **********''The key words from the Prime Minister's point of view are 'informal' and 'workmanlike,' '' said Ian Kydd, a press spokesman.

Andropov as leader of the Soviet Union will face a host of problems that he might be called upon to address immediately. **********Around the Soviet Union's far-flung borders, the policies of the last two decades have saddled the Kremlin with costly and unproductive dependencies, with a vexing war in Afghanistan, frustrated ambitions in the Middle East and, most seriously, with a stalemate in disarmament talks and the worst relations with the United States in at least two decades. **********This weekend, in well-appointed parlors and suites around Moscow, powerful men are probably gathered in clusters, their thoughts and schemes focused on the vacancy in one of the world's most powerful offices. **********The complex maneuvering may never come to light, since all that the world is likely to see sometime soon is a ''unanimous'' decision by the Central Committee of the Communist Party on a successor to Yuri V. Andropov. **********And sometime next week, one of the late leader's comrades from the Politburo will have to stand alone on the figurative ramparts of the Kremlin and survey what he had fought so arduously to take charge of. **********Vice President Bush, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chancellor Helmut Kohl have all announced plans to come to Moscow for Mr. Andropov's funeral, and all will be looking for signals from the new chief on the future of East-West relations. **********On the domestic front, the new leader will inherit a system choked by inefficiency, lack of motivation and corruption, despite the campaigns his predecessor launched against these evils. **********With a military machine crying for resources to meet what it sees as the threat of American rearmament under President Reagan, the new chief will be pressured to accelerate the economic experiments and tinkering that Mr. Andropov set in motion before illness sent him to the sidelines. **********The new man will take charge of an agricultural system unable to supply the nation's needs, a high-technology industry decades behind that of the West and falling ever farther behind, and a sluggish, bloated bureaucracy. **********These challenges are essentially the same ones Mr. Andropov faced in his 15-month tenure. But in contrast to the current contenders for the job, the late chief came to office armed with the prestige and power of a man who had spent 15 years at the head of the K.G.B. security police, and who had the backing of the military and majority support in the Politburo.   A Few Advantages **********The advantages a new leader will face are those offered by a totalitarian system. Once in office, he is unlikely to face serious challenges to his job, and in the highly centralized system political powers will naturally gravitate toward him, especially as the old power brokers like Dmitri F. Ustinov, Nikolai A. Tikhonov or Andrei A. Gromyko pass away. **********For all the occasional talk in the West of a crisis in Soviet morale because of the lack of consumer goods or food, the reality is that Russians seem capable of tightening their belts to a degree few in the West could tolerate, and there have been no tangible signs - beyond widespread grumbling - of serious dissatisfaction. **********The dissident movement, once reasonably organized and widely publicized, has been effectively decimated. The most immediate challenge to any new leader will be to find ways out of the freeze in East-West relations and the deadlock in arms talks. **********In the bitter dispute over the new American missiles in Europe, the Kremlin had staked its strategy on dissuading the Europeans from accepting the rockets. The policy failed last November, and the Russians walked out of the talks on medium-range missiles and refused to set a date for resumption of the talks on strategic arms.   Another Daunting Problem **********Since then, the Soviet position has been that negotiations can resume only if the Americans return to the situation that existed before the beginning of the deployment of medium-range missiles. Washington is hardly likely to do this, especially if President Reagan is re-elected. And the harsh words slung between Washington and Moscow in the past months will make reconciliation difficult even for a new leader. **********Most diplomats here believe that the Soviet military, in the person of Marshal Ustinov, and the Foreign Ministry, in the person of Mr. Gromyko, are unlikely to let a new chief make overtures to Washington after the slights they feel they have suffered in the negotiations and at Mr. Reagan's hands. Most diplomats, however, believe the prospects of huge new investments in a continued arms race must persuade the Russians to find a way back to the negotiating table, if necessary with Mr. Reagan. **********A more promising arena for Soviet foreign policy is the Middle East. Against a background of recent military successes by leftist Moslem militias in Beirut, the United States has decided to move its marines out of the city to ships offshore. Those militias' successes have given new leverage to their Syrian backers.  After years of supplying Syria with costly weapons, the Kremlin can hope at last to get some returns in the the Middle East. **********On other fronts, Mr. Reagan's demonstrated willingness to use force has made Soviet foraging for gains in Central and Latin America far more risky. In Africa and Asia, those allies gained at such expense in the 1970's - Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Cambodia - remain in serious economic trouble. **********With Poland now seeming to be effectively back in harness, Moscow seems to have bought temporary peace in Eastern Europe. But pressures for greater economic independence, and dissatisfaction with East-West tension, demand permanent vigilance in Moscow.  In Afghanistan, a police operation to salvage a Communist regime has developed into a nagging, drawn-out tangle with armed mountain men. **********More generally, Soviet leaders face the fact that infatuation with Soviet- style ideology waned long ago outside the country's borders. In international forums, where for a while Moscow could count on automatic support from third-world allies, the Soviet Union has found itself under attack on issues such as Afghanistan or the downing of the South Korean jetliner. **********No prospective party secretary will be able to sharply reverse foreign policies in force today, especially with the extensive authority Mr. Gromyko has forged over all foreign affairs. But it is on the domestic front that the next leader will ultimately be judged. **********In the 15 months Mr. Andropov was in office, labor productivity nudged upward and agriculture production registered a slight improvement. Mr. Andropov also experimented in less centralized management techniques, began a shakeup of party cadres, ordered a crackdown on inefficiency in the workplace and took stern measures against corruption. **********It was an impressive effort by Soviet standards, but Western diplomats believe that even were they followed through with vigor, the measures would have fallen short of solving Russia's economic woes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/06/business/long-term-bond-yields-up.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1984-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 672, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Long-Term Bond Yields Up", "print_headline": "Long-Term Bond Yields Up", "body_text": " **********Interest rates were mixed yesterday, with yields for most long-term bonds rising modestly while rates for three- and six-month Treasury bills fell by an eighth of a percentage point or more. **********Analysts said the rise in yields of some recent Treasury bonds, which accompanied price declines of about half a point, reflected a decline in speculative buying by securities firms and other traders that had helped buoy prices by more than five points over the previous three trading sessions. **********Investor demand for notes and bonds was modest, but was great enough to lift note and bond prices above their lowest levels of the day.

You just watch and see.'' **********The White House and State Department officials said that part of the confusion stemmed from the fact that President Reagan and Vice President Bush were on the campaign trail and it was difficult to coordinate with the State Department. Part of the problem was that Mr. Bush had not seen Mr. Shultz's speech ahead of time. **********''At the end of the day,'' a State Department official said, ''there was no distance between George Shultz and Ronald Reagan on terrorism.'' **********Mr. Shultz's aides said he felt that the United States, despite its frequent warnings, had not been willing to take decisive actions that would deter or punish terrorists. **********He has argued, officials said, that the United States should be willing, as Israel is, to respond, as he said on Thursday, ''on a moment's notice,'' and to strike even though ''we may never have the kind of evidence that can stand up in an American court of law.'' **********''We cannot allow ourselves to become the Hamlet of nations, worrying endlessly over whether and how to respond,'' Mr. Shultz said. **********Aides said he was particularly critical of the caution shown by Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger and by the covert side of the Central Intelligence Agency in stressing the dangers of retaliation to American foreign and domestic policy.  Mr. Shultz's differences with Mr. Weinberger go back to the dispute over the marines in Lebanon, with Mr. Shultz opposing a withdrawal and Mr. Weinberger arguing they should not be there. Pentagon Aide Concedes Caution **********An official close to Mr. Weinberger said today: **********''It is true that the Pentagon is more aware of the downside of military operations and therefore is cautious about undertaking operations where the results are as unpredictable as in pre-emptive strikes against terrorists.'' **********Another official said Friday, ''One has to proceed with caution and with a lot of thought about unintended consequences from the use of force.'' **********According to White House and State Department officials, Mr. Shultz is supported by Robert C. McFarlane, the White House national security adviser, who, like Mr. Shultz, is a former Marine Corps officer. The officials also said Mr. Reagan, depite some comments to the contrary, basically agreed with the Shultz call for a firmer approach. **********''Look, George Shultz is a cautious man,'' an aide said today. ''Can you imagine him making that speech on Thursday if he did not believe that he also spoke for the President?''   McFarlane Supported Shultz **********Mr. McFarlane read the speech before it was given and supported it, a White House official said. The speech was also circulated to the Pentagon, but elicited no official comment. **********Mr. Shultz said in his speech that the public should understand beforehand that there was ''potential for loss of life of some of our fighting men and the loss of life of some innocent people'' when force was used against terrorists. **********Mr. Reagan, in his most recent remarks on terrorism, on Sunday in the debate with Mr. Mondale, was more cautious. **********''We want to retaliate,'' he said, ''but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians.'' **********Vice President Bush while campaigning in Ohio on Friday, was asked about taking the risk to hurt civilians. **********''I don't agree with that,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I think you have got to pinpoint the source of that attack. We are not going to go out and bomb innocent civilians or something of that nature. I don't think we ever get to the point where you kill 100 innocent women and children just to kill one terrorist. I don't think we have reached that point.'' Reagan Tried to Resolve Conflict **********Mr. Reagan, when asked about the apparent conflict, tried to resolve it by saying of Mr. Shultz's speech, ''I don't think it was a statement of policy.'' **********''He was saying all these things must be considered,'' he said. ''I think what Secretary Shultz was saying was that you couldn't rule out the possibility of innocent people being killed. He was not saying that we would do that.'' **********Mr. Reagan created the impression that he was not supporting the speech. This led Larry Speakes, his spokesman, to say, ''Shultz's speech was Administration policy from top to bottom.'' **********Today officials close to Mr. Bush were saying that he was caught off guard since he had not been sent a copy of the speech. They said Mr. Bush was trying to reflect Mr. Reagan's comment in Sunday's debate that the lives of civilians should not be risked. Comment Offered by Mondale **********Some State Department officials also said that Mr. Bush's position, in general, was closer to Mr. Weinberger's. **********Today Mr. Mondale told reporters in San Francisco; **********''This past day we have the U.S. Government all over the map - the Secretary saying we will attack terrorists even if innocents are killed; then the Vice Presideny saying, 'Oh, no, only if they can be attacked without touching innocents;' then the President backing up and taking a different position, underscoring the fact that there is no one in charge.'' **********''All that theoretical talk yesterday, and the inconsistency,'' Mr. Mondale said, ''only emboldens terrorists to think this Government does not know **********what it is doing.''  Bush Hails Shultz's Leadership **********Today, Mr. Bush, speaking to the Zionist Organization of America in Washington, hailed Secretary Shultz for his ''able leadership'' in efforts to fight international terrorism. But the Vice President made no mention of the retaliation issue. **********''Under the able leadership of Secretary Shultz, the State Department is focusing as never before on international terrorism and what can be done about it,'' Mr. Bush said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/09/business/business-people-chairman-s-title-added-by-gri-s-president.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1984-07-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 271, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": " Chairman's Title Added By G.R.I.'s President", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;  Chairman's Title Added By G.R.I.'s President", "body_text": " **********David R.

Indeed, while high interest rates have been a bane to home buyers and other borrowers, as well as to economists concerned about the strong dollar, they have been a boon to individual investors. In the past few years, small investors, who normally have bypassed the bond markets, have decided the yields are too good to pass up. **********Nowhere is this more evident than in tax-exempt municipal bonds. Once the domain of institutional investors, such as banks and insurance companies, that market is now inundated with small investors, who buy about three-fourths of all new tax-exempt bonds. The appeal of tax-exempt bonds, which are issued by states, local governments and local government authorities, is that the interest paid on them is free from Federal income tax. **********''Why invest in a money market fund earning 11 percent, when you have to give back half of it in taxes?'' asked Howard Brody, a New York City insurance broker. ''I'm better off buying New York Power Authority paying 10 percent.'' **********''It's not the amount of your income that counts,'' added Robert Lamb, a New York University professor and specialist in the tax-exempt bond market. ''It's the income you get to keep after you have paid all the taxes on that income.'' **********Next to tax-exempts, small investors prefer United States Treasury securities, which have a special position in the bond market, because it is assumed that the United States would never default on an interest or principal payment. State and local governments also have a good safety record, and defaults have been rare since the Depression. **********Under the current progressive income tax, most individuals or families earning more than $30,000 a year find that the interest earned on tax-exempt bonds compares favorably with the after-tax interest paid on Treasury securities. **********Small investors are not the only ones who are impressed with the bond markets. Pension fund trustees at such major companies as Bethlehem Steel Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation earlier this year bought a combination of securities that locked in high yields, enabling them to reduce the size of future pension plan contributions. **********Of course, bonds, despite their reputation for safety, are not riskless. Fluctuating interest rates in recent years have played havoc with bond prices. While investors cannot avoid the risk that interest rates might rise higher than when the bonds were bought, they can hedge against it by buying shorter-term securities. As a rule of thumb, the shorter the maturity of a debt security, the less volatile will be the price fluctuations in the secondary market. **********Many investors, however, being content simply to get the income from their bond holdings, ignore fluctuating interest rates and the consequent change in the value of the bonds. This buy-and-hold strategy works well when interest rates are stable or falling. But when interest rates are rising, many financial advisers recommend some turnover in an individual's bond portfolio. By selling bonds at a loss, the investor reduces his total income, which cuts the size of his tax bill, and, in effect, lets Uncle Sam absorb part of the loss. When money from the sale of the old bonds is reinvested in new bonds, the investor can adjust the risk of the new portfolio according to maturity and quality, and the higher interest rates available on new issues can recoup the loss from the sale of the old bonds within a few years. **********To reduce the investor's risk, traditional bond offerings are now supplemented by special features - ''bells and whistles'' in the jargon of those in the securities business. The emergence of special features, such as put options (a device allowing the investor to redeem the bond at 100 percent of face value at specified dates) and floating interest, is a sign that a deep-seated fear still persists among investors that today's seemingly high bond yields might not protect against another round of high inflation. Rising inflation during the 1960's and 1970's turned the low interest rate bonds of that era into a bad investment, and investors are ever conscious that today's double-digit yields might not look so good if inflation reappears. **********And, investors seem to be stubbornly clinging to the belief that the economy's rapid growth eventually will mean renewed inflation. ''Deep down inside, many investors are not willing to put their money on continued growth'' of the economy, said Thomas Johnson, president of the Chemical Bank. As a result, many individual investors prefer shorter-term bonds, even though they must accept a lower yield. In recent months, the investor in one-year tax-exempt bonds has accepted a yield that was three percentage points less than was available on 20- and 30-year issues. **********Bonds of states, cities and counties are often the safest, lowest yielding of tax-exempt issues because they have the backing of a government. ''There is nothing to match the appeal of tax-exempt bonds for individuals,'' said Richard Franke, president of John Nuveen & Company, the leading sponsor of unit investment trusts - pools of bonds that are sold to the public through a number of securities firms. **********A wide variety of revenue bonds also have a good safety record, but are vulnerable to the risk that hospitals, electric power systems, or toll-roads may not generate as much revenue as expected and could default. The Washington Public Power Supply System, for example, has missed two interest payments on $2.25 billion of bonds it issued to build two nuclear power plants, which have since been abandoned. Bondholders are now embroiled in lawsuits to recover their money . **********The widely publicized default has been a boost to a handful of companies that insure the interest and principal payments of tax-exempt bonds. Of the $85 billion of new bonds sold in 1983, about 14 percent were insured, up from 2 percent five years ago. Insured bonds sell with lower yields than most other issues in the market, except for the highest quality issues. Still, insured yields of 10 percent are widely available. The most active and best known insurers are the Municipal Bond Insurance Association, the Ambac Indemnity Corporation and the Financial Guaranty Insurance Corporation. **********One new bond in seven is insured.  Yields, though lower, can exceed 10 percent and such issues are widely available.  While all tax-exempt bonds are exempt from Federal income tax, some local issues are also exempt from state and city income taxes. California bonds are exempt from the California income tax, for example, but are taxable to residents of New York. **********Because of the difficulty in selecting tax-exempt bonds - there are more than 40,000 issuers - many investors prefer to buy an interest in a pool of bonds and reap the benefits of a professionally selected, diverse group of securities, bought at wholesale prices available only to large buyers. Of course, the investor pays a fee for the professional help and service, but the cost of a fully disclosed fee ought to be weighed against the higher prices small investors must pay when buying odd lots of bonds, or amounts of less than $50,000. **********Unit investment trusts are the most common way of investing in a pool of tax- exempt bonds. An interest can be bought for as little as $1,000, which entitles the investor to his proportional share of interest paid on an underlying pool of bonds. The investor also shares proportionally in increases and decreases in the value of the bonds should the bonds be sold by the trust (which is not common but is allowable under certain conditions) or should the investor sell his units before maturity. Once a trust is created, the trust sponsor does not adjust the portfolio, except occasionally to sell bonds that are considered a bad risk. **********Funds and trusts prove popular.  Acquiring shares in a mutual fund invested in tax-exempt bonds is another way of buying into a professionally managed fund with a small initial investment. Rather than paying a sales commission (about four percent is not uncommon for long-term unit investment trusts), the investor in a mutual fund pays an annual management fee of about seven-tenths of a percent. In return for the management fee, the fund manager is supposed to be active in trading the portfolio of bonds, so that the fund minimizes losses when interest rates rise and maximizes gains when rates fall."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/25/business/sohio-s-outlook.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sohio's Outlook", "print_headline": "Sohio's Outlook", "body_text": " **********The Standard Oil Company (Ohio) believes ''it will be difficult for the last half of 1984 to match the first half unless petroleum products and metal prices improve more quickly than we expect,'' it said in its second-quarter report to shareholders.

''There was a problem between Irv and Jack,'' the source said. ''It was a problem over a long period of time and it finally came to a head.'' **********The dispute may have involved Mr. Tramiel's management style. Insiders say Mr. Tramiel ran the company like a one-man show, making it difficult for the company to recruit and retain executives. **********The unexpected resignation came as Commodore was achieving its best performance ever: The company emerged from the price wars in the home computer sector last year as the clear leader in market share and profits as its competitors were hit by huge losses. **********Commodore's revenues for 1983 surpassed $1 billion and its net income will exceed $100 million, the company estimates.

Greenberg, a spokesman for Commodore, said Mr. Tramiel was not forced to resign. ''This is definitely Jack's decision based upon clear reasoning,'' he said. **********Commodore said Mr. Tramiel would remain a consultant to the company. **********It also said the board had has chosen a replacement for Mr. Tramiel, to be announced in a few days. Mr. Greenberg said the replacement was formerly president of a manufacturing company with more than $1 billion in annual revenues that is not in the computer business. **********It is unclear what effect Mr. Tramiel's resignation will have on Commodore, but it is bound to be dramatic. Mr. Tramiel founded Commodore in 1955 and has built the company as the lowest-cost producer of home computers - and one that can change directions in an instant. **********Commodore officials certainly gave little hint that trouble was brewing at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this week, where a beaming Mr. Tramiel and other executives introduced a new line of home computers. Sig Hartmann, head of Commodore's software division, said Commodore executives had a surprise dinner for Mr. Tramiel at which Mr. Gould made a speech.

In the 1950's, he started a typewriter manufacturing business in Canada. **********In the mid-1960's, a scandal arose involving the Atlantic Acceptance Corporation, a Canadian finance company with close ties to Mr. Tramiel and Commodore. He was not indicted, however, and kept his business going with money from Mr. Gould, a Canadian financier who has been chairman ever since. **********In the mid-1970's, Commodore was almost driven out of business when Texas Instruments, a supplier of computer chips to calculator makers like Commodore, went into the calculator business and slashed prices. **********Mr. Tramiel vowed that Commodore would make its own chips to cut costs. That vertical integration and attention to cost-cutting helped Commodore survive the price wars which, ironically, forced Texas Instruments out of the home computer business. **********Under Mr. Tramiel, Commodore introduced products if there was a market for them, even if the new product cut sales of an existing product.

By day, the shoppers hold sway, streaming in and out of the department stores and jewelry shops in a finely groomed parade. **********But beneath its shiny surface, the Ginza has reason to worry about holding on to its reputation as Japan's leading - not to mention best-known - entertainment and shopping district. Other centers of this sprawling city glow brighter, move faster and echo with younger voices. By comparison, the venerable Ginza is like a cashmere coat with frayed sleeves, attractive but perhaps best not examined too closely. **********Now the Japanese Government thinks it may be time for a facelift. **********It is talking about a development program for the district, an ambitious project involving underground shopping arcades, new condominiums, a monorail service and improvements in what city planners like to call the infrastructure. The hope is to attract a younger crowd, to shift slightly from the Ginza's image as a showcase of middle-aged self-indulgence. Any development cost will be high, perhaps $1.7 billion, and no one is sure who will pay. If it fails, it will not be the first project of this sort proposed for the Ginza and then discarded.   Maintaining the Vitality **********But the discussions seem to be more serious this time, and with an official study of the possibilities scheduled to be completed in a few weeks, the store owners and restaurateurs of the Ginza are waiting eagerly. **********''It's something we'd like to have, but I don't think this is a must for maintaining the Ginza's vitality,'' said Yuji Ishimaru, secretary general of the Ginza Street Association, a business group. Others involved in business disagree; they think the district needs to change if it hopes to keep its competitive edge. **********None of this is to suggest that the Ginza is ready for a going-out-of-business sale. The area still encompasses 180 acres of some of the more remarkable stretches of urban real estate in the world - a place of style and contrasts, where one can plunk down $200,000 on a pearl necklace at Mikimoto and eat a passable stand-up meal at a noodle stall for about a dollar. **********The name means Silver Seat, a reference to the silver market that was centered there in feudal days. As recently as 30 years ago, willow trees lined the streets and murky canals veined the back paths.   A Monument of Commerce **********Now there is mainly concrete and granite, a monument of commerce dominated by offices, specialty shops and opulent department stores. Women still come in kimonos, and families like to stroll on weekends, when the main avenue is closed to traffic. **********But the Ginza is really the night. There is a word, mizushobai, that means water business. The word, however, suggests more life than its literal definition, speaking of a swifter pulse than the mere statistic that along the Ginza one can find 3,000 bars and restaurants. Many are no bigger than respectable closets, tucked enticingly into narrow alleyways or piggybacked inside drab buildings that no one would glance at twice during the day but that gleam bewitchingly at night. **********Women venture there, but it is essentially a world for men, expense-account executives who go out with associates or business contacts and forget the day or strike a deal. For a price that is merely outrageous, one can buy a drink with a whisper of alcohol and be indulged by hostesses whose craft is illusion - of hanging on every word, of enjoying the oldest joke, of admiring the foreign visitor for the skill in Japanese he has just demonstrated by ordering a ''biru.'' **********Increasingly, younger people seem less amused by such pastimes. They go out at night, too, but they take their entertainment in other quarters, possibly the frenetic Shinjuku section or stylized Roppongi or pell-mell Shibuya. Dining in a top-flight restaurant no longer means an obligatory trip to the Ginza. Much of the excitement has moved elsewhere.   Appeal to the Older **********It takes only a brisk walk around town to see that the Ginza appeals to older people. According to Mr. Ishimaru, surveys confirm that the average age of customers in Shinjuku is 18 to 25 while half the people who go to the Ginza are 25 to 45 years old. Much of the considerable amount of money spent by affluent youngsters is going to the old district's rivals. **********What bothers some merchants more than their lack of appeal to youth is the influx of fast-food chains in recent years. In spots the main boulevard, Ginza-dori, looks like a trendy stretch of New York's Columbus Avenue that has been pockmarked by touches of West 34th Street. Some stores hang out merchandise on the street, and traditionalists close their eyes when walking past Shakey's and Pizza Hut. **********A popular McDonald's on the street level of the Mitsukoshi department store has especially irritated some neighborhood store owners. There is no place to sit at the hamburger stand, so customers munch their Big Macs in the street. Older Ginza establishments are not thrilled by the sight, and they want McDonald's out. Mr. Ishimaru, for his part, said that although '' 'evict' is too strong a word,'' his association had ''advised Mitsukoshi to improve the present eating situation of McDonald's customers.'' **********To create an atmosphere that might appeal to a younger crowd, Ginza merchants are looking to underground arcades. There is not much affordable space on the street, where land goes for as much as $10,000 a square foot. In the plan under study, the subway lines that crisscross below ground would be lowered even farther, creating new space to be occupied by shops.   Sassiness vs. Mass Appeal **********Some store owners think this is a mistake. Let Roppongi lure the kids, they say. They are not troubled by the thought of letting the Ginza hold onto its faintly musty air and its discreet sassiness. **********Many visitors seem to agree. In a college survey of them taken last summer, 40 percent said they wanted the Ginza to remain a ''high class'' area, while only 10 percent preferred that it appeal to ''the masses.'' **********There are even those who would yank out blocks of concrete and plant willow trees again.  ''Widen the sidewalks,'' said the writer of a recent letter to The Mainichi Daily News. ''Close some streets to traffic and lay down pedestrian thoroughfares - complete with landscaping, stone lanterns and a footbridge or two. **********''Tone down the flash and neon.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/01/business/sykes-datatronics.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sykes Datatronics", "print_headline": "Sykes Datatronics", "body_text": " **********Sykes Datatronics Inc. said it had received notice from Chase Lincoln First Bank and Chemical Bank that they had withdrawn their commitments to make additonal advances under their respective loan agreements. **********Sykes develops, makes and markets information-processing and communications products.

THATCHER SHUNS A SIEGE", "body_text": " **********One of the oddest features of the siege at the Libyan Embassy in St. James's Square, which ended on Friday with the departure of 30 Libyan diplomats and others, was the distance Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher put between herself and the crisis. **********No major political or diplomatic event that has occurred in London since Mrs. Thatcher took office five years ago has had so little overt involvement from the Prime Minister - a surprising circumstance, as one Western diplomat commented, for someone ''usually so fond of standing up to people who she thinks are trying to push Britain around.'' **********For the first 72 hours after the fatal shooting of Constable Yvonne Fletcher, the Prime Minister was in Lisbon on an official visit, an important trip but not one whose cancellation would have caused vast problems. When she returned, she went to Chequers, her country estate, for the weekend. And when the decision to sever diplomatic relations with Tripoli was announced last Sunday, it was explained to the press not by Mrs. Thatcher but by Richard Luce, a junior minister at the Foreign Office. **********As negotiations dragged on last week, and even after the Libyans filed stony-faced out of the embassy, it was not Mrs. Thatcher who commented in the House of Commons and on television but Leon Brittan, the Home Secretary. When first the families of diplomats in Tripoli, then the diplomats themselves, returned safely to London, and when Miss Fletcher's funeral was held in Salisbury, Mrs. Thatcher was absent.   Saw Ice Skaters **********Her principal public engagement on Friday, the climactic day, was a farewell performance by Britain's world champion ice skaters, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean. **********The official explanation was that the Prime Minister had complete confidence in Mr. Brittan's judgment. But among many British politicians the conclusion was that Mrs. Thatcher could see from the start that the episode was likely to end in public frustration and anger and that she wanted as little blame as possible. **********''She hates this kind of fudge and compromise,'' a Conservative Member of Parliament said. ''She has no time for diplomatic niceties. She didn't want to look the way Jimmy Carter did over the hostages in Iran, so she wanted to stay out of it and get it over with quickly.'' **********If she was indeed engaged in trying to limit the political damage, she seems to have succeeded. Newspapers across the spectrum reacted unhappily to the episode this morning with The Daily Express calling it a ''humiliation for Britain'' and The Guardian descibing it as ''a bleak little tragedy.'' But there was no criticism - indeed, almost no mention at all - of the Prime Minister. **********Even though from the start it looked unlikely that anyone could ever be brought to trial for killing Miss Fletcher, Scotland Yard went to extraordinary lengths to find out who did it and to build as much of a case as was possible under the circumstances. **********Lest someone escape, even the sewers were sealed off. Long-range cameras, some of them with infrared film, were set up, along with television surveillance equipment. Bugging devices were attached to the walls of adjacent buildings and super- sensitive microphones were aimed at the besieged ''People's Bureau,'' as the Libyans call their embassy. Radio circuits linking the embassy with the Triploi were monitored, as were telephone lines. **********From all of these sources, plus interviews with people known to have close links to the Libyan Embassy, a ''fairly complete picture'' of activities in the building after the shooting was built up, a senior police official said. More information may have been gleaned from questioning the 30 occupants of the embassy at the Civil Service College in Sunningdale, Berkshire, Friday afternoon before they left for home. **********Even after the evacuation, Scotland Yard was looking for clues. Policemen crawled through the square on all fours on Friday afternoon and again this morning, looking for spent bullets or other forensic evidence, and the police broadcast an appeal for a man in his 40's known from television film to have walked through the square at the time of the shooting with a tightly furled umbrella clutched in his right hand. **********Without citing sources, some British newspapers suggested today that the police now know who fired the murder weapon. The Daily Mail said his identity was finally nailed down at Sunningdale and described him as a dark-haired man in his early 30's. The Daily Telegraph said there were still two names on the list of Libyans who are suspects. **********If anyone gave the British a lift during an unpleasant 11 days, it was Julia Miles, the 39-year-old wife of the British Ambassador in Tripoli. While her husband, Oliver, carried on negotiations with the Libyans and prepared to close down the embassy, Mrs. Miles gave a series of telephone interviews to newspapers and broadcasters here. **********A steady, matter-of-fact woman, given to saying things like ''we're rather up a gum tree,'' Mrs. Miles was generally photographed wearing a T-shirt and a denim skirt as she busied herself packing and looking after four children. **********She joked about the size of the dining table in the ambassadorial residence - ''a friend gave me a back- scratcher to push the salt pot across the table to my husband'' - and calmly described the difficulties the British were facing each day. **********''Julia Miles, coping,'' said Sir Robin Day admiringly at the end of one of his lunchtime talks with her on BBC radio last week. **********When she and other dependents were finally permitted to board a plane for the trip back to Britain on Thursday night, Mrs. Miles led the group in singing ''Rule Britannia.'' **********The building that was besieged by the police is one of the finest 18th century houses in London, formerly known as Wentworth House, with elaborately paneled reception rooms and ornate chandeliers. It was bought by the Libyans for more than $4 million in 1978 from the family of the Earls of Strafford. **********St. James's Square, at whose northeast corner the house stands, was laid out in the 17th century and is filled with historic buildings. At No. 31, George III was born, the Dukes of Norfolk lived for more than 200 years and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower presided over Allied headquarters in 1944. No. 4 was for three decades the home of Nancy Astor, then from 1943 to 1945 the headquarters of Charles de Gaulle and the Free French. No. 10, which now houses the Royal Institute of International Affairs, was the residence of no fewer than three Prime Ministers - William Pitt, Lord Derby and William Gladstone. **********Jermyn Street, where the police vans waited for the departing Libyans, is one of the most fashionable in London, leading past such shops as Fortnum and Mason; Turnbull and Asser, the haberdashers; Paxton and Whitfield, the cheese merchants, and Floris, the perfumier. Benjamin Franklin once lived there. **********''It's been a dreadful time,'' said Paul Bentley, owner of Astley's Pipe Shop. ''Some days we haven't been able to open at all.'' **********''We'll never recover our losses,'' said another businessman, George Racz.

Manuel Salvatierra, who oversees Sandinista operations in the area. ''We realize that this war is going to continue for a long time.'' **********Commander Salvatierra told reporters here Thursday that insurgent forces had been ''partly successful'' in setting up bases of operation deep inside Nicaragua. He said his troops had killed 913 rebel soldiers in 156 battles since the offensive began in March, but he declined to disclose the number of Sandinista casualties. **********Estimates 3,000 in Country **********The commander said he believed that 3,000 insurgents remained inside Nicaragua and that 3,500 more would soon begin infiltrating in from Honduras. He said new rebel troops were being trained at bases in Honduras to take part in a coming offensive. **********He did not reveal the source of his information, but both sides in the Nicaraguan conflict are believed to be infiltrated by enemy agents. **********''They are trying to influence the peasants and create a social base for themselves,'' Commander Salvatierra said. Because rebels are operating in isolated areas ''where we have no mass organizations,'' he said, they have managed to win some popular support. **********To confront these problems, deal with the expected offensive and resolve a host of difficulties that face this vital coffee-growing region, the Sandinista Government has sent one of its top leaders, Jaime Wheelock, the Minister of Agrarian Reform, to Matagalpa. Officials said he was now working here almost full time and had left his ministry in the hands of subordinates. **********In towns and villages in the north, residents said they had heard no reports of major fighting since the beginning of June. Many said earlier attacks had led them to believe some of their neighbors might be secretly collaborating with insurgents. **********Houses in some remote areas are papered with handbills urging rebels to desert and surrender.   Supply Routes Cited **********According to Sandinista officers and independent military analysts here and in Managua, the recent offensive was aimed at opening supply routes that would permit insurgent units to remain inside Nicaragua for extended periods. Commander Salvatierra said as many as 1,100 rebels appeared to be based in the eastern part of Matagalpa Province. **********In recent attacks on the northern towns of Ocotal, Waslala and San Rafael del Norte, rebels apparently operating in conjunction with local residents inflicted millions of dollars in damage on Government offices, food warehouses and vehicles. A spokesman for the Ministry of Construction estimated that the attack on Ocotal inflicted more than $1 million damage to installations controlled by his ministry. **********In several towns, according to local officials and residents, rebel attackers have gone directly to the homes of Sandinista organizers, accused them of repressive abuses and killed them. The most recent victim was said to have been the head of the Sandinista youth organization in Ocotal, which was hit by a rebel squad two weeks ago. **********Much of northern Nicaragua is virtually unpopulated and covered wih rugged mountains, which at this time of year are shrouded in thick fog. The Sandinistas themselves started their guerrilla war here, as did the man after whom their movement is named, Augusto Cesar Sandino, who fought Government troops and United States marines in the 1920's and 30's.   Ortegas Visit Area **********The Sandinista junta coordinator, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, and his brother, Defense Minister Humberto Ortega Saavedra, have visited this area in the last few days. They assured soldiers and civilians that the Government considered defense its top priority. **********The official Sandinista newspaper Barricada reported today that a high- level official delegation would make ''a working visit'' to the Soviet Union later this month. It will be headed by Daniel Ortega and will include Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto Brockman and Comdr. Henry Ruiz, who speaks Russian and attended Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow. **********Commander Salvatierra said Sandinista forces were using new Soviet-made heavy artillery pieces that have a range of over 10 miles and can simultaneously fire 40 projectiles, each containing 1,500 pounds of explosives. ''In a short time we can saturate an area,'' he said. **********Sandinista officers and rebel leaders have said the rebel force is growing in size. Officials have attributed this to forced recruitment of peasants in northern Nicaragua, but the insurgents say their new soldiers are mostly young people alienated by the regime.   'Massive Mobilization' Cited **********Defense Minister Ortega said Nicaragua was involved in ''massive and prominent mobilization'' for the war effort. He also said Sandinistas should work ''to neutralize rightists in our cities and towns, who are conspiring by launching campaigns of confusion.'' His statement coincided with what appears to be a new crackdown on suspected collaborators. **********At least four people were arrested by the security police in Matagalpa this week, according to human rights activists and religious workers. Their whereabouts is unknown and no charges are known to have been lodged against them, but associates said they assumed the four were suspected of anti-Sandinista activity. **********Today's issue of the pro-Sandinista newspaper Nuevo Diario reported one of the arrests and said the woman taken into custody, Edith Guerrero de Arias, had been proven to have ''ties to counterrevolutionary activities'' that endanger the security of the country. **********In the provincial capital of Chinandega, 50 miles west of here, the police this week reported finding crates of C-4 plastic explosives and several light antitank weapons in a home. The occupant was said to have been arrested.   U.S. Support Denounced **********The United States has provided anti- Sandinista forces with military advice and millions of dollars in war supplies. Commander Salvatierra characterized the rebels as ''a mercenary army which exists because the Reagan Administration maintains it.'' He said the United States was supporting rebels in the hope their successes would force the Sandinistas to the bargaining table, but he declared, ''We will never give in to pressure.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/14/world/dispute-over-marine-wounded-in-honduras.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Taubman", "pub_date": "1984-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 661, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DISPUTE OVER MARINE WOUNDED IN HONDURAS", "print_headline": "DISPUTE OVER MARINE WOUNDED IN HONDURAS", "body_text": " **********The Defense Department told Congress earlier this year that a United States marine was shot by accident in Honduras last November even though a Marine Corps investigation concluded that the victim was hit by hostile fire, according to Pentagon documents. **********In a report submitted to Congress in April, the Defense Department said the marine, who was shot while guarding a radar installation on Tiger Island in the Gulf of Fonseca, ''was wounded accidentally by either his own weapon, or that of a fellow sentry.'' **********The incident at Tiger Island, off the coast of Honduras not far from Nicaragua and El Salvador, took place on the night of Nov. 3, 1983, the first day a Marine unit was used for sentry duty on the island. **********On Nov. 9, six days after the incident, a Marine Corps investigation concluded that ''the fired weapon was not friendly fire.'' **********The victim, Lance Cpl.

This does not include additional aid of $100 million provided last year by Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, China and Israel, according to official estimates. **********Although all those interviewed agreed that the aid was substantial, there was disagreement over how much arms aid was actually reaching the rebels, whether the weapons were adequate and, above all, whether the guerrillas were winning or losing. **********Dispute Over U.S. Purpose **********Beyond this, there remains a dispute over the American purpose. The Administration talks about making the Soviet Union ''pay a price'' for its intervention. To Congressional officials, the Administration's approach condemns the rebels to defeat. **********By all accounts, Congress has been responsible for most of the increases in covert aid, sometimes encountering Administration resistance. **********Officials of the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency say that the fighting is not going well for Soviet and Afghan Government troops, and that the rebels are well supplied. **********Other intelligence sources and several outside experts assert that the Russians are making gradual progress, that 15 to 40 percent of the arms aid is being skimmed off by the Pakistanis and by Afghan exiles and that, of the arms that do get through, many are old or ineffective. **********The sources described the system for supplying arms to the rebels. According to these accounts, American dollars are used to purchase mainly Soviet-made arms from countries such as China, Egypt and Israel. The price is said to be exorbitant. **********The arms are then delivered to Pakistani ports. At that point, by agreement between the C.I.A. and Pakistan, the supplies pass to Pakistani control for delivery to the political leaders of the Afghan insurgency in Peshawar, Pakistan, and elsewhere. They, in turn, are supposed to pass them to the guerrillas.  ''Accounting procedures are next to nil,'' said an American intelligence official. **********According to Administration officials, Pakistan is given full control on the ground that it is running the risk of incurring Soviet displeasure and possible military retaliation. **********The sources said that Pakistan skimmed off some arms and played favorites among the Afghan exiles, but that most of the skimming was done by the exiles themselves. **********As a result, a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff report said in April, ''signs of Western aid are indeed scarce.'' **********Report by Senate CommitteeA more detailed report was given at the end of September to the Senate Intelligence Committee by Alexander Alexiev of the Rand Corporation working under a Pentagon contract. To him, the problem was the quality, more than the quantity, of the arms being delivered to the Afghan rebels, who he called the Mujahedeen. **********''The most glaring deficiency,'' he testified, ''continues to be the lack of any effective means to combat Soviet jets and helicopters. **********''The Soviets are able to operate with virtual impunity in the air, which, given the fact that perhaps 80 percent of all Soviet combat and logistics operations depend on air, virtually precludes any significant and lasting Mujahedeen military gains.'' **********By all accounts, the Afghan rebels operate with Soviet-built ground-to-air missiles known as SAM-7's rather than more effective American, British or French shoulder-fired weapons. **********Administration officials say that the United States could not plausibly deny involvement if it were to provide its own arms. As for the use of British and French arms, the officials add, Pakistan has not given approval. **********Shortages ReportedMr. Alexiev and others also reported shortages in ammunition for mortars and heavy machine guns and in mines, communications equipment, binoculars, maps, warm clothing and sleeping bags. **********Andrew L. Eiva, head of the Federation for American Afghan Action, the lobby for the Afghan rebels, said: **********''To the guerrilla in the field, clutching a World War I rifle that has just run out of bullets, the rosy claims of our executive branch have no meaning.'' **********Administration officials said the shortages were being corrected as supplies approved last year were only now reaching the rebels. **********To critics such as Mr. Eiva, these arguments are ''just an excuse.'' **********Administration officials said the quality of arms was upgraded more than a year ago to its present level, and that the Afghan insurgents could not manage more advanced arms. **********The $280 million approved by Congress for this year will not begin reaching the rebels for about a year.

Despite its high rhetoric, however, Williamsburg was followed by a wave of protectionism. **********Ambassador Robert Morris, deputy to the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, is representing the United States in preparations for the London conference. In an interview yesterday, he conceded, ''For a variety of reasons, some of us - and not just the United States - took protectionist actions after Williamsburg.'' **********But he insisted, ''If we are not simon pure, we remain fairly credible.'' **********He said this country's main protectionist moves were to impose quotas on foreign steel and to tighten the administration of import barriers against textiles, while the Europeans refused to ''unbind'' agricultural restrictions, especially on corn gluten. Yet, he said, the Reagan Administration held out against many other demands for protection, and ''we do not have to hang our heads in shame.'' **********At the London conference, the participants - the leaders of the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and the European Economic Community - will try to finish Phase One by completing the lowering of trade barriers agreed to at the Tokyo Round, which began back in 1973. It has become urgent to open Western markets to the debt- burdened third world. Mr. Morris said the Reagan Administration would press a resistant Congress to give preferences to goods exported by developing countries. **********In Phase Two of the trade talks the United States will call for a new ''safeguards'' code in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, with more realistic and fairer antidumping and retaliation procedures. **********In Phase Three the nations will take up the proposal of Japan's Prime Minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations, now that the Tokyo Round is nearing completion. It is likely, Mr. Morris said, that the London conference will support a new round and that it will get under way in the autumn. But it probably will not be completed until the late 1980's or early 1990's. **********In London the national leaders will also tackle the international debt problem, the world monetary system and the functioning of the world economy. ''Some people were optimistic at Williamsburg about recovery,'' Mr. Morris said. ''But now there is no disputing it.'' The United States will continue to urge that world recovery can best be achieved if nations pursue stable, noninflationary policies. As usual, though, the United States is likely to be censured for its huge budget deficits and high interest rates, which have slowed world growth and aggravated the debt-repayment problems of developing countries. **********Mr. Morris regards it as a ''healthy sign'' that the European governments are coming to recognize that their economies have lacked dynamism because of ''a lack of flexibility in labor and capital markets and too much government interference.'' **********If the Americans have their way, the London conference will not address the issue of creating a new mechanism for refunding the debts of third-world countries. The United States will stick to its ''immediate strategy,'' Mr. Morris said, of dealing with debt crises on a ''case-by-case basis.'' He said, ''Mexico is not Argentina, and Brazil is not the Philippines.'' The international debt problem, he predicted, ''will be with us for a long, long time'' and can be solved only by enabling debtor countries to expand their exports and foreign-exchange earnings. That would necessitate, he added, ''a more open world economic regime and a reduction of export subsidies skewed against the developing countries.'' **********There is a planned and unplanned aspect to every summit conference. **********In his new book, ''The Age of Interdependence,'' Michael Stewart of University College, London, writes: ''The June 1982 Versailles summit is remembered as having aggravated a long and acrimonious row between the United States and the European countries over economic relations with the Soviet bloc. **********''The Williamsburg summit of May 1983 was chiefly used by President Reagan to secure the support of his major allies for his controversial arms deployment proposals; little progress was made in convincing him of the need for a reduction in the structural American budget deficit in order to reduce world interest rates.'' **********The London conference may have a hidden agenda that will not emerge until the national leaders actually get together behind closed doors. **********But at this point it looks as though the London meeting may, with the recovery spreading to other countries, be a key exercise in promoting a more open and integrated world economy. It has become increasingly clear that national leaders must take account of developments in the world economy. Integrated financial markets, capital movements, labor markets, technological diffusion, electronic communications and data processing - all have shrunk the world and bound economies together. **********Economic summitry has become a national and international necessity, not just a media event."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/09/business/prospects.html": {"writer_name": "H.

Regan make him the Scrooge of Christmases to come, many economists and merchants say he deserves the moniker this year. They believe that many middle-income consumers, faced with the prospect of higher taxes and lower deductions, are likely to cut their spending - an unpleasant prospect for retailers hoping for a holiday buying binge.  ''The tax reform proposals couldn't have been delivered at a worse time, two weeks before the holiday shopping season starts,'' said Edward E.  Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''Even before the tax proposals were announced, consumers were saving more and spending less.'' Now, he said, that trend is likely to be accelerated as uncertainty abounds. **********For example, he said, third-quarter savings were 6.5 percent of disposable personal income, the highest percentage since the depths of the 1982 recession. This would mean that consumers are buying less and reducing consumer installment credit levels, which are regarded as important barometers of a healthy economy. ''We may well see consumer installment credit for October up only $3.5 billion, when the figures are released next Friday, compared with the rises of $4.3 billion in September and $6 billion in August,'' he said. This, he added, could further depress interest rates and inflation levels - and the spirits of retailers. **********Spending Freeze Fears **********The Treasury Department's tax proposals are also being blamed for the recent decline in stock prices. ''The only impact the tax package has had has been fear among investors that debate of the proposals may freeze corporate spending plans,'' said Steven G. Einhorn, vice chairman of the investment policy committee of Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********When the market began its downward trend last January, he noted, it was correctly signaling that the recovery was going to run out of steam sometime during the summer, which is what happened. **********What about now? ''We have,'' he said, ''a stand-off between investors who fear that any strong signs of renewed economic growth will send interest rates climbing and those who fear that continued economic anemia will reduce corporate earnings further. Until one side becomes convinced otherwise, the markets will continue to churn in a choppy narrow range.'' **********More Days, More Discounts **********The long weekend that many consumers will enjoy before celebrating Christmas on Tuesday this year may encourage retailers to slash prices for another 48 hours, according to Bruce R. Grier, retailing analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert. ''This season,'' he said, ''is turning out to be a cliffhanger, with consumers waiting for more price cutting and retailers, many of whom have already slashed prices of the heavy inventories by 20 to 30 percent, wondering how much more they should cut.'' **********November's retail sales figures, due out Thursday, may not offer hints of what could follow. Since the summer, retail sales have been erratic: nearly flat in October, up 1.2 percent in September and off eight-tenths of 1 percent in August. ''Nobody is going to guess about November sales. Even if they were up, they weren't very profitable,'' Mr. Grier said. ''The only items that are moving are toys, mostly traditional toys.'' **********Stretching Out Investments **********Most professional money managers, believing that short-term interest rates are moving downward for the near future, are lengthening their investments in money market mutual funds. In the week ended last Wednesday, for example, the average maturity in these funds grew to 46 days from 43, a sizable extension, said Cornelia S. Bugbee, editor of Donoghue's Money Fund Report, Holliston, Mass. **********''The fund managers want to lock in today's short- term funds rates before they decline with the maturing of higher-yielding Treasury bills, commercial paper and other short-term instruments mature,'' she said. ''So do many smaller investors.'' **********Based on figures from the 256 taxable mutual money funds monitored by her group, assets rose to $196.7 billion last Wednesday, up from $187.2 billion a month earlier and the 1984 low of $159.8 billion reported last Jan. 5. Bank bank money market deposit accounts are also growing, but at a much slower rate. They rose by $16.3 billion, to $386.8 bilion, in the past year. **********H. J.

THE GIANTS", "print_headline": "PEOPLE EXPRESS VS. THE GIANTS", "body_text": " **********People Express Airlines is growing like a gawky teen-ager, bursting its seams. Overflowing its base in the old North Terminal of Newark International Airport, it is filling the skies here with its planes. **********That growth accelerated last week as the low-fare airline announced plans to extend its bus-line-in-the-sky with five roundtrip flights a day to Chicago. That challenges the airline giants United and American, which each have 24 roundtrip flights a day between Chicago and the New York area. **********Fare Wars Forecast **********There were immediate forecasts of ruinous fare wars for the airline industry, for the People Express fares - $79 from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M. Monday through Friday and $59 at other hours - were about 70 percent below coach fares on the full-service airlines. And the risk to People Express, taking on the established major lines, was evident. Analysts recalled other carriers whose swift growth overtook them: Braniff, Laker and Air Florida. **********These recent failures, however, have given no pause to Donald C. Burr, the chief executive and founder of People Express. His philosophy is growth, and he wants eventually to put People Express planes in the nation's skies the way McDonald's puts restaurants on the roads. **********The investment community's awareness of the risks and costs of growth is reflected in a lower stock price for People Express. It closed Friday in over-the-counter trading at $12.875 bid, well below its year's high of $25.50. **********The airline is expecting delivery of 24 more planes by spring. That will give it 76 aircraft - 22 Boeing 737's, 50 larger 727's and 4 jumbo 747's - and a voracious need for new passengers to fill them. **********Confidence in Formula - **********There is no question that Mr. Burr and his associates have zealous confidence in their formula of low-cost operations, in which extra charges are levied for such amenities as checked baggage and meals. The formula allows profits on fares as low as one-third those charged by other airlines. But until now the formula's success has come on peripheral routes, such as Newark to Buffalo, where much of the competition is from small airlines. **********People Express intensified the game when it began international service to London last year. Now it has added domestic service from Newark to such major destinations as Los Angeles, Houston and St. Paul- Minneapolis, and on Aug. 22 it will begin the Chicago service. **********These new routes have taken People Express up against the big airlines. ''It does represent a change in strategy,'' said Alfred Norlin, an analyst at Kidder Peabody. ''They had said they would try to avoid the head-to-head competition as much as they could. But considering the amount of airplanes they have bought, it's pretty clear they had to have that kind of expansion.'' **********The move to Chicago was no surprise within the industry, said Robert Joedicke, of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb. It was known that People Express had obtained landing right slots at Chicago's O'Hare airport. **********''They've got to go into big enough markets,'' Mr. Joedicke said. ''With the delivery schedule of aircraft, they've got to keep finding places to put them.'' **********''What will happen has happened in many People Express markets,'' said an airline consultant who asked that his name not be used. ''The total market is so stimulated by their low fares that before the smoke is cleared, everybody benefits.'' **********Indeed, People's main competition in the New York-Chicago market have already responded. United acted first, announcing that it would match People's fares, with some restrictions, on its Newark-Chicago flights, and charge $30 more than People on Newark flights with no restrictions. And, recognizing the preference of many travelers for the other New York-area airports, United offered fares as low as $79 on Chicago flights to La Guardia, Kennedy International, White Plains and Islip, L.I. **********American Airlines then announced it, too, would match People's fares, with some restrictions. In addition, it decided to undercut United on flights to La Guardia, Kennedy and Islip, offering fares as low as $69 each way. **********People Express's low fares tap a market of new passengers. ''They have taken people off the roads and out of buses,'' Mr. Norlin said. ''They generate traffic, no doubt about it.'' **********Stimulating Traffic **********Harold Pareti, People Express's president and chief operating officer, said, for example, that when the airline began to fly to Boston in 1981, airlines on the New York-Boston route carried 1.4 million passengers a year.  Now, 3.8 million fly the route. **********Because so many of the new travelers hauled by People Express are young, it is sometimes called the ''backpacker's airline.'' But now it is seen as trying to attract the ''briefcase'' market by going into routes heavily traveled by business people, such as New York-Chicago. **********Business travelers make up the bulk of New York-Chicago air passengers, and it may be hard to change their habits, such as their preference for La Guardia over Newark because they feel it is more convenient to Manhattan. In any case, some analysts believe People Express will be using its new Chicago route mainly to try to feed its entire system. **********''I believe they're not going to stress New York-Chicago but the connecting traffic,'' Mr. Joedicke, the analyst, said. **********People Express's profits so far this year have not matched its performance in the first half of 1983. Net income in the first six months was $3.8 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with $6.3 million, or 37 cents a share, in the earlier period. **********Long-Term Growth **********As for profitability, Mr. Pareti stressed the long term of ''building net worth and a strong system for the future.'' He said the airline will add other cities, and hopes to create other hubs such as its Newark operation. **********One problem is the inadequate building and equipment at the Newark airport's antiquated North Terminal. This is being solved with a move to the airport's modern Terminal C, where the airline will have as many as 44 gates. **********One of the airline's weaknesses has been its reservation system, which all but broke down under the weight of its expansion and jammed the phone lines. Phone-answering has been beefed up with new operations and equipment and Mr. Pareti, on a busy Friday afternoon, put it to the acid test. He picked up the phone and dialed the reservations number. A look of relief came over his face. The phone was answered after two rings. **********people glance   AT A GLANCE People Express      All dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data  Three months ended June 3019841983 Revenues $135,296$64,304 Net income 3,7604,208 Earnings per share $0.15$0.24  Year ended  Dec. 31 1983 1982 Revenues $286,589$138,859 Net income 10,4341,002 Earnings per share $0.57$0.08  Main Lines of Business   Total assets, Dec. 31, 1983   $415,733 Current assets   *103,783 Current liabilities   **67,220 Long-term debt*   *246,591 Book value per share, Dec. 31, 1983   $5.57 Stock price, Aug. 10, 1984 O-T-C close   12 7/8 Stock price, 52-week range   25 1/2-7 5/8 Employees, Dec. 31, 1983   2,596 Headquarters   Newark * Includes capitalized lease obligations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/24/business/ex-stewardesses-vs-united.html": {"writer_name": "Tamar Lewin", "pub_date": "1984-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1253, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Stewardesses vs. United", "print_headline": "Ex-Stewardesses vs. United", "body_text": " **********Doris Cooper Baxter, who is known to her friends as Daiquiri, got her dream job as a United Airlines stewardess in July 1967. **********\"I loved United, I loved doing things for people and I loved flying,\" said Mrs. Baxter, a resident of Greensboro, N.C., who now runs a business called Designs by Daiquiri. **********She only flew for a year, though, because United had a rule that its stewardesses had to remain single, and in September 1968, she got married. **********Now - 16 years, two children and many jobs later - Mrs. Baxter wants to fly again. And like 1,800 other former United flight attendants who left their jobs between July 29, 1965, and Nov. 7, 1968, when the no-marriage rule was changed, she stands a good chance of winning reinstatement. **********As a result of a sex discrimination class action that is costing United Airlines millions of dollars and causing hard feelings among the airline's current flight attendants, these former stewardesses are coming to Chicago, one by one, to try to persuade the court that but for the no-marriage rule, they would have kept their jobs. **********While a few of the former stewardesses tell of concealing their marriages, and even of giving up a child to keep the job, most concede that they accepted the rule and quietly resigned. Most of them took other jobs - one is a lawyer, another a college professor - that they describe as boring compared with flying. **********For the most part, the former stewardesses have kept the eagerness to please, the pleasant mannes and the looks that made United hire them at a time when only 1 in 30 applicants was accepted for what was viewed as a glamour job that could catapult a small-town girl into a world of international travel, celebrity contact and sophisticated urban life. **********Even on the witness stand, many behave more like hostesses than litigants. When the lawyer who is challenging their testimony stands up and says, \"I am Mark Bigelow, representing the union,\" the witness is as likely as not to lean forward with a big smile and say, \"Hi\u00b8\" Harsh Questions **********The hearings themselves show how much times have changed: Several of the lawyers involved are young women asking the stewardesses harsh questions like \"Didn't you think about putting off your marriage so you could keep your job?\" or \"Wouldn't you have quit your job and followed your husband even if there had been no rule against marriage?\" **********The stewardesses who persuade the court they wanted to keep flying - about 71 percent of the nearly 500 flight attendants whose cases have been decided so far - not only win back their jobs, but also get full seniority in pay and vacations, and, if they live near a major United center, get to work out of their hometown. They will also get back pay, although the amount is in dispute. **********United opposes the former stewardesses' claims. \"The vast majority of these women would never have come back except that this lawsuit came out of the blue for them, said Paul Tschirhart, an in-house lawyer at United. \"There's something kind of unfair about any company being forced to face this kind of substantial liability so long after the event, to people who never even complained the time.\" **********The union that represents United's flight attendants also opposed the reinstatements. Since the no-marriage rule was a subject for bargaining in negotiations as far back as 1965 - and since the union won reinstatement for the few women who did not quit but waited to be dismissed after marrying - the union argues that any woman who really cared about her job should have filed a union grievance. **********\"Anybody who had two ears and two eyes should have known that the union would have fought for them if they had complained,\" said Nancy Coopersmith of the Association of Flight Attendants. **********\"We have gone back and found copies of local newsletters advising women not to quit, but to file a grievance,\" she continued. \"I don't think you can discount what was expected of young brides back then, which was to stay home and have babies. At the time, and even for a few years after the no-marriage rule ended, the job was considered a transitory one, with terrible pay and benefits, and no retirement plan.\" **********There are some hard feelings between the new generation of flight attendants and the more than 120 former stewardesses who have been reinstated. And there is reason for mutual distrust, since the new generation's seniority is threatened by the former stewardesses - who, in turn, are acutely aware that the current generation only has seniority because the no-marriage rule and another rule that stewardesses had to stop flying at the age of 32 were changed. **********As a legal matter, the injured parties in most discrimination cases get full seniority to put them, in effect, in the same position they would have been in if there had been no discrimination. **********But since, in the United case, that would have meant that women like Mrs. Baxter, who flew for a year, or Cheryl Williams Dailey, who flew for only four months, would be able to bump the current flight attendants from the choices routes, the court has refused to award full seniority in one crucial ara - bidding for flight schedules. **********In that process, the reinstated flight attendants' seniority will reflect only their employment time at United. Because that decision goes against the general legal rule, the seniority question is being appealed to the Supreme Court. United's Difficult Position **********Although United is not the only airline that had a no-marriage rule even after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited sex discrimination in employment, it is in a particularly difficult legal position because it had 49 male stewards, all of them Hawaiian, to provide local color on the Hawaiian flights, and they could marry. **********However clear it may now be that the no-marriage rule was discriminatory, Mr. Tschirhart said, the question was once a tough one. In 1966, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a preliminary opinion that the rule was acceptable, and the airline relied on that until two years later, when the agency said the rule was discriminatory. **********While the no-marriage rule was in effect, United was fierce about enforcing it. Former stewardesses who tried to conceal marriages not only had to eschew weddding rings, but also keep two phones, one of which would never be answered by a man, and put their maiden name on the mailbox. There are tales, denied by the airline, of United employees assigned to check newspapers for wedding announcements, and of harassing or grounding women suspected of secretly marrying, or worse, have a baby. **********\"Times were different then,\" Mrs. Baxter said. \"I knew one stewardess who concealed her marriage and got caught and fired. When my time came, I told them and applied for a ground job. The man I talked to said, 'You're 24 years old, you're going to start a family and in a year you won't be working.' When I told him we weren't going to start a family for four or five years, he said, 'That's what they all say' and he didn't hire me. It really made me mad.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/28/business/creditors-seek-to-oust-the-head-of-ghr.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 788, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CREDITORS SEEK TO OUST THE HEAD OF GHR", "print_headline": "CREDITORS SEEK TO OUST THE HEAD OF GHR", "body_text": " **********The turbulent command of John R. Stanley, who twice piloted his Gulf Coast energy company into bankruptcy, may be coming to an end at the hands of his creditors. **********Mr. Stanley, who is president, chairman and sole shareholder of the GHR Companies, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code 13 months ago, after huge losses forced the closing of his company's Good Hope, La., refinery - and payments lagged on $1.2 billion in debt. The GHR case is one of the biggest bankruptcies in history. **********Last week, at a hearing on a default motion before a Federal Bankruptcy Court in Worcester, Mass., the banks and unsecured creditors told Judge Paul W. Glennon that they agreed unanimously on a key concept: Mr. Stanley must leave if a reorganization plan were to succeed. **********GHR, once the nation's third-largest privately held industrial concern, owes about $800 million in secured debts to 14 banks led by Continental Illinois of Chicago, Chase Manhattan and Paribas, the French bank. About 1,000 unsecured creditors, including PPG Industries, Ingersoll-Rand and others, are owed an additional $200 million. **********Debts From Earlier Bankruptcy **********To complicate matters, Goodhope Industries, a predecessor company of GHR, which had its headquarters here, owes local creditors several million dollars from a 1975 bankruptcy reorganization. **********The creditors now propose that Mr. Stanley be replaced by Eugene B. Berman, a Springfield attorney, who would become GHR's court-appointed trustee. Under the creditors' plan, Mr. Berman and a board of directors would run the company, with Mr. Stanley serving as a consultant to the board. **********The banks said they would divert 20 percent of their secured party payments to the unsecured creditors in the first year of a 10- to 15-year program. The program would provide a 100 percent payback, plus interest, to all creditors. **********''Any durable plan requires stable economic management'' to develop GHR's natural gas fields, Earl Alpert, a Springfield attorney who represents creditors from the 1975 case, told the court. He said Mr. Stanley has been ''quixotic'' and ''mercurial'' at the head of GHR. **********'New Face' Urged **********Van Oliver, a Dallas attorney who represents Gulf Coast creditors, said his clients supported Mr. Stanley for more than a year. Now, he said, ''a new face must appear on the debtor,'' so that GHR can obtain production loans to develop the gas fields. **********If Judge Glennon approves the default motion, Mr. Stanley faces immediate removal. If he disapproves, or chooses not to act on it, the creditors and GHR will probably offer competing plans for the company's reorganization. **********GHR has continued to operate under Chapter 11, and its natural gas fields in Laredo County, Tex., have been profitable recently. But the refinery remains closed and efforts to sell or lease it have failed.  In a rare courtroom appearance, Mr. Stanley, 44 years old, listened impassively to the demands for his ouster. In an interview later, he said that plunging oil prices a year ago, not poor management, had forced the shutdown of the refinery and the subsequent bankruptcy filing. **********''We lost $180 million on the refinery in 1982,'' he said. ''We had no choice.'' This year, Mr. Stanley said, the gas fields will produce profits of $224 million. **********GHR's Payback Plan **********In any case, Mr. Stanley's role would be reduced even with an alternate 100 percent payback plan that was outlined by GHR last week. While he would not step down as president, he would agree to the appointment of an independent board of directors and would place his stock in trust during the payout period, said Stephen F. Gordon, GHR counsel. **********Starting with one service station here in the 1960's, Mr. Stanley built the 230-unit Gasland chain in the Northeast. He was squeezed out of business, however, as a result of the 1973 Arab oil embargo. In 1975, a plan to build a fertilizer plant in Good Hope, near the now-closed refinery, failed, leading to the first bankruptcy. **********Mr. Stanley appeared to have resolved his problems in 1980, when the bank group lent GHR $750 million to pay off many of its debts and expand capacity at the Good Hope refinery. **********After the second bankruptcy last year, Mr. Stanley sought a $24 million loan to improve the refinery. He later sued the banks for $3 billion, contending that they had illegally diverted assets of GHR into the Bellermine Foundation, a charitable trust that benefits Fairfield University in Connecticut. **********Last week's move to replace Mr.  Stanley came in a request to declare GHR in default of the remaining 1975 claims, and force adjudication of both the 1975 and 1983 cases under the relatively harsh terms of the Federal Bankruptcy Act - in effect when the 1975 case was filed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/22/business/futures-options-insurers-own-risks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 725, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Futures/Options; Insurers' Own Risks", "print_headline": "Futures/Options; Insurers' Own Risks", "body_text": " **********AFTER lobbying successfully for the right to use financial futures and options for hedging purposes, a number of states, led by New York, finally agreed last year that life insurers needed their own insurance against lending and borrowing risks. **********Last week's spectacular rise in the prices of fixed-income securities and the decline in interest rates again emphasized the volatility of the credit markets. **********But the most important fact as far as the financial futures exchanges and brokers are concerned is that few insurance companies have been using these markets for hedging the huge amount of funds that they, in effect, borrow from policyholders and lend to real estate and other businesses. **********For example, life insurers writing policies that guarantee a fixed yield at maturity have no guarantee that they will have sufficient earnings from their investments to pay the yield, he noted. **********''The most obvious reason why few life insurers use financial futures is that the states that permit such hedging have placed severe limits on the use of futures,'' said Arthur L. Rebell, first vice president of Wertheim & Company. ''In New York, for example, the life insurers can only use futures to hedge 2 percent of their admitted assets. California's regulators set a ceiling of 5 percent.'' **********Moreover, the life insurers based in New York can use futures and options only to hedge specific risks, such as a loan for a fixed period, he said. **********And casualty underwriters are still prohibited from using futures or options to hedge their investment portfolios, although Mr. Rebell noted that New York's insurance regulators, who often set standards followed by other states, say they are studying requests by the casualty insurers to use futures and options. **********But executives of several life insurance companies have told futures and options brokers that they are not optimistic, despite their lobbying efforts, about the chances of New York officials' relaxing the current restrictions. **********Another reason why life insurers have not made much use of financial futures and options, Mr. Rebell continued, ''is that they have traditionally made decisions by committee, rather than giving this responsibility to one person.'' **********Meanwhile, the life insurance business is undergoing a dramatic change, with more policies being written at variable rates. Increasingly, such risks are being hedged between insurers through ''swaps.'' **********Under this arrangement, insurers exchange fixed-rate mortgages for variable-rate policies. ''In effect, this means one insurer or other party is in agreement to pay a fixed rate in exchange for a variable-rate debt,'' Mr. Rebell explained. **********Not only are such swaps often more flexible than hedging with futures, but also they can usually be effected for much longer periods, he said. ''And neither party has to be concerned about tying up large amounts of funds for initial and maintenance margins, as is the case with futures,'' he said, ''nor or do those engaged in swaps have to pay premiums.'' A premium is the cost of buying an option. **********What also makes swaps attractive, Mr. Rebell continued, is that these operations need not show up on balance sheets as credits or - much worse for institutional money managers - debits. This often happens when investment portfolios are hedged with futures. **********The typical hedge for an institution or other investor in, say, Treasury bonds, would be to sell short a like amount of bond futures. During last week's extraordinary surge in bond prices, the futures sold short showed huge losses on paper despite the fact that the value of the actual bonds rose just as much. **********Thus, many institutional portfolio managers had to either put up huge amounts of additional margin on their futures hedges or sell off some of their increasingly profitable holdings. **********''While financial futures and options are not total panaceas for the hedger, neither are swaps because of the safety factor,'' Mr. Rebell warned. ''With the volume of insurance debt swaps now about $100 billion, the insurers should consider the inherent risks involved in this unregulated market.'' **********With any kind of swaps there is no guarantee that anyone will make good if the other party goes under, he said, noting that a number of once- prominent dealers in Government securities who were heavily involved in repurchase agreements, which are similar to swaps, have failed in recent years. But all exchange-traded futures and options are guaranteed by the exchange's clearinghouse."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/16/world/around-the-world-irish-leader-cautions-americans-on-terrorists.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 244, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Irish Leader Cautions Americans on Terrorists", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Irish Leader Cautions Americans on Terrorists", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald of Ireland urged Americans today to stop supporting Irish terrorists. **********In a speech to a joint meeting of Congress, Mr. FitzGerald said peace in Northern Ireland ''can be fulfilled only by a corresponding rejection - of revulsion against - the very idea of aid by way of money, or by way of weapons, or by way of moral support, to any of those who are engaged in the act of horrific violence corrupting and destroying the life of a whole community.'' **********This also precludes, he said, ''making common cause for any purpose, however speciously well-meaning, with people who advocate, or condone the use of violence in Ireland for political ends.'' **********BELFAST, Northern Ireland, March 15 - Scattered violence continued across Northern Ireland today as a result of the shooting of the leader of the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. **********Several buses in Belfast were pelted with rocks overnight and two were set afire.

Altman & Company of New York, which is currently on the block. **********''The merits of a developer acquisition of a retailer depend pretty much on the particular situation,'' said Jeffrey B. Edelman, analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., New York. ''Developers have a high cash flow. But with the reduction in shopping center sites, it probably is a good idea for the developer to redeploy his cash flow into an operating division in retailing.'' **********'Some Site Priority' **********He added, however, that for the retailer, he did not see ''any great advantage in being acquired by a developer or anyone else except for the additional financing.'' In general, Mr. Edelman said, top retailers can get into most shopping centers, but if a local retailer can be acquired by a developer building in the area, ''it might give the retailer some site priority.'' **********In the case of Woodward & Lothrop, the $320 million purchase by Taubman was in part motivated by concern that the chain might be vulnerable to a takeover by a less-desired company. **********This concern originated when Ronald S. Baron, a New York broker- dealer, proposed a leveraged buyout of Woodward & Lothrop by its management. The proposal was rejected and a settlement with Mr. Baron was achieved, but Woodward & Lothrop's chairman, Edwin K. Hoffman, felt that the Baron maneuver had created a climate in which a takeover move might occur. **********Accordingly, he arranged to meet with A. Alfred Taubman, chairman of Taubman & Company, which in addition to its shopping center interests acquired control earlier this year of the leading auction house Sotheby Parke Bernet. **********Stockholders' Dissent **********A Taubman offer, though accepted in principle by Woodward & Lothrop's board, was contested by dissident stockholders, whose legal actions failed in the courts. An offer by Monroe G. Milstein, chairman of the Burlington Coat Factory Company, and related investors to buy the company also failed to make headway, although Mr. Taubman was compelled to raise his offer to $60.50 a share, from $59. **********Several issues were debated during the eight-month takeover contest. Critics of the Taubman offer said that the original price was too low, that the value of Woodward & Lothrop real estate was greater than had been estimated, that additional merger partners should be pursued and that financial benefits to be received by Woodward & Lothrop's top officers were too high. **********But none of these issues did more than delay the merger. It was resoundingly approved by Woodward & Lothrop's shareholders. **********'We Own It Now' **********''We own it now,'' Mr. Taubman said last week in a telephone interview. ''It's an investment for us as far as we are concerned and a positive opportunity.'' **********He said that the Taubman company, which manages 19 shopping centers around the country, bought Woodward & Lothrop because ''it has an excellent earnings base and excellent growth potential. We think that Washington is the No. 1 retail market in America, because it has the highest per-capita income, and is depression- free because of the high content of Government employment.'' **********Will Woodward & Lothrop, which operates 17 stores in the Washington area, with sales last year of $403.6 million and net income of $15.5 million, expand further? **********''We are not planning any major expansion, but will, as in the past, look for expansion opportunities,'' said Mr. Taubman. **********Asked how the merger would provide mutual benefits, other than through expansion, he said: ''We believe that our knowledge of real estate will help them, and their knowledge of the department store business will help us.'' **********Albert Sussman, executive vice president of the International Council of Shopping Centers, a New York- based trade association, said that it was unusual for developers to acquire retailers, although many large retailers own shopping center subsidiaries. **********A Precursor of the Deal **********The only precedent for the Woodward & Lothrop deal was a smaller transaction five years ago: the purchase by the Crown-American Corporation, Johnstown, Pa., of Hess's Inc. of Allentown, according to Mr. Sussman. **********''There's no reason why more of that sort of transaction shouldn't take place,'' Mr. Sussman said, ''because developers do have more savvy about where to go and can help the retailer they buy work out more favorable terms. Some department stores are even able to get their sites rent free, since the developer feels they will attract a good tenant mix. But no tenant, under the statutes, can dictate to a developer who should be allowed into a center.'' **********Since Hess's Inc. was acquired by Crown-American, its sales, profits and number of stores have doubled, according to Irwin Greenberg, president of Hess's. Sales last year were $254 million, pretax income was $12 million and the total number of stores was 32. **********Interest in B. Altman **********As for B. Altman, at least two shopping center developers are interested in either acquiring it or being part of a purchase group. **********One is Mr. Taubman, who said, ''We are looking at it.'' The other is Melvin Simon, chairman of Mel Simon & Associates of Indianapolis, who said that his company has made inquiries about Altman. **********But whether or not they buy Altman's, there are other department store independents around for them to bring into their sights. These include Strawbridge & Clothier, Philadelphia; D. H. Holmes, New Orleans, and Carson Pirie Scott and Wieboldt's, both of Chicago."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/01/world/200-sri-lanka-rebels-are-said-to-kill-at-least-42-at-prison-farms.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 379, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "200 SRI LANKA REBELS ARE SAID TO KILL AT LEAST 42 AT PRISON FARMS", "print_headline": "200 SRI LANKA REBELS ARE SAID TO KILL AT LEAST 42 AT PRISON FARMS", "body_text": " **********The Government of this island nation off India said today that at least 42 people were killed when heavily armed Tamil guerrillas attacked two prison farms in the northern region. **********Officials said the attacks occurred before dawn today at the Dollar Farm and the Kent Farm, both rehabilitation settlements where convicts live with their families before being released. **********The officials said about 200 guerrillas had scrambled from two buses, spraying submachine-gun and rifle fire and throwing grenades as they herded prisoners into buildings and then blew up the buildings.

Some are turning to religious orthodoxy or are becoming more conscious than ever of their heritage, attending clandestine Hebrew language classes.

The door is closed and will never open again.'' **********After 260,000 departures since 1970, peaking at 51,000 in 1979, the numbers dropped sharply, to 1,315 in 1983 and 780 so far this year.

But Western groups, and many Jews here, disagree. **********According to figures compiled in the West, 300,000 Jews - out of a population of 1.8 million Soviet Jews - had asked relatives to send invitations when emigration was reduced after 1979.

Some would-be emigrants now argue that the basis for Jewish emigration in the 1970's - founded on the right of family reunification as set forth in the 1975 Helsinki accords - was a mistake. The invitations were not closely scrutinized, and some left on the basis of tenuous family relationships. **********One Moscow intellectual was called in recently for a talk about his application to join his wife's brother in Israel.

Your parents remain in Moscow.'' **********Two petitions signed by would-be emigrants in Leningrad and Moscow argue that Jews should have insisted on the right to live in Israel, which some say they consider their homeland, and that the philosophy of family reunification, with its abuses, was a mistake. **********As a matter of bureaucratic practice, Soviet exit visas list Israel as the country of destination. But, after an early trend toward Israel, most Jews, once abroad, now choose to go to other countries, mainly the United States.

Because 10 major European nations cannot agree on dividing up their community's cost, these countries are now unable to start carrying out a two-stage strategy they have devised for breaking out of the recession that has gripped their economies for the last 10 years and sent unemployment to record numbers. **********When last week's meeting also broke up in disagreement over Britain's budget rebate, most people overlooked what the 10 government heads present had actually achieved. This was a solemn political commitment to introduce real free trade between the community's member nations and to devote more of its resources to narrowing Western Europe's technological gap with the United States and Japan, instead of featherbedding its farmers. **********This declaration amounted to a promise to rectify a basic failing of the Common Market and one that economists increasingly believe is an important cause of Europe's poor recovery prospects, its technological backwardness and its high and growing levels of unemployment.   Beyond Tariffs, Other Barriers **********Although the 10 have abolished all tariffs on industrial trade, European companies still do not get the advantages their huge Common Market should provide because many other barriers stop them from selling goods, services and skills freely in all the member countries of the Common Market. **********At the Brussels meeting, the 10 government heads promised to create ''a genuine economic union'' in Europe. This means, they said, abolishing the 101 tricks member countries use to keep out imports - tricks ranging from differing safety standards to complex customs formalities and banning foreign companies from bidding for government contracts. **********It also means allowing banks and insurance companies to do business where they will; it means breaking the inflationary stranglehold that state- owned airlines and railways exert over the transport sector; it means new legal steps to help companies merge across national boundaries and it means spending more community money on industrial research and less on subsidizing farmers. **********The overal aim, the Ten declare, is to stimulate Europe's comatose economies.   Commitments on Ice **********While the Ten remain divided over budget changes, these valuable commitments to create ''a genuine economic union'' remain on ice, with individual countries lacking the political will to carry out the painful changes needed.  Meanwhile, the idea that the Ten can improve their economic prospects by creating freer trade among themselves - ''strengthening the internal market'' is the buzz phrase - has become the new orthodoxy among economists in Europe. **********This approach has its dangers and its limitations. Dangers, because instead of wasting taxpayers' money subsidizing farmers, the Ten could just as easily throw it away on uneconomic high-technology projects. **********Limits, because many economic rigidities retarding Europe's recovery can only be diminished at the national level. **********Nevertheless, the Ten's inability to free internal trade is particularly unsettling at present, many officials and economists believe, because it damages one leg of a two-part recovery strategy that is now emerging.   How to Spur Growth? **********So long as the dollar remains strong and American interest rates high, there is little else that European governments can do to stimulate growth beyond improving their internal market - and this is now in doubt. **********But if Washington does cut its budget deficit, permitting interest rates and the dollar to slide, European officials are now broadly agreed on the strategy they should follow to obtain maximum benefits. The plan, worked out at recent meetings in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, at the Common Market's Monetary Committee and among central bank governors at Basel, requires Europe to cut its own interest rates somewhat faster than the United States. **********This would simultaneously strengthen European recovery, prevent a dollar crash while edging inflation lower, and reduce budget deficits by cutting the cost of serving government debt. As a result, officials hope that the conservative governments now in power in West Germany and Britain would feel that they could take the risk of carrying out their promise to reduce taxes next year, and thus further fuel Europe's recovery. **********The combination of a clear commitment to free internal European trade with cuts in interest rates and taxes would unleash powerful recovery forces inside the Common Market, officials believe, allowing these countries to take over the role of world economic locomotive while the United States cools off its economy by reining in its budget deficit. Unfortunately, so long as the Ten remain paralyzed by their budget quarrel and unable to start improving the Common Market's internal workings, half of Europe's recovery strategy is missing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/14/world/2-groups-say-us-violates-south-africa-arms-embargo.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 168, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 Groups Say U.S. Violates South Africa Arms Embargo", "print_headline": "2 Groups Say U.S. Violates South Africa Arms Embargo", "body_text": " **********Two groups charged today that the United States had systematically violated the mandatory United Nations embargo on the sale of military equipment to South Africa by approving licenses worth $28 million for export of parts that could be used for military purposes. **********The White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, denied the allegation, asserting, ''We go out of our way to insure that we do not approve the export to South Africa of equipment readily adaptable to military uses.'' **********A report prepared by the American Friends Service Committee and the Washington Office on Africa said the United States ''is sabotaging the international arms embargo by winking at U.S. companies' exports to Africa.

The effort led to visits to Moscow, Washington and various capitals in East and West Europe. **********In Canada, Mr. Trudeau brought the country's Constitution back from Britain two years ago, an act that many consider Canada's true declaration of independence. He also fought to improve the situation of French speakers in Canada, achieved the personal dream of passing a Charter of Rights and Freedoms similar to the United States Bill of Rights, and successfully battled Quebec separatism. **********His sometimes idiosyncratic sense of style was apparent in final comments to reporters Friday. **********''I'll try to remain silent for most of the rest of this year,'' he said. ''It depends on how provoked I get.'' **********Mr. Turner referred to his newly- named aides as ''a phase one Cabinet'' that would be altered after an election. ''Everyone in the present Cabinet will have to fight to keep his job,'' he said. **********Until 1975 Mr. Turner served as a senior minister in Mr. Trudeau's Government, and left after a dispute with the Prime Minister. Although Mr. Turner publicly praised his predecessor during his campaign for the party leadership as ''the most outstanding Canadian of his generation,'' he took the opportunity today to separate himself from Mr. Trudeau in several ways.   Give Cabinet More Powers **********He said, for example, that he would meet with reporters more often. He has also given Cabinet members more power, while cutting the size of the Cabinet from 37 to 29. **********He also made a quip about his long absence from politics, and perhaps the dispute between him and Mr. Trudeau. When asked how he felt while being sworn in, he said, ''I suppose I didn't reject from my mind certain ironies of the situation.'' **********Mr. Turner's decision not to look outside the Government for top aides at this time meant that he retained a number of Mr. Trudeau's ministers. Marc Lalonde, for instance, will continue as Finance Minister. **********Jean Chretien, the Energy Minister who was Mr. Turner's strongest challenger for the Liberal Party leadership, was named Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary of State of External Affairs and senior minister for Quebec. For more than a week, Mr. Turner had been negotiating with the popular Quebecer to secure his support in a new administration.   Praises Opponent **********Mr. Turner praised Mr. Chretien at the news conference today, calling him ''my most important collaborator.'' **********Politically, the new leader's most urgent political task is to determine an election date. Some politicians suggested that the decision not to name unelected ministers indicates a later election, perhaps in November. **********A four- or fivemonth delay before a vote also might give Mr. Turner an opportunity to establish a national image as a Prime Minister, the politicians suggested. **********Arguing in favor of an earlier vote, however, are said to be two polls recently completed for the Liberal Party. Both supposedly show the Liberals leading by 4 to 6 percentage points nationally, a dramatic increase from the more than 20 percentage points by which they trailed just six months ago. **********Additionally, the Liberals tend to do better when turnouts are lighter, and a summer election, perhaps in August, might accomplish this purpose.   Visits by Queen and Pope **********A key consideration are planned visits by Queen Elizabeth II in July and by Pope John Paul II in August. Canadians are worried an election might disrupt the long anticipated visits, and a principal consideration in the timing of an election is making sure this does not happen. **********Only five Members of Parliament were promoted to Cabinet rank. The others are familiar faces, with precedence clearly given to those who supported Mr. Turner. **********For instance, Lloyd Axworthy, Mr. Turner's campaign manager, was made Liberal political chief for the entire West in addition to retaining his post as Transport Minister. Industry Minister Ed Lumley, Labor Minister Andre Oullet and Consumer Minister Judy Erola were all given expanded powers. **********Gerald Regan, who managed Mr. Turner's campaign in the Maritime Provinces, was elevated from trade to energy, a key concern in his native Nova Scotia, which is basing its economic hopes on offshore drilling for natural gas. **********Mr. Turner defended the exclusion of reporters and television from his swearing-in ceremony, despite the fact journalists and cameramen were permitted both when Joe Clark was sworn in as Prime Minister in 1979 for a nine- month period and when Mr. Trudeau returned to office the following year. Mr. Turner said the ceremony would have appeared on television too early in the morning on the Canadian West Coast for all regions to have equal access. **********Whenever an election is called, the Liberals will be up against the Progressive Conservative Party led for the past year by Brian Mulroney, a former businessman. Just as the Liberals are trying to gain in the West, the Tories are concentrating on picking up seats in Quebec, where they presently hold only one of 75 seats. **********The promise of Mr. Turner to run in British Columbia thus represents a challenge to Mr. Mulroney to run in his native Quebec. So far, the Tory leader, who was elected to Parliament in a by- election to a safe seat in Nova Scotia, has been reluctant to say where he plans to run. **********Mr. Trudeau has said he plans to move to a home he has purchased in Montreal and ponder his future. His immediate plans are to be ''a loafer,'' he told reporters Friday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/26/business/british-bar-low-fare-tickets.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 477, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Bar Low-Fare Tickets", "print_headline": "British Bar Low-Fare Tickets", "body_text": " **********More than 100,000 people in the United States and Britain who bought discount tickets from major carriers to fly across the Atlantic this winter will have to pay higher fares, the British Government said today. **********The major carriers sold tickets for flights starting Nov. 1 pending British Government approval of reduced winter fares.

Nevertheless, several analysts foresee a short rally over the next few weeks, and they predict that there will be a prolonged rally if several uncertainties nagging at traders are resolved. **********''The market was being ripped up like a tornado for four months, but now there is a light at the end of the funnel,'' said Charles M. Lewis, vice president of Shearson/American Express. **********Mr. Lewis predicted that the Dow Jones industrial average - which closed at 1,132.22 on Friday, down 32.67 for the week, despite a gain of 1.67 points on Friday - will climb 50 points in a short- term rally over the next two weeks.

He said interest rates have reached their peak because many consumers will refuse to borrow at current rates. In addition, he said the Federal Reserve Board's long-anticipated decision to raise the discount rate to 9 percent effective today has reduced investor uncertainty. All this caused Mr. Lewis to say, ''I think you've seen the lows for the year in the market.'' **********Although he was less sanguine about the short term, Newton D. Zinder, chief technical analyst at E. F. Hutton & Company, predicted the market would advance in the second half of the year. He said for most of the spring the market will be in a ''rally-decline phase,'' swinging between 1,070 and 1,200.  According to Mr. Zinder, the weakness in sensitive retail, automobile and transportation stocks indicates a belief that economic growth is slowing considerably. In his view, this factor, together with an outlook for low inflation and the receding of some interest rates, will propel the market higher. **********''The leadership on the next big leg up will be the big capitalization companies, rather than the more speculative stocks,'' Mr. Zinder said. **********Like Mr. Lewis, Martin D. Sass, president of M. D. Sass Investors Services, sees a short rally in the next few weeks. He said expectations of slower economic growth will spark a rally that will lift the market to 1,200. **********But Mr. Sass, whose company manages $1.4 billion in investments, said the rally will be ''short- lived'' if interest rates do not decline, economic growth does not slow and there is no major action on budget deficits. In that case, he said, the market could drop to 1,000. **********At heart he is a little more optimistic, however. ''There's a marginally better than even chance that the economy will slow down sufficiently to cause a reversal in rates beginning this summer,'' he said.

In recent weeks, the producer price of copper has jumped to 75 cents a pound, from 65 cents, and analysts predict that it may reach 90 cents by yearend. **********''All three of the major copper producers are going to outperform the market,'' predicted Peter Ingersoll Jr., an analyst with Salomon Brothers, referring to the Phelps Dodge Corporation, the Newmont Mining Corporation and Asarco. **********After a severely depressed year, copper mines are expected to turn profitable in the second or third quarter largely because demand is finally in line with world supply. Despite the optimistic outlook for the industry, analysts differ about which copper stocks are worth buying. **********William G. Siedenburg, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, is recommending only Phelps Dodge, the purest copper play. He is more enthusiastic about Phelps Dodge than the others because it is concentrated in rapidly improving copper while Newmont and Asarco are diversified into areas that Mr. Siedenburg does not expect to surge as much. In addition, analysts say Phelps has slashed its costs the most, an effort that helped lead to a painful, nine-month strike in Arizona. **********Peter L. Anker, an analyst with the First Boston Corporation, is recommending all three copper stocks. ''We think Asarco and Phelps Dodge are somewhat cheaper than Newmont,'' he said, although he acknowledged that Newmont is the only one expected to be profitable in the first quarter.

It sprang to his lips again in an interview last week. But he left little doubt that he believes things are bad enough both within NATO and between NATO and its adversary, the Warsaw Pact, to give him plenty of work when he starts his new job in Brussels in July. **********''This is a fairly important moment in the history of the alliance,'' he said at the unprepossessing office he has occupied for the last year as chairman of the British General Electric Company. ''There are misunderstandings between the United States and Europe and within Europe. There is a climate of opinion on both sides of the Atlantic that must be persuaded all over again that NATO makes sense.'' **********Perhaps even more important, he added, ''there is a mutual distrust between East and West that has caused relations to deteriorate alarmingly, and NATO has to try urgently to remedy that situation.''  Few Public Statements **********Lord Carrington will bring to the NATO offices near the Brussels airport a rare gift for getting along with reporters, and he can be expected to cut a much more public figure than his predecessor, Joseph M. A. H. Luns. But he doesn't talk about that. He puts himself down (''Can you possibly make anything out of all of this prattle?''). And he complains, with the special glee of the millionaire, about the high price of tickets for the 40-minute flight from Brussels to London, which he expects to be making most weekends. **********Heavy-rimmed glasses give him an owlish aspect, and he has that upper- class knack of looking as if he springs from bed each morning perfectly dressed. His eyes sparkle as he passes along - strictly off the record, of course - bits of tasty if never quite malicious gossip about former Cabinet colleagues and prominent members of the opposition Labor Party. **********''I'm glad to be getting back to public life,'' he said, lounging in an armchair, his legs crossed. ''Been a public servant all my life, when the electors had the good sense to elect a Tory Government.'' **********Since his resignation as Foreign Secretary after the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982, Lord Carrington has made few public statements, but he has continued to meet frequently with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, whose country residence is near his. Yet in his most significant speech, delivered in April of last year, he implicitly criticized not only the Prime Minister but also President Reagan, her ideological ally on major East-West questions.   Against 'Nuclear Accountancy' ''The notion that we should face the Russians down in a silent war of nerves, broken only by bursts of megaphone diplomacy, is based on a misconception of our own values, of Soviet behavior and of the anxieties of our own people,'' he said at that time. **********In an allusion to arguments about the proper way of counting warheads, a key issue in arms-limitation talks, he denounced what he called ''nuclear accountancy.'' And he said it seemed to him ''extraordinary, and against the dictates of common sense and of the evidence of our own eyes, for anyone to claim that the West, in military terms, is in any danger of sinking to its knees.'' **********Despite those comments, the 64-year- old aristocrat had the support of both the British and American Governments for the NATO job, according to diplomatic sources. Lord Carrington's resignation on a matter of principle - his old-fashioned conviction that he must pay personally for the ''humiliation'' of the Argentine seizure of the Falklands - won him many new admirers here and abroad. He has been described in a number of recent newspaper and magazine articles as one of Britain's two best postwar Foreign Secretaries, along with the late Ernest Bevin.   Dislikes Bellicose Statements **********He said last week he was ''not going to begin by criticizing the policies of member-states of NATO.'' But he made it clear he still disliked bellicose statements by leaders in either the East or the West, and he promised he would work as hard on disarmament as he would on any subject. **********The most important development in recent weeks, Lord Carrington said, was the prospect of serious East-West conversations in Stockholm about renewing arms talks. The Stockholm conference opens next week. **********He said he hoped to be able, as a man who knew both Europe and the United States fairly well, to interpret one to the other. He argued that ''any identity of attitude is impossible,'' because of differing history, geography and economic interest, but that ''an identity of purpose can be rebuilt if both will stop to think.'' **********Such incidents as the squabbles between the United States and Europe over Grenada, the Soviet-European pipeline and Lebanon were really only transient irritants, Lord Carrington asserted. But he said there were lasting, deep-seated differences of perception.  'You See Us as Selfish' ''There is a feeling in the United States, to put it very crudely, that many European countries are more interested in material prosperity than in their own defense,'' he said. ''You see us as selfish. To many Europeans, the situation appears very different; we worry about social and economic gains made since the war being eroded, and about a nuclear war fought on our soil. **********''Europeans used to criticize the United States for lack of leadership. Now you have an Administration that is ready to give a lead, and you're criticized for not consulting us and for seeing things in black-and-white terms. But you're always on a hiding to nowhere if you're the big boy in town. You simply can't in that position hope for your reward on earth. The British had a lot of practice at that.'' **********Any dilution of the American commitment to Europe's defense, he said, would be seen in Western Europe as ''a very grave development.'' It was therefore up to Europe, he declared, to do nothing to prompt the United States to reduce its troop strength here, and yet some way must be found to involve Europeans more completely in their own defense. **********''Opinion polls show revealingly nationalistic impulses on defense,'' Lord Carrington said. ''In this country, for example, people are all for us maintaining an independent deterrent at the same time as they are worried about American bases. That's not anti- Americanism, in my view, but a desire for national independence.'' **********The problem with suggestions that spending on Europe's defense beswitched in part from nuclear to conventional weapons, he contended, was that it would mean a cut in the American military budget and an increase in the Europeans' budget, since the Unuted States could not be expected to increase the number of troops it has here. **********''It is desirable, of course,'' he said, ''but it's about money, and one has to be realistic about money. The figures that are quoted seem unrealistically large.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/17/business/patents-solar-power-in-space.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1984-11-17", "snippet": "Two inventions that convert sunlight into electricity in space as well as on the ground were patented this week for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

In Israel, the name sticks to the estimated 5,000 Ethiopian Jews who have survived the perilous trek here, as does the stigma of being different in the society they expected to welcome them home. **********Over the years Israel has absorbed wave after wave of immigrants, about half from Europe and the Americas and the rest from Asia and Middle Eastern countries such as Morocco and Yemen. **********In the resulting spectrum of complexions, the Ethiopian newcomers are the darkest-complexioned. Officials who are concerned with the absorption of immigrants into Israeli society fear that the primitivism uninformed Israelis associate with black Africans will complicate the Ethiopians' integration. **********In addition, the troubles the Ethiopians bring with them make them ''the most problematic group ever to reach the country,'' according to Malcah Elbaum, head of the Ethiopian absorption center in Beersheba.   Difficult Arrivals **********Most of the Ethiopian Jews who reach Israel arrive illiterate, with nothing but the ragged clothes they are wearing, a powerful fundamental Judaism and a scattering of African diseases, including malaria and bilharzia, officials said. Many have never seen televisions, toilets, supermarkets or doors. Couples often split and give each other up for lost along the route, remarry and then awkwardly rediscover each other here. **********At a recent meeting held to introduce the Ethiopians to their new Israeli neighbors in the town of Safad, the objections residents raised centered more on the resources that a ''weak population'' would use up than on racial considerations. The Mayors of Eilat, Tiberias and Upper Nazareth initially refused to receive Ethiopian immigrants. **********At the Safad meeting, one resident said: ''We should be honest. It's because they're not white.'' Few of the residents present agreed with her on that point. But the complaints continued that Safad, where unemployment is already relatively high, would find it hard to absorb the new immigrants. **********When the Ethiopians began to arrive in numbers in 1980, special programs were set up in centers like the complex in Beersheba. The new immigrants are completely subsidized for at least their first year here, given semifurnished apartments, clothes, monthly food checks, medical treatment, language courses and occupational training, all under the supervision of social workers. Eli Artzi, Director General of the Israeli Absorption Ministry, said the Ministry spends roughly 10 times more on Ethiopians than it does on average immigrants.   The 'Color Problem' **********A group of Ethiopian women recently aired their complaints about crowded apartments and cheating husbands. The only surge of indignation came when what they call the ''color problem'' arose. ''A person is a person,'' one said. ''Anyway, black is not dirty,'' she said, holding out her brown hands. ''We got it from the earth.'' **********Other Israelis hint that the Ethiopians are not Jewish - an implication the Ethiopians take as the worst of insults. Their people has observed the teachings of the Torah for hundreds of years, despite persecution. Ethiopians have officially been acknowledged as Jews in Israel since 1972, when the chief rabbi, Ovadia Yosef, published a decree to that effect based on his belief that the Falashas were the descendants of the lost tribe of Dan. **********''When we got here and saw everyone riding around on the Sabbath, we thought we were in the wrong country,'' said Mordechai Tabai, a native Ethiopian who arrived almost two years ago. **********Mr. Tabai, whose Hebrew is already so good that he works as a translator here, said that getting used to modern technology and organization is comparatively simple for Ethiopians. The really difficult adjustments concern cultural and religious customs, he said.   Some Moments Are Painful **********In Ethiopia, for example, menstruating women are considered unclean and are sent to a special hut for a week to avoid contaminating others. Here, the women stay in their apartments with their families. ''It was very painful at first, and it was painful for my wife too,'' Mr. Tabai said. **********An Ethiopian immigrant recently appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court against the Interior Ministry's requirement that Ethiopian men undergo a symbolic circumcision, a pinprick, as part of immigration. **********Such protest is unusual, however. Michael Ashkenazi, an Israeli anthropologist who has worked with the Ethiopians, said that they are generally eager enough to become ''real Israelis'' that they do not raise strong objections to such policies. None of the immigrants interviewed here objected to the new names they were assigned upon arrival. ''I thought it was a good to have a new name in a new country,'' said Mr. Tabai's wife, Aviva. **********The absorption process has produced conspicuous successes - Israeli Army soldiers, university students, marriages with longtime Israelis - and also conspicuous failures.  A young Ethiopian was recently found hanged in a public park in Ashdod; according to the daily Yedioth Aharonoth, he left a note in his room saying: ''It's hard for me in this country. My sister died.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Qi Huaiyuan, said the talks were carried out in a ''warm, friendly and earnest atmosphere.'' **********The talks were to evaluate the progress already made and to study what needed to be done to reach an agreement on Hong Kong's future, the spokesman said.   September Deadline for Accord **********China, which intends to reassert its sovereignty over Hong Kong, has said it will announce its own plans if an accord is not reached by September. **********The spokesman gave no details of today's talks, which were conducted with the same air of confidentiality that has covered 12 rounds of direct negotiations on Hong Kong. **********Sir Geoffrey is the most senior British official to visit China since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher first raised the subject in her official visit here in September 1982. **********In a toast at a dinner this evening, Sir Geoffrey said that he was ''heartened'' by the progress that had been made on the issue of Hong Kong since Mrs. Thatcher's visit. **********''The excellent relations which exist between Britain and China encourage me in the view that we can reach an agreement under which Hong Kong's stability and prosperity can be maintained,'' he told Mr. Wu.   Speculation of Breakthrough **********The British Foreign Secretary's visit has raised speculation in Hong Kong that some breakthrough might be forthcoming. Sir Geoffrey tried to dampen this hope Sunday by calling his visit ''only one stage in the complex and difficult process'' of agreeing on the best way to preserve Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. **********After his arrival Sunday aboard a Royal Air Force plane, Sir Geoffrey was quoted by his spokesman, John Goulden, as saying: ''A good deal of progress has already been made by our negotiators. It is now timely to review the position at the ministerial level and to decide how best we can take the process forward from here.'' **********The visit is seen partly as a way to reassure the 5. 5 million inhabitants of Hong Kong. They remain unsure of their future despite recent Chinese assurances that the colony's economic and social system will be left unchanged for at least 50 years after China reasserts its sovereignty. **********For this reason, Sir Geoffrey is expected to withhold any subtantial comments on his talks here until after he arrives in Hong Kong on Wednesday.

The index, which over the past year has been virtually flat, is expected to show a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent for the month.  That would be good news for prices, but not for profits. ''The flat index helps explain the erosion in third-quarter corporate profits, which fell by $10 billion,'' said David D.  Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, Chicago. A rising tide of low-cost imports has prevented domestic producers from raising prices, Mr. Hale said.  He also suggested that the index's drop means that business is being hurt by interest rates - a problem that economists have been on the lookout for during much of the recovery period. **********''Our economy may be losing its ability to live with high real interest rates,'' he said. Traditionally, producers shoulder high rates and pass them on to customers in the form of higher prices. ''But this magic circle is now crumbling, along with corporate earnings.'' **********The Recovery Turns Two **********November marks the second anniversary of the economic recovery that began in l982, and many economists, though anticipating slower growth, expect the news to be generally good. ''The third year is never as sparkling as the first two, but this has been a well balanced recovery, and I think that growth will continue through l985,'' said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Bank. **********Not everyone, however, is as convinced as Mr. Kellner that the recovery is on an even keel. The continued weakness in net exports, for example, represents a disturbing imbalance, according to Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman/American Express Inc. ''In past expansions that lasted as long as this one, the average drop in net exports was $2.4 billion. But since the fourth quarter of l982, net exports have dropped $46.8 billion in real terms. I find that imbalance very threatening to a sustained recovery,'' said Mr. Sinai. The weakness in foreign trade, he said, drains much of the spending power from the economy. **********More Trading, More Hedging **********The New York Stock Exchange is the world's biggest financial market and the Chicago Board Options Exchange would have it no other way. Why? **********''Because the institutions that produce most of the Big Board's volume increasingly lay off, or hedge, their positions in our stock options and stock index markets,'' answered Henry G. Nothnagel, the Chicago Exchange's vice president for marketing. **********Mr. Nothnagel noted that the daily volume of his exchange's Standard & Poor's 100 Index options alone averages 300,000 contracts, each with a cash value of $16,000, which comes to $4.8 billion a day. **********''We couldn't do this if the Big Board's daily volume weren't averaging 92 million shares a day.'' he noted. For the New York exchange, with an average share price of about $33, he said, that works out to a total of $3 billion a day there. **********So confident is Mr. Nothnagel that the Big Board's volume will rise, that he predicted that the turnover of the S.& P. 100 options alone will reach one million contracts a day by the end of the year. **********Few Midnight Traders **********While many brokers talk about offering clients 24-hour service, Lind-Waldock & Company, the nation's largest discount futures and options brokerage house, began doing just that last August. **********''The result thus far has been the waste of a lot of midnight electricity, sleep and money,'' said Charles B. Epstein, vice president. **********Of the 700 calls his house receives each night after the Chicago markets are closed, he said, ''450 are requests for quotes and only 250 are actual orders for us to execute on exchanges in Singapore, Hong Kong or London.'' **********''Traders on the Continent apparently have better things to do at night than trade futures or options,'' said Henry A. Engelhardt, Lind-Waldock's senior vice president in charge of its Paris operation.

Roosevelt. But the undershot jaw and the pug nose of the breed are seldom seen these days in a country where dogs are omnipresent on city streets, on country lanes, in houses, in pubs. **********The official figures kept by the Kennel Club show that German shepherds, Labrador retrievers and Yorkshire terriers are the most popular dogs in Britain; no fewer than 20,593 new-born shepherds were registered last year. Bulldogs, however thoroughly British they may be, were well down the list, with only 792 registrations. **********According to F. A. Hamilton, the editor of the weekly Dog World, the fact that German shepherds outnumber English bulldogs results not from a decline in patriotism but from an increase in crime. ''It's the changing times, I'm afraid,'' Miss Hamilton said. ''People want the shepherds as guard dogs.''  Long Out of Top 20 **********Bulldogs were still among the top 20 British breeds as recently as 1954, but then they dropped completely off the list, and for the last two decades there have been fewer than 1,000 registrations a year. **********Originally bred to bait bulls - hence the name - the bulldog was known in Britain as early as 1500. It is a descendant of the mastiff, a Tibetan breed that is one of four types of dog thought to have existed in 3,000 B.C. Although they were often tossed into the air, the dogs kept at it until they finally pinned the enraged bull by the nose. Great sums of money were bet on the outcome of the fights until the sport was finally outlawed in this country in 1835. **********Little by little, bulldogs' legs have grown shorter and their bodies stouter; old prints show creatures that are positively elfin compared with the modern bruisers. But in the process, some critics say, they have become disease-prone, vulnerable in particular to ailments that make breathing difficult. **********''Ridiculous, absolute nonsense,'' retorted G. S. Wakefield, a no-nonsense woman who has been breeding bulldogs at her house in this Cambridgeshire village for 30 years. ''None of my dogs is ever sick. They exercise three times a day, without leashes, just running free, in all kinds of weather. Don't tell me they can't move or breathe!''  Bulldogs All Over the Place **********Mrs. Wakefield, a regular winner at the big Cruft's dog shows in London for more than two decades, is one of those sturdy Englishwomen with a single, rather esoteric passion in life. There are bulldogs in the kennels out back, baby bulldogs in a box in her kitchen and representations of bulldogs all over the house - on cartoons, mirrors, statuettes, ashtrays, prints, paintings, photographs, plates, paperweights, even a fire-screen. **********All her champions are kept outdoors; indeed, that is the prefix to their names. They are called Outdoors Boozer, Outdoors Basher, Outdoors Jubilant, Outdoors Duke, to suggest how hale and hearty a bunch they are. Mrs. Wakefield, a widow, says that ''my dogs are my life,'' but she is not above a little fun: She used to tease her husband occasionally by calling him ''Indoors Boozer.'' **********Wakefield bulldogs have appeared on television, and they help earn their keep by posing for advertising photos. Some have won titles as far afield as the Netherlands, the United States and Brazil.   'Beautifully Ugly Animals' **********''The bulldog will never disappear,'' Mrs. Wakefield, who is in her 60's, said with a determined air. ''The bulldog is the British breed - strong- faced, tough, good-natured. Like a lot of us, they're beautifully ugly animals.'' **********But Rita Stratta, manager of the pet shop at Harrods, the big London department store, says the bulldog is a connoisseur's dog, ''the kind of breed that only appeals to people who want to be a little bit different.''

The two sentences are to run concurrently. **********The judge also ordered Mr. Peli to serve five additional years for the willful destruction of army property and for illegally transporting old Syrian mines, the explosives from which served to make bombs that were planted in five Arab-owned buses in East Jerusalem last month. **********The attempt to sabotage the Arab buses, which was foiled by the Israeli police, led security forces to crack what is believed to be the largest Jewish terrorist movement since Israel became independent in 1948.   He Pleaded Guilty Mr. Peli pleaded guilty to all of the charges last Thursday as a result of a plea bargain with the prosecution. His lawyers and relatives said they had been expecting a much lighter sentence because Mr. Peli cooperated with the prosecutors and had a relatively minor role in the terrorist movement. **********Mr. Peli is the second person to be sentenced in the case under a plea-bargain arrangement. On June 7 Noam Yinon was sentenced to 18 months in prison for transporting explosives. **********Another 24 Jews accused of being terrorists remain to be tried, most of them on charges far more serious than those against Mr. Peli, including the premeditated murder of Arab students at the Islamic University of Hebron in July 1983. **********The sentencing today appeared to indicate that the courts will deal very strictly with the Jewish terrorists, even though their activities have elicited a good deal of public sympathy. **********A poll published Wednesday in the daily Haaretz indicated that about 32 percent of the Israeli public felt the anti-Arab actions of the Jewish underground were ''totally justified'' or had a ''certain justification.'' Sixty percent of the those polled said the actions were unjustified. **********In imposing the sentence, Judge Weiner told Mr. Peli that the very existence of the terrorist group to which he belonged ''shakes the basis on which a democratic administration is based.'' He added that ''It is inconceivable that a group of men should take the law into their own hands,'' organizing ''to perpetrate violence which is liable to cause death or injuries of persons.''  Ideology Dismissed as Irrelevant **********The judge dismissed as irrelevant the ideology and motivations of the underground and added that the court must ''react commensurately, not only to punish the accused but even more so to deter potential lawbreakers from committing such crimes in the future.'' **********Referring to the plot to blow up the Islamic holy place, Judge Weiner added: ''There is no need to waste words describing the harm which would have come to the state of Israel if the plan had been carried out. The harm to the Moslem people would have been even greater.'' **********Bearded and wearing a skullcap, Mr. Peli sat through the proceedings gripping a book of Hebrew psalms in one hand. An Israeli radio reporter said Mr. Peli appeared ''stunned and pale'' when Judge Weiner read out the 10- year sentence, and he had to be helped to walk out of the courtroom. He refused to make any statement to the press.   Father Reacts Bitterly **********His father, Mattiyahu, reacted bitterly to the sentencing, telling reporters: ''The charge sheet omitted the basic point. Charge number one should have been 'love of Israel.' If they had understood the basis of all that has happened, they would have treated the matter differently.'' The father added that the 10-year sentence was a ''burning insult to all lovers of Israel.'' **********Rabbi Moshe Levinger, a spiritual leader of Jewish settlers on the occupied West Bank, told reporters after the sentencing that ''the arrested will yet go down in history as dear boys who worked for the state at a time when it did not do enough on their behalf.'' **********Supporters of the accused have argued that the defendants were forced to take the law into their own hands because the state did not do enough to insure the security of Jewish settlers on the West Bank. **********One of Mr. Peli's defense lawyers, Moshe Yisrael, denounced the sentences as ''very severe,'' but said no decision had been taken yet on whether to appeal.

France has been supporting Iraq in its war with Iran and has given political asylum to leading Iranian figures opposed to the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. **********French newspapers across the political spectrum blamed Iran for the incident, and some of the papers charged that the Iranian Government had given logistical assistance to the hijackers. **********Plane Taken Over on Tuesday **********Serge July, the editor of Liberation, a left-of-center paper, charged that ''there was complicity that appears to go as high as the Iranian state apparatus itself.'' **********''The least that one can say is that in the schools of international terrorism, and notably Shiite, it is not imagination that is lacking,'' said Mr. July, who sometimes reflects the thinking of the French Government. ''It is extremely difficult to smuggle arms into a commercial airliner.'' **********A conservative paper, Le Quotidien de Paris, compared the incident to the taking of hostages at the American Embassy in Teheran in 1979. President Francois Mitterrand, the paper said, ''felt the wind of the cannon ball that was fatal to Jimmy Carter.'' **********That view was shared by some of the passengers interviewed tonight, who were virtually unanimous in saying that no heavy weapons had been seen on the plane until well after it had landed in Teheran. **********The Boeing 737 was seized over Luxembourg on Tuesday during a flight from Frankfurt to Paris, and the hijackers, described by the authorities as Arabic-speaking, demanded that they be flown to Iran. **********Iran initially declined to accept the aircraft, and after brief stops in Geneva and Beirut, the plane landed early Wednesday in Larnaca, Cyprus. It flew later in the day to Iran, and the hijackers threatened to start killing hostages unless the French Government freed five Iranians jailed in 1980 for an assassination attempt. France refused to meet the request, and on Thursday the hijackers took the passengers off the plane and set off an explosion that rocked the airliner. They then released the hostages and surrendered to security forces. **********In all, 60 former hostages arrived in France tonight, including 55 passengers and 5 crew members from the hijacked flight. The figure included 14 hostages who were freed between Wednesday and Thursday morning. **********Arriving tonight, the first passengers and crewmen entered the Honor Pavillion of Orly Airport to an almost hushed reception shortly after 10 o'clock. But the mood quickly became one of celebration as more passengers filed in.   Three Machine Guns **********John R. Scott, an American who lives in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was among the passengers who said heavy weapons had not been seen on the plane until after the arrival in Teheran. Until the plane arrived there, he said, the hijackers ''had what appeared to be a fruit juice bottle with a small fuse and a blasting cap and it was wrapped in tape.'' **********He said they also had ''two other smaller devices'' that appeared to be ''small quantities of plastic explosives.'' **********''We were in Teheran almost 18 hours before one of the passengers knew there was a weapon on board,'' he said. **********Mr. Scott, a former marine, said that eventually the men had three .45-caliber pistols, three machine guns, a box of plastic explosives and a box of grenades, ''and they had an incredible quantity of detonator cable.''  'Excuse to Get to the Hold' **********''I thought it highly improbable that they could have gotten that amount of munitions onto the aircraft,'' he said. **********Several passengers said they believed it was possible that the men had gotten the munitions into the airplane's baggage compartment and retrieved them after the plane had landed in Teheran. The compartment was opened, supposedly to retrieve medicine for a sick passenger. **********But Jane Wallington, a 27-year-old British nurse who also lives in Dubai, said she did not believe anyone on the plane was sick. ''It was an excuse to get to the hold,'' she said. **********Jean Nicol, the pilot of the plane, said he saw no apparent complicity between the hijackers and the Iranian authorities. Several other passengers echoed this view. None of the passengers interviewed, including Mr. Scott, said they were in a position to establish with certainty whether or not there had been cooperation between the hijackers and Iranians on the ground.   'Ignorant and Stupid Leaders' **********The threat of further terrorism against France came from Iran's President, Hojatolislam Ali Khamenei, during a prayer meeting in Teheran. **********The hojatolislam, who made his comments before the passengers had left Teheran, issued a stinging rebuke to the French Government for granting political asylum to opponents of the regime of the Ayatollah Khomeini. He said France's ''ignorant and stupid leaders gave asylum to the ugliest international terrorists, gave them shelter, supported them.'' **********He said the leaders of international terrorism were disguised as the leaders of large nations, including France and the United States, and added, ''They should take note that with their attitude, the wave of terrorism against them will intensify day by day.'' France, he said, was confronting Iran ''face to face.'' **********He referred to the hijackers as ''three young Arabs,'' but gave no indication of what happened to them after they surrendered. **********In a television interview today, Roland Dumas, the Minister for European Affairs and the French Government spokesman, noted that before the fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini himself benefited from France's tradition of granting political asylum. **********The Iranian exiles in France include some of Ayatollah Khomeini's one- time allies, such as former President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr and the leader of the leftist Mujahedeen, Massoud Rajavi, as well as former Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar and Princess Ahraf, the sister of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi.   Harder Line From Paris **********The rise of terrorism in France has been a matter of serious popular concern here and something of an embarrassment for the French Government. For many years, various Western governments criticized France for tolerating the presence of groups that they believed were responsible for terrorist acts outside French territory. **********Over the last two years, however, the Government of President Mitterrand has taken a harder line on terrorism. It has, for example, strengthened cooperation with the Spanish Government in pursuit of Basque terrorists. **********Meanwhile, an extremist group called Direct Action took responsibility for an explosion Thursday just before midnight at the European Space Agency headquarters here.

Shultz would be authorized to affirm to Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko that the United States would be ready to consider ''measures of restraint'' in testing the antisatellite weapons now under development. **********The official, as well as Mr. Shultz in a separate briefing for members of Congress today, stressed that the Americans were approaching the negotiations as a comprehensive package with the goal of seeking stability in Soviet and American military strength through tradeoffs in the various weapons. **********Until today, American officials have said they hoped the Geneva talks would lead to negotiations on strategic offensive arms and medium-range offensive missiles, along with ''discussions'' on the Administration's long-term research plans for a defensive shield against missiles. This had led to uncertainty about whether the Administration would be willing to include any curbs on defensive weapons when the talks resume. The senior official said today that the Administration would, in fact, make its so-called Star Wars defensive program subject to negotiation. **********Long Briefing for Reporters For the first time since the announcement on Nov. 22 that Mr. Shultz and Mr. Gromyko would meet in Geneva Jan. 7-8, a long briefing was held for reporters to provide some information on the behind- the-scenes work that has been going on in recent weeks to prepare the American position. **********The official, one of the few senior aides to President Reagan involved in the advance planning for Geneva, spoke at the White House on condition that he be identified only as ''a senior Administration official.'' This is a common Administration practice, particularly on foreign policy issues, when the White House wants to provide background information in a less official way than if the high aide was identified by name. **********It is not done to keep the official's name secret from other governments since foreign correspondents, including Russians, are usually present, as they were today. Officials contend that by speaking on this background basis they can speak somewhat more candidly. **********'Flexible and Constructive' The practice is not followed consistently. For instance, when Robert C. McFarlane, the national security adviser, announced the Soviet-American resumption of talks last month, he spoke at considerable length on the record on events leading up to the announcement. **********The official's remarks today seemed aimed at indicating to the Soviet Union, American allies, and public opinion that the Reagan Administration, despite continuing internal differences, was approaching the Geneva talks in what he called a ''serious, flexible and constructive'' manner. **********''We have identified some ideas and concepts which we think hold promise for bridging gaps which existed heretofore,'' the official said. He added that the United States was continuing to stress reducing the size of each side's offensive nuclear arsenal, but was also ready to negotiate on the research program on defensive weapons as well. **********''We are ready in going to Geneva to exchange thoughts on these ideas, hopefully to receive some from the Soviet Union, and we hope to come away with an agreed plan for the early renewal of formal dialogue and negotiations in each of these areas,'' he said. **********About the same time that reporters were being briefed at the White House, Mr. Shultz was discussing the Administration's Geneva plans with some key members of Congress in a closed meeting. Later Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, the next chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the Administration was insistent that both offensive and defensive weapons be considered comprehensively, and not piecemeal. **********''We are hopeful that there will be a comprehensive desire to talk about all offensive and defensive weapons in their entirety and completeness,'' Mr. Lugar said. **********The main goal of the Geneva talks is to set up a format for continuing the negotiations in a detailed way in the three major areas - strategic offensive arms, medium-range missiles and defensive weapons. The official said the United States was flexible on the eventual format.   No Preconceived Outcome **********''We have no preconceived outcome we insist upon,'' he said. ''We have a number of ideas on different formats which hold out promise of making progress in each of the areas. We will listen to their ideas.'' **********The most contentious issue facing the arms control talks are the two programs that the Soviet Union says must be given priority. The first is the current American plan for testing a weapon that could knock out satellites in space. New tests of this system are due to take place this winter. The second is the expensive, long-term research program to develop a defense against nuclear-armed missiles aimed at the United States and American allies. **********Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet Politburo member who has been visiting London this week, has emphasized that the American defensive weapons could upset the nuclear balance and lead to intensified Soviet spending on new offensive weapons. **********On Wednesday Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger said in a speech that the strategic defense system, known colloquially as ''Star Wars,'' was vital to American defenses and had to be pursued. He also said that the Soviet Union had an advantage over the United States by already possessing an antisatellite weapon.   Early Accord Is Favored **********State Department officials are known to believe that the defensive programs ought to be pursued but should also be offered eventually as a trade-off for sharp Soviet cuts in the multiwarheaded, ''heavy'' land-based missiles that American planners say give Moscow an offensive advantage. The State Department also favors negotiating an early accord that might include a moratorium on testing of the antisatellite weapons as a way of getting the negotiations moving. **********The senior official today seemed to support the State Department view, but made an elaborate argument as well for pursuing the research program into ''Star Wars'' defense. He said it was crucial to engage the Soviet Union in talks on what constitutes ''stability.'' He said the Administration ''had no illusions that some unilateral U.S. deployment of defensive systems'' would enhance stability. **********The senior official, who said earlier that the Administration looked to trade-offs in the negotiations, was asked if this included the defensive systems, which are still in the very early research phase. **********He said that because there were no actual American defensive weapons to trade at this point, ''it is intellectually obscure'' what the trade-offs would be. **********But he added, ''The research program and our intentions for it have to be on the table and a matter for discussion and agreement and negotiation between us, and they surely will be on the table.''  'Trade-Offs' Considered Fruitful **********The official also said the United States thought ''trade-offs'' would be particularly fruitful in the strategic arms area, where the United States would be willing to see curbs on its bomber force, which is more advanced than Moscow's, in return for Soviet cuts in its land-based missiles, where it has an edge. **********The official said he believed the Russians had agreed to resume talks because it had been Soviet practice to be more forthcoming in negotiations when Moscow felt the United States might use its advanced technology to move ahead of the Russians, as seems to be the case now that Washington is pressing ahead in defensive weapons. **********Konstantin U. Chernenko, the Soviet leader, has called several times for a moratorium on testing of antisatellite weapons. President Reagan, in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly last September and in private comments to Mr. Gromyko in Washington, said the United States would not agree to any curbs in advance of negotiations, but would consider restraints - a possible moratorium - at the actual negotiating table. **********The senior Administration official said that ''the President stands by his commitment.'' **********''Yes, we will consider what measures of restraint are appropriate when the negotiations open,'' he said. He recalled, however, that the Soviet Union violated a moratorium on nuclear testing agreed to in the late 1950's and held extensive testing before finally agreeing in 1963 to a treaty banning atmospheric nuclear tests - the first significant Soviet-American arms control accord. **********''This is not to say that one precedent rules out a moratorium,'' he said. ''The President stands by the commitment in his speech.'' **********He said Mr. Reagan had been given ''a rich panoply of options'' and is expected to make decisions before the New Year on what to instructions to give Mr. Shultz."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/30/business/brazil-will-seek-flexible-debt-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1984-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1276, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRAZIL WILL SEEK FLEXIBLE DEBT PLAN", "print_headline": "BRAZIL WILL SEEK FLEXIBLE DEBT PLAN", "body_text": " **********Brazil has decided to follow Mexico's example in seeking to postpone all principal payments coming due on its debts for the next several years, according to officials here. The request is expected to be made when Brazil resumes debt negotiations with foreign banks in New York this week. **********Foreign bankers and economists said that, if successful, the Mexican and Brazilian attempts to obtain multiyear reschedulings could mark a turning point in the two-year-old regional debt crisis by providing the two largest debtors with time to rebuild their troubled economies. **********At the London economic summit conference last month and in other forums, officials of the industrial nations have been urging that those debtor countries that make an effort to control inflation and reduce international payments deficits should receive favored treatment on their debts. **********Models for the Region **********By easing conditions for Brazil and Mexico, analysts say, both nations' austerity programs could become regional models. **********Some bankers also say that an agreement on a more flexible system of principal repayment would help separate Mexico and Brazil from countries such as Argentina that favor a more militant approach to the debt problem. ''This could be the best way of ending talk of a debtors' cartel,'' one Brzazilian economist noted. **********Affonso Celso Pastore, president of Brazil's central bank, refused to disclose last week whether Brazil would request a restructuring of ''two, three, four or five years,'' but he said the objective was to avoid new liquidity crises ''in, for example, 1988 or 1989.'' **********At present, Brazil is committed to repaying some $57 billion of medium- and long-term commercial and Government loans maturing between 1985 and 1989 as well as interest payments of about $12 billion a year. The country's total foreign debt stands at $95 billion, the largest in the developing world. **********''We have information that Mexico is achieving a multiyear payment plan,'' Mr. Pastore told an audience in the Supreme War College July 24. ''It's like a Formula One race. We're letting Mexico take the lead, and we're going to ride in its slipstream, later overtaking to achieve even better repayment conditions.'' **********Earlier this month, Mexican officials met with a 13-bank advisory group in New York and reportedly asked to reschedule some $45 billion in public-sector debt maturing between 1985 and 1989. Mexico is also said to want a repayment period of 15 years, including a five-year grace period on the repayment of principal, combined with a reduction of commissions and ''spreads,'' which are the margins earned by banks above the floating interest rate. **********Months of Negotiations **********Mexico's debt talks are expected to continue for three months. Mr. Pastore is scheduled to present Brazil's case to a 14-bank advisory group in New York on Thursday, although formal negotiations with the country's 500 or so commercial creditors are not scheduled to start until September. **********Regional officials involved with the debt problem said that the outcome of these twin negotiations would determine the next act in the debt drama. They argued that commercial banks had an opportunity to demonstrate a willingness to ''reward'' countries like Mexico and Brazil that have adopted severe austerity measures. **********Such an arrangement would imply recognition by banks that most debtor nations cannot, even over the long term, repay the capital on their debts. **********''People keep asking, 'When is Brazil going to pay off its debt?' '' Brazil's finance minister, Ernane Galv^eas, said last Thursday. ''We're not going to pay off our debt. The bankers know it, the official financial institutions know it, and the governments know it. We're going to pay our interest to the extent of our possibilities, and when we cannot, the bankers will lend us the money and then we will.'' **********Analysts have said that, while the Mexican and Brazilian negotiations are separate, they are linked in the minds of foreign bankers as well as of officials in both countries. ''In a sense, that's what the Cartagena meeting was all about,'' one Brazilian official said, referring to a conference of Latin American debtor nations in the Colombian city of Cartagena last month. ''A joint regional renegotiation was discarded as impractical, but the idea of coordinating strategy was very much endorsed.'' **********If the Mexican and Brazilian demands are met, other Latin debtor nations may request similar treatment from creditors without having first redressed trade and budget deficits through austerity programs. **********Interest Rate Worries **********Also, the coming negotiations will not address the region's overriding fear of a continuing rise in world interest rates. But analysts caution that, once relieved of the burden of almost continuous principal renegotiation, Mexico and Brazil might feel freer to concentrate their energies on obtaining lower interest rates. Early last year, Mexico rescheduled all debt maturing between August 1982, when its financial crisis reached a peak, and December 1984. In contrast, Brazil has been involved in annual renegotiations. **********In his remarks last week, Mr. Pastore said that Brazil's bargaining position had been strengthened by the growth in the country's foreign exchange reserves, which now stand at $4.2 billion and should reach $6 billion by the end of 1984. This was attributable largely to a growing trade surplus that reached $6.1 billion by the end of June and is now forecast to exceed $11 billion for the year. **********The central bank president said that Brazil would be seeking longer repayment and grace periods than those - nine and five years, respectively - obtained during the last rescheduling, as well as lower spreads and commissions. **********Request for 'New Money' **********Planning Minister Ant^onio Delfim Netto said last Thursday that Brazil would also request between $3 billion and $4 billion in ''new money'' for 1985 as part of its renegotiation package - compared with the $6.6 billion needed this year. **********Mr. Pastore explained further that, like Mexico, Brazil would propose that interest rates on the restructured debt be linked exclusively to the London interbank offered rate, known as Libor, rather than the U.S. prime rate, which, he said, was more unstable. **********Referring to Brazil's long-term growth prospects, Mr. Pastore said that much would depend on the industrialized world's ability to maintain its expansion and hold down interest rates. ''These countries must discipline themselves because, if not, there will soon be another 1982 - the world economy in recession and high international interest rates - that will simultaneously break all the debtor countries,'' he warned. ''The result, without any doubt, would then be creation of a debtors' cartel.'' **********Venezuelan Proposal **********CARACAS, Venezuela, July 29 (Reuter) - Venezuela has submitted proposals to its creditor banks to restructure up to $22 billion of debts over 10 to 15 years, Carlos Guillermo Rangel, Venezuela's chief debt negotiator, said. **********In an interview in New York last night with a Venezuelan television station, Rangel also confirmed that the Government had been granted a 90-day extension of its moratorium on public-sector principal payments. **********He said he was certain basic agreement would be reached with the banks during the 90-day period, which starts on Aug. 1. **********''Nevertheless, we have submitted some unconventional proposals which could make the negotiations more complicated than usual,'' he said.  Venezuelan Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua said yesterday his country had included in its rescheduling proposals debts maturing in 1985, in addition to those of 1983 and 1984, in an attempt to reach a longer-term solution to its financial problems. **********Venezuela, which has a total foreign debt of $34 billion, is seeking to become the first Latin American debtor to obtain major rescheduling without an International Monetary Fund agreement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/16/world/21-salvador-police-die-in-train-attack.html": {"writer_name": "Lydia Chavez", "pub_date": "1984-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 510, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "21 SALVADOR POLICE DIE IN TRAIN ATTACK", "print_headline": "21 SALVADOR POLICE DIE IN TRAIN ATTACK", "body_text": " **********Salvadoran military sources said today that 21 Treasury policemen were killed on Saturday when leftist guerrillas attacked a cargo train 25 miles north of the capital. **********At least three civilians were wounded, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. **********The attack, which took place at 11 A.M. at an isolated spot near the small town of San Antonio Grande, is the latest in a series of guerrilla raids against the country's transportation system. **********Last week, guerrillas blew up another cargo train and issued repeated warnings to motorists to stay off the Pan-American Highway, which is the country's main road for trucks and buses delivering goods throughout the country.

Dento-Med had the best percentage gain among the top 10 stocks in New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and over-the-counter trading. **********Leading the list of stocks upon which fortune did not shine last year was the Baldwin-United Corporation, the piano maker turned insurance conglomerate, which was forced to file for reorganization. Its stock fell a staggering 91.9 percent. **********They All Had Stories **********The spectacular overachievers and underachievers all had stories of their own: striking it rich at a wildcat well, lagging behind competitors in an industry shakeout, enjoying a strong and unexpected turnaround in earnings, investing heavily in new technology and then getting squeezed by a drop in revenues. **********''Some speculative and secondary stocks absolutely took off and others fall out the window,'' said William M. LeFevre, a partner with Purcell, Graham & Company, a securities firm. **********The big gainers were often small companies that only a lucky few had heard about before the stocks began their ascent into the stratosphere. In contrast, the big losers were usually either large corporations, such as Baldwin-United, Mattel or Mitel, whose sagging fortunes were widely reported, or tiny ones whipsawed in intensely competitive industries, such as small computers and oil refining and drilling. **********The APL Corporation is certainly not a household name, but the small diversified company, which makes tissue and plastic products, was the Big Board's top performer, rising 318.5 percent. Having weathered five years of weak earnings and concomitant low stock prices, this Miami Beach company sold several assets and roared back into the black. **********Finishing a strong No. 2 on the New York Stock Exchange was International Rectifier, which saw its stock soar 247 percent. The semiconductor and pharmaceutical company disposed of its low-profit animal products division and invented a low-cost, highly efficient method to power silicon chips. **********The Big Board's third-best performer was the Hesston Corporation, an agricultural machinery company that is half-owned by Fiat S.p.A. of Italy. ''Hesston was the strongest performer in a strong group,'' said Eli S. Lustgarten, an analyst with Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins. **********Harvester in Comeback **********Another strong performer in the agricultural machinery group turned out to be the strongest performer among the 30 Dow industrials: International Harvester. **********''A year ago, people wrote it off as a bankrupt company,'' Mr. Lustgarten said, ''but now the issue of survival has pretty much been put to rest.'' Notwithstanding its strong 1983 gain, the scaled-down company's stock, which closed at $11.50 on Dec. 30, is light years away from its high of $45.50 in 1979. **********Far less fortunate than these superstars but at least more fortunate than Baldwin-United, were Mattel Inc., and Nutri/System, the second- and third-worst performances on the New York Stock Exchange. Mattel stock fell by 69.9 percent, largely because of the unforeseen decline in the video game fad and the company's $222.8 million loss in the first nine months of 1983. Nutri/System, which runs a chain of weight-control centers, was hard hit by the recession and forced to close more than 50 of its centers. **********Two oil and gas-related companies were among the Top 10 losers on the Big Board. The Galveston-Houston Company, a contract driller, was the sixth-worst performer. Analysts said it was financially overextended and nearly crippled by the dropoff in drilling caused by the weakness in oil prices. The seventh-worst performer was Tosco, a California oil refining and marketing company that was squeezed by declining margins. **********Problem-Plagued Utilities **********Two utilities plagued by large delays and cost overruns at controversial new nuclear power plants that might never be operated were the Big Board's ninth- and eleventh-worst performers: the Public Service Company of Indiana, with its Marble Hill plant, and the Long Island Lighting Company, with its Shoreham facility. **********Another sad story was Mitel, a producer of telephone switchboards that was the Big Board's eighth-worst performer. I.B.M. had signed a large order with Mitel but canceled it largely because of a yearlong delay in introducing a sophisticated new switchboard. ''There are three times as many competitors as there were three years ago,'' said Amy Newmark, an analyst with C. J. Lawrence. ''In addition, prices have come way down.'' **********Similarly, companies that make sophisticated computer and communications products populated the Top Ten worst performers in both Amex and over-the-counter trading. **********One of the most interesting stories involves American Medical Buildings, a California-based builder of medical facilities that decided to buy a share of a communications satellite to beam entertainment and educational programs into hospitals. **********The fifth-worst performer on the Amex, the company was pushed into heavy losses because it is having problems finding customers for and paying for the system. Adm. Elmo R. Zummwalt, former Chief of Naval Operations, recently helped oust the head of the problem-plagued company and became its chairman. **********Another one-time glamour issue to have fallen in a big way is Vector Graphic, which was the second-worst performer among over-the-counter issues. Shortly after it was founded by Lore Harp, it was a leader among companies making small computers and many said it would be the first company founded by a woman to join the Big Board. Vector stumbled badly, however, because of a shakeout in the industry and because it was slow to move from 8-bit computers to 16-bit ones. **********''A lot of these computer companies seem very glamorous,'' Mr. LeFevre said.

Work on the dispute had been suspended by the Court while its full contingent of 15 judges heard Nicaragua's request for a restraining order to stop United States-supported military activities against the Nicaraguans.   Area May Have Oil and Gas **********The Gulf of Maine case is expected to set important legal precedents because the number of disputed maritime boundaries has grown in recent years with the general acceptance of 200-mile fishing zones. **********At issue is a 30,000-square-mile area of the Atlantic in which it is believed there may be oil and natural gas, although drilling attempts so far have failed. The United States' boundary proposal would give it total jurisdiction over Georges Bank. The United States claims the area was developed in the 19th century by New England fishermen, who fished in it exclusively until the 1950's, when fleets from other countries joined them. **********Canada is asking for half of the disputed area. Its lawyers say some parts of Nova Scotia have a vital economic dependence on the eastern segment of Georges Bank. **********The Canadians contend that the United States does not have any economic dependence on that part of the area, and that its fishing activity is centered principally on the sector that would go to the United States in any case. **********On Thursday, the Interior Department proposed to open 14 million acres in the North Atlantic to offshore oil and gas leasing. The department said the area disputed by Canada would be leased only if the United States received a favorable ruling from the World Court.   Geography of Area Stressed **********The panel, which includes an American and a Canadian in addition to Italian, French and West German judges, will be making the first judicial determination of a 200-mile zone boundary, as distinct from a boundary for the continental shelf alone or for the territorial sea. **********Only the United States pleaded today, Canada having completed its case. Davis R. Robinson, the chief United States legal adviser, emphasized two central points about the geography of the area and the characteristics of the fishing banks there. **********''The coast of the Gulf of Maine,'' Mr. Robinson said, ''is the principal coast of New England, facing the Atlantic Ocean and the outside world. Under the United States proposal, the maritime boundary will proceed in a southeasterly direction perpendicular to the general direction of the coast. **********''Yet Canada persists in advocating a boundary that moves still further south across the front of the United States' east coast, claiming nearly half of the last great fishing bank in the northwest Atlantic Ocean to which United States fishermen have access. **********''If Canada's line is adopted,'' he added, ''the entire Atlantic Coast north of Philadelphia - where one-quarter of the entire population of the United States lives - would face not Europe, not the high seas of the open Atlantic, but Canadian waters.'' **********''This issue of 'cutoff,' '' Mr. Robinson said, ''will be replicated in maritime boundary disputes around the world. This issue raises the most fundamental issues of sovereignty. The question of 'cutoff' posed in this case, not only in a geographic sense, but in a political sense as well, affects the interests of all states.''  Separation of Fish Stocks Cited **********The Americans argue that fish stocks in Georges Bank are separate from those of the Scotian Shelf, an area that would remain Canadian. The Americans, who maintain that the Canadians recognized the Northeast Channel as separating the two stocks, hold that conservation and management of these stocks by a single nation is more effective than joint management. **********If the Canadian proposition was accepted the two countries would divide the Georges Bank area for management purposes. **********The Canadian argument is that it has drawn a line so that every point on the proposed boundary is an equal distance from base points on the coasts of both countries. **********Canada maintains that its boundary is an equitable one that the United States has tacitly accepted. It said the United States failed to protest Canada's issuance from 1964 to 1969 of oil and gas permits up to the line it is proposing. The Canadians also said that evidence indicated that over the same period geophysical survey permits issued by the United States for Georges Bank were granted on the basis of an equidistance formula like the one proposed by Canada."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/04/world/food-for-ethiopia-brings-us-dispute.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 589, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOOD FOR ETHIOPIA BRINGS U.S. DISPUTE", "print_headline": "FOOD FOR ETHIOPIA BRINGS U.S. DISPUTE", "body_text": " **********A dispute has arisen between the Reagan Administration and Congress over Administration assertions that food donated by the United States and other countries to fight famine in Ethiopia is being diverted by that country's leftist Government to commercial markets. **********In an interview, two officials of the Agency for International Development contended that proceeds from the sale of donated food were being used by Ethiopia to buy Soviet military equipment for Ethiopia's civil war in two northern provinces, Eritrea and Tigre. **********Representative Howard Wolpe, a Michigan Democrat who heads the House subcommittee on Africa, called the diversion charge baseless.

They know that the sooner that funds are deposited in an I.R.A., the sooner they begin to accumulate tax-deferred interest or dividends. **********Individuals who establish retirement accounts at banks, brokerage firms, mutual fund organizations or insurance companies can contribute up to $2,000 of earned income annually, or $2,250 when there is a non-working spouse, on a tax-deductible basis. Non-penalty withdrawals from an I.R.A. can begin once an account holder reaches age 59 1/2. **********The accounts that have drawn the attention of the I.R.S. pay above-market interest rates. However, the financial institution also requires that a balance equal to the amount in the I.R.A. be kept in another account that usually is a low-yielding certificate of depositor passbook savings account or even a no-interest checking account. If the amount in such a companion account falls below the linked I.R.A. balance, the interest rate in the I.R.A. generally drops to a lower level. **********The advantage to those who open high-yielding I.R.A.'s linked to a separate low-yielding account is that the larger return on the I.R.A. is tax-deferred. For the banks, these accounts bring in additional business at little cost. **********For example, if a bank would otherwise have an annual yield of 13 percent for an I.R.A. with a particular maturity, its linked I.R.A. might yield a whopping 20 percent. But at the same time, the yield on a certifcate of deposit linked to the I.R.A. might be 6 percent annually for the same maturity. **********''It's intriguing,'' said Joe A. Mintz, the Dallas- based publisher of NROCA Press, a retirement planning newsletter. ''If I'm rewarded by a high interest rate, I don't see how I've done anything illegal. It's a tie-in sale, like the old days when you had to buy some kind of junky wine and they'd sell you a bottle of whisky.'' **********The I.R.S. may have another point of view, however. Just before the end of the peak I.R.A. selling season on April 15, its Chicago district office issued a strong warning on the accounts to financial institutions in its area. **********''The Internal Revenue Service will consider interest in excess of the regular I.R.A. rate to be taxable interest earned on the companion account,'' wrote J. R. Starkey, the district director. ''In addition, for any year in which the taxpayer has contributed the maximum allowable amount to the Super I.R.A., all 'excess' interest would be considered an excess contribution to the I.R.A. subject to a 6 percent non-deductible excise tax . . . and a 10 percent premature distribution penalty.'' **********Mr. Starkey added: ''The offering of Super I.R.A.'s must be discontinued. Failure to discontinue these plans could result in the entire I.R.A. plan being considered as not qualifying for I.R.A. treatment in any respect.'' **********This approach, believed to be the first direct attack on linked I.R.A.'s by the Federal Government, applies only to the Chicago district, since the national office of the I.R.S. has not yet ruled on the matter. Shortly after the Chicago announcement was issued, a spokesman for the I.R.S. in Washington said that a statement would soon be forthcoming, but nothing has thus far been released. Now the service will only say that ''the issue is under study and something will be coming out in the near future.'' **********W. Wesley Howard 3d, editor of the I.R.A. Reporter, a newsletter published in Cleveland, said: ''My guess is that the national office doesn't have any choice but to go 100 percent with what the Chicago district says. I.R.A.'s lie on the fringe of pension law and for better or worse, I.R.A.'s are subject to some of the areas of law affecting pensions.'' **********The linked I.R.A.'s may very well be eliminated before they become widely accepted by the public. And until a final determination is made by the I.R.S., there will continue to be doubts as to the long-range viability of this marketing tool with a perceived consumer benefit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/05/business/italy-increases-discount-rate.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Italy Increases Discount Rate", "print_headline": "Italy Increases Discount Rate", "body_text": " **********Italy raised its official discount rate today to 16 1/2 percent from 15 1/2 percent in an effort to curb strong domestic demand for loans and to keep inflation in check. **********Unexpectedly high private credit demand, which rose at an annual rate well above Government targets in the first seven months of this year, made the increase necessary, the Treasury said. **********Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria said, ''The main aim of the measure is to cool domestic demand so as to continue reducing inflation and not allow an intolerable worsening of our foreign accounts.'' **********Price inflation fell in July to 10 1/2 percent, a 10-year low for Italy but higher than rates in major trading partners. **********Today's rate rise reversed a recent decline.

The body offers a limited political role to some nonwhite South Africans but not to the black majority. **********However, a low turnout and other factors indicated the obstacles facing the Labor Party leader, the Rev. Allan Hendrickse, in defending his participation in the South African political system. Critics assert the new Constitution upon which the parliament is based institutionalizes the ostracism of blacks and entrenches the official system of racial division. **********Mr. Hendrickse, a Congregational minister who has opposed apartheid, has said repeatedly that he agreed to take part in what the authorities call a ''new dispensation'' in order to dismantle the apartheid system from within. After Wednesday's voting, he said his task now would be to ''deliver the goods'' to his constituents. **********But South African commentators said his chances of doing so were slim, since the whites will have a veto in the new parliament and the legislation underpinning apartheid cannot be easily modified.   Party Wins 75 of 80 Seats **********With the votes for all but one seat counted, Mr. Hendrickse's party had 75 of the 80 places allocated to the 2.8 million people of mixed race - ''coloreds'' in South Africa's racial nomenclature - in the parliament that is to be introduced next month. Whites, who number 4.5 million and who have already approved the new Constitution, are given 160 seats, while the country's 800,000 Indians are to vote for their 40 seats next week. **********The black majority of more than 20 million has not been consulted about the qualified policy changes, through which the authorities are seeking to widen their political base without losing the power that the dominant Afrikaner group has exercised for 36 years. **********Despite the jubilation of Labor Party supporters, an alliance opposing the new system, the United Democratic Front, said Wednesday's voting had failed to endorse the constitutional changes and granted no legitimacy to those taking part in it. The group considers Mr. Hendrickse a traitor. **********'Unrest and Tension' Predicted **********''I cannot see how the new parliament will ever work and how continuing with it after yesterday's poll cannot cause more unrest and tension,'' said the Rev. Allan Boesak, the most prominent mixed-race opponent of the policy changes and a central figure in the pre- election campaign for a boycott of the vote. **********''The people going into the new system cannot by any stretch of the imagination talk about a mandate,'' he said. **********In Johannesburg today, an explosion thought to have been caused by a bomb destroyed offices of the Department of Education and Training, which administers the country's black schools, the police said. No injuries were reported in the blast, and there was no claim of responsibility.  According to provisional figures, less than 30 percent of the registered mixed-race voters cast ballots Wednesday. Opponents of the elections said only 60 percent of the mixed-race population had registered to vote, so the actual turnout was less than 20 percent of those eligible. **********The immediate challenge to Mr. Hendrickse is to establish the credibility of his participation in the new parliament by exacting changes from it, South African political scientists said. In doing so, he will be confronting a vast body of legislation designed to keep races and tribes apart. Many of the laws are interlocking since they cover almost every aspect of life - where people may live, whom they may marry, where their children are educated and where they are buried. **********Mr. Hendrickse plans to seek the change of laws prohibiting marriage and sexual relations between racial groups. But South African commentators said such changes would be cosmetic unless the entire structure were dismantled. **********Mr. Hendrickse, 57 years old, is widely expected to become the first nonwhite member of the Cabinet. In an interview before the elections, he said: ''Our decision to participate must merely be seen as a point of departure, not as a place of arrival. We want to see apartheid dismantled. Our decision to participate is motivated by this desire. We believe that once the first apartheid law goes, the domino principle will result in the others going too.''  No Plans to Repeal Basic Laws **********The Government, however, has stressed that it has no plans to repeal such basic aspects of apartheid as the Group Areas Act, which determines where races may live. Thus, once in office, Mr. Hendrickse may find he is obliged to share the collective responsibility for Cabinet decisions reinforcing apartheid. **********If he joins the Cabinet, Mr. Hendrickse will be sitting among those who, eight years ago, were his jailers. In late 1976, after riots in Johannesburg's black suburb of Soweto, Mr. Hendrickse was held in solitary confinement for 60 days, marking the long hours, he recalls, by a makeshift sundial in his cell. **********Mr. Hendrickse studied at Fort Hare University in South Africa, where his classmates included such African nationalists as Robert Sobukwe, founder of the Pan-Africanist Congress, and Robert Mugabe, now Prime Minister of Zimbabwe. **********Of his involvement with the new Constitution, Mr. Hendrickse has said: ''If after five years there are no clear movements away from apartheid, we will just leave this new dispensation'' and seek a mandate from mixed-race people for other strategies.

Pictured are four clean-cut students strolling across the cobblestone courtyard of Trinity College; the caption reads, ''We're the young Europeans.'' **********The advertisement, part of a new campaign by the country's Industrial Development Authority to attract foreign investment, reflects Ireland's attempt to cope with an awkward, urgent problem. For Ireland's greatest selling point - a growing population of well-educated young people - is also rapidly becoming its most critical national concern. **********More than half of Ireland's population is now under 25 years of age - a demographic concern mentioned continually by economists and industrial officials here. The population has grown by 22 percent in the last 20 years, and the labor pool is now expanding at an annual rate of 1.2 percent - more than double the overall European rate. **********The result is an increasingly intractable unemployment problem. Those out of work now account for 16 percent of the labor pool, up from 8 percent five years ago, and some economists expect that the level will approach 20 percent next year. **********Large Foreign Debt **********But unemployment is only the most visible of Ireland's economic woes. Indeed, the verdant land that President Reagan toured this past weekend now faces other, less familiar challenges: Though inflation has eased from the damaging levels of three years ago, a huge public deficit remains, and external borrowing by the Government, at nearly $10 billion, now stands at two-thirds of the gross national product - its highest level ever. **********And most agree that these new problems will haunt Ireland for years. ''The problems we have aren't going to be solved in a year,'' said Joseph Durkin, an economist with D.K.M., a Dublin consulting firm. ''We're talking about the long haul.'' **********In the midst of such new economic troubles remains the old: With a per capita personal income of $3,900 in 1982, the latest year available, the Irish people are among the poorest in Europe. And now, many believe that this poverty, exacerbated by increasing personal taxes and the lack of jobs, may renew an 80-year tide of emigration that ended 20 years ago. **********''Migration used to be a bad word here,'' observed Kenneth Whitaker, once the nation's Secretary of Finance and now chancellor of the National University here. ''Now, one might see emigration not as a sad and tearful thing, but as a migration within the European community.'' **********Key Development Agency **********For the last decade, Ireland's primary weapon against unemployment and poverty has been the Industrial Development Authority, a state agency whose aggressive tactics and $225 million budget have made Ireland the most successful European nation in attracting foreign - and especially American - manufacturing investment. **********The agency's efforts have transformed a country once almost wholly dependent on agriculture. Though agriculture still accounts for 69 percent of Ireland's land, manufacturing employs about the same number of people, approximately 190,000. The biggest employment sector in the country, which has a population of about 3.5 million, is services, which accounts for 600,000 jobs. **********Today, the agency says, 850 foreign companies operate manufacturing facilities in Ireland. American investment alone over the last 25 years has totaled $4.6 billion, and American companies now provide 18 percent of all manufacturing jobs. President Reagan acknowledged that investment in a meeting during the weekend with the chief executives of the Irish subsidiaries of 19 American companies. **********The authority's new emphasis on Ireland's youth reflects an attempt to attract more service and high-technology companies - companies, the authority believes, that will provide more white-collar jobs. ''We're not looking for products that depend on cheap labor to be viable,'' said one I.D.A. executive. ''We're not going to compete with the Far East.'' **********Maximum Tax of 10 Percent **********This strategy, spiced with substantial cash grants for plant construction and a maximum corporate tax rate of 10 percent, has already had considerable success, despite the fall-off in American investment in the latest recession. **********Indeed, executives at American companies, in interviews during the weekend, most often cited the availability of relatively inexpensive, trained labor as the primary advantage of operating in Ireland. **********But economists here, while acknowledging the I.D.A.'s success, say that foreign investment is no longer enough to revitalize Ireland's economy. A proposal by the National Planning Board, published in April, called for dramatic changes in monetary and fiscal policy in the period from 1984 to 1987. **********Most believe the Government must rein in public expenditures, which last year produced a deficit of $1.1 billion, or 7 percent of G.N.P. Foreign borrowing by the public sector increased by more than 20 percent in 1983, and some expect the total will reach $11 billion next year.

Last Wednesday, for example, a record 342,297 OEX contracts changed hands, eclipsing the previous mark of 320,529 trades set on Feb. 9. Its daily average volume this year has been 224,000 contracts. **********As another example, last Wednesday the New York Futures Exchange's options on its parent's composite index traded 26,581 contracts and the American Stock Exchange's Major Market Index, 22,994. **********Also typical, the most active futures market last Wednesday was in Treasury bonds on the Chicago Board of Trade, where 195,000 contracts were traded, as well as 22,520 Treasury-bond options. Significantly, the volume of the S.&P. 500 index futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that day was 59,289. **********''There are several ready explanations for the OEX phenomenon, which is unparalleled in the history of the options or futures markets,'' said John M. Blin, partner in Shatkin Investing Inc., Chicago, and a former economics professor at Northwestern University. ''One reason is that the OEX index of 100 stocks contains 80 percent of the richest, or most heavily capitalized shares in the S.&P.  500 index, against which the investment performance of most institutional portfolio managers are measured.'' **********Another reason, Mr. Blin said, was that many portfolio managers now believe they have found the ''handle'' that permits them to project the overall stock market's moves a few minutes before the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks confirms them. As he explained: ''The fact is that I.B.M. has become the anchor around which the market moves. So 'rich' is I.B.M. that any price change in its stock will greatly influence the popular share averages immediately. Because the OEX has only 100 stocks, including I.B.M., it responds somewhat faster than the other averages. Since the breakup of A.T.&T., I.B.M. has become, for better or worse, the bellwether issue.'' **********By ''richest,'' Mr. Blin meant that no other stock is as heavily capitalized as the International Business Machines Corporation, which has 609 million shares outstanding. At last Friday's I.B.M. close of 108, these shares were worth almost $65.8 billion. **********According to his researchers, I.B.M. represents 12.5 percent of the value of the OEX options; 6.5 percent of the S.&P. 500 index; 4 percent of the Big Board's composite index, and 9 percent of the Amex Market Value Index. **********Because the Dow Jones industrial and Value Line averages are termed ''democratic'' in that all shares are weighed equally, I.B.M.'s price represents one-thirtieth of the Dow and carries as much clout as the cheapest over-the-counter stock in the Value Line, Mr. Blin noted. **********Still another reason the OEX has become a sort of early warning indicator of how the other averages will move is the volatility of the shares in this index. All the OEX blue-chip stocks are constantly being traded, while the broader-based indexes contain many less-active issues or those that trade infrequently. **********Stewart C. Elner, vice president and director of options trading at Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis Inc., offered another view of the OEX options: **********''Aside from the technical factors that have made the OEX the most successful product anyone can think of, we must remember that it was the first of its kind and from its first day enjoyed the expertise and liquidity of the C.B.O.E., the first stock options market. Copy-cat products rarely do as well as the first one off the mark.'' **********Mr. Elner said that the OEX options have also benefited from changes that have been sweeping the equities market. ''Investors today do not think long-term,'' he continued. ''That is why the stock options grew so popular. Now, many investors think in even shorter day-to-day terms and this may explain the incredible OEX index option market. It may also explain why the stock options volumes on the C.B.O.E. and Amex both declined 2.7 percent in 1983, a year of rising share prices.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/26/world/reagan-jet-s-exhaust-hurts-several-in-guam.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 194, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reagan Jet's Exhaust Hurts Several in Guam", "print_headline": "Reagan Jet's Exhaust Hurts Several in Guam", "body_text": " **********Several people, including a baby, suffered minor injuries when they were hit by a jet blast from President Reagan's plane shortly after the President's arrival here today. **********The aircraft, Air Force One, was taxiing to a parking position when its jet blast blew several people over and threw tables into the air, according to Nolan Hendricks, safety chairman of the Guam chapter of the American Red Cross. **********Although there was an announcement that people should get out of the way because the plane was going to be turned around, some failed to heed the warning. **********Several people who were cleaning up the tarmac area where Mr. Reagan had been welcomed were treated at the scene for minor injuries, Mr. Hendricks said.

And he has found two important themes common to most large-scale innovations - those costing many millions of dollars and having a significant impact on their environment. **********First, he said, innovation is normally the result of chance and an individual's ''flash insight'' - the kind that struck Masaru Ibuka of Sony, who was visiting the United States when Bell Labs was offered a patent for the transistor. ''He saw its ultimate potential in very small devices in the electronics field'' and went on to invent the pocket radio, Professor Quinn observed. ''In the early stages, invention itself is almost a random process.'' **********Second, in all successful innovations, a company's top management sympathizes with and involves itself in the project. ''Management knows that development is chaotic, and they allow this tumultuous, unstructured progress to go on,'' he said. ''It takes vision, but faith more than vision. And it takes a willingness to have your organization broken up and disrupted a bit.'' A conservative, financially oriented company often finds it difficult to forfeit bureaucracy for innovative chaos, he said. ''But when you're organized to do that, you get tremendous premiums.'' **********Professor Quinn noted that some companies, such as I.B.M., are good innovators even though they may not be the first to develop a particular invention. And many others are ''superbly managed'' but rarely innovate. ''They can sell a good product at a very low cost and do it very well indeed. And we need people like that - people who can turn out a well-made bar of steel.'' **********Recognized internationally as an expert in strategic planning and technology management, the 55-year-old professor has served as a consultant to leading American and foreign companies and governments. **********In 26 years at Tuck, he has designed courses in business policy, technology management and entrepreneurship, and still teaches three courses in both the fall and winter terms. For years, he has warned students about ''birdwatching'' - preparing, that is, for his ''blue eagles,'' or suprise examinations. Last semester, students in his second-year business policy class presented their mentor with ''a baby blue eaglet'' - actually, a parakeet. **********Professor Quinn, a soft-spoken man identified on campus by his perpetual bow tie, played along. He took the bird home, named it ''Stockman'' and dubbed his study the ''Office of the Management and the Budgie.'' His wife, he says, talks of acquiring a second parakeet - to ''narrow the budgie gap.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/07/world/2500-homes-won-in-cairo.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 45, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2,500 Homes Won in Cairo", "print_headline": "2,500 Homes Won in Cairo", "body_text": " **********About 2,500 young, newly married couples won new homes today in a raffle organized by the Egyptian Government.

More than 140 countries are broadcasting a total of 25,000 hours a day on the high-frequency wave bands, compared with only 62 countries broadcasting a total of 5,000 hours a day in 1950, according to Telecommunications Union figures. **********''The existing situation is far from satisfactory,'' Richard E. Butler, the secretary general of the Telecommunications Union, said at the opening session of the conference, urging delegates to put aside political differences and try to ''harmonize initially differing views.''  Political Implications Noted **********''Although technical, the issues we are discussing have potentially serious political implications,'' the United States representative, Leonard H. Marks, who heads a 44-member delegation, said in an interview. **********The United States and the Soviet Union, which sent 24 officials to the opening ceremony, were elected conference vice presidents at today's opening session. **********Third world nations attending the conference have already introduced a number of resolutions criticizing the present largely voluntary system for sharing the airwaves, which they say favors the richer industrial countries. **********Instead, they want a strict new planning system that would allocate each country a fixed part of the high-frequency spectrum under the control of the Telecommunications Union, in which they form a majority. **********This demand for a bigger share of the world's airwaves forms part of the ''new world information and communication order'' that third world countries are pressing for in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as well as the Telecommunications Union and other United Nations bodies concerned with communications.   Plan Called Unworkable **********Their aim is to reduce Western dominance of international communications and establish the right of governments to control the news outlets.  Western delegates say they are anxious to help third world countries broadcast more effectively by improving the present voluntary airwave allocation system, particularly through the use of computers to select the best frequencies for individual users. But they oppose as unworkable calls for a rigid long-term allocation of airwaves by the Telecommunications Union. **********''Every effort to do this has broken down in disagreement since the end of the Second World War,'' Mr. Marks commented. **********Complicating the task of organizing access to the airwaves, delegates say, is the increasing use of ''jamming'' by Soviet bloc countries and some third world nations to prevent their citizens from hearing foreign broadcasts. **********Western nations that believe free access to information is a basic human right say they are entitled to switch to any usable frequency to get their message across if another country jams their broadcasts, even though doing so may upset international efforts to share out the wave lengths.   Dutch Introduce Resolution **********The Netherlands, which complains that Suriname, its former South American colony, is now blocking its broadcasts, has introduced a resolution condemning interference with radio communications and asserting every country's right to get round jamming by changing frequencies at will. **********At the last World Administrative Radio Conference four years ago, member countries of the Telecommunications Union agreed to increase the amount of the radio spectrum allocated to high-frequency broadcasting. But parts of the high-frequency range are virtually unusable at some times of the day, while reception everywhere has deteriorated.  Meanwhile, broadcasting authorities are using increasingly powerful transmitters to make themselves heard, squeezing out new broadcasters in the developing world, Telecommunications Union officials say. **********At present, high-frequency radio waves are allocated on a voluntary basis every four months by the Telecommunications Union, which collects members' broadcasting plans, pinpoints likely areas of overcrowding in the spectrum and then suggests alternative frequency choices. Individual countries are not bound to adopt these.   New Ways Pressed by U.S. **********As a result, Telecommunications Union officials say, the Western industrialized countries and the Soviet Union, which began high frequency broadcasting first, cannot be dislodged from the large section of the spectrum they have occupied. **********Western radio experts say the long- term answer to overcrowding in the high-frequency radio spectrum lies in the so-called ''single sidebar'' technique, which squeezes many more broadcasters into the same part of the wave band than at present. But this is expensive, requiring new transmitters and receivers. **********In the meantime, the United States, with backing from other Western countries, is proposing a number of new technical ways of making the present voluntary allocation system work more effectively, notably by the use of computers to make quick identification of promising parts of the spectrum for broadcasters to use."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/10/business/l-pay-checks-252012.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 377, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pay Checks", "print_headline": "Pay Checks", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********The article by Michael Jensen and Kevin Murphy (''The Flap Over Executive Pay,'' Business Forum, May 20) must surely rank as one of the more naive analyses of why corporate executives are paid so much.

What they neglect to mention is that the elections of these boards are, for the most part, sham elections since there is rarely any real opposition to management's slate. Indeed, most corporate directors are carefully selected by corporate executives, who want people on their boards who will be sympathetic to their points of view on many matters - hardly the least of which is the matter of how much compensation top corporate officers should receive. There is indeed an old-boy network at work here, and it functions very efficiently from the point of view of top corporate executives, many of whom serve on one another's boards. **********To further rationalize the system, corporate management hires specialists to appraise how much compensation corporate executives should receive. These compensation specialists make detailed studies of what other executives are paid and generally recommend rather high salaries and other perks for top corporate officers. Should we really be surprised that they come to this conclusion when they are, in fact, hired to produce exactly that result? In fact, if these compensation specialists were to come in with low figures, the likelihood is very great that they would not be invited back to make similar studies in future years, which would, of course, adversely affect their livelihoods. **********The marketplace is not determining what top corporate executives are paid, but rather a system that enables those at the top to take care of themselves very well.

But shares of some of the nation's largest carriers sagged this week to their lowest prices in 12 months or longer. **********So far this year, railroad issues have lagged far behind even the general market's disappointing performance. As of July 18, Standard & Poor's railroad group fell 22.6 percent, compared with a decline of 8.2 percent for its 500-stock index. **********Why are rail issues acting so poorly? **********''It's a paradox,'' Stephen R. Klein, rail analyst for Standard & Poor's, said yesterday. ''Perhaps people have a tendency to sell on good news nowadays. Because of this indiscriminate selling, however, I believe that rail stocks are very close to a bottom.'' **********He continued, ''Issues that appear attractive at these price levels include Burlington Northern, CSX Corporation, Norfolk Southern and Santa Fe Southern Pacific.'' **********In yesterday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, most rail issues showed fractional gains. **********Union Pacific is another stock that registered a 12-month low this week. Mr. Klein is not so favorably inclined toward Union Pacific, he said, ''because I'm cool on energy.'' Oil and gas are major profit contributors at Union Pacific. **********Richard Fischer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, carries an ''O.K. to buy'' opinion on all five stocks for the intermediate term (up to one year). In addition, he rates both CSX and Union Pacific as outright ''buys'' for the long pull.  Robert D. Long, who follows railroads for the First Boston Corporation, has expressed a view for some time that ''rail stocks represent excellent value in the current market.'' His favorite, he said yesterday, is Santa Fe Southern Pacific. ''Directors recently approved a repurchase program of 10 million shares, and that limits the downside risk in the stock,'' he said. **********In relation to the rest of the stock market, Mr. Long added, railroads have fallen to their lowest level in several years. ''Fundamentals are no problem for this industry,'' he said. ''Declines in railroad stock prices simply mean that many investors don't want to own cyclical issues.'' **********Moreover, specific factors are seen as affecting individual railroad stocks. CSX and Norfolk Southern are characterized by analysts as ''Eastern coal railroads.'' Coal shipments have increased because of the specter of a strike by coal miners, so recent strong railroad profits may represent borrowing from the future. **********Robert B. Claytor, chairman and chief executive officer of Norfolk Southern, alluded to this factor Tuesday in announcing a second-quarter earnings gain of 42.4 percent from a year earlier. ''Some of the increased coal revenues,'' he said, ''undoubtedly reflect stockpiling in anticipation of a possible coal miners' strike in the fall.'' **********One negative factor at Burlington Northern, some analysts say, is the competition the road faces, starting in August, from a rival coal carrier in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. As a result, some analysts expect the company to show flat, or possibly a bit lower, earnings next year. **********But Mr. Long of First Boston disagrees with such a forecast. ''I expect Burlington to earn $7 a share this year and $7.50 in 1985,'' he said. **********Earlier this year, in appraising rail stock performance, Mr. Fischer of Merrill Lynch noted that the entire group, led by companies rich in natural resources, ''recorded very favorable relative price action'' in 1979 and 1980 when energy stocks were climbing. In 1981 and the first half of 1982, stocks of most ''pure'' railroads continued to advance while the ''resource'' railway companies generally declined.  ''During the second half of 1982 and for three quarters of 1983,'' Mr. Fischer said, ''the rail group again substantially outperformed the market.'' Over that extended period, railroads benefited greatly from legislative and regulatory changes that increased the industry's operating freedom while improving its financial condition, according to the analyst. **********One odd facet of the present railroad picture is this: The Penn Central Corporation, which made history by going bankrupt as a railroad system, has been making impressive gains in the stock market. It rose one point yesterday, to 46 7/8. Penn Central, now widely diversified in several industries, indicated this week that it would buy back about 25 percent of its outstanding common stock under terms of a recent repurchase offer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/07/business/enstar-proxy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Enstar Proxy", "print_headline": "Enstar Proxy", "body_text": " **********The Enstar Corporation said that a dissident shareholder, Roy M.

Araskog, son of a Fergus Falls, Minn., dairy farmer, took over the reins of ITT, the telecommunications giant whose electronic wires span the globe. Mr. Araskog had the tough job of succeeding Harold Geneen, the legendary conglomerate builder who molded ITT into a $21 billion behemoth. But what Mr. Geneen brought together, Mr. Araskog has torn asunder, creating a trimmer, yet still troubled, ITT **********In his tenure as ITT's chairman and chief executive, Mr. Araskog has lopped off more than 65 companies and raised some $1.2 billion in the process, substantially cut ITT's ballooning debt and simplified ITT's unwieldy bureaucracy. For this, he has received high marks. But Wall Street eagerly awaits Mr. Araskog's next act. And, ITT's poor showing in the stock market is a measure of a widespread belief that not much else is waiting in the wings. **********''This is no time for Araskog to rest on his laurels,'' said Harry Edelson, a technology analyst with the First Boston Corporation. ''He's got to do something from here on out. It's time for the company to be reinvigorated. He's sold the cats and dogs. Let's get into the horses.'' Added Brian R. Fernandez, an analyst with Nomura Securities, ''To get a real spark of renewed investor interest, you need either a divestiture or operations will have to turn around.'' **********But ITT is so huge that Mr. Araskog's next move will have to be a stunner to have any impact. He sits at the pinnacle of an empire that resembles a Hollywood version of the multinational mega-corporation. ITT is the king of telecommunications overseas and is just beginning to break into the American market, newly opened to all comers after the A.T.& T. divestiture. Its insurance and information operations include the Hartford Insurance Group and the electronic mail system used by the White House. And it has a grab bag of other diverse businesses including Rayonier forest products, Sheraton hotels, Scott lawn products and the Continental Baking Company, maker of Wonder Bread and Hostess Twinkies. **********ITT is a sleek corporate world where Mr. Araskog jets to meetings h Brussels, London, Washington and New York in a turquoise-and-white 12-passenger Gulfstream III. He meets monthly with his 80 senior lieutenants in a corporate board room of microphones and maps, a setting that looks like everyone's fantasy of a Pentagon war room. Yet behind this facade of high-stakes finance is a company burdened by problems in many important lines of its business. Mr. Araskog refused to be interviewed for this article, but analysts and others familiar with his sprawling domain were, for the most part, critical and impatient with ITT's lumbering progress of late. **********THE company's much-heralded foray into the wild and woolly American electronics market has been characterized as tepid, at best. The strong dollar continues to push down ITT's earnings from abroad, the source of over half its pre-tax income. Storm-related losses - some $15 million from one East Coast storm last March alone - have battered the Hartford Group, ITT's single biggest income source. And, many of its businesses are only marginally profitable: Pretax profit margins in 1983 plunged to 1.3 percent for insurance, were a scant 4.2 percent for hotels and 4.5 percent for bakery operations, and even its core telecommunications business returned only 7.8 percent. **********All the while, Wall Street continues to clamor for ITT to sell even more low-performing businesses in order to raise the cash to further pay down its still-sizable debt and to fund its brighter prospects. In the 1984 first quarter, ITT's earnings fell to 52 cents a share, from 92 cents in the previous first quarter. Analysts have recently been lowering ITT's 1984 earnings estimates to less than the $4.50 that ITT earned in 1983 on sales of $20.2 billion. ''I've described ITT to my clients as either a permanent mediocrity or a turnaround that won't happen,'' said one analyst, who declined to be named. ''On paper, they seem to have a lot of strengths. But those strengths don't seem to pay off.'' **********ITT has made much ado lately about cracking the American telecommunications market, which accounts for about 40 percent of the world market. American telecommunications is the promised land for ITT - it feels it can parlay its overseas expertise in making telephone switching equipment and office switchboards onto American soil. But, to date, ITT has barely gotten its foot in the door.  Most of its domestic sales have been in basic telephones, some 5 million or 20 percent of the market, in 1983 alone. At the high ticket end of the market, its products are few - and dated - and many analysts say that ITT hasn't shown much appetite for competitive battles. Instead, aggressive competitors like Canada's Northern Telecom and Western Electric have left ITT in the dust in critical product areas. **********''ITT is a company that's blown more telecommunications opportunities in the last 10 years than any other company,'' said Harry Newton, president of Telecom Library Inc., a telecommunications research group. ''ITT has faced the same opportunities that hundreds of newcomers have faced in this industry. But ITT has not had the resources or management focus or attention or discipline to do anything.'' **********The company has done poorly in the $3 billion-a-year market for new central office switching systems used by phone companies. It spent over $1 billion to develop its new digital switching product, the 1240, a state-of-the- art entry that has been rolling up sales overseas. But ITT must still pump millions more into the 1240 to adapt it for the American market and the product may not even be available here until 1986. ITT's domestic version, the 1210, is considered the Cadillac of the industry here, but is so expensive that it has fared badly in the face of aggressive competition. In the market for PBX's, automated switchboards critical to the offices of the future, ITT offers only a single low- end product that must do battle in the most competitive end of this market, also estimated to be in the $3 billion range. **********''They've not done well in the central office market or in PBX's, which is the fastest-growing market,'' said William Ambrose, an analyst with Northern Business Information, a research group. ''They offer products of old design and they haven't been quick to react. There going to have to come up with some new products soon or they'll be in big trouble.'' **********MANY of ITT's woes can be traced to its legacy as a supplier to governments and not a marketer to end users. ITT's telecommunications sales overseas have been largely to government agencies. As a result, ITT is well schooled in the ways of wooing governments, but not in facing stiff rivals in wide-open markets. And ITT is being forced to develop these new skills in one of the most turbulent areas of American business. ''They've never had to position themselves in this market and they've never had to face this intense competition,'' said Robert Sullivan, an analyst with Paine Webber. Added Mr. Ambrose: ''They've never had to understand what the end user wanted. They had to understand what the governments wanted and then engineer it to those standards.'' **********ITT, however, shrugs off such remarks. ''There's no reason to believe we won't do well in the American market,'' said M. Cabell Woodward Jr., chief financial officer of ITT ''We've only been up and operating here for a short time, but our worldwide telecommunicatons effort is going well and I would be suprised if we didn't do well here.'' Mr. Woodward pointed to a few recently placed orders - a $150 million sale to United Telephone of Florida of a 1240 system and sales of other equipment to four of the seven Bell operating companies - as evidence of ITT's success. **********ITT is also moving into computers, where it faces many problems as well. The company has gotten low marks for its highly advertised entry into personal computers, the ITT XTRA, an I.B.M.-compatible machine that has been dubbed just another ''me-too'' product in an already crowded field. Tough competition has already forced ITT to slash prices of the XTRA by 20 percent - even before shipping it to stores. ''ITT will have a battle royal on its hands and there's no telling whether they will win,'' said Ulric Weil, a technology analyst with Morgan Stanley. ''This is not the best of times to be a new entry and it is still a fairly hostile environment for I.B.M.-compatible PC's. There are some 50 companies making them and ITT will be going against the likes of A.T.& T., Sperry and I.B.M. The fact that ITT has had to cut prices already shows how treacherous these waters are.'' **********But if Mr. Araskog is having to wade through treacherous waters outside his doors, he's been successful in calming the internal storms left by Mr. Geneen. The lanky Mr. Araskog is widely described as a mild- mannered man of military bearing - in contrast to Mr. Geneen who had the reputation of an overbearing autocrat who ruled through intimidation. Mr. Araskog has gone a long way toward reshaping the culture of a global corporation that carried the personal imprint of Mr. Geneen, for good or bad. In the Geneen era, the company gained notoriety for its political involvement: The famed memo of ITT lobbyist Dita Beard that reportedly implied that Mr. Geneen had used his pocketbook to influence the Nixon White House and Mr. Geneen's attempt to work with intelligence agencies to overthrow the government of Salvador Allende in Chile. **********To the relief of many employees, Mr. Araskog has done away with such Geneen trademarks as the huge corporate meetings in which employees were dressed down in front of the group. Mr. Araskog has also reorganized ITT's hundreds of businesses into four main divisions - corporations in their own right - and has decentralized decision-making and pushed it down into the operating level. He has made ITT more efficient, if a little duller. **********''Instead of a razzamatazz conglomerate doing a deal a minute and having the financial people pirouetting, the atmosphere of ITT is one of a tighter, more traditional business organization,'' said Mr. Fernandez. ''It's less based on star magnetism and more on back to basics. To the outside, the culture used to be one of working 18 hours a day and having an answer to every question. It almost appeared as if internal performance was as important, if not more important, than business acheivement. Araskog reorganized all that and brought the company to a more normal form.'' **********FROM the beginning, Mr. Araskog tried to set a different tone and worked to shrink a corporation that had become overblown in the days of cheap money and conglomerate building. In his first major decision, Mr. Araskog stopped construction of an ill-fated mill by Rayonier and accepted a $320 million write-off. Then, he sold a European foods business and a domestic telecommunications business that had been tied to poor contracts, restructured a troubled Florida condominium development, and backed the company out of coal operations. All totaled, the 65 companies divested by Mr. Araskog had combined sales of more than $2 billion, which accounts at least partly for ITT's drop in sales. **********Mr. Araskog also had to stand by and watch ITT be manhandled by the French, who decided to nationalize ITT's French operations and give the company only $50 million for properties that had been independently appraised by Merrill Lynch at $360 million. ITT has also been selling portions of other overseas investments to local investors, most recently 65 percent of its United Kingdom operations and 20 percent of its Norwegian businesses. **********Sales of ITT's more esoteric - or underperforming - businesses have provided it with much-needed cash to finance its core businesses and slice its still-heavy debt burden. ITT has cut its debt from 42 percent of total capitalization at the end of 1979 to about 38.5 percent today. Analysts, however, contend that ITT still has a long way to go and that it may be mortgaging its future if it doesn't start pulling in more cash through divestitures. **********They point out that ITT's investments in its own businesses have fallen from $1 billion in 1981 to about $825 million in 1983, while its research and development costs have remained steady at $1 billion. They note that the company's long-term debt is still a hefty $4 billion and that it owes about $1.4 billion in short-term borrowings. Since ITT's tax bill is substantially reduced by investments in tax shelters, the carrying costs on this debt hit heavily on the bottom line. And, ITT's cash position has steadily fallen over the last three years, from $143 million in 1981 to $118 million in 1983. ''Araskog is facing some difficult strategic choices,'' said Normura's Mr. Fernandez. ''At the present time, he has too many areas of opportunity to fund and he doesn't want to starve some growth companies. He's going to have to make some difficult choices.'' **********Mr. Araskog has already fumbled the ball at least once and many wonder whether he is even going to try to get to bat again. He tried to sell the Rayonier forest products division in late 1982. But, after getting a bid for the company, Mr. Araskog decided to put Rayonier on the auction bloc to see if he could get a better price. While investment bankers and lawyers spent valuable time tinkering with their calculators, timber prices collapsed, interest rates zoomed and the chance to do the deal died. Since then, Mr. Araskog has not made any other major sales, although ITT's Mr. Woodward contends the divestiture program is coming along quite smartly. ''All I can tell you is that we are committed to divesture and hope to have more completed by the end of the year,'' he said, while declining to say exactly what would be up for sale. The company has hinted that it may have a major announcement - perhaps along these lines - later this month. **********Wall Street would like to see some major sales - Sheraton, Continental Baking, some of the auto parts companies and Rayonier. ''Earnings in some of these cyclical companies are peaking. If he's going to do it, now is the time,'' said Mr. Edelson of First Boston. ''It's reasonable to sell some of the larger businesses, now that the smaller ones are gone.'' And many cannot understand why Mr. Araskog is not exhibiting his earlier toughness - whether he is, once again, waiting too long for the top dollar to arrive or whether he has simply lost his will and succumbed to the huge bureaucracy. Much of this concern is reflected in ITT's stock price; while rival A.T.&.T. trades at a multiple of 12, ITT shares are priced at only 8 times earnings. Should Mr. Araskog not make a major sale, ITT is expected to continue to lumber on with lackluster earnings and uninspired profitability. And divestitures may be the only road to salvation. ''It's not only desirable that he sells these businesses,'' said Paine Webber's Mr. Sullivan. ''It's essential.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/11/business/texaco-getty-deal-approved.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 174, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Texaco-Getty Deal Approved", "print_headline": "Texaco-Getty Deal Approved", "body_text": " **********The Federal Trade Commission gave final approval to Texaco Inc.'s purchase of the Getty Oil Company for $10.1 billion.

Zimbabwe will have to import, or get in aid, plenty of its staple food, corn, as well as most of the wheat for its cities' bread-eaters. **********But as the beginning of the rainy season raises slight hopes for an end to the drought and a normal growing season for 1984-85, Zimbabwe can reflect on an accomplishment that sets it apart from the rest of a continent whose farmers every year produce less food for more mouths than in the preceding year. **********'Where We Scored' **********It has weathered three dangerously lean years not only because of the expertise of its 4,400 owners of large, modern commercial farms, a carryover of the white-minority rule that ended in 1980, but also because of a dramatic increase in the productivity of its 800,000 to 900,000 peasant farmers. **********''That's where we scored,'' said Agriculture Minister Denis Norman, himself a successful farmer and president of the Commercial Farmers' Union before he became the only white Cabinet member. **********A bit of good luck helped. A harvest that appeared headed for catastrophe when last winter's rains never came was partially salvaged by an unexpected spring rainfall. A corn harvest that had been estimated at 560,000 tons - about a third of a good year's crop - has yielded 925,000 so far, with more still trickling in, Mr. Norman said in an interview in his Senate office. **********Forty-one percent of this total came from the communal, small-scale farmers, the ebullient Mr. Norman continued, jumping up to fetch a pile of statistics from his briefcase. ''We expected 100,000 tons from them - we've got 378,000 so far,'' he said. ''It will reach 400,000.''  A Beacon of Realism **********On a continent over which recurrent droughts, the spreading of its great deserts and population growth unmatched by increases in food production have cast a pervasive sense of helplessness and hopelessness, Zimbabwe is a beacon of buoyancy and realism. **********Unlike most African leaderships, the Government of Prime Minister Robert Mugable did not hide the facts of drought and the threat of famine from its people and the world at large. It cooperates with the governments and private organizations that provide relief, but has not abandoned to outsiders its task of helping those affected by drought. **********''We have a lot of external aid, but we put the program together ourselves,'' Mr. Norman said. ''When you have a viable program it's easy to get the money.'' **********What the official described was a program that African governments shorter on political will, administrative efficiency and functioning public services have been unable to conceive or afford to put into effect.   Food for Work **********''We had a fairly wealthy stock in hand when drought started,'' Mr. Norman said. ''What we did was first a food-relief program for the outlying regions - the farther you are from the center, the worse things were. We distributed free food, then we changed food for work - roads, wells, all things that will help produce more food. **********''For two years running,'' he said, ''we have been distributing packages of seeds, fertilizer and other chemicals and minimal tools - the requirements to grow another crop for the man who had nothing left. This covered 140,000 families. **********''This solves many problems. Above all, it restores a man's self-respect. He provides for himself and his family. No apathy.'' **********''I don't think we had famine anywhere,'' Mr. Norman went on. ''We had a bit of malnutrition here and there.'' **********This view is shared by international relief workers and diplomatic specialists here, with the reservation that the Government seemed less ready to send timely relief to Matabeleland in the south, where Mr. Mugabe's opponents are in armed resistance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/16/business/advertising-addendum.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 26, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Addendum", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Addendum", "body_text": " *********** Taylor & Silverman Communications, public relations, has split into Silverman, Warren/Kremer at 2 Park Avenue and Alan Taylor Communications at 322 Eighth Avenue."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/10/business/phone-installation-backlog-grows-16.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1984-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 993, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PHONE INSTALLATION BACKLOG GROWS 16%", "print_headline": "PHONE INSTALLATION BACKLOG GROWS 16%", "body_text": " **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said yesterday that, despite emergency efforts to relieve a huge backlog in phone installations for businesses, unfilled orders grew more than 16 percent last month. **********The company, in a monthly report to the Federal Communications Commission that seemed to confirm widespread reports of worsening telephone service, said that by the end of June it had 41,700 unfilled orders nationwide for private lines, up from 35,800 in May.

And for the first time, one of the five members of the Federal Communications Commission suggested that Government intervention could be necessary. **********The commissioner, Henry M. Rivera, said in a statement: ''In view of this continuing business service deterioration, we must now begin seriously to consider whether a regulatory response is needed to avoid the dire consequences that may lie ahead. Our legislative mandate requires no less.'' **********An Active Role Suggested **********Mr. Rivera, who was traveling in Switzerland yesterday and was unavailable to answer questions, suggested in his statement that the commission take ''an active coordination role'' in reducing the backlog. **********He also hinted that the F.C.C. might have permitted deregulation to go too far, and he urged that the commission consider requiring the ''industry to focus on providing reliable, high-quality basic service before permitting nontraditional business opportunities.'' **********But Mr. Rivera's statement did not specify what actions the commission should take. In addition it is unclear what jurisdiction the commission has over the company's nontelephone-related services. **********Industry analysts and F.C.C. staff members said yesterday that they doubted that Mr. Rivera - one of two Democrats on the Republican-controlled commission - would persuade the other members to intervene strongly in what some termed a ''service crisis.'' **********Comment by F.C.C. Official **********''We have a healthy understanding of our limitations, and I have no reason to believe the Government can do it any better,'' said Michael Slomin, legal assistant to the head of the F.C.C.'s Common Carrier Bureau, which oversees long-distance service. **********He said that ''the problem is a people problem - information is still not being passed correctly'' between A.T.&T. and the operating companies, each of which is now involved in different aspects of installing new private lines, or repairing existing installations. **********Mr. Slomin and others noted that the commission had stepped up the pressure on A.T.&T., asking for more detailed information about its performance and warning of possible action if it failed to resolve some basic issues - such as agreement on a single ordering form to be used nationwide for companies seeking service. **********Deadlock Broken by Staff **********F.C.C. officials say the details of such a form were agreed upon only after commission staff members threatened to draft it themselves to break a deadlock among the operating companies and A.T.&T. **********Although the problems for private line service worsened, A.T.&T. said yesterday that the percentage of orders completed on time for WATS service, including the installation of new toll-free 800 numbers, improved in June. And Donald F. McLaughlin, an A.T.&T. spokesman in New York, said that the number of private-line orders actually filled last month was 15,800, about 1,100 more than in May. **********He added that the A.T.&T. ''strike force,'' recently assembled to coordinate efforts to reduce the backlog, had made agreements among the various operating companies integrating their order-taking operations with A.T.&T.'s. **********Bigger Program for Users Separately, A.T.&T. said it was expanding its ''Opportunity Calling'' program, in which long-distance users get discounts on goods and services in proportion to their telephone expenditures, so that businesses may also receve benefits. Among the incentives for businesses to use A.T.&T. instead of a long-distance rival, the company said, would be discounts on air courier services and office equipment. **********In another action, the Conrac Corportation said it had reached a settlement with A.T.&.T. and the operating companies over a civil antitrust lawsuit filed in April 1982. Conrac said it would receive $24 million in payments over the next six years. **********Dispute Over Assets **********WASHINGTON, July 9 (AP) - The American Telephone and Telegraph Company has disclosed that it is locked in a dispute with its former Bell System subsidiaries over conflicting claims to assets totaling more than $3 billion. **********A.T.&T. has filed a 46-page ''motion for declaratory ruling'' here with United States District Judge Harold H. Greene. In the motion, A.T.&T. says the seven regional Bell companies created with its Jan. 1 breakup are demanding payments totaling $3 billion. The claims were submitted, A.T.&T. added, after it filed a claim of its own requesting payments from the Bell companies totaling roughly $659 million. **********Both claims are based on the complex reorganization plan used six months ago to divide the assets and debts of the companies. **********According to A.T.&T.'s brief on the dispute, however, the seven regional companies that were spun off Jan. 1 are ignoring the reorganization plan approved by Judge Greene by trying to reopen the entire question of the assets to which they were entitled at the time of the breakup. **********Those companies, in a joint filing of their own, countered that their claims were based on the fact that A.T.&T. had failed to share any of a $5 billion working capital fund with them at the time of the breakup."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/04/business/building-spending-is-up-1.7.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 341, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Building Spending Is Up 1.7%", "print_headline": "Building Spending Is Up 1.7%", "body_text": " **********Construction spending rose in October for the first time in five months, climbing 1.7 percent, the Commerce Department said today. **********Total construction spending increased to an annual rate of $315.8 billion, the department said.

It was the fifth such meeting of the six-member group of oil- producing nations, known collectively as the Gulf Cooperation Council. **********Sheik Sabah, who spoke at a news conference, provided few details about the group's new military cooperation effort. But he said the force would include all six member nations - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman - and would have a unified command. He also suggested that it would not be a permanent standing force. **********'A Limited Period' **********''It will have a mandate for a limited period of time,'' Sheik Sabah, said. The mandate will be reviewed periodically, he added. **********Shiek Sabah stressed that the new force would not be used to counter internal subversion in one of the gulf nations, but rather would be used to thwart an ill-defined ''emergency that threatens any gulf state.'' **********He declined to specify whether the force would be based in one location, how many troops would be involved or which nation would command it. **********But other officials said each member nation had agreed to earmark several units that would be activated only for joint military training exercises and in the event of a threat to a Gulf Cooperation Council nation. **********The emergency force will number 10,000 to 13,000 troops, the officials said. It will be commanded by a Saudi general who was recently assigned to the council's secretariat.   Goal: To Deter Aggression **********Abdullah Yaqub Bishara, Secretary General of the Gulf Cooperation Council, said the force was intended to help deter aggression against gulf nations. **********''It's a symbolic expression,'' he told reporters after the meeting ended. **********Several officials said the creation of the force was a tentative, but natural, step in the council's effort to improve military cooperation and coordination. This effort has been stimulated, they said, by the threat posed by the Iran- Iraq war, now in its fifth year. **********The conservative gulf nations have been particularly concerned about terrorist threats and possible military aggression by the radical Shiite Moslem regime in Iran. The Gulf Cooperation Council nations, although professing neutrality, have supported Iraq in the protracted conflict. **********Some officials said the force fell short of the kind of standing military unit that some had sought but that others, they acknowledged, had feared.   No Mention of Air Defense **********Sheik Sabah made no mention of a plan to provide a coordinated air-defense system for the gulf. Asked tonight whether the emergency force would be able to protect shipping, he replied, ''We are not one of the superpowers.'' **********Diplomats and Gulf Cooperation Council officials said political differences among member nations and technical incompatibilities in their defense systems continued to hamper military coordination. **********Last summer, for example, when stepped-up fighting between Iran and Iraq threatened gulf shipping, the United States offered Kuwait computer equipment that would give the country instant access to data collected by Saudi Arabia's American-supplied Awacs radar planes. But Kuwait has been unable to work out a satisfactory arrangement on the proposed data- sharing with the Saudis, diplomats here said. **********The conference's focus was also far narrower than many of the group's activists had desired. The meeting did not officially discuss, as Egypt had hoped, growing sentiment in the region for Arab nations to follow Jordan's lead and restore diplomatic ties with Cairo. Diplomats said Saudi Arabia, the council's most powerful member, strongly objected to placing the issue on the meeting's agenda. **********Although the council appealed for an end to the Iran-Iraq war and called on Iran to submit to mediation, it stressed that the gulf nations would not launch a new initiative unless there was some signal from Iran that it would be receptive to their mediation.   Indirect Backing for Arafat **********The council did provide an indirect endorsement to Yasir Arafat and his faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which ended its National Council meeting tonight in Amman, Jordan. The council repeated its support for the ''legality of the P.L.O. as the sole legal representative of the Palestinian people.'' Syria had denounced Mr. Arafat and charged that the Amman assembly was illegal. **********In his farewell address tonight, Sultan Qaboos bin-Said, leader of Oman, hinted at the disappointment some gulf activists felt about the tentative steps taken by this year's meeting. He acknowledged that the council's achievements might appear ''modest in comparison to our expectations.'' **********But he and other gulf leaders maintained that since its creation four years ago in Abu Dhabi, the Gulf Cooperation Council had evolved into a more cohesive group and was now one of the few Arab forums that is not paralyzed by bitter internal feuds. **********Last year, council officials held 65 ministerial-level meetings on political, economic and military cooperation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/20/world/a-rare-quake-shakes-britain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 255, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A RARE QUAKE SHAKES BRITAIN", "print_headline": "A RARE QUAKE SHAKES BRITAIN", "body_text": " **********The most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Britain shook buildings, toppled chimney pots and rattled the breakfast teacups today in western Britain and along the east coast of Ireland. **********Ambulance crews reported that a 64- year-old woman injured her back when she fell down stairs at Weston-super- Mare on the Bristol Channel. **********Two women were treated for shock in Liverpool when a chimney pot crashed through their roof. **********Earthquakes are rare in Britain.

R. Ewing flashes his villainous smile. On ABC's ''Dynasty,'' the oil- industry wheeler-dealer Alexis Carrington is vengeful and destructive. **********In Sidney Sheldon's long-time best- seller, the novel ''Master of the Game,'' the main character, Kate Blackwell, is a ruthless conglomerate tycoon. **********Fictional ''bad guy'' business executives are smirking, scheming, cheating and conniving their way across the nation's television screens and the pages of its novels. **********It's become a familiar theme in the long fictional and dramatic history of America - a country that, ironically, was built largely by the efforts of hard-driving capitalists but at the same time lionizes the working-class hero, the fellow who often finds himself in conflict with just such a capitalist. **********But these bad-guys capitalists seem to go over fine with the public: ''Dallas's'' ratings have been stratospheric, and so have the sales of ''Master of the Game.'' Its paperback publisher, Warner Books, has printed more than 4.3 million copies. **********Yet the bad guys have been drawing boos and grumbles from real-life business people - mostly concerned about prime-time network television shows, and much less about novels. Bernard J. O'Keefe, chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers' executive committee, complains that when the networks create fictional business folk, ''they are either crooks or greedy or people who shout all the time.'' **********Mr. O'Keefe - he's also chairman of E.G.& G. Inc., a Wellesley, Mass.- based high-technology company with sales of $1 billion a year - argues that ''having a hard-working, unexciting businessman'' or police officer or whatever as a fictional television character ''doesn't sell advertising, and so most of us are caricatured for that reason.'' **********The beef at the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, as Thomas J. Donohue, group vice president, puts it, is that ''there is a tendency in entertainment television to depict many business people as wealthy, unscrupulous and succeeding through less-than-honorable dealings. This is totally incorrect.'' **********But network executives contend that such peeves ignore some basic considerations of their art. ''The viewing public,'' says Alice M. Henderson, a CBS Broadcast Group vice president, ''is a lot more intelligent than some of those people give it credit for being.'' **********Mrs. Henderson, vice president for program practices, says ''the primary function of prime-time fictional television is to entertain.'' Much of the programming being complained about, she contends, ''has done just that - it has entertained people. It's not meant to be a view of business people in real life.'' **********At ABC, Alan Wurtzel says: ''Television tends to deal with larger-than- life situations. With television, as with any dramatic form, there is very rarely a depiction of the day-to-day life of any profession, be it doctor, lawyer or businessman.'' The day-to-day truth, says Mr. Wurtzel, vice president of broadcast standards and practices for ABC television on the East Coast, is that ''the vast majority of businessmen - network executives included, I might add - pay their bills and operate in a highly ethical and appropriate fashion.'' And anyway, he says, ''I don't think that businessmen are all depicted unfavorably'' in fictional television. **********At NBC, M. S. Rukeyser Jr., executive vice president for public information, says catcalls about fictional television characters don't come only from the business world. ''It's probably true that no group likes the way it's portrayed on television or, in fact, in any other part of the media,'' he says. ''The goals of a special interest group, which by definition are special and positive, are often at odds with how that group sees itself portrayed on television, and particularly in entertainment programming.'' **********Conversely, Leonard S. Matthews, president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, says businessmen aren't alone in suffering at fiction-writers' hands. ''The writer who sits down to entertain and communicate fast finds his job made much easier if he stereotypes people,'' he says. ''I don't think it's so much a matter of malice as it is that the writer is giving the viewers what they expect, so to speak.'' **********BE that as it may, some scholars have systematically studied fictional depictions of American business people - and have found that those portraits bear more than their share of warts. At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, for instance, Prof. Emily Stipes Watts of the English department has concluded that since 1945, ''most businessmen depicted in television and serious literature are characterized as greedy, unethical and immoral (or amoral).'' **********At the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communications, researchers have catalogued more than 2,000 fictional business people shown on prime-time network television in the past eight years. The school's dean, George Gerbner, reports that one in three of the characters is a ''bad guy'' - which, he says, is a much more negative ratio than the bad-guy ratio for doctors (1 in 13) or police officers (1 in 29). **********Other analysts, crunching different sets of numbers, have decided that prime-time television's presentation of fictional business people is even wartier. In a 1982 article in the journal ''Public Opinion,'' Linda S. Lichter, S. Robert Lichter and Stanley Rothman reported that ''the struggle between good and evil dominates television, and businessmen come down squarely on the side of the bad guys.'' **********The three analysts reported that, of the fictional TV business folk they studied, ''60 percent were portrayed negatively, compared to only 28 percent who were depicted positively.'' They concluded that ''if American business has redeeming social values, they rarely turn up on prime- time television. Rather, businessmen are cast as evil and selfish, social parasites.'' **********Drawing on such findings, Herbert Schmertz, the Mobil Corporation's vice president for public affairs, asked a rhetorical question in a speech last January: ''Who are the worst crooks of all on TV after professional gangsters?'' **********''You're looking at one: the businessman,'' he declared. ''Not every crook on TV has an occupation that can be identified, but of those who do, the largest single group,'' he said, is business people. And he suggested that exporting American television's ''crazy-crooked-businessmen shows'' helps fan foreign suspicions ''of American institutions, particularly the multinational corporations.'' **********A similar though milder view comes from George L. Ball, president of Prudential-Bache: ''There have certainly been relatively few pieces of modern fiction or drama'' on television or film ''that I've seen in the recent past that have had as a sympathetic protagonist'' someone from the American business world. **********Such rumbles and grumbles don't come only from Big Business and Big Finance. John E. Sloan Jr., president of the National Federation of Independent Business - an organization of more than 500,000 small- and independent-business owners - said in a speech in February that in some television entertainment, ''there is no mercy shown to small business.'' **********He singled out three fictional small- business owners spotlighted on CBS television in recent years: Archie Bunker, now no longer first-run network fare, but still widely seen on local stations; George Jefferson, the owner of dry cleaning plants on ''The Jeffersons,'' and Mel, the diner owner on ''Alice.'' **********''Bunker is a bigot,'' Mr. Sloan said, ''Jefferson is a conniver, and Mel, a selfish loudmouth who is hard on his employees. Not exactly models of the small-business people I represent.'' **********That sort of depiction, he said, has helped make business widely suspected, and ''as a result, scores of agencies and thousands of regulations have sprung up, imposing checks on the performance of business.'' **********CBS views its fictional children more fondly. Mrs. Henderson argues that Archie Bunker should not ''truly be labeled a bigot.'' ''He's a person you love to hate,'' she says, but ''I don't think that's a negative portrayal of a small tavern owner.'' **********As for George Jefferson, she says he ''may be a little rough around the edges as to how he deals with people, but he's certainly not at all corrupt. He's genuinely a very good person.'' And Mel, she says, ''cares about his employees as much as he irritates them - that's not portraying him as a negative small-business man.'' **********At ABC, Mr. Wurtzel argues that the character flaws of ''Dynasty's'' vengeful Alexis Carrington are balanced by the sterling qualities of another character, her ex-husband, Blake Carrington, ''a very tough but fair businessman who is not involved in anything unscrupulous.'' **********THIS whole artistic issue, if that's **********what it is, flows out of America's **********cultural and commercial past, with many cross-currents. Professor Watts of the University of Illinois wrote in her 1982 book-length treatise, ''The Businessman in American Literature,'' that ''The capitalist has been attacked for any number of reasons throughout our literary history.'' **********She analyzed the 1885 work that has been dubbed the first American business novel, William Dean Howells's ''The Rise of Silas Lapham.'' And her verdict was that the image of Silas, the businessman and main character, ''is one of greed and grasping miserliness, of unethical business dealings somewhere on the way to financial success, of insensitivity to the needs of employees, of emotional atrophy, and of exploitation.'' **********Another early business novel much pored over by literary historians is Frank Norris's 1903 work, ''The Pit,'' about anarchic speculation in wheat. That book, too, gives a negative view of a hard-driving businessman - and it was a best seller in its day. **********But all is not sourness and gloom, Professor Watts reported in her book. Among the cultural cross-currents she charted was what she called ''a growing tendency among our recent writers to treat the businessman with compassion, understanding, and even admiration.'' She suggested in an interview that recent fiction-writers' portrayals of small-business men have become more favorable. **********And Roger W. Straus Jr., president of the publishing house Farrar, Straus & Giroux, argues that ideological currents have favored fictional business folk in recent decades. He says, ''speaking of the top-of-the-line literary novel,'' in the Depression years, ''certain authors of the Steinbeck-Dos Passos school depicted the business executive as a capitalist heavy, but I don't think that's been so true in contemporary times.'' **********The reason, he believes, is that today's writers find ''the present capitalistic society more compatible'' than writers viewed it in the Depression and early postwar years. **********Winthrop Knowlton, chairman of another publishing house, Harper & Row, singles out John P. Marquand, who died in 1960, as having written perceptive fiction about business people. And he says the writer-lawyer Louis Auchincloss is one fictioneer of today who has an ''understanding of how marvelously rich and tensioned'' office lives can be. **********Mr. Knowlton, who has written some fiction himself, also offers one practical explanation of why fictional portrayals of the business world give its real-life denizens a pain: ''There's a great thinness of knowledge about businesmen on the part of people'' writing fiction, he says, ''because most people who are writing fiction are spending their time writing fiction, they're not going to an office. So what we tend to get is caricatures.'' **********And Prudential-Bache's Mr. Ball says the blame for the unlovely portraits may lie partly ''with those of us in the business community who have probably done too little to talk about some of the things of conscience, some of the things of morality, some of the things of honor that we do.'' **********Mr. Ball also argues that the proper reflex for a business person, when riled by a fictional character, is not a gripe, but a stiff upper lip. **********''People in any business,'' he says, ''bridle at seeing fictional portrayals of people in their line of work that are reputationally adverse. But to carp about it really implies a defensive mentality as opposed to a pride that can override pinpricks. Thus, for us to criticize specific illustrations would be, I think, a form of sniveling.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/06/business/advertising-ohlmeyer-helps-stroh-battle-anheuser-miller.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ohlmeyer Helps Stroh Battle Anheuser, Miller", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Ohlmeyer Helps Stroh Battle Anheuser, Miller", "body_text": " **********The Stroh Brewery in Detroit considers itself a David against two Goliaths named Anheuser-Busch and Miller. **********And in its search for more bang for its bucks, Stroh has retained the services of Ohlmeyer Advertising (nee Parkson Advertising), which has particular strengths in broadcast programming in the sports area. **********According to David C.

Pact with Ex-Sandinista Reported **********Some Latin American specialists said they considered it potentially significant that Mr. Pastora had apparently joined forces with Arturo Jose Cruz, a former Sandinista leader who is now an economist with the Inter- American Development Bank here. **********Opposition leaders in Nicaragua have mentioned Mr. Cruz as a potential candidate, but he has thus far refused to be drawn into active politics or affiliation with any grouping. **********However, Nicaraguan rebel sources in Costa Rica said Mr. Pastora and Mr. Cruz had agreed to join forces to lobby for negotiations between the Sandinistas and their external opposition as well as for participation in elections. And today Mr. Cruz accompanied Mr. Pastora in the meetings on Capitol Hill. **********In addition to Representative Wright, they met with Representative Bill Alexander of Arkansas, who is the chief Democratic deputy whip. The two House leaders were among a group that wrote in mid-March to Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the Nicaraguan leader, to propose ''a fully open and democratic electoral process'' as an alternative to the insurgency.   Pastora Seeks Safety Guarantee **********According to Representative Alexander, Mr. Pastora said today that ''he wants his party to participate in the elections and to be guaranteed safety.'' **********''While Pastora does not say explicitly he will lay down arms, he implies that,'' Representative Alexander said. In the civil war leading to the Sandinista seizure of power in 1979, Mr. Pastora was a guerrilla commander known as Commander Zero.  He served as a Deputy Defense Minister until he broke with the Sandinistas and went into armed rebellion two years ago. **********Representative Alexander said Edward Chamorro, a leader of the rival Nicaraguan rebel group, the Nicaraguan Democratic Front, said last month in Honduras that he also wanted to stop the rebellion and take part in elections. **********''So we have a good beginning and that is the stuff settlements are made of,'' Representative Alexander said. **********Mr. Pastora's efforts, to be discussed at a news conference on Monday, came as the United States completed the first round of talks with Nicaragua, and the Senate joined the House in dropping money for the Nicaraguan insurgents from a spending bill.   Shultz Expects More Fighting **********In a meeting with Washington correspondents of The New York Times, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said that, despite the Congressional refusal to vote more money, he expected the Nicaraguan rebels to go on fighting. He said the United States would give ''moral support'' to their efforts to raise money elsewhere. **********Although he treated the negotiations with the Nicaraguan Government as serious, he gave no indication that he saw evidence of an early breakthrough. **********In a separate development, Roberto d'Aubuisson, the Salvadoran rightist, said at a news conference at the Capitol Hilton Hotel here that he would support an effort by his Government to induce the Salvadoran insurgents to run candidates in elections next year. But he said any talks to share power with the rebels would violate the Constitution. **********''Let the insurgents try to seize power, to share power, in the only permissible fashion, through the ballot box,'' he said. **********Speaking of President Jose Napoleon Duarte's plans to try to arrange for the rebels' participation in local and national assembly elections in 1985, he said, ''If that is what Duarte intends to do, we will support him on this.'' **********Mr. d'Aubuisson, who lost to Mr. Duarte in the presidential election on May 6, held up a map of El Salvador to show that Mr. Duarte had won geographically small, but heavily populated areas, while people in some 85 percent of the country, including guerrilla strongholds, had voted for Mr. d'Aubuisson's party, the National Republican Alliance. **********Mr. d'Aubuisson repeated earlier allegations by members of his party, which is known by the Spanish acronym Arena, that the Central Intelligence Agency and American Embassy officials had aided his rival during the elections. **********Mr. d'Aubuisson also contended that Nicaragua was supplying Salvadoran guerrillas with heavy weapons, including antiaircraft rockets and advanced communications equipment and codes that the Pentagon had been trying unsuccessfully to break. **********Mr. Shultz later said he could not confirm that heavy weapons were moving from Nicaragua into El Salvador and he declined to discuss any code-breaking efforts.

As a result, they added, Iran's oil exports, which had dropped early in the week by a million barrels a day, to about 500,000, will probably jump to about 900,000 barrels. **********Insurance Costs Up **********Oil company sources said the discounts were helping to compensate shipping companies for about $2 a barrel in extra payments to insurers and ships' crews for entering the Kharg Island area, where a spate of attacks on tankers has occurred in recent weeks. **********Shippers and oil experts said Iran's initial $1.50 discount was not enough for many shippers. With a $2.50 discount, the shippers would make at least 50 cents a barrel, or about $1 million, on a large tanker shipment, sources said.  ''The Iranians have reduced the price of oil enough to offset a lot of the costs associated with the hostilities,'' said Douglas Wolcott, vice president of operations at the Chevron Shipping Companies, a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California. **********Two of the large tankers that have headed for Kharg were chartered by the Mitsubishi Corporation, a large Japanese trading company. They are the Atlanticos and the Kypros, with Liberian flags and a Greek owner, said Nobie Nakamura, chief crude oil trader for the Mitsubishi International Corporation in New York. **********He said the two ships together hold four million barrels of crude and that the Atlanticos left Kharg on Thursday. Other sources said the ship was now out of the war zone. **********Other tankers bound for Kharg include the Louisiana and the Alta, both chartered by Boest Alpine of Vienna, and the Canaria, chartered from London by Marc Rich, Mr. Nakamura said. **********The Danish-owned tanker Karoline Maersk was said by other oil industry sources to have headed for Kharg. Oil trading sources also said a Phibro-Salomon trading subsidiary in New York planned to charter a tanker to Kharg. Phibro traders declined to comment. **********Iraq's Pipeline Plans **********As for Iraq, it stepped up plans yesterday to build pipelines to get its oil to world markets. Early in the 44- month-old war, Iran destroyed Iraq's export facilities on the Persian Gulf, so Iraq now can export only about 900,000 barrels a day via a pipeline through Turkey to the Mediterranean Sea. Its exports before the war were more than three million barrels a day. Iraq's new efforts include possible pipelines through Jordan to the Red Sea, and another through Turkey.  John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said that were it not for Iran's actions, Iraq would probably be able to export another million barrels a day, considering the production quotas by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. **********Iraq's oil revenue loss is about $10 billion a year, he said. He noted, however, that Iraq had received about $35 billion in advances from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and others, helping its war effort. **********Senior Iraqi officials have stressed that they will continue to attack all ships trying to load at Kharg.

It came about this way: target companies insisted on guarantees that their shareholders would be paid the promised purchase price if an acquiring company tried to renege on a merger deal. The problem was how to provide such a guarantee without actually putting millions of dollars into an escrow account. The acquiring companies turned to the big money center banks for a solution and the banks, particularly Citibank, offered the ''standby'' letter of credit. **********Under the standby L.C., as it is called, the bank itself promises to pay the guaranteed merger price, come what may. That can be risky, but over the last five years, the loss rate from these standby letters of credit has been less than from commercial loans, according to a recent Federal Reserve study. And the standby letter of credit has caught on, generating millions of dollars in new fees for the banking industry. **********From guaranteeing merger payments, the banks have expanded into all sorts of other guarantees. For example, they are issuing standby letters of credit that guarantee payment for stock purchased by wealthy individuals. And the standby has become a popular guarantee for golden parachute agreements, thus assuring that executives affected by hostile takeovers can actually collect millions of dollars in severance pay. Even a group negotiating to invest in the offspring of a champion thoroughbred, Secretariat, turned to a standby letter of credit to guarantee repayment of their investment if their horse failed to sire any offspring, a problem that did not develop. **********''Anybody who's a beneficiary of a transaction of any kind would be less than prudent if he didn't demand a letter of credit,'' said Robert Feldman, a vice president of Citibank and head of its international trade services. Citibank has handsomely profited from the fees these instruments have generated in recent years. **********Indeed, the dollar value of standby letters of credit issued by commercial banks jumped to $119.6 billion last year from $46.9 billion in 1980, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported. Citibank has the most outstanding, with a total portfolio of $17.3 billion last year. The Chemical Bank and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company are also major issuers of standby letters of credit. The banks collect an annual fee ranging from one-eighth of 1 percent to 1 1/2 percent of the value of these letters. **********WHILE the standby letter of credit is just now rising to prominence, the commercial letter of credit is almost as old as civilization itself. Inscriptions on stone tablets unearthed by archaeologists indicate that Phoenician sea-traders used a variation of the letter of credit more than 4,000 years ago to finance their commerce. And the commercial letter of credit is the principal method today of paying the billions of dollars involved in international trade. **********But the commercial letter of credit differs from the infant standby agreement in a key aspect. A commercial letter of credit is issued by a bank only after the buyer of some merchandise - the American purchaser of a German car, for example - turns over to the bank the purchase price of the car or takes out a loan for the equivalent amount. The bank, in effect, holds this money and pays it to the German auto maker, through a German bank, once the car enters the United States and all the conditions of the sale have been met. **********That trans-Atlantic shipment might take weeks. The American, in the interim, renounces any right to reclaim the cash if he or she has second thoughts about the purchase. The buyer usually pays the bank fee for the commercial letter of credit, which makes the bank, in effect, the intermediary between a buyer reluctant to pay for goods he has not yet received and a seller unwilling to ship without assurance of payment. **********In contrast, the standby letter of credit binds the bank to make payment without having collected any money in advance. A stockbroker, for example, might require a wealthy client to provide the bank's guarantee that he will, in fact, send payment for the stock that he has just told his broker to buy. The individual buys this guarantee for a fee in the form of a standby letter of credit payable to his broker. The letter of credit promises that the bank will pay the stockbroker's bill, if the wealthy individual fails to do so. In that event, the bank is out the money, unless it can collect on promissory notes or collateral that might have been put up by the individual. **********IN the competitive world of deregulated banking, the standby letter **********of credit has turned out to be a lucrative market niche. ''It is the only instrument in the world that provides irrevocable assurance of payment,'' Mr. Feldman said. Other bankers echo Mr. Feldman's promotional statement, although some acknowledge the dangers involved in issuing standby letters of credit. ''There has been little loss experienced in the area, but there has been concern,'' said William Blanc, a Chemical Bank vice president. **********Still, the standby letter of credit has increasingly become a major tool in corporate takeovers. Companies about to be acquired view the letter of credit as ''a good security blanket,'' said Gilbert Harrison, chairman of Financo, a Philadelphia-based investment concern that specializes in the acquisition of companies with a selling price of $5 million to $75 million. **********Mr. Harrison says that the owners of these small companies, when they sell out to larger corporations, often insist on a standby letter of credit to guarantee a purchase completed with installment payments over a period of months or years. He said that in several recent deals, he had offered the seller the alternative of notes at 11 percent interest, but without the backing of a standby letter of credit, or notes at 10 1/2 percent interest, with the backing of a standby L.C. ''In the vast majority of cases, the sellers choose the L.C. arrangement,'' he said. ''They'd rather sleep soundly at night.'' **********The standby has also become an important tool in the leveraged buyout, in which the buyers - often a company's top executives - pledge as collateral the assets of the company they are buying. Because of the risk involved in this sort of financing, standby letters of credit are becoming a common form of guarantee that the buyers will actually make the purchase payments. **********The letter of credit is also in vogue among the wealthy. Take the individual who has agreed to invest $75,000 in a tax shelter over three years. Instead of paying out $25,000 each year, this investor takes out a letter of credit to guarantee payment of the total amount at the end of the period. In the meantime, he or she gets the benefit of an annual tax write-off, even though no money has been put up. Meanwhile, the postponed $25,000 payments can be invested in Treasury securities that yield more than the cost of the letter of credit. **********In professional boxing, the standby letter of credit, payable to the fighters, has become a promoter's means of guaranteeing to the boxers that he will actually pay the agreed-upon purse at the end of the bout. In turn, the L.C. guarantees that the fighters will show up for the match. The bank pays the fighers if the promoter fails to do so. Muhammad Ali demanded such standby L.C.'s in the 1960's and 1970's when their use was still limited chiefly to guaranteeing payment of construction contracts. **********Most bankers regard the letter of credit as an ideal instrument for their own business. With the range of one- eighth of 1 percent to 1 1/2 percent of the L.C.'s face value, the actual rate depends on the credit standing of the applicant and the amount of money involved. A standby L.C. for $200 million might command a $3 million fee. **********MOST L.C.'s, however, are not that large, and some bankers think fees should not be lowered to less than the average three- quarters of 1 percent currently charged, among them Vincent Maulella, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover. ''What bankers are looking at now is the value to the customer,'' he said. ''The value is more than one-eighth of 1 percent.'' **********He adds that in some cases banks should not write a standby letter of credit at all because they would do much better providing a standard commercial loan at current rates of 12 percent to 14 percent. This represents a spread of up to 4 percentage points, vearsus a maximum of 1 1/2 points for a standby letter of credit. **********''The banks are competing against themselves,'' Mr. Maulella said. **********Still, revenue from standby letters of credit is attractive because it raises income ''below the line.'' Standby L.C.'s are contingent liabilities - possible but not probable future obligations - and banks are not required to hold reserves against them. In fact, a recent Federal Reserve study shows that standby L.C. losses average only three-tenths of 1 percent of the total value of L.C.'s outstanding, which is below the four- tenths of 1 percent loss rate for commercial loans. **********Federal Reserve officials say they are not too happy about the proliferation of standby L.C.'s, which impinge on the Fed's ability to control credit and raise the potential for huge losses, according to bankers. But banking industry officials say they have become more selective about the standby L.C.'s that they issue. ''More and more, the standby is a payment mechanism,'' Mr. Maulella said, in which the client is required to provide enough collateral to assure repayment if necessary. **********The most expansive view of the future for standby L.C.'s comes from Citibank, which has been the most aggressive in leading seminars in various cities to promote the standby letter of credit. ''Anybody from an individual to a conglomerate is a target for one,'' Mr. Feldman says."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/11/business/first-quarter-profit-at-vw.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "First-Quarter Profit at VW", "print_headline": "First-Quarter Profit at VW", "body_text": " **********Volkswagen A.G. today reported earnings of $18.3 million for the first quarter, in contrast to a loss of $35.9 million a year earlier. **********Carl H.

It will thus be using the interactive cable TV system in a way that has already proved highly successful in a single-market test. **********The test was just before Christmas, 1982, in Columbus, Ohio, the first city to get the Warner Amex Qube system. By pressing any of five response buttons, Qube subscribers can participate in such things as consumer research, polls and game shows. **********In the 1982 test, the cosmetics company, working with the Lazarus department store, began running half- hour demonstrations of women getting cosmetic makeover treatments. The demonstrations ended with an offer for viewers to get a free makeover of their own. They were asked to push one of three Qube response buttons to indicate which Lazarus branch they would like to have get in touch with them for an appointment. **********According to Brenda Davidorf, director of Warner Amex Video Ventures, 11,600 people tuned in to the program during the two weeks it ran and 1,682 responded, or ''touched in,'' as Qube calls it. Some 800 of the touch-ins made appointments and 48 percent actually showed up. **********Now the bottom line: Each of those attending bought an average of $50 worth of Ralph Lauren cosmetics. No wonder that Warner Cosmetics (which is no longer owned by Warner Communications) is out to extend the scope of that operation. **********In addition to Columbus, the new program will be in Cincinnati and Pogues department store; Pittsburgh and Kauffman's, and Dallas and Nieman-Marcus. **********The program, which will have Clotilde, Ralph Lauren's official cosmetics model as hostess, will also have a cosmetician doing over three different models. **********The segment will run twice a day in all markets except Dallas, where it will be aired three times. In an attempt to make the advertising more selective, Warner Amex has created a 30-second promotion spot that it will run on the cable network whose audience demographics are closest to the ones that the cosmetics company is looking to attract. **********This is the sort of thing that the ebullient Miss Davidorf does for a living. The former teacher of the deaf, who joined the company seven years ago, is in charge of changing national advertisers' dreams of cable TV into reality as far as the Warner Amex systems are concerned. That also goes for the seven Qube systems (the remaining three being Chicago, Houston and St. Louis), and the 112 regular non-urban cable systems owned by Warner Amex, which is a joint venture of Warner Communications and American Express. **********More than anything else, Miss Davidorf's unit is in answer to advertiser demand, and she has been actively helping out in an informal way for about two years. In January the position became official and she became part of the advertising sales department. **********Miss Davidorf, who appears to be a basically bubbly person, is particularly ''up'' these days over a recent Qube success in Columbus, where she is based. **********The caper, involving Kraft Foods and J. Walter Thompson, Chicago, showed an altogether different capability for Qube. **********Kraft was sponsor of the April 6 CBS-TV special, ''The Magic of David Copperfield.'' With the agreement of the Columbus CBS affiliate, WBNS- TV, a crawl message across the bottom of the screen invited Qube subscribers to touch-in for copies of Kraft recipes. Of the roughly 50,000 Qube homes in Columbus, about 3,000 touched-in to get Kraft recipes. **********To Ronald B. Kaatz, senior vice president in the media research of Thompson, Chicago, the response was amazing. So surprising was it, in fact, that he voiced concern that Kraft would have difficulty filling the orders if such an undertaking was attempted on a broader scale.

He said the map contained notes on supposed ''weak points'' in the large embassy compound. **********Earlier Arrest in Zurich **********Mr. Monarca said another Lebanese man was arrested in Zurich six days earlier and was carrying more than four pounds of explosives. **********He said that although he had no hard evidence to prove the suspects' membership in Islamic Holy War, he based his conclusion on documents the arrested men were carrying. **********In Washington, Administration officials said they were working on the assumption that the Lebanese were linked to Islamic Holy War. But American officials declined to provide much detail, preferring to let information come from the Italian authorities. **********Reports on Carrier Denied **********In another matter, State Department and Defense Department officials denied reports that that the United States had ordered the aircraft carrier Eisenhower to prepare for a retaliatory strike if terrorists in Lebanon struck against American installations again. **********The Washington Post said in its issue today that the Eisenhower was ordered ''shortly before Thanksgiving'' to hold its position in the central Mediterranean for possible retaliatory strikes. But Michael Burch, the Pentagon spokesman, said today that the Eisenhower was on port call in Athens from Nov. 21 to 24 so the crew could have Thanksgiving liberty. **********The New York Times in its last edition today said that the Eisenhower had been held on station in the central Mediterranean for several weeks preparing to respond to terrorist attacks.   No Specific Mission **********Today, State Department and Defense Department officials said that the United States had had a carrier on station in that area for months for possible assignments, such as aiding in the evacuation of Americans in an emergency. They said no specific retaliatory mission had been ordered, but they did not rule out the possibility that in case of an attack on American installations, one could be ordered. **********On Nov. 4, two days before the American Presidential election, a message issued in the name of Islamic Holy War warned of an operation that ''will surprise the Americans.'' **********The group has taken responsibility for bombings of the American Embassy buildings in Beirut in April 1983 and September 1984, and of the American and French military barracks south of Beirut in October 1983. Since the most recent bombing Sept. 20, American embassies and diplomats have been on high alert because of repeated threats of similar attacks.

Investigation Continuing **********The State Department, without going into details on how the Italian police were alerted to the possible plot in Rome, said the investigation there was still going on. It confirmed that one of the arrested Lebanese had a plan of the embassy. **********Administration officials said Italian and American security agents had shared information leading to the arrests Saturday. **********The State Department said that ''U.S.-Italian relations have been marked for some time by excellent and growing cooperation in the law enforcement area, including against terrorism.'' **********Mr. Monarca, the Rome Police Chief, said the Lebanese who were arrested apparently planned to attack the embassy with a truck full of dynamite, the method used in Beirut. **********According to news agency reports, the seven Lebanese who were arrested Saturday in Ladispoli, a seaside resort near Rome, had been in Italy for up to a year, and some or all were registered as students. **********They were reportedly charged with belonging to an armed band and plotting a massacre, and were being held in a maximum-security prison outside Rome.   Embassy Is Heavily Protected **********The American Embassy is located on the Via Veneto, one of Rome's major thoroughfares. It has been heavily protected since the advent of the Red Brigades terrorist group in Italy in the 1970's, and threats have been made to attack it in the past, Administration officials said.

They are expected, nonetheless, to give fresh impetus to a broader national debate, long under way, over whether the Japanese toil too hard or whether their well- known work ethic is eroding. **********Changes in Labor Law Urged **********The panel's recommendations call for changes in the Labor Standards Law to reduce the officially sanctioned work week from 48 hours to 45 hours. At the same time, however, the legally permitted work day would be stretched from eight hours to nine hours. **********If adopted, the proposal would mean nine-hour work shifts, five days a week, rather than the present official standard of eight-hour shifts for six days. Although the suggested cut in overall hours is small, the intent seems clear: to nudge Japan toward a five-day week, with further reductions in hours to follow. **********In large companies, defined as those with 1,000 or more employees, a 40- hour, five-day week has already become the norm, as in the United States and other industrial countries. **********But less than one in five workers belong to such companies, Japan remaining a country of shops and small concerns despite the attention given to giants such as Mitsubishi and Toyota. In companies with fewer than 100 employees, the Labor Ministry found that nearly 40 percent of the workers put in at least 48 hours, usually by working all or part of a sixth day each week.   No Change in 37 Years **********The advisory group's proposal is not intended to be its final one. Considerable discussion is likely over the next year before the Government offers specific changes in legal working hours, which have not been altered in 37 years. **********Employers, especially in small and medium-size companies, can be counted on to oppose a reduction in work hours to 45 a week. Labor unions, which have long urged a five-day week, will probably regard a nine-hour day as too great a price to pay. Eight-hour days have been the custom for many years - excluding overtime, which Japanese workers accept as a matter of course. **********Among the major industrial countries, no work force is more diligent than the Japanese. On average, the Labor Ministry said, employees work 2,116 hours a year, compared with about 1,800 hours in the United States. **********That means the typical Japanese works more than an extra month a year compared with the average American. And the figures for Japan do not include overtime or after-hours socializing with colleagues, regarded as critical for maintaining workplace cohesiveness. White-collar workers habitually stay on in the office long after the work day is officially over.   The Drive to Work Hard **********Whether this drive to work is good or bad has been much discussed here for some time. **********More and more Japanese seem to be questioning the continued need for such assiduousness amid obvious prosperity. A woman identifying herself as a 24- year-old housewife in Kawasaki, south of Tokyo, complained in a letter to the newspaper Asahi recently that her husband left home every day at 7 A.M. and did not return until 11 P.M. **********''Can a lifetime devoted to one's work be called meritorious?'' she wrote. ''I want my husband to enjoy his life that he can have only once instead of working like a bee.'' **********In a Government opinion poll last year, people were asked, ''Would you sacrifice your daily life for the benefit of the company?'' Fifty-nine percent of those surveyed said no. The younger the person, the more likely was a negative response - 68 percent among those aged 20 to 29.   Political Considerations **********The Government's reasons for promoting a five-day week are embroidered with political considerations. It wishes to alter the image abroad of Japan as a nation of workaholics, enjoying an unfair economic advantage internationally because of the commitment to long hours. **********Despite all this, the work ethic appears to be deeply ingrained in this country, a point obvious to anyone who observes the enthusiasm with which even menial jobs are usually performed. **********Recognizing the resistance to change, the Labor Ministry advisory council recommended that any reduction in work hours not apply to three important industries - construction, transportation and small service-oriented companies. All have yet to trim their basic schedules to even 48 hours a week."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/24/world/big-battle-clears-streets-of-beirut.html": {"writer_name": "E.

A recent addition to a fabled edifice, it could be a monument to heroism. Or it could be a tombstone to two middle-aged advertising men who instead of following the southerly trek of agencies looking for rent relief below 23d Street in Manhattan, instead screwed their courage to the sticking-place (as once suggested by Lady Macbeth), and moved their $10.5 million agency to Queens. **********There are places you can move an agency, but Queens is not generally considered one of them. Westchester. Fairfield. Fort Lee, N.J., O.K., O.K., O.K., but Queens? **********But, it must be admitted, this is no ordinary part of Queens, for, although it does have a nice mix of modest one- and two-family houses with some of the most beautiful rose bushes to be found in Gotham, and some manufacturing plants, it is the home of world- renowned Astoria studios, originally the Famous Players Laskey Studio, which was Hollywood before Hollywood was Hollywood. It is now Kaufman Astoria Studios, 15 buildings on 12 acres. **********And there is a lot of activity going out there these days, outer walls being refurbished, and on what was once the back lot, workers are finishing up a fancy new office wing, whose ornate canopied front door will face on a street that will be shut off to traffic and enclosed by big gates just like Hollywood studios. **********For this, Harvey Herman, 50-year- old chairman, and Charles E. Rosner, 40 and president, gave up 110 East 59th Street at Park Avenue. The incitement to relocate, according to Mr. Herman, was a $22-a-square-foot rental that was about to go to $42. **********Of course, they looked around down in the lower Fifth Avenue area where such outstanding creative agencies as Geer, DuBois, and Rosenfeld, Sirowitz & Lawson have taken up occupancy. But in the end, they were lured across the river by Harold Rand, recently named marketing director of Kaufman Astoria Studios and a friend of long standing. **********And during a tour of the establishment yesterday conducted by Larry Barr, vice president, production, of Kaufman Astoria, one could see how the place could grow on you, even if you do have to wear an I.D. badge. The visible activity going on in the huge sound stages has the vibes of great creativity compared with the sterile confines of midtown office buildings. **********On one stage, workmen were putting together some background material for the 20th Century-Fox film ''Turk 182'' now in production, while on another, carpenters were knocking down a set of Caesars Palace, Atlantic City, in which Buddy Hackett had just starred in a spot done by the Bean-Kahn production company for Wunderman, Ricotta & Kline. **********According to Mr. Barr, every imaginable kind of production specialist has offices in or near the premises, which is in keeping with the desire of George Kaufman, the developer, to make this a communications complex. And the place is already 95 percent to 98 percent rented, according to Mr. Rand. **********But as exciting as it all may seem, Mr. Herman still said of the move, ''This is freightening and risky, but it is pioneering.'' He is in 4,000 temporary square feet preparing to move into 4,500 permanent square feet at $18 a square foot. **********There was a weekend there when they almost did not come to Queens. That is when they measured up the pros and cons and got seven of the former and 23 of the latter. What saved the day for Astoria was their realization that the few juicy pros outweighed the many piddling cons. **********''We think we are going to attract people with a pioneering spirit who can see the future here,'' said Mr. Herman, to which Mr. Rosner added: ''Agencies like to claim they're innovative, but its usually only with the client's money. We're being innovative with our own.'' **********In addition to the N and RR subway trains, which stop at the Steinway station three blocks away, there is a shuttle bus from the East Side that the studio operates during rush hour, and it has been prove that Porsches, BMW's, Mercedes and even stretch limos with one-way rear windows make the trip over the Queensborough Bridge with ease. **********But what is it like to work there?

Each of these segments has its own priorities and programs and adherents. **********Then, too, the social climate has changed while many of the leaders were in jail and many of those emerging are commenting on the apathy, fatigue and fatalism they have noticed in their compatriots. **********All of these factors almost certainly figured in the decision by the Government to announce the amnesty and to extend its term to the end of the year. The Government apparently hopes that Solidarity's internal difficulties, combined with diminished public enthusiasm for disorder and the somewhat successful buyout of such key sectors of the work force as the coal miners, will keep the returning activists from picking up where they left off. **********The position of the Government is that the situation has normalized to the point where dissidents need not be imprisoned, but that they cannot be allowed to organize campaigns that might shake or topple the framework of the Communist system. **********This was asserted again in an editorial in Saturday's issue of Trybuna Ludu, the party newspaper. The editorial noted that Western radio stations broadcasting in Polish had declared that if the amnesty is to make any sense it must be accompanied by the legalization of Solidarity and the restoration of union pluralism. **********Illusion and Reality The editorial said that, while pluralistic approaches remained possible within the ''framework of the socialist state,'' the kind of independent unions advocated by Solidarity were unaccceptable and that ''it is an illusion to think that the past will return.'' **********Indeed, the freed prisoners seem to be suffering few illusions. **********''We are in a period of negative calm,'' said Mr. Gwiazda, and a factory hand associated with the underground faction said, ''Our work will take years.'' **********The initial euphoria of some of the freed prisoners, who sounded at times like cheerleaders urging renewed confrontation, has given way to sober statements of people who recognize that, after two and a half years of isolation from one another and from society, what they need most is a chance to confer and and consult. **********For example, when Adam Michnik, one of the most defiant of the detainees, was expelled from jail by force on Saturday, he demonstratively shunned interviewers and left Warsaw. Friends said he would probably have nothing to say for several weeks while he acquainted himself with the new situation.   Solidarity Meeting Urged **********At the same time, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, a Solidarity leader from Wroclaw, said he thought a full meeting of activists should be held in perhaps a month. **********He had earlier made a dramatic gesture to affirm unity of the opposition movement, when on his release, he dodged surveillance and made his way to Warsaw where he signed a joint open letter with Mr. Bujak, the underground leader. In the letter, the two men called for a resumption of the struggle ''to achieve union pluralism and freedom of thought and expression.'' Despite appeals for a full reunion, some sources close to the movement said they thought the meetings to be held in the next weeks would be small and private and away from the glare of publicity. Already, they said, polling of activists has begun, with people being asked to suggest approaches for renewed organizing efforts. **********So far, these have reportedly ranged from urgings that Solidarity infiltrate the worker self-management groups now legally established at factories, to calls for greater emphasis on underground activities, such as publishing, clandestine radio and consciousness- raising groups."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/09/business/business-people-three-executives-out-in-shake-up-at-amway.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1984-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 276, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Three Executives Out In Shake-Up at Amway", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Three Executives Out In Shake-Up at Amway", "body_text": " **********The Amway Corporation, the big direct-sales company that pleaded guilty recently to charges of customs fraud in Canada, said yesterday that three senior executives had left and that more might follow. **********''This is a painful experience, but once we get through it we are bullish about the future of the company,'' said Casey Wondergem, director of public relations. **********Those leaving are William J.

Osborn, executive managing director for Asian operations for TRW Inc. and former economic attache for high technology at the United States Embassy here. ''But American companies are not keeping tabs on the Japanese competition to the level the threat warrants.'' **********When American technologists do visit here, they are frequently surprised by the extent and sophistication of the work being done in such fields as optical communications, data storage, computer memory chips, advanced ceramics and automation. **********''I must admit that while I was well informed before visiting here, what I have seen since I came here almost frightens me,'' said Roman J. Wasilewski, an expert in advanced new materials who is surveying Japanese work in that field for the National Science Foundation. **********Americans in Japan **********To remedy the situation, American companies such as the Burroughs Corporation, the Eastman Kodak Company, the GTE Corporation and TRW are moving people here or are hiring people to keep track of Japanese work. The American Electronics Association, a trade group, has just opened an office here to monitor technological and political developments. **********The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan also formed a high- technology committee to keep members informed on developments in the field. One of the first actions of the committee was to urge the United States Government to step up its observations of Japanese technology. **********''In a nutshell, our national ability to monitor and understand emerging Japanese commercial technologies of great significance, in a timely manner, is not what it should be,'' the committee said in a statement. **********The Government is also taking some steps. The House Subcommittee on Science, Research and Technology held hearings on the subject in March and is proposing to allocate $750,000 for the translation of Japanese scientific papers into English. The United States Embassy will add more people to monitor Japanese development and the National Science Foundation is beginning a program of sending experts in various fields to survey developments in Japan. **********Still, most American experts say too little is being done. The Boston Consulting Group, for instance, found that of 12 major foreign companies it interviewed recently, only four actively followed Japanese technology. Experts say that if American industry fails to keep track of Japanese technological progress, Japanese companies will leap ahead of the Americans before they realize it. **********''We will continue to be caught by surprise as we were in the steel industry, the automobile industry and the consumer electronics industry,'' said John A. Alic, a project manager for the Office of Technology Assessment in Washington, who has done some studies of Japanese technology. **********One of the major reasons for the failure to watch the Japanese is that Americans have long been the leaders in technology and suffer from what is known as the not-invented- here syndrome, the belief that work done by others is not important. **********''When you think you're number one, it's very hard to get excited about the others until you find you're not number one any more,'' said Justin Bloom, a former science attache at the United States Embassy here and now a consulting engineer in Potomac, Md. **********Almost without exception, American technology experts stationed here say their colleagues in America seriously underestimate the Japanese accomplishments. **********''There is a great gulf of willingness to accept the fact that the Japanese are leading in certain areas,'' said Thomas J. Savereide, technical director of Sumitomo 3M Ltd., a joint venture of the Minnesota company and two Japanese companies, the NEC Corporation and Sumitomo Electric Industries. **********Optical Communications **********Many experts think Japan is ahead, for instance, in the emerging field of optical communications, in which information is transmitted using light traveling through glass fibers rather than electricity traveling through copper wiring. Japanese industry has developed a low-cost method of manufacturing the fibers and is highly advanced in making the electronic components needed for such communications. **********The Japanese expertise in optics also extends into the area of data storage. The Japanese are as advanced as the United States in development of new optical disks, which can store far more computer data than the currently used magnetic disks. **********In electronics, the Japanese lead in computer memory chips, and have more experience than American companies with a process for producing computer chips that use only small amounts of electricity. **********Ceramics and Fast Trains **********Other areas in which the Japanese are ahead of the Americans or are drawing close include advanced ceramics for use in electronics and in engines, supercomputers, high-speed railroads, photovoltaics, information displays used in portable computers, low-priced copiers and printers, and factory automation using robots and computers. **********In some of these fields, according to industry analysts, American companies virtually ignored Japanese efforts until they had lost their dominant share of the market. **********In addition to keeping up with the competition's technology, monitoring Japanese developments can also lead to discovery of new market opportunities to sell equipment in Japan and to influence Japanese policies. **********When the Japanese Government was considering legislation recently that would have been detrimental to United States software and telecommunications industries, American representatives here protested quickly. One bill was tabled and the other changed in a way favorable to the American companies. In the past, officials here say, protests would come largely from Washington and would often be too late to influence the legislation. The Japanese have become more open to such intervention, recently deciding to allow American participation on some of the advisory councils that shape legislation. **********American companies might also spot technology they could use for their own products. ''We're in a position to come over here and copy from them,'' said T. E. Blaszczak, vice president of design and manufacturing technology for Westinghouse Electric Japan. **********Undoubtedly the best example of the benefits of monitoring technology is Japan itself, which has scoured the world for technology it used for its own advancement. Employees of Japanese companies stationed abroad are well-known for the extent to which they monitor patents, hire market researchers to perform studies, and attend scientific meetings and trade shows taking assiduous notes and photographing the insides of computers on display. **********Japanese Use U.S. Advances **********Arthur Heuer, a professor of ceramics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, recalled that when he did some work with potential application to the development of new types of diesel engines made of ceramics, several Japanese companies were quick to inquire about his work and use it. American companies did not pay attention even when he went to them. For reasons like this, according to experts, Japan leads in many phases of the use of ceramic materials. **********In some cases, the Japanese have gone too far in their quest and have been charged with copying or stealing technology. The most notable example was in 1982, when executives of Hitachi Ltd. and the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation were charged with trying to steal trade secrets from the International Business Machines Corporation. The companies and some employees later were fined. **********Japanese information gathering extends beyond technology to marketing and general business information. One American consultant recalls seeing at Hitachi a book containing estimates of Motorola's sales broken down by product and by state. John W. Cusick, who runs the Japan office of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said Japanese companies often tell him which A.T.& T. officials are visiting before he finds out from his own company. **********American companies have done nowhere near as extensive a surveillance job. Part of the reason is that most American companies have small staffs here whose main job is to sell products, not gather intelligence. **********''The way most American companies operate here, you sort of catch the information on the fly,'' said Edwin W. Schaffner, executive assistant to the president of the Control Data Corporation's Japan subsidiary. **********Language Barrier **********Language is also a problem. While the Japanese are taught English as a second language, few Americans know Japanese and fewer still understand both technology and Japanese. Because of United States military concerns, far more American technical experts know Russian than know Japanese. **********Until now, the most extensive monitoring of Japanese technology has been done by the United States military and, it is believed, by the intelligence agencies. But they are interested mainly in finding technology with military applications, not commercial ones. **********Among American companies, I.B.M. is said to have an extensive force of Japan watchers, both inside its I.B.M. Japan subsidiary and outside it. I.B.M. closed down much of its Japan-watching activities in 1981 in an economy move, according to a source at the company, but recognized the value of the monitoring activities and resumed them a year later. **********Kodak, after leaving most of its Japanese operations to distributors, plans to move people here to offer more technical support to its sales force and to monitor technology. The GTE Corporation opened an office here in January. **********Some market research firms and trade journals also see growing opportunities to provide information to Americans. In the past year, three companies have started publishing English language electronics newsletters focusing on Japan. **********Analysts say another step that must be taken for the Americans to gain the kind of insight into Japanese technology as the Japanese have elsewhere is for American students to study at Japanese universities and work for Japanese companies, just as Japanese students have studied and worked in the United States. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology runs one such student exchange program with Japan and the American Electronics Association is beginning another one this year. **********Joint Ventures **********Another effective way of transferring technology is to engage in joint ventures such as General Motors's arrangement with Toyota to produce small cars in California, the experts say. Such joint ventures between American and Japanese companies are increasing. **********One big obstacle facing American Japan-watchers is that foreigners are generally not permitted to participate in the huge research and development efforts sponsored by the Japanese Government in such fields as advanced computers and optical communications. That situation is changing to some extent, however. **********In addition, just gathering the information is not sufficient. A means must be found to distribute it to the proper people and to use it. **********Perhaps the biggest challenge, however, is to get American industry to become more receptive to ideas developed by others. **********''If we had every single technical word written in Japan I'm not sure American scientists would pay attention to it,'' said Mr. Bloom, the former embassy science attache. **********James C. Abegglen, a Japan expert associated with the Boston Consulting Group here, agreed: ''The top management of the American company has to have the conviction that there is something here worth knowing about.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/14/world/uranium-salvaged-from-ship.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 277, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "URANIUM SALVAGED FROM SHIP", "print_headline": "URANIUM SALVAGED FROM SHIP", "body_text": " **********Salvage crews retrieved the first of 30 containers of radioactive material today from the torn hull of a French freighter that sank 19 days ago in the North Sea, officials said. **********The officials also said they were quite certain the 29 other containers carrying uranium hexafluoride were still inside the hull of the 4,210-ton Mont Louis, which broke open during a fierce storm last Monday. **********''We found a lot of them bunched together in the forward part of the ship,'' said Paul Goris of the Antwerp salvaging company of l'Union de Remorquage et de Sauvetage. **********Divers also picked up one more of the 22 empty containers aboard, the 14th to be retrieved to date, said Hans Walenkamp of the Dutch salvaging company of Smit Tak International. **********Thursday was the first day divers were at the stricken vessel after six days of storms and high waves. **********The Mont Louissank Aug. 25 in about 46 feet of water after colliding with a passenger ferry.

Keller, a ruddy, muscular man who grows 50 acres of horseradish near this farm town a dozen miles east of St. Louis, asks himself why he continues to grow this problematic root. **********Harvesting it requires digging deep holes, some 16 inches into the soil. Harvesting continues into the chill of winter, and preparing the bitter root for market brings a larger flood of tears to his eyes than do onions. **********''There's a lot of orneriness to growing horseradish,'' said Mr. Keller, whose father also cultivated the pungent root. ''You're out in the wet and cold harvesting when the corn and soybean farmers around town have their tractors in the barn and have gone off to Florida.'' **********But this is clearly the year to stay with horseradish, as arduous as it is. Mr. Keller, one of 33 horseradish farmers in and around Collinsville - which styles itself the Horseradish Capital of America - predicts that high prices and a bumper crop will make this year the most profitable ever for horseradish growers. **********Last year, by contrast, severe drought and heat hobbled the crop of the nation's 80 or so farms that raise horseradish in big quantities. The roots, which are brown on the outside but white on the inside, were puny compared with their normal 14-inch length and 2-inch diameter. The poor harvest pushed prices about 15 cents a pound above their usual level of 30 cents. **********A Lucrative Crop **********Mr. Keller said it costs him $2,000 an acre to cultivate his crop, or seven times what it costs to grow corn, the crop he rotates with horseradish. His main cost is labor. For planting, he needs 15 people - one person can plant one and a half acres a day - and for the harvest, which is set to start in just a few weeks, he needs 25. **********''In the long run, it is more lucrative per acre than other crops,'' Mr. Keller said. In an average year he will get 8,000 pounds of horseradish per acre, which translates to $2,400 in revenues. This means $400 profit per acre, compared with $50 an acre for his corn. This year, however, abundant late-summer rain is expected to raise his yield to 10,000 pounds an acre - at more than 40 cents a pound. **********The nation's horseradish growers do a lot of haggling over price with the handful of processors, just as their parents haggled with their processors' parents. **********''Right now there's an acute shortage of horseradish,'' said Joseph Dogan, general manager of Thor- Shackel Horseradish Inc., a processor and packer in Burr Ridge, just southwest of Chicago. ''This year is going to be a very expensive year for horseradish, maybe over 50 cents a pound. It's going to be wonderful for growers.'' **********Mr. Dogan, who estimates that his 74-year-old business processes 400,000 pounds a year, said he markets everything from 5-ounce jars, which retail for 69 cents, to 30-pound jars for commercial use. He said prices will likely go up several cents a small jar at the retail level this year. **********About 70 percent of all horseradish is sold straight. The remainder is used in shrimp sauce, in mixes with mayonnaise and in other dressings. Horseradish has its biggest sales around the Jewish New Year, Christmas, Passover and Easter. **********'A Business of Entrepreneurs' **********''The little guys who used to get 50 pounds of roots, fool around with them in their kitchen, and then sell them have died out,'' said Sol Tulkoff, who boasts that his 21-acre family- owned industrial park in Baltimore makes his company the nation's largest horseradish processor. ''It's now become a business of entrepreneurs.'' **********Mr. Tulkoff's parents, immigrants from Russia, founded Tulkoff's Horseradish Products Company in 1928. He said many processors have left the business because their small volume did not enable them to afford the modern equipment required to satisfy Federal inspectors, or the sophisticated ventilation systems needed to prevent workers from getting teary-eyed. **********Mr. Tulkoff, the marketer extraordinaire of the industry, has developed a zesty condiment known as Tiger Sauce, which relies on a healthy dollop of horseradish. **********He estimated that something more than 2,000 acres of horseradish are cultivated in the nation. Appreciable quantities are grown in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Wisconsin and California, in addition to Illinois. No one seems to know exactly how many growers there are, however, or how many pounds are harvested each year. Indeed, the United States Department of Agriculture has no horseradish expert. **********Drawbacks for Growers **********''There's something intriguing about growing a minority crop,'' Mr. Keller said, bending over to examine the 15-inch-high plants. The soil was loamy on top and sandy below - ideal for growing horseradish. **********Growing a minority crop has its shortcomings, however. Chemical companies do not manufacture special pesticides for horseradish as they do for crops like corn. Nor do farm implement companies produce equipment tailor-made for planting or harvesting horseradishes. **********As a result, horseradish growers are often inventors. George H. Willaredt, a grower in Edwardsville, 8 miles northwest of Collinsville, said he had developed a 30-foot-wide rack that attaches to a tractor and carries a dozen fieldhands who plant rows as the tractor inches forward. In addition, he has developed a reinforced potato harvester that gouges 18 inches into the ground to harvest. **********''My father started out with just five acres,'' said Mr. Willaredt, who - thanks to the new machinery - has expanded to 100 acres of horseradish, ''That was all we could do without this specialized machinery because it's such a high labor-intensive crop.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/05/world/on-grenada-sounding-off-again-in-print.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1984-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 941, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ON GRENADA, SOUNDING OFF AGAIN IN PRINT", "print_headline": "ON GRENADA, SOUNDING OFF AGAIN IN PRINT", "body_text": " **********- **********''Dear Editor: I have read the first two issues of The Grenadian Voice and I will never read this paper again.'' **********''Dear Editor: I am very apprehensive about the future of Grenada.'' **********''Dear Editor: For quite some time now I have been experiencing problems with the Grenada Electricity Services Ltd.'' **********After years of control under the leftist Government that ended with an American-led invasion on Oct. 25, the people of Grenada are sounding off again in The Grenadian Voice, a revived, low- budget weekly newspaper. **********Its editor, Leslie Pierre, who was jailed for more than two years after publishing one issue of the paper in 1981, is printing letters from varying viewpoints, and they portray an emerging debate about the future of the country. **********'I Express My Congrats' **********Elizabeth Charles wrote in the latest issue: ''I express my congrats to our Lord and Savior.

It referred to the ''tyrranical rule'' of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and ''two weeks of terror under a bloodthirsty bunch'' who jailed and then killed him on Oct. 19. The headline above its letters page read: ''God Bless America.

Surviving With Outside Help **********Mr. Pierre said he was selling about 6,000 copies of his press run of 7,000. But he said distribution was still a problem and the newspaper was still slow in attracting advertisers because ''people haven't been used to advertising for the past few years.'' **********It is surviving with the help of other regional newspapers like The Barbados Nation and The Trinidad Express, which are printing it at low cost and sending copy editors and business managers on short tours to help out. **********''Nobody has sent us a bill yet,'' Mr. Pierre said.  ''We're operating on advance income and the sale of the newspaper.  The price is 75 East Caribbean cents, or about 30 United States cents, a copy.'' **********Grenada has a history of a lively press dating from colonial days when small presses turned out a variety of little papers and pamphlets. **********In the post-independence government of Sir Eric Gairy, when the Government-owned West Indian and independent Torchlight were publishing, the opposition New Jewel Movement led by Mr. Bishop was inspired in its pamphleteering. To get around a Government ban on unauthorized publication of periodicals issued more frequently than 100 days apart, Mr. Bishop's men changed their pamphlet's title each issue, bringing out a ''new'' publication each week. **********Once in power, though, the New Jewel Movement took over the West Indian, renaming it The Free West Indian, and within five months the party had closed down The Torchlight. The next year, a nonpolitical newspaper sponsored by the Roman Catholic Church, The Focus, was also closed after just one issue, leaving Grenada with only the Government-controlled publication.   A Decision to Publish **********Shocked by the apathy of the public to the shutting off of a free press, Mr. Pierre said, he decided in 1981 with 25 other shareholders to publish an independent newspaper that would conform to all laws and would be, at the start at least, ''deliberately innocuous.'' **********Its first mimeographed run of 2,500 copies was sold out and an additional 500 were printed and distributed, Mr. Pierre said, but it was shut down after the second issue and Mr. Pierre was detained for questioning. When he escaped from detention the day after the Americans landed, Mr. Pierre said, ''I was still waiting to be questioned, two and a half years later.'' **********Like the Grenadians who write letters to his newspaper, Mr. Pierre is concerned about the future. There is no assurance, he said, that today's freedom of the press will not again be restricted. **********''Let's hope it doesn't happen here again,'' he said.

At 200,000 barrels a day, Yemen's output would approximate the production added by each of several non-OPEC countries since 1981. **********Diplomats said that an added advantage was that, unlike most other states of the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen could export from the Red Sea, not from the Persian Gulf, where oil exports are threatened by the tanker war between Iran and Iraq. **********Last summer Hunt Oil announced that it had made Yemen's first oil strike ever in a 12,600-square-kilometer concession in the Marib al Jauf basin, in the northeastern part of the country. The company initially announced that the well produced 7,800 barrels a day in crude oil, but this figure was quickly revised to 10,000 barrels a day. **********The find prompted immediate interest within oil circles, because Hunt had found the oil after drilling only one well. Oil experts here described this as a 1-in-10,000 probability. **********Hunt has drilled two more wells since then, but it made no announcement about whether oil had been found in those wells. William J. Furr, vice president of operations for the Yemen Hunt Oil Company, said earlier this week that Hunt had brought in a second rig that would enable it to drill more wells at a faster rate. But he declined to confirm reports that vast quantities of oil had already been discovered. **********In Dallas, a spokesman for Hunt Oil declined to release further details, citing a request from the Yemeni Government. Hunt Oil is an independent oil company with interests domestically and abroad. It is also independent of other oil interests operated by Nelson Bunker Hunt and Herbert Hunt, the billionaire Texas businessmen who are brothers of Ray Hunt. **********Refinery and Pipeline Planned **********President Saleh said tonight that two oilfields had been discovered. He said Yemen intended to build a refinery, a pipeline from the fields to the Red Sea - about 150 miles - and ''all the infrastructure required'' to exploit the oil. **********He said that several unspecified companies would be bidding on contracts for the projects, and that construction would take ''no more than two years.'' However, he added, if Yemen faced ''economic pressures,'' the infrastructure work could be completed more quickly. **********He declined to specify the type of pressures that might arise. But Yemen has previously played down the oil discovery, partly for fear that Saudi Arabia and other donors might decrease their aid levels, diplomats said. **********No Sharing With Southern Yemen **********President Saleh also made it clear that he intended the oil to be used for the immediate benefit of Yemen, and would not be shared with the Soviet- backed, Marxist Southern Yemen. **********But, the President added, Yemen was conducting ''studies'' to determine whether joint oil exploration could be carried out in the two countries' ''adjoining areas.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/04/world/two-greeks-face-wiretap-charges.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 766, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TWO GREEKS FACE WIRETAP CHARGES", "print_headline": "TWO GREEKS FACE WIRETAP CHARGES", "body_text": " **********The publisher and the editor of Ethnos, the newspaper with Greece's largest circulation, will be tried in December on charges of tapping the office telephone of a Cypriot- born journalist in Athens and of publishing a transcript, lawyers in the case said today. **********The journalist, Paul Anastasiades, who writes under the name Paul Anastasi, is a correspondent for The Daily Telegraph of London and a part-time correspondent for The New York Times. **********The case was brought by the Athens Public Prosecutor, the Greek equivalent of a district attorney, and Mr. Anastasiades is involved as the offended party. If convicted, the Ethnos publisher, George Bobolas, and the editor, Alexander Filipopoulos, could be sentenced to a maximum of five years' imprisonment. In the investigation preceding the placing of formal charges, both men acknowledged the use of material obtained by tapping but said they were not directly involved in the tapping itself. **********Lawyers for Mr. Anastasiades, in making their announcement today, did not say when the two men had been charged or when the court date had been set, but both actions were believed to have been taken in the last several days. **********The disclosure of a taped conversation between Mr. Anastasiades and a lawyer friend followed the correspondent's publication of a book in which he contended that Ethnos received the material support and assistance of the Soviet secret police, the K.G.B. In a suit for libel and defamation brought by Ethnos, Mr. Anastasiades was first sentenced to two years in prison; on appeal, the term was commuted to a fine last May.   Tapes Offered to Press Ministry **********In presenting his charges against Mr. Bobolas and Mr. Filipopoulos for trial on Dec. 13, the Prosecutor, Leonidas Lazarakos, accused the two men of initiating the wiretap and making illicit use of the information obtained by publishing it and by offering the tapes to the head of the Press Ministry, Under Secretary Dimitris Maroudas. **********Mr. Maroudas said the Government had refused to accept the tapes. In recent conversations, a senior official assured The Times that no wire-tapping of its phone conversations was being conducted. The New York Times, which has its own correspondent based in Athens, rents office space from Mr. Anastasiades in the same suite in which he has his office. **********Zissis Constantinou, one of Mr. Anastasiades's lawyers, said today that the trial would be the first in Greece on wiretapping charges. **********The conversation that Ethnos published involved Mr. Anastasiades and Panayotis Zotos. Speaking shortly after Mr. Bobolas had filed suit against Mr. Anastasiades, the two discussed the Anastasiades book and Soviet ''disinformation'' tactics. In an article accompanying the extracts, Ethnos presented the conversation as one between two agents of the Central Intelligence Agency. **********The newspaper asserted that the ''agents,'' Mr. Anastasiades and Mr. Zotos, discussed plans to murder Ethnos personnel, destabilize democratic institutions in Greece and extend such activities to other European countries. Nothing in the published excerpts supported these accusations. **********Ethnos said in its article that it possessed ''tens of tapes'' of Mr. Anastasiades's conversations. It said they had been mailed anonymously to the newspaper by people it described as members of Mr. Anastasiades's ''group of agents who apparently disagreed with the murderous plans of their bosses and decided to warn us against the intentions of this ruthless group.''  Anonymous Caller Cited **********Testifying before a magistrate investigating the case against them, the publisher and the editor said they had not been involved in the wiretapping. They said their only contact with the tappers was an anonymous telephone call advising them of the particular interest of the tape that Ethnos subsequently published. **********Mr. Bobolas and Mr. Filipopoulos said they had considered it their duty to inform the public of the purported conspiracy against Ethnos. **********The prosecutor accused them of initiating the tapping when they failed to produce the parcel in which they said the tapes had been mailed. He accused Mr. Bobolas and Mr. Filipopoulos of violating, ''jointly and with intent,'' a constitutional guarantee of privacy of communications. **********Mr. Filipopoulos and Mr. Bobolas declined to comment on the accusations. **********Meanwhile, Mr. Anastasiades is appealing to the Supreme Court for a new trial in the libel case. In his earlier appeal, the public prosecutor said that Ethnos was ''evidently pro-Soviet'' and that some of the Soviet publishing officials with whom Mr. Bobolas had dealings as a publisher of Soviet books in Greek translation might have been K.G.B. agents. But he said this did not justify the contentions of Mr. Anastasiades's book."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/12/world/shultz-says-soviet-olympicdecision-is-part-of-plan-to-freeze-ties.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1984-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 908, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SHULTZ SAYS SOVIET OLYMPICDECISION IS PART OF PLAN TO 'FREEZE' TIES", "print_headline": "SHULTZ SAYS SOVIET OLYMPICDECISION IS PART OF PLAN TO 'FREEZE' TIES", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today that the Soviet decision not to attend the Olympic Games in Los Angeles this summer was part of an overall Soviet plan to put relations with the United States ''in a sort of deep freeze.'' **********Today Vietnam and Mongolia, two of the Soviet Union's Asian Communist allies, joined in the Soviet-backed move to boycott the Los Angeles Games. After the Russians announced their decision Tuesday not to attend, Bulgaria and East Germany were the first two nations to follow suit. Others are expected to do the same soon. **********State Department officials said they had received word that Moscow was applying diplomatic pressure on certain African countries, like Ethiopia, which receive considerable aid from Moscow, to stay away from Los Angeles.   Reports of Soviet Debate **********Some State Department officials said that there were unconfirmed intelligence reports circulating in the West that the Soviet decision on the Olympics was made after a spirited debate within the Soviet leadership. According to these reports, officials said, the Soviet K.G.B., its state security agency, as well as Dmitri F. Ustinov, the Defense Minister, and Grigory V. Romanov, who has jurisdiction over the internal security, argued strongly that the risks of defection and possible harm to Soviet participants made it necessary to avoid the Games. **********State Department officials also said that they had been told by East European diplomats that the East Europeans were not consulted by the Soviet Union beforehand and that the Hungarians, in particular, resented being forced into a position where they will have to go along with the boycott.   Olympic Chief to Keep Trying **********In Lausanne, Switzerland, Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Spaniard who is president of the International Olympic Committee, said he would ''fight to the last minute,'' which is June 2, to change the minds of Soviet leaders. **********He said he was waiting for Soviet permission to fly to Moscow to try to speak directly with Konstantin U. Chernenko, the Soviet leader. He made public the text of a letter from President Reagan to him, pledging that the United States would fulfill all its responsibilities as host of the games. **********Addressing the American Society of Newspaper Editors convention in Washington, Mr. Shultz said the Soviet justifications for staying away from the Games were not credible because ''tremendous efforts have been made and continue to be made by the United States to insure the security for the Olympics and a warm welcome for the athletes.'' **********''Right now,'' he said, ''we see the Soviet Union engaged in a tactic of negotiation that involves withdrawal, that involves a kind of scare campaign, and that involves a sort of deep freeze. We will not be intimidated.''  Election Seen as Factor Other Administration officials said Moscow appeared to have decided to avoid doing anything that could possibly seem to benefit President Reagan's re-election. **********The decision by Vietnam and Mongolia, two countries heavily dependent on Soviet military support, to stay away from the Olympics was not unexpected. It is anticipated that all the Warsaw Pact countries except Rumania will not attend. It is not known whether Cuba, which also depends on Soviet support, will also stay away.   Reagan Letter on Olympics **********Mr. Reagan's letter to the International Olympic Committee president was dated Tuesday, the day the Russians pulled out and also the day Mr. Reagan met with Mr. Samaranch. In the letter Mr Reagan said ''the Olympic Games should not be used for political purposes.'' **********''Athletes and Olympic officials of all countries will find a warm welcome in Los Angeles and will be treated equally and without discrimination,'' he said, ''in accord with the Olympic Charter and Olympic spirit.'' **********He also said all Federal agencies had been ordered to cooperate fully with Olympic and local officials ''to insure the safety of all participants.'' **********Soviet Scorns Reagan Assurances **********MOSCOW, May 11 - The official Soviet press agency Tass today scorned assurances given by President Reagan on the safety of athletes who will compete in Los Angeles.  ''The U.S. President has issued promises and assurances whose name is legion,'' a Tass commentary said. ''In reality, however, they proved to be nothing but a fig leaf to cover Washington's perfidy.'' **********Efforts to persuade the Kremlin to reverse its decision gained momentum tonight with the arrival here of Mario Vazquez Rana, president of the Paris- based Association of National Olympic Committees, who was asked by Mr. Samaranch to make the trip. **********Says Andropov Was Better **********LOS ANGELES, May 11 - The head of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee suggested today that if Yuri V. Andropov, the former Soviet leader, who died in February, were still alive, the Soviet Union would be planning to send athletes to the Games. **********''The change in power there has had a very negative effect on these Games,'' said Peter V. Ueberroth, president of the Olympic Committee. **********He said several high-ranking sports officials in the Soviet Union were replaced by Mr. Andropov after he succeeded Leonid I. Brezhnev as the Soviet leader in 1982. **********From that point, Mr. Ueberroth said, relations with Soviet Olympic officials gradually improved. They reached a high point, he said, when Konstantin Andrianov, head of the Soviet delegation to the International Olympic Committee, praised preparations for the Los Angeles Games in an I.O.C. meeting at Sarajevo, Yugoslavia."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/08/world/argentine-parties-sign-a-peace-accord.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Schumacher", "pub_date": "1984-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 667, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARGENTINE PARTIES SIGN A PEACE ACCORD", "print_headline": "ARGENTINE PARTIES SIGN A PEACE ACCORD", "body_text": " **********President Raul Alfonsin and former President Isabel Martinez de Peron signed an accord today that officials called a triumph in Mr. Alfonsin's drive for national unity. **********The accord, signed also in a nationally televised ceremony by the leaders of a dozen other parties smaller than the Peronists, sets principles for dealing with a host of issues that have been threatening the country's six-month- old democracy. **********Among the principles are that the country should repay its foreign debt, undertake limited economic austerity and use its advancing nuclear technology only for peaceful ends. **********The signing came as presidential aides reported that agreement with the International Monetary Fund was expected soon on an austerity plan that would open the way for refinancing Argentina's $45 billion foreign debt. **********Mr. Alfonsin has ordered that negotiations with an I.M.F. team here end before he leaves on an official visit to Spain on Sunday, the aides said. If no agreement is reached by then, they said, he has ordered that Argentina present its own plan to the I.M.F. board of directors in Washington with the goal of forcing the United States and other industrial nations represented on the board to overrule the I.M.F. staff. **********Agreement Seen as Crucial The accord on national unity and an I.M.F. agreement have been seen as crucial as labor strikes grow, inflation, now at nearly 600 percent, refuses to be brought under control and the international financial community grows increasingly jittery that Argentina might default on its debt, upsetting the world financial system. **********The Government had been dragging its feet in the I.M.F. negotiations, partly because it was waiting to achieve some consensus in the national unity accord. The accord now also paves the way for an expected agreement by the weekend with the country's powerful Peronist unions over union elections. **********''I think that today we have inaugurated a new political style in the country,'' Mr. Alfonsin said in a short address after the signing. He stressed ''the high democratic spirit, the understanding of the necessity of working with a sense of national unity that has permeated the political leadership.'' **********He noted that the agreement did not imply an end to political differences and criticisms, but said it ''is linked to that Argentine spiritual necessity of marching united in the basic and fundamental aspects to achieve among all of us the country we deserve.'' **********The 15-point accord comes after two weeks of almost daily talks between Mr. Alfonsin and opposition political leaders. With the signing by Mr. Alfonsin and Mrs. Peron, the accord brings together the country's two largest parties, the Radicals and the Peronists, who shared 92 percent of the vote in last year's presidential elections. **********Among other parties represented were the Movement for Integration and Development and the left-of-center Christian Democrats, who with provincial parties that also signed are critical in building coalitions in the Congress. **********Some Parties Balk More extreme parties to the right and the left, including the socialist Intransigents, the Communist Party and the conservative Democratic Center Union, boycotted the accord. They mostly complained that it lacked specifics. **********The accord pledges the Government to increase the real wages of workers and reactivate the economy while renegotiating the foreign debt. It calls only for paying the country's ''legitimate'' debt, which means the Goverment may not recognize some loans obtained abroad by individuals and companies entirely for the purpose of speculation. **********The call for austerity was implied in the need to lower inflation, but it was qualified by saying that reactivation of the economy was more important. **********The accord was largely made possible by the evident moderation of Mrs. Peron, who returned two weeks ago from living in Spain to lead the Peronists in the talks.

Instead, Wall Street is a place where ''the little guy is always wrong,'' and a contrary outlook on life is elevated into an investment theology. No single source is more perversely surprising than the fruits of academic research. The professors, combing through millions of transactions with their computers, have an affinity for against-the-grain results. **********A Tale of Coattails **********In the executive suites, tender offers, proxy fights, greenmail and other takeover maneuvers are as popular as the closing hour at a college bar. Shareholders may have a warmer view. Whatever they do for the executive digestion, the corporate raiders and their tribe often make money for other stockholders, or so a new study has found. **********The study, from the Alfred P. Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, traced share prices in some 500 cases in which a company or individual acquired a toehold interest - 5 percent or more - in another concern. Richard S. Ruback of M.I.T., working with Wayne H. Mikkelson of the University of Oregon, found that stock prices typically rose about 4.5 percent in the nine days before the toehold was announced and 5 percent in the two days surrounding the announcement. **********In episodes that ended with the target company's being taken over - either by the original stalker or by someone else - shareholders saw their holdings rise another 13 percent between the takeover announcement and the time they tendered their stock. In cases where the suitor sold his shares to a third party, stockholders saw their holdings rise an added 2 percent between the time a toehold was disclosed and the time the suitor sold. And even in cases of ''greenmail,'' where a suitor ended the takeover attempt by selling his shares to the company itself at a premium, the target company's shareholders nevertheless came out ahead. As one would expect, they saw their share prices decline when the suitor was bought out. But the losses were less than earlier gains, and shareholders typically ended up ahead about 1.7 percent. **********Only in one outcome - unsuccessful takeovers - did shareholders fail to gain. Stock prices rose when the takeover try was announced, but those gains were erased when the takeover was thwarted, leaving the price of the shares unchanged. ''Shareholders very much benefit from takeovers,'' Professor Ruback concluded. ''Other evidence suggests that when managers resist advances - when takeovers become hostile - shareholders can get paid bigger premiums over the current value of their shares.'' **********Interest Rates **********Why are interest rates so high? The answers always seem the same: Federal deficits, competition for funds, inflation fears. But a study taking a notably different view is under way at the Amos Tuck School of business administration at Dartmouth College. It stands the conventional wisdom on its head. **********According to Dennis E. Logue, a professor at Tuck, the foreign exchange markets are the key to understanding interest rates. The orthodox view holds that foreigners, attracted by high interest rates here, bid up the dollar's value as they buy dollars to buy dollar-denominated debt. But Professor Logue contends that cause and effect go the other way: that interest rates remain high because foreign investors expect the dollar to fall. They therefore demand a higher return now to compensate them for the day when the dollar will buy less of their own currency. ''There is no doubt that foreign investors are seeking an interest return for the risk of a dollar demise,'' Professor Logue said. **********To forecast interest rates, Professor Logue suggests watching the foreign exchange markets. If the current exchange rate, the spot rate for dollars, is falling, one can expect interest rates to decline. That is because when the dollar has already fallen, foreign investors will be less fearful that a depreciating dollar will erode their earnings. **********Trends in forward rates - the rates on contracts to buy and sell dollars in the future - are also telling. If the forward rate begins approaching the spot rate, that generally implies that investors believe the dollar will be steady in the near future. That, in turn, means interest rates should edge down as fears of a dollar depreciation wane. If, by comparison, a wide difference persists between spot and forward rates, interest rates should remain high as foreign investors try to guard against losses. **********Professor Logue and a team of researchers are working on a model to trace a precise mathematical relationship between changes in interest rates and movements in foreign exchange. ''Most of the pieces you see written about interest rates focus on the U.S. alone,'' he said. ''Yet rates are not determined in a vacuum, and you really have to focus on the foreign-exchange markets to get an idea for what is going on.'' **********'Inefficient' Markets **********Wall Street spends its existence trying to beat the market in a big way, but according to a substantial body of academic research, investors stand very little chance of making a killing, no matter how much research they do. **********According to the ''efficient market'' theory, very few stocks are so undervalued that they can yield outsized profits for individual investors. Money managers and other professionals are probing and evaluating stocks so constantly that pertinent data about any given stock is quickly incorporated into its price. As a result, even if the small investor does his own homework, it seldom pays off. Or so the theory runs. **********Now, a new study from the Graduate School of Management at the University of California at Los Angeles gives addi- tional credence to efficient markets. The study, by Bradford Cornell, focuses on bank stocks. Professor Cornell studied 50 bank stocks both before and after the banks were required to disclose Latin American problem loans country by country. He found that stock prices responded similarly before and after the disclosures, indicating that the market had already figured out a bank's loan problems and reflected that riskiness in the stock price. **********''The response of the market to Latin events was very similar in 1982 and 1983,'' Professor Cornell said. ''The market effectively inferred loan exposure to individual countries.'' Indeed, for small investors, he said, the results suggest that ''time spent picking a stock is not the best use of your time.'' **********''An investor would be wiser to consider things like what it will cost to buy and sell stocks and how much faith he has in his brokerage firm,'' Professor Cornell said. **********Playing a Quiet Corner **********A finance professor at New York University says he has discovered a market that is too new to be always efficient. Thus it harbors the potential for huge profits for those with mathematical expertise. That market, says Stephen C. Figlewski, is stock index futures, in which investors pick the direction of the market as a whole without having to pick the movement of a specific stock. **********Stock index futures, which have been hailed on Wall Street as a way to hedge a portfolio, are so new and complex, Professor Figlewski says, that arbitragers and other professionals do not yet dominate it. As a result, index futures are not always an efficient market. Rather, they are often priced either too high or too low in relation to the index they are based on. In theory, investors can earn substantial profits either by buying stocks and selling index futures or by selling stocks and buying index futures. **********''The risk-return trade-off has in fact been broken,'' said Professor Figlewski, who has himself made a fair amount of money in the market. ''It's a rare opportunity that few people know about, and it won't last forever. In time, arbitrage always sets in.'' **********To understand how it works, assume that stock index futures are priced too high. An investor has, say, a $50,000 portfolio of 15 diversified blue-chip stocks, selected carefully to perform in line with the New York Stock Exchange Composite index, which at the time is at 100. The investor then sells a futures contract based on the composite index at a price of 105 - 5 more than the index. (That contract represents a commitment by the investor to pay $500 times the difference between the selling price of the futures contract - 105 - and the value of the index when the contract expires). **********When the stock index future expires, however, the New York Stock Exchange index, say, did not go up, but remained at 100. As a result, the index future's value dropped to 100. So the investor buys back the futures contract at 100, making $2,500 (the saving of 5 on the index future's price times $500). He also makes money from dividends on the stocks he owns. **********If the index had fallen to 90, the investor would have lost on the stocks he owned but gained handsomely on the index future. **********Conversely, if the index had gone up to 110, his stocks would have increased in value, but he would have lost on the index future. In either case, he would have come out ahead. **********The same example holds true if stock index futures are underpriced, for instance, a future is selling for 95 when the index is at 100. In this instance, the investor would sell his $50,000 in stocks and put the money in, say, a money market fund earning 12 percent, and then buy index futures. **********The trick, of course, is knowing whether the stock index futures are underpriced or overpriced. **********According to Professor Figlewski, a simple formula tells what the stock index future's price should be, if the market were efficient. Take whatever the index is, say 100, and add the interest rate that an investor would make on his money if it were invested in a money market fund or Treasury bills, say 10 percent. Then subtract the dividend rate, for example, 4 percent. In this case the answer is 106, so if index futures were selling above or below that, then clearly the market is inefficient, Professor Figlewski said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/05/business/consumer-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONSUMER RATES", "print_headline": "CONSUMER RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/16/business/lockheed-payout.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lockheed Payout", "print_headline": "Lockheed Payout", "body_text": " **********The Lockheed Corporation declared a quarterly dividend of 15 cents a share, the first dividend on common stock since December 1969, Roy Anderson, the company's chairman, said at the annual meeting.

At OPEC's rancorous two-week London meeting in March 1983, Sheik Otaiba caused a stir with his rhymed criticism of the group's slow negotiating habits and the obstinacy of Nigeria, the nation that sparked this year's emergency meeting by cutting its prices. The London meeting resulted in an official price cut of $5 a barrel to $29. **********This year, Sheik Otaiba's poem, titled ''From The London Conference to the Geneva Conference'' and dated Oct. 28, 1984, cautions: ''London's nightmare lives on in memory/Will it, dear friends, regain reality?'' **********Sheik Otaiba was unavailable to explain his poetry. Perhaps exhibiting the traditional poetic whimsy, he slept through his first interview appointment with a New York Times reporter, and he did not return from a daylong trip to West Germany in time for his second appointment. But his poem itself contains some hints: ''In verse I find a bountiful largess/A great refuge at times of much distress.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/16/business/business-people-3-executive-changes-set-by-bristol-myers.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1984-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 Executive Changes Set by Bristol-Myers", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; 3 Executive Changes Set by Bristol-Myers", "body_text": " **********The Bristol-Myers Company yesterday announced three executive changes, including the appointment of John W.

A senior committee aide, asked if the chairman preferred no bill at all this year, parried, saying, ''If you asked the chairman, he would say he won't know the answer to that question until he holds hearings.'' Given the brief time Congress will be in session this election year, Mr. St Germain's schedule appears to leave little time for passage of a major deregulation bill. **********The caustic tone of Mr. St Germain's prepared speech was the clearest indication yet that he is philosopically cool to efforts by banks - that are largely supported by the Administration - to deregulate banking further. **********''The proponents of instant deregulation,'' he declared, ''hang their arguments on a questionable premise - that banks and other depository institutions are just like other businesses.'' **********Last fall, Senator Jake Garn, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, introduced a bill that would let bank holding companies get into a broad array of non-banking activities, including real estate, insurance brokerage and some securities services. **********Senator Garn, a Utah Republican, has vowed that legislation would be passed in Congress this session, but many bankers have questioned whether such a bill could be enacted without the support of Mr. St Germain. Until now, Mr. St Germain has given no indication that he would back such a measure. **********Mr. St Germain also charged that banks had used deregulation as a means for selecting affluent customers at the expense of the poor and elderly. **********''The move to affluent markets, and away from the blue collar, the elderly and the less well-to-do is being accomplished through an elaborate fee system that effectively prices the 'undesirables' out of the banks,'' Mr. St Germain said. **********''Some banks clearly don't like to deal with senior citizens,'' he said. ''One solution is to charge fees of $2 to $3 per Social Security check or in some cases a full 1 percent of the check.'' He did not give the names of any such banks. **********Mr. St Germain suggested that Congress make banks that seek broad deregulation pay a price, the loss of Federal deposit insurance and ''Government assistance.'' The result, he said, would be two classes of banks, a deregulated class ''that operates in the more rarefied air of the affluent'' and a regulated class that offers ''essential utility functions'' and retains Federal insurance.'' He did not explain what he meant by ''utility functions.'' **********Reacting to the speech, Gerald Lowrie, executive director of government relations for the American Bankers Association, said that Mr. St Germain ''has a very interesting way to say he wants to hear from us.''

As the new senior vice president for sales and marketing of Group W Satellite Communications, he is in charge of selling The Nashville Network to cable system operators and to advertisers. **********That network, he is quick to point out, has the potential of each day delivering 12 million of those folks, folks who buy American, be it cars or beer or camera film. The cheese people at Kraft love them. So, too, the boot makers at Acme and the jeans makers at Wrangler. **********The network is delivering the heartland and the heartland is everywhere. ''Stand up for your country'' is the new promotion theme that has taken over from ''The network for people who love their country.'' **********TNN is owned by Opryland USA, Nashville's gift to music lovers, and it is Opryland that produces the six new hours of nightly programming that are repeated twice the following day for an 18-hour daily programming package. **********Since Group W gets a commission on all of the advertising it sells and advertising rates are dependent on the number of viewers, Mr. Werner's people are in the midst of a big promotion effort to get more viewers. And since even the most ardent country fan cannot watch if the cable system is not carrying it, the thrust of the advertising is to get viewers to prod operators with what Group W has called a Countrygram. **********Commercials running on six other advertiser-supported cable networks ask that viewers call an 800 number and request that TNN send a Countrygram to the viewer's cable operator. **********The tactic was tested last year from September to mid-December on radio stations in 30 markets and on television in Tulsa, Okla., and Eugene, Ore. It worked, but Mr. Werner and his people were concerned about the amount of waste: all of those people who were being reached who did not have cable. That is when they decided to put the bait where most of the fish are and move their commercials to the advertiser-supported cable networks. **********So there are now a total of twenty 30-second spots running each week on ESPN, Lifetime, USA, CBN, the Weather Channel and WTBS. Missing from the list are CNN, which wanted too much money, Mr. Werner said, and MTV, whose audience is younger than TNN wants. **********Group W is spending $500,000, which is only half of what it put into its fall test, but more than any other cable network has spent for self- promotion on cable, Mr. Werner believes. And this too is a test. **********''If it is successful, I suspect we could be advertising 30 to 40 weeks of the year,'' Mr. Werner said. **********The cable TV advertising is being created in-house and features bits of the programming and shots of the stars. The advertising aimed at the advertising trade has been created by Slater, Hanft, Martin. In addition to appearing in the advertising trade press, it ran in The New York Times, New York magazine and New York regional editions of Time, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and Business Week. **********Some of the advertiser-supported cable networks charge operators a fee based on the number of their subscribers, so they have two income sources. TNN has only the advertiser's money, and it has eight minutes - sixteen 30-second units - to sell in each hour. The network gives an additional two minutes an hour to the operators. **********According to Mr. Werner, a prime time 30-second spot on TNN goes for $800 to $1,000. And while all of the network's commercial time is being used, only half is purchased by regular advertisers paying regular rates. The rest, Mr. Werner said, features either direct marketers or other direct sales outfits that pay the network a certain amount for each inquiry they get."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/07/world/where-the-atomic-age-began-life-is-workaday.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1984-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1054, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WHERE THE ATOMIC AGE BEGAN, LIFE IS WORKADAY", "print_headline": "WHERE THE ATOMIC AGE BEGAN, LIFE IS WORKADAY", "body_text": " **********The TalkofHiroshima **********HIROSHIMA, Japan, Feb. 3 - The auto workers could not get to their jobs on time at Toyo Kogyo, the big factory better known to Americans as Mazda. It had snowed, surprisingly and heavily, that morning, clogging traffic. That slowed the assembly line by an hour or two, delaying production of 300 cars and trucks, but the workers put in overtime and the plant was back on schedule by nighttime. **********The day before, the Hiroshima Toyo Carp baseball team hired a new fielding coach, then left for pre-season camp in Okinawa. **********A welfare program for single fathers fell into trouble. The idea was to provide housekeepers for them five days a month, but only six men have taken advantage of the service and now the city wants to spend its money on something else. **********In one neighborhood, residents sought advice on the best use for a community hall that is in demand by too many groups.   The News Is Prosaic **********That's the news from Hiroshima this week - not much for the global- minded, perhaps, but the news nonetheless. **********This is just a workaday city, with 921,000 people, electric trolleys, 2.4 million library books, broad boulevards, a dozen burglaries a year, a few graceful parks, many not-so- graceful buildings, 1,500 bars, an island-studded harbor and a movie house showing a revival of ''Deadline U.S.A.'' with Humphrey Bogart. **********Visitors come all the time, most, probably all, burdened with knowledge of the United States nuclear attack that destroyed the city on Aug. 6, 1945. It is what makes Hiroshima special. It is why they come. But then they stroll around and see that it is a city - better than some, less attractive than others, with shops and restaurants and schoolchildren in dark uniforms - and they are reassured by the ordinariness. Maybe that is how it should be, said Minoru Ohmuta, who writes about atomic bomb survivors for the Hiroshima newspaper, Chugoku Shimbun. **********''People's concerns are basically with the future,'' Mr. Ohmuta said the other day. ''The past is past. It has its meaning. It remains deep in people's minds. But it rarely comes to the surface.'' **********Of course, Hiroshima cannot help looking back. **********Sometimes, the stimulus comes from outside, as it did last weekend when the much-traveled American television version of nuclear war, ''The Day After,'' came to town. The film had been playing elsewhere in Japan for two weeks, and it was greeted with an initial burst of curiosity at Hiroshima's Ritz Theater, although attendance fell away midweek. Still, about 4,500 people went the first two days, more than had gone for the opening of ''E.T.,'' which in Japan, as in the United States, says something. **********Afterward, bomb victims living in Hiroshima said much what survivors elsewhere had been saying - it was good that such a film had been made but the cinematic carnage was ''too pretty,'' in the words of Mitsuko Yoshioka, who writes poems about the nuclear ordeal that afflicted her city when she was 18 years old. **********Heiwa, the Japanese word for peace, is a commonplace here. Heiwa is the name of a park, a boulevard, a bridge and a museum. There are the Heiwa Diner, Heiwa Cosmetic Surgery and Heiwa Garage, just to name a few. There is even a Heiwa Demolition Company. **********Local officials have an idea that Hiroshima should become an ''International Peace and Culture City,'' but what that may mean is hard to tell. It could mean more visitors, and that would be desirable because the city's economy could use a spark. The latest thought came last week - a man- made offshore island, where a convention center and exhibition halls could be built, presumably for use by those wishing international peace and culture. **********To a degree, Hiroshima's problems are the concerns of any big city. **********After the war and the tens of thousands of deaths that it brought, the population was reduced to about 137,000. By 1955, it was back to its pre- war level of 350,000, and now it is approaching three times that number. Fifty-six percent of the people have lived here less than 10 years.   Expansion Peters Out **********For a while, the boom was a blessing. The economy was growing by 20 percent a year, and factories kept being built - 2,800 of them - including major employers such as Toyo Kogyo and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. **********But the expansion did not last. The oil crisis hurt Hiroshima as it did the rest of Japan, and while the city grew to eight times its prewar size, it was running out of room. It is surrounded on three sides by mountains and on the fourth by the Inland Sea, and so when factories needed more space for expansion they found space was the one thing Hiroshima did not have. Through the 1970's, more than 100 manufacturing companies packed up and left. In the meantime, Hiroshima has had to contend with the full assortment of urban ailments from traffic jams to inadequate sewer systems. **********Inevitably, the road leads to the Peace Memorial Park, astride the center of the explosion that killed more than 100,000 people. **********Last year, 1.2 million visitors came to the adjacent museum. They walked past exhibits demonstrating the atomic bomb's physical properties and giving brief scientific explanations of what had occurred, past fragments of buildings and people's personal lives, past those terrible, familiar pictures of burned bodies and ulcerated faces, of keloids and twisted limbs and bleeding gums and scarred children - it goes on and on, an album of horror. **********Once outdoors again, the visitors see the skeletal remains of the Hiroshima Industrial Promotion Hall, the one central-city building still standing from 1945. It is commonly called the Atomic Bomb Dome. **********''There is a story,'' said Akihiro Takahashi, a bomb victim who heads the Hiroshima Peace Culture Foundation. In 1966, he said, an issue arose over whether to destroy the Dome or to preserve it. Most of the Hiroshima survivors wanted it torn down, but city officials overrode them and so the old hall stands. **********''That was a good decision,'' Mr. Takahashi said. People need physical reminders, he said, that once, not long ago, something happened here."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/22/business/saturday-review-sold.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 312, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Saturday Review Sold", "print_headline": "Saturday Review Sold", "body_text": " **********Saturday Review, once a weekly journal of literature and the arts but moribund since January, was sold today by Jeffrey Gluck to a group of investors headed by Paul Dietrich of Washington, president of the nonprofit National Center for Legislative Research. **********The new owners said they hope to get out a summer issue, then resume monthly publication this fall. **********The 60-year-old magazine has most recently been published as a bimonthly, but no issue has appeared since the January-February number, according to DuPre Jones, who will be a senior editor. **********Mr. Jones said two more issues have been prepared, and they may be combined and sent to subscribers as a double summer issue.

Others, he asserts, have shot themselves because of disclosures he has printed about their private lives. Still more, he reckons, live in trembling of what he might publish in the future. **********Mr. Smith, in short, has cast himself as a nation's conscience. **********The Windhoek Observer, now six years old, is one of southern Africa's most talked-about and irreverent publications. Each week, for instance, it carries a full-page picture of a seminude woman, challenging the morality laws that extend from South Africa to this territory under its domination. **********Its editorials rail against Pretoria's occupation of South-West Africa, which the United Nations calls illegal, and against what Mr. Smith calls the duplicity and double lives led by prominent figures in the territory. **********The paper is locked in a running battle with the Dutch Reformed Church, the institution that provides the theological spine of Afrikanerdom and the scriptural justification for the policies of racial separation. Its accusations are sweeping, attributed to ambiguously described sources and laden with innuendo. Mr. Smith says it reflects a white society that lives what he calls a ''pious lie'' in a city with the population - and the proclivities - of Peyton Place.   Journalist for 27 Years **********Mr. Smith has been active as a journalist in South-West Africa for 27 years. His father made a living hauling ox wagons for the Imperial German colonizers who survived here until 1915. His mother belonged to the Afrikaner pioneers who pushed northward, deep into Angola. **********At the age of 51, he is a man much tormented with visions of his nation and its people that verge on the apocalyptic. The language of his anguish is Old Testament rather than New, laced, nonetheless, with intimations of lust. **********Of South Africa's domination of South-West Africa, widely known as Namibia, he said in an interview: ''We are like the little stepdaughter that comes into the house and is told by the stepfather to wash the dishes, and is told how dependent she is. But then, at night, she is raped, night after night.'' Mr. Smith is a fervent Namibian nationalist, seeking a single nation ''under one flag'' without South African rule. **********On what he calls the duplicitous lives of high-ranking clergy and government officials: ''In the day they are upholders of morality. At night they appear in the devil's attire.'' It is a world, it seems, with no grayness between sunlight and satanic night. **********If the Dutch Reformed Church moves against him, he said in an interview at the white-painted bungalow here that is the headquarters of The Windhoek Observer, ''I have told them that I will start a series on the nocturnal lives of certain top office-bearers.'' In his columns, he has been more direct, speaking of church elders ''having nicknames as a result of their sex escapades with women, in some cases little black girls aged 10 to 12.''  Paper Is Widely Read **********In the world of the Dutch Reformed Church here, with its rebuttal of miscegenation and insistence on a messianic role for white morality, that's fighting talk. And in Windhoek's small world, among a population of only 90,000, it spells trouble. Mr. Smith compares his relationship with the authorities to ''running away from a man with a knife and pleading with him not to kill you.'' **********With a print run of between 8,500 and 11,000 a week, The Observer may seem small, but only in circlation. It is probably the most widely read newspaper in the land, and, to outsiders at least, its idiosyncratic style provides a not-to-be-missed break from the slavish loyalty displayed by some, but not all, Windhoek newspapers to various party lines. **********In a recent issue, for instance, Mr. Smith printed, in full, the United States State Department report on human rights in South-West Africa. He highlighted, on the front page, an article on a purported party at which senior military officials entertained the Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, used a military aircraft to fly in more liquor and decorated the table with about $15,000 worth of Krugerrand gold coins. **********The newspaper, much of which is written by Mr. Smith himself, then went on to question the probity of a Windhoek city councilor. On page 52, as on every back page, the space was occupied by an unidentified woman wearing only the lower part of a leopard- skin bikini. Such brazenness is unrivaled in the southern African press.   'I Am Going It Alone' **********The newspaper also reported fully on Mr. Smith's withdrawal from the National Press Union, an umbrella organization of newspaper proprietors. ''I am going it alone, for such is my fate,'' Mr. Smith wrote. ''What is left for me before I enter the incinerator of the Windhoek Crematorium? Quite simple. To stand up in defense of the truth, and to resist to the last day of my sublunary existence the rot that is the practice in my country.'' **********His editorial, then, revolved around a favored theme: South Africa's ''plundering'' of South-West Africa's resources, and what Mr. Smith sees as the hypocrisy of Pretoria's claim to be a defender of this country against Communist advance. **********''You are hailed as a fighter against the Red Peril when you have stolen masses of the limited natural wealth of a poverty-stricken people who live in oppression in a system that is so criminal that it does not even provide a man with the basics which the country of his birth owes him - schooling, a job and something to eat.'' **********Mr. Smith does not think such broadsides guarantee his newspaper much by way of longevity. He has just received, he said, an order to register with the authorities that could be the precursor of the newspaper's demise. **********His newspaper, he said, ''came into this world not in the garment of the newly born.'' ''It came in the garment of death'' because, he said, of its opposition to South Africa's rule here. ''How far can a man maneuver before he is outmaneuvered?''  A Passion for His Work **********He is a man, it seems, seized with passions for his work. He drives 5,000 to 6,000 miles a month in quest of stories and disclosures, noting where government trucks are heading, probing their business, investigating, recently, an abandoned mine inhabited by poverty- stricken people who eke a living from the last scratches of minerals left there. **********The twin windmills against which he tilts are South Africa's domination and what he says are the moral double- standards among people in office. And that poses questions, for the crusader, after all, should not be given to the same mendacity as his victims. **********So his confession is public. ''I like women,'' he said, ''I like nice girls and nice women and I will like them to the last days of my life.'' No coyness there, in other words, no conflict of interest. He even speaks up in favor of the establishment of a ''proper house of pleasure'' here. **********But what of those of his victims who he says have taken their lives rather than face the opprobrium of publicity in the pages of The Windhoek Observer, serving a community so small and interlocked that names do not need to be named for identities to be established? **********''I have forced certain people to suicide,'' Mr. Smith said in the interview, ''and I'm not unhappy about it because they did nothing to help my country.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/28/business/finance-new-issues-jones-intercable-debenture-filing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": ";  Jones Intercable Debenture Filing", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; ;  Jones Intercable Debenture Filing", "body_text": " **********Jones Intercable Inc. said it had filed a registration statement with the S.E.C. relating to a proposed public offering of $30 million of subordinated debentures.

The company is investing heavily on the theory that the market will prosper abroad and will eventually come home. **********The theory runs counter to recent experience in this country, where electric customers, utility regulators and even electric companies are questioning whether more nuclear plants will ever be built. **********About $15 billion has been spent in the United States on plants canceled or abandoned since the late 1970's, and the costs of the surviving construction projects are threatening to raise electric rates by more than 50 percent in some areas. A few utilities are near bankruptcy. **********But the Westinghouse Electric Corporation is anticipating a long-term return to nuclear power in this country as well as orders from abroad and a growing business in servicing existing reactors. Each American reactor annually needs about $20 million for service, the company says. **********Japanese Joined in Project **********To be prepared, Westinghouse is putting new money into research and development. The company is paying for one-fourth of a $150 million project undertaken with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, five Japanese utilities and the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, to design an advanced reactor. Westinghouse describes it as an ''order of magnitude'' improvement over existing reactors. **********The company has also recently purchased nine small enterprises with highly technical specialties in reactor maintenance. **********''We are making the investment, and we are pushing the technology,'' said James S. Moore, vice president and general manager of Westinghouse's water reactor division. ''When we look at this business, we see a growth business,'' he said. **********Westinghouse dominated the first round of nuclear plant construction, supplying the nuclear portion of 35 of the 86 reactors now operating in this country and 21 of the 33 still under active construction. **********Biggest Reactor Exporter **********The company is the nation's leading reactor exporter, with 15 plants operating and 38 others under construction. Licensees in France and Japan have built additional plants. **********Westinghouse predicts that 25 or 26 plants will be ordered in the next five years in the worldwide market where Westinghouse can compete. That means outside France, Japan and West Germany, where domestic companies will manufacture their own reactors - sometimes under license from Westinghouse - and outside the Soviet Union and its satellites. Of the 25 or 26 projected orders, Westinghouse hopes to win 6 to 10 of them. **********Some experts on electric power, however, are predicting that fewer reactors will be built. At the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington-based research institution, Christopher Flavin, an analyst, declared in a study at the end of last year that nuclear power was ''stillborn'' in the third world and that cancellations would outpace orders. **********A recent survey by William Walker and Mans Lonnroth predicts an average of just two reactor orders a year worldwide for the next few years. **********Outlook for Domestic Orders **********Westinghouse expects no orders in this country in the next five years. **********Part of the company's strategy is that it can do better if it has a better product. The existing reactor model is complicated, and in the United States it is expensive to build. In addition, several of its components are prone to failure, requiring lengthy maintenance shutdowns. Designs have been criticized for safety reasons. **********The advanced reactor that Westinghouse is helping to design will use the same general plan, but Westinghouse believes there is substantial room for improving it. ''The plants coming out today were designed in the early 1970's,'' Mr. Moore noted. The advanced reactor is expected to go into service in Japan by 1993. **********The new design will differ from earlier efforts in this way: In the 1960's and 1970's, many American utilities started building reactors with only 20 percent of the design work done, but the new model is to be 70 to 80 percent designed before construction begins. Previously the idea was to save construction time - and, therefore, money - by starting to pour concrete without waiting for all of the reactor's design details. **********Development Work Pursued **********''We're doing the design, the up- front testing and development work,'' Mr. Moore said. ''These kinds of things we didn't do a lot of in the last few years.'' **********While Westinghouse will do most of the design work, according to Raymond A. George, manager of the advanced reactor program, the Japanese partners play a big role. ''Their contribution is disciplining us to make us follow through,'' he said. ''They're nit-picking us.'' **********The Japanese also contribute management expertise. Westinghouse officials say that reactors in Japan have been completed in 48 months, using 2,500 workers on a single shift. At some plants in this country, twice as many workers laboring twice as long have failed to finish the job. The length of the construction period is important to the final cost, utility officials say, because of the interest expense on tied-up capital. **********But Westinghouse is not conceding anything on design. ''We have not relinquished the technical lead whatsoever,'' said Mr. Moore. His company, he added, is selling robots for reactor maintenance to Japan. Westinghouse acquired Unimation Inc., a robot manufacturer, in early 1983. **********Review in Advance Is Sought **********The company has asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review the design in advance of the first reactor order in this country, so that a standardized product can be built, with simplified regulatory approval. **********The new reactor is to incorporate a host of changes, such as how to improve the reliability of parts. **********One major change will be to place the nuclear fuel lower in the reactor vessel, below the level of the pipes carrying cooling water, to reduce the risk that a pipe break could leave the core uncovered and let the fuel melt. **********Hardware changes, made to reduce the chance of accident, ''will avert radiation releases to the public as well as protecting a utility's plant investment,'' according to a paper prepared by a Westinghouse engineer, John Iacovino Jr. He said a combination of passive and active safety features had resulted in ''a more forgiving plant design.'' **********The pipes are being designed with fewer bends, to cut the accumulation of radioactive sediment. **********Less Exposure to Radiation **********And with a longer wait between refuelings, the new reactor is supposed to result in personnel radiation exposure totaling no more than 100 rem a year - a rem being a measure of such radiation. The average at existing American nuclear plants is about 680 rem a year, and the best record is 154 rem. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission sets an annual limit for any worker of 5 rem. **********The new reactor's control room will have computers that display extremely detailed information about temperatures, pressures and flows. **********The new design includes more ''dedicated'' equipment, intended specifically for use in emergencies, rather than making pumps and valves used in regular operations serve a second purpose in case of an accident. Thus fewer operator actions in an emergency will be required, according to the company. **********Another improvement, according to Westinghouse, is planned for the steam generators. These transfer heat from the pressurized, radioactive water to cold, clean water, which boils, creating steam. Steam generator leaks and repairs have been a major cause of plant shutdowns. **********Improvement in Availability **********The new reactor is intended to be available 90 percent of the time. Reactors in this country now are available only about two-thirds of the time because of shutdowns for refueling and repairs. **********No reactors have been ordered in the United States since 1978, when Commonwealth Edison ordered two from Westinghouse - and work on them never began. This is part of a general slowdown in the electric generation business, according to Westinghouse. Last year no large power plants of any type were ordered in this country, the company's officials say. But with the economic recovery, they point out, the utilities' load growth has resumed. **********''Nobody wants to talk about building,'' said Mr. Moore. ''But I think what's going on in the back rooms is they're struggling to figure out how to meet load in the mid-to-late 1990's. In a couple of years, somebody's going to be interested in buying something. We'd like them to be interested in buying nuclear.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/30/business/textile-import-rules.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Textile Import Rules", "print_headline": "Textile Import Rules", "body_text": " **********A bipartisan group of Senators, concerned that China could halt promised purchases of United States farm goods, urged President Reagan in a letter today to scrap new rules governing textile imports. **********Senator Nancy Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, organized the effort because of concerns that China might halt purchases of United States wheat."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/18/business/interest-rates-move-higher.html": {"writer_name": "Yla Eason", "pub_date": "1984-02-18", "snippet": "Interest rates rose yesterday when investors sold government securities because of growing fears that the Federal Reserve may tighten credit availability in response to the continuing strength in the economy.\n\n Following the upward revision yester...", "word_count": 512, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTEREST RATES MOVE HIGHER", "print_headline": "INTEREST RATES MOVE HIGHER", "body_text": " **********Interest rates rose yesterday when investors sold government securities because of growing fears that the Federal Reserve may tighten credit availability in response to the continuing strength in the economy. **********Following the upward revision yesterday of the fourth-quarter gross national product, traders reported scattered selling, which met low demand. **********In addition, a rumor that the Fed would raise the discount rate from its current 8.5 percent level encourged another round of selling pressure.

With the collapse last weekend of a small bank in Sandwich, Ill., the number of failures in 1984 rose to 79, the highest since 81 banks failed in 1938. **********To be sure, this year's failures are a far cry from the 4,000 or so banks that failed in 1933, when there was no insurance system in place to cushion the blow, either to depositors or to the economy as a whole. Nonetheless, the rash of failures reflects both the existence of trouble spots in the economy - including agriculture, energy and real estate - as well as the uneven capabilities of bankers. **********But if the numbers loom large, there are some comforting aspects to them. For one thing, most of the failed banks were relatively small institutions. Although their problems may have shaken their local communities, they represented only a small portion of the banking system, smaller even than in recent years. Deposits at failed banks this year totalled only $2.9 billion, well below the $5.4 billion last year and the $9.9 billion of the previous year. **********More importantly, this year's bank collapses had relatively little effect on the overall financial system, and few depositors lost any money. At the start of 1984, there were widespread concerns that loans to developing countries might sour, crippling the banking system. But the ''international debt crisis'' never quite crystallized. And when the giant Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago was threatened by a run on deposits in the face of huge problem loans to energy companies, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve System quickly pumped in money to keep it from failing. **********Problem-Bank List Swells **********Many analysts are surprised, however, that with the economy in its third year of recovery, many banks are still struggling to stay afloat. Indeed, as the year ended, the F.D.I.C.'s list of so-called problem banks swelled to a record 817, a number that has been growing since the beginning of 1983 and that included major banks as well as smaller ones. The previous record was in 1976, when 380 banks were on the list. **********Yet, many analysts believe that the fundamental strength of the banking system has improved considerably in recent months because the nation's biggest banks seem to be in sounder condition. **********''We're pretty close to full health,'' said Ronald I. Mandle, first vice president of Paine Webber Inc.   Third World Debt Crisis Eases **********Most analysts attribute that to an easing of the third world debt crisis. Agreements are being forged between most major debtor nations and the banks, reducing the likelihood of sudden defaults that could wipe out the net worths of a number of this nation's leading banking institutions. **********''No banks have failed because of country-debt problems,'' Mr. Mandle said. ''Even Argentina seems to be making progress.'' **********Rather, the biggest problems have been loans to the once-booming domestic energy and agricultural sectors, and to a lesser degree, real estate. To the surprise of many, including banking officials, most of the failures have been in what had been considered the more prosperous Sun Belt states. **********According to the F.D.I.C., there were no bank failures in New York State, in New England or in Pennsylvania, and only one in New Jersey and one in Michigan. But there were 11 failures in Tennessee; 6 in California and in Texas; 5 in Oklahoma, Texas, Oregon and Kansas, and 4 in Nebraska and Oklahoma. **********''We all sit around trying to figure out why there haven't been more failures in states with high unemployment,'' said a regulator who asked not to be named. ''We speculate that bankers in the Rust Belt have grown up dealing with adversities and know how to survive, and that bankers in areas that have been more prosperous still must learn how to deal with problems.'' **********Regulators say that it is usually difficult to attribute any bank failure to one factor. But in some cases the basic problem is readily apparent. **********An example of a bank that failed mainly because of farm loans was the David City Bank of David City, Neb. The bank had been ''struggling in a down agricultural economy and this factor was paramount in causing its insolvency,'' said Roger M. Beverage, Nebraska's director of banking and finance. The bank had deposits of $17.4 million. **********In the energy belt, the $25.2 million- deposit Community Bank and Trust Company of Enid, Okla., failed largely because of loans to the energy sector. And in California, the Heritage Bank in Anaheim, a relatively large bank, with deposits of $153.3 million, failed in March, mainly because of loans to real estate developers. **********Farther north, the depressed condition of the forestry industry contributed to the failures of two Oregon banks, the Bank of the Northwest in Eugene, and the United Bank of Oregon in Milwaukie.   Brokered Deposits Are Cited **********Banking authorities also attribute some of the problems to brokered deposits. Some bankers, they say, are so eager to grow that they pay brokers such high rates to get deposits that the money must be re-lent at extraordinarily high rates, and to high- risk credits. In most cases the brokers get the money in large denominations from investors and break the deposits down into chunks of $100,000, the maximum amount insured by the F.D.I.C. **********In some cases, banks receive brokered deposits with the understanding that they will make loans to specific borrowers. If the banks fail, the F.D.I.C. repays the depositors. **********At the Heritage Bank of Anaheim, for example, $97.5 million of its $153.3 million in deposits represented brokered funds. Similarly, of the $20.7 million of deposits in the Emerald Empire Banking Company of Springfield, Ore., $11.2 million, or more than 50 percent, came from brokers. **********In other cases, banking officials indicated that imprudent practices, such as loans to friends and associates, and illegal practices, such as embezzlement and fraud, had played a role in failures. **********Questionable practices appear to have been involved, for example, in many of the 11 bank failures in Tennessee this year. Most of these failures were connected to the collapse of the United American Bank of Knoxville, which was owned by Jacob F. Butcher, known as Jake. Mr. Butcher and his brother, Cecil Hilque, or C.H., together had interests in 27 banks with assets of about $3 billion. Jake Butcher has been indicted for bank fraud. **********Among the nation's biggest banks, none technically failed this year, but some were shaken. Government officials privately contend that Continental's takeover by the Government was an effective failure - its top executives were dismissed, most of its directors removed and its stockholders are expected to lose most, if not all, of their investment. But the Government's intervention avoided an actual failure of the nation's eighth- largest bank, which could have caused a chain reaction of bank failures.   Large Banks Not Immune **********In addition to Continental's problems, other large banks were experiencing serious troubles. In the third quarter, for example, the First Chicago Corporation, the parent holding company of the First National Bank of Chicago, the 10th largest in the United States, reported a $71.8 million loss. That was the result of large loan write-offs following a special examination by the Comptroller of the Currency, the chief regulator of federally chartered banks. Similar events occurred at large banks elsewhere in the United States, especially in Texas and Minneapolis. **********Other giant banks, including the Bank of America, in San Francisco, the second largest after Citibank, also reported heavy loan losses. **********At both First Chicago and Bank of America, the Comptroller forced the banks' directors - including some of America's most prestigious corporate executives - to sign legally binding pledges that their banks would be run more prudently. **********On the more positive side, the nation's biggest banks - under pressure from regulators and investors - have been rebuilding their reserves against loan losses and increasing the levels of their stockholders' investments. As a result, there is a bigger cushion between possible loan losses and depositors' money. **********Some analysts say that the pressures on banks to increase their primary capitalization could substantially slow economic growth. **********''The danger to the economy,'' said Lawrence Cohn, first vice president and bank-stock analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., ''is that the banking industry might overreact and tighten up too much. It could starve the economy of credit. I don't lose a lot of sleep over that, but it's something I give some thought to.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/19/world/irish-nationalists-search-for-a-formula-for-unity.html": {"writer_name": "Jon Nordheimer", "pub_date": "1984-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 660, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IRISH NATIONALISTS SEARCH FOR A FORMULA FOR UNITY", "print_headline": "IRISH NATIONALISTS SEARCH FOR A FORMULA FOR UNITY", "body_text": " **********Irish nationalists, after eight months of deliberation and few signs of encouragement from the British, are preparing to make painful and politically sensitive decisions to produce a formula they hope will lead to Irish unity. **********The document that the nationalist New Ireland Forum puts out at the end of March may not entice British Unionists in Northern Ireland or the Government in London to join the Irish Republic in a search for a political settlement to end six decades of the partition of Ireland.

Other officials said this would be at about the same levels that Israel was now receiving. **********For the 1985 fiscal year ending next Sept. 30, Israel has received a total of $2.6 billion in direct grant aid, of which $1.2 billion is economic assistance and $1.4 billion military aid. **********Israel announced this week that it was seeking a dramatic increase in direct aid, to some $4.1 billion for the 1986 fiscal year. Of this amount, $2.2 billion would be military aid and $1.9 billion economic assistance. In addition, the Israelis asked for an immediate grant of $800 million to maintain their foreign-exchange reserves. **********John Hughes, the State Department spokesman, said the Israelis had been told that in response to the $800 million request, ''the United States will defer a decision on this, pending the adoption of an effective Israeli economic stabilization program and a determination of the utility of such additional U.S. assistance in supporting such a program.''

But American officials who met with the Israelis this week stressed that the United States did not believe the steps had gone far enough. **********Israeli sources said their delegation, headed by Emmanuel Sharon, director general of the Finance Ministry, told the Americans that Israel had to proceed cautiously because its social situation would not permit drastic measures. **********One Israeli said unemployment had reached 7 percent of the civilian work force, a very high figure for Israel. He said that if the budget was cut further and more people were laid off, this would not only cause unrest in the areas of highest unemployment, but would also lead many Israelis to leave for other countries and discourage other Jews from immigrating to Israel.  The American side was headed by W. Allen Wallis, Deputy Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. **********As to the Israeli request for an increase of more than 50 percent in aid for 1986, Mr. Hughes said the Administration would propose economic aid at about the same $1.2 billion level. He indicated that military aid might increase so Israel could maintain its ''qualitative edge'' over Arab countries. **********The Administration is considering large-scale military sales to Saudi Arabia, which would lead to increased concern from Israel that the equipment, such as additional F-15 aircraft, might be diverted for use against Israel. **********Hope for Support in Congress **********Israeli diplomats expressed disappointment at the inability to persuade the Administration to be more generous. One diplomat said Israel might have to rely on its backers in Washington to persuade Congress to approve the aid over Administration objections. **********A staff member for the Senate Appropriations Committee said he was confident Israel would receive a large-scale increase at least for the 1986 fiscal year. **********In the last two years, the Israelis and the Administration have agreed on the levels of aid and Congress has not tried to tamper with the figures. **********Some of Israel's supporters in Congress said it might be difficult to win approval of the additional aid for Israel - already the largest benefiary of American aid - if Israel does not make more dramatic economic sacrifices.

CATLIN, formerly of Pan American and American Airlines, is currently trying to pilot a load of new business prospects into the hanger at N. W. Ayer, the country's oldest, and 17th- largest, agency. **********As a senior vice president, director of business development, he is the new-business man, and his job includes attracting clients to Ayer's growing international network. **********Jerry N. Jordan, a Princeton grad with a master's in psychology from Penn, is president of the international operation, and was host at a press conference yesterday to talk about the changes. **********Currently the agency, which is committed to growing in the international arena, has increasing equity in, or total ownership of, agencies in 12 countries. It also has affiliations with 25 other agencies in which the aim is to get an equity position and develop that into a majority position. **********''We found that 25 percent equity is great, as long as everything is going well,'' Mr. Jordan said, ''but when there is a problem you have to have the ability to step in. So we have been trying to increase our equity.'' **********He said the reason it works - even with only 25 percent - is because he insists that the contract with the foreign agencies stipulate total control for the lead agency (the agency whose client it is), including the staffing of the account. **********Ayer is 115 years old, and in the 1930's had a number of overseas offices that served its Ford client. All closed up during World War II, and never reopened. **********Then, realizing that the advertising world was passing it by, Ayer moved cautiously abroad by joining the Barker agency of Britian and the Hegemann agency of Germany to form a joint venture in the Netherlands called ABH. It acquired a maximum of 25 percent of five European agencies, and also had a position in each of the parent agencies. **********When Ayer, driven by its new client, Pan American World Airways, to acquire and expand, became too aggressive for its two partner agencies, they, at different times, asked out of the joint venture. So Ayer bought them out. **********Pan Am, which became a client in 1978, also wanted help in Latin America, the Pacific and the Far East. **********Ayer International, as a subsidiary of N. W. Ayer, was started in 1981, the same year the agency lost Pan Am. Its 12 partner agencies include three bought into last year in France, Italy and the Netherlands. They were added to the existing chain in the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Germany, Italy, Spain, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. **********Ayer is pushing hard for majority ownership, except where frustrated by government policy, as in Australia and New Zealand. And Mr. Jordan added, ''I think it would be almost impossible to get a majority position in a major Canadian agency.'' **********''And our objective,'' he said, ''is to have ownership, where governments will allow, in the top 20 markets by the end of next year.'' **********For the agencies, the benefit, he said, is their access to the training they will get - as well as the opportunity to exchange information with other shops in the network. **********The reason Ayer pushes for more than the 25 percent ownership originally sought by ABH is that a majority position, Mr. Jordan said, ''helps us protect our investment better'' and placates those clients who think control only comes with majority ownership. **********Ayer's major multinational clients are Deere & Company, the tractor maker, and the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism. And, while there are 32 advertisers who are served in two or more countries by Ayer, only five or six of them are clients of the agency in the United States. This is something that Mr. Catlin - on his return performance at the agency - is out to rectify. Ayer has more than 50 domestic clients. **********The 56-year-old Mr. Jordan is a second-generation Ayerman. His dad, the late Clarence, was a copywriter. The son's first job was at the agency's original heqadquarters in Philadelphia. He stayed for 12 years. He was a senior account man on the United Airlines account. When the agency lost it, he left and went to work for American Airlines for seven years. **********Then he became president of the United States unit of Thomas Cook, the British travel company. When Cook dismissed him, he was available to Ayer, whose Louis T. Hagopian, chief executive, rehired him in 1976 as an executive vice president."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/11/business/executive-changes-114224.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 230, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " **********American Standard Co., a diversified manufacturing and building products company, has elected John J.

He sees two risks stemming from big Federal budget deficits in the United States and high interest rates in this country. **********The first is a threat not to West Germany directly but to the developing countries of Latin America, Africa and Asia. ''They are our clients,'' Mr. Lambsdorff said. ''Our capital goods exports have been weakened, and the developing countries cannot buy capital equipment if their financial position is worsened.'' He warned that the debts of the third-world countries, ''already piled high,'' were bound to increase if United States domestic policies kept interest rates high and rising. **********His second big worry is over the ''growing protectionist tendency in the United States.'' He sees this as linked to high interest rates, which he said had made the dollar overly strong, undermining the American trade position and costing this country hundreds of thousands of jobs. He fears that protectionism will spread, here and abroad, if the United States does not set its fiscal house in order. **********But Mr. Lambsdorff conceded that the extra- strong dollar had been an immediate blessing to the German economy. As noted in the latest issue of the monthly report of the Bundesbank, his country's central bank, West German exporters have profited from the strong economic revival in this country and also ''from the fact that their products have been priced very attractively for foreign buyers as a result of the lower valuation of the Deutsche mark against important world currencies, particularly the United States dollar.'' **********A new study by the Commerce Department in Washington shows how powerful price effects have been in the last two years in worsening the United States balance of trade. In the field of machinery and transportation equipment, for example, the dollar prices received by United States exporters rose only 6.4 percent from the end of 1981 to the end of 1983, but the foreign currency prices that foreigners had to pay for those American goods rose 22.8 percent. Conversely, prices of foreign machinery and transportation equipment paid by American importers rose only 1.2 percent in dollars but 16.6 percent in terms of the foreign-currency prices received by foreigners on sales to the United States. **********Mr. Lambsdorff criticized the Reagan Administration and, even more strongly, Congress for yielding to protectionist pressures, especially in steel, as a false and dangerous solution to the trade problem. He warned that this country is courting retaliation from Europe, and he urged positive steps to regain a more ''outward-looking'' attitude through international negotiations. **********Relations between the United States and West Germany have also been strained over this country's criticism of what it considers an inadequate contribution by Europeans to their own defense. Mr. Lambsdorff sharply opposed suggestions - made recently by Lawrence Eagleburger, Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, and Henry A. Kissinger, former Secretary of State - that the United States should reduce its military forces in Europe if the West Germans and others did not spend more on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  Mr. Eagleburger has suggested that the United States might make a relative shift toward the Pacific Basin. And Mr. Kissinger, whom the Germans consider a possible successor to Secretary of State George P. Shultz, has said in an article in Time magazine that the United States should consider cutting its 320,000 troops in Europe by as much as half if the Europeans refused to strengthen their contributions. **********Mr. Lambsdorff said he considered Mr. Kissinger's proposal that the next commander of NATO forces be a European and the next secretary general of NATO be an American as just ''making a show.'' But Chancellor Kohl, disturbed by the critical signals emanating from Washington, is likely to try to reassure President Reagan during his White House visit that he and President Francois Mitterrand of France intend to bolster their cooperation with the United States and their military self-defense. **********Mr. Lambsdorff has a self-defense problem of his own. He has been accused of taking a bribe in the form of a $50,000 contribution for his political party, the Free Democratic Party, from the Flick holding company in exchange for tax waivers of $175,000 on some of its foreign operations. **********The Bonn economics minister acknowledged that Flick had made the contribution and that the tax break had been granted to Flick. (It has since been withdrawn.) But he said there was no connection between the two actions, that the money was ''never given to me'' and that there is no evidence against him except that his name was on a list found in Flick's offices. **********In the interview, Mr. Lambsdorff stoutly maintained his innocence and ''good conscience,'' and he said he intended to ''fight my way through.'' But if he is indicted, as expected, in May or June, he will probably be compelled to resign to defend himself in court. **********Mr. Kohl has assigned Mr. Lambsdorff to the critical effort to strengthen relations with Washington and, at the same time, demonstrate that West Germany is not a humble or pliant vassal of the United States.

Prices of typical department store goods are up about 3 percent this year. **********In the metropolitan area, including business in both the city and the suburbs, the seven retailers reported an average sales increase of 9.5 percent over May 1983. But once again, the range of gains was wide, from 4.5 percent to 15.2 percent. **********The retailers participating in the survey are Abraham & Straus, B.

The lowest monthly gains came in March, with a 1.2 percent increase in the city and 1.1 percent in the area.

''All together, it hasn't been a good three months.'' **********While other merchants were not quite so pessimistic, most said that retail inventories have risen sharply in recent weeks because of lagging business. The result has been an effort to clear stocks and promote considerable goods at lower prices.

The fighting dashed hopes for a quick cease-fire guaranteed by Syria. **********The intense clashes came as the Lebanese President, Amin Gemayel, conducted another day of negotiations with Christian and Moslem leaders in an effort to win support for his understanding with Syria's President, Hafez al-Assad, on a framework for a settlement of Lebanon's political strife. Syria is Moscow's foremost ally in the Middle East. **********In Damascus, Syrian officials were expected to continue their efforts to convince the two key Lebanese opposition figures, Walid Jumblat, the Druse leader, and Nabih Berri, the Shiite Moslem leader, to cooperate with Mr, Gemayel. They had earlier called for his resignation, but Mr. Jumblat said Friday night that they had agreed to drop this demand. There were reports that Mr. Berri and Mr. Jumblat might meet today with President Gemayel, but the Druse leader said that there had been no talks. **********2 More Leaders Endorse Plan **********Experts here said they believed that earlier talks by Syrian officials with Mr. Berri and Mr. Jumblat were partly aimed at securing their agreement for a halt to the violence here before political reconciliation talks in Geneva could begin. **********Meanwhile, the Syrian-Lebanese understanding won endorsement today from two other leading Lebanese opposition figures, former Prime Minister Rashid Karami and former President Suleiman Franjieh. The two men, members of the pro- Syrian National Salvation Front, met today with Mr. Gemayel. **********The meeting with Mr. Karami, a Sunni Moslem, was especially significant because he and Mr. Gemayel had not met since national reconciliation talks broke down last November in Geneva. **********'Historic Turning Point' **********Mr. Karami, a leading candidate for prime minister in a new government, called the Syrian-Lebanese understanding an ''historic turning point'' that marked ''the beginning of the end of the crisis.'' **********As talks went on, fire from mortars, tanks, heavy artillery and rocket-propelled grenades shook buildings around the city and added to the already heavy toll of civilian casualties. **********The crackle of gunfire and the loud report of exploding grenades and artillery shells echoed down the streets in many parts of the capital. In some neighborhoods, residents said the fighting was the worst in some time.  Artillery duels also erupted between Lebanese Army troops and Druse and other anti-Government forces around Suk al Gharb, a strategic mountain village not far from the presidential palace and the Defense Ministry. **********In today's fighting, two 82-millimeter mortar shells struck near the Hotel Alexandre, which houses most of the foreign press corps in East Beirut. The shells wounded one neighborhood resident and damaged eight cars. **********In the meantime, new details emerged here concerning the two days of talks this week between Mr. Assad and Mr. Gemayel.  High-ranking Lebanese officials say the two leaders agreed on a Syrian- guaranteed cease-fire, the scrapping of Lebanon's troop-withdrawal agreement with Israel reached last May 17, the resumption of political reconciliation talks in Geneva as early as next week and the formation of a government of national unity that would include all major opposition figures or their representatives. **********The plan also called for talks with Israel designed to replace the May 17 accord with a much narrower agreement to guarantee the security of Israel's northern border. **********Lebanon is sounding out Israel through the United States on the possibility of such talks. But Christian leaders with ties to Mr. Gemayel said today that the Government was under no illusions that Israel, which has responded angrily to the proposed cancellation of the May 17 accord, would take up any Lebanese offer to negotiate a narrower agreement. **********Even if Israel rejects such talks, the leaders said, Mr. Gemayel plans to go ahead with the cancellation, having made a clear choice for Syria over Israel as the country most likely to guarantee his political survival and the possibility of a new government. **********U.S. Position Is Unclear **********Some officials here familiar with the talks said they believed that the United States had so far expressed neither strong opposition nor strong support for Mr. Gemayel's Syrian opening. **********While Lebanese Christian leaders are generally deeply unhappy with American policy, one of them said today that the United States might see some advantage to Mr. Gemayel's move since it might open the possibility of better American relations with Syria. **********''Sometimes, the United States is good at making the best of its mistakes,'' the leader said. But he added that the lack of a strong American response may also reflect division within the Reagan Administration. Many Reagan Administration officials, notably Secretary of State George P. Shultz, are believed to be wary of any opening to Syria now. **********Conversations with Christian leaders and Lebanese officials here over the last few days revealed that President Gemayel understood his weak bargaining position with Syria after the major defeat suffered by the Lebanese Army last month.   Chance of Political Survival   They said Mr. Gemayel apparently expected little immediate return from Syria for his agreement to cancel the accord with Israel. He believes, however, that by doing so he has increased his chances for political survival, for a cease-fire and for some sort of security guarantees for Christian areas not now under Syrian occupation, they said. **********Beyond that, the Gemayel Government is hoping that by ''opening a new chapter with Syria,'' in the words of one official, it might have a chance of winning major concessions later. **********Such concessions would include the withdrawal of Palestinian and other foreign forces who have been aiding the Moslem opposition, the return of at least some Christian areas to Government control and, ultimately, the dismantling of the Green Line dividing Christian East Beirut from the Moslem West. **********These concessions, however, are not enough for a large segment of the Christian leadership, which cherishes its ties with Israel. These officials fear that Mr. Geyamel's trip to Syria constitutes, in the words of one pro-Israeli Christian, ''only the first mile on a 10,000-mile walk toward the Syrianization of Lebanon.'' **********Mr. Gemayel has sought to appease the fears of these groups, which include the Christian militia founded by his brother Bashir, the National Liberal Party led by former President Camille Chamoun and important elements of the Maronite Church led by the Rev. Boulos Naaman.   Christians Step Up Mobilization **********These leaders met today and issued a statement saying they could not respond to Mr. Gemayel's initiative until he had at least achieved a cease-fire and the withdrawal of troops from the demarcation lines. **********The Christian militia, known as the the Lebanese Forces, recently stepped up its mobilization and reorganized its leadership to prepare for Mr. Gemayel's Syrian opening. Its commander, Fadi Frem, said the group has moved from a ''low profile'' role to a more active stance. **********Mr. Frem has said the militia would maintain its ties with Israel, regardless of what Mr. Gemayel decided. He also said it would strengthen its presence in Christian areas, play an increasing military role in defending Christian neighborhoods and generally form a ''political opposition'' to the Syrian strategy. But what form that opposition will take remains unclear, and several Christian leaders said the new situation could lead to a de facto division of labor between Mr. Gemayel, who is a Maronite Christian, and the Christian opposition.   More Power for Moslems **********Mr. Gemayel's role, experts said, is likely to be to win as many concessions as he can from Syria, but revert to the role of a relatively weak President in a government where Moslems will have more power. The Christian opposition will represent its interests in bargaining with the Druse, Shiite Moslems and other Lebanese groups.  ''The Christians,'' said one political leader today, ''may find that they have more room to maneuver by not having to back the president all the time.'' **********Some Christian leaders have indicated that they are hoping for a far more militant policy of opposition to the President than this leader's predictions would imply. But President Gemayel is relying on his father, Pierre, to use the powerful organization of the Christian Phalangist Party to contain rancor against his Syrian policy in the Christian community. Among other things, Pierre Gemayel, who is 78 years old and the founder of the Phalangist Party, succeeded in keeping the party from opposing Mr. Gemayel's policy toward Syria, despite the party's traditional ties with Israel. Today, the party's central committee again voted its confidence in President Gemayel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/22/business/prices-up-0.4-again-in-october.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 874, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRICES UP 0.4% AGAIN IN OCTOBER", "print_headline": "PRICES UP 0.4% AGAIN IN OCTOBER", "body_text": " **********The Labor Department reported today that consumer prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month, the same as in September. **********Economists viewed the report as fresh confirmation that inflationary pressures continued in check. **********The latest increase in the Consumer Price Index, the most widely followed gauge of inflation, was attributed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to a mixture of rises and declines in various categories but mainly to higher gasoline prices for the second consecutive month. Some analysts said, however, that the gasoline run-up would prove temporary and that declines would occur by year-end, reflecting recent softness in prices of crude oil. **********In contrast to the national trend, consumer prices in the New York City area fell one-tenth of 1 percent in October. (Page D3.) **********Analysis of Month's Figures **********Food prices, which had dipped in September, rose four-tenths of 1 percent in October. **********Allan Sinai, chief economist for Shearson Lehman/American Express, said the October figures were a bit worse than expected. But over all, he said, he foresees no reacceleration of inflation. **********Citing Wednesday's report that economic growth slowed to 1.9 percent in the third quarter, Mr. Sinai said, ''The economy is growing very slowly, if at all, and for that reason, mainly, inflationary pressures are diminishing rather than accelerating.'' **********In the first 10 months of 1984, today's report said, consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 4.2 percent, compared with 3.8 percent for all last year. **********Outlook for Gasoline Prices **********Analysts also predicted that the recent surge in gasoline prices - which were up 1.1 percent in September and 1.8 percent in October after declining in the preceding three months - would be short-lived. **********''There's room for optimism,'' said Jay N. Woodworth, senior economist with the Bankers Trust Company. He said, ''Recent moves in the energy markets to lower crude oil prices will bring another round of oil price relief, which should show up at the gasoline pumps in the closing weeks of this year.'' **********He predicted that the rate of increase in consumer prices would decline to 3 percent or perhaps 3 1/2 percent by December or early next year. **********All the national price index figures are adjusted to compensate for normal seasonal changes in prices. **********Calculation of Annual Rate **********The rise of four-tenths of 1 percent in October, if it continued for 12 months, would work out to a compound annual rate of 4.2 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It made the computation from the unrounded increase in the index, which was 0.3508772 percent. **********Patrick C. Jackman, the official in charge of the Consumer Price Index, said the October spurt in gasoline prices was concentrated in the West, primarily in California. In Los Angeles, gasoline prices rose from 115.4 cents a gallon to 121.1 cents, and in San Francisco they rose from 125.5 cents a gallon to 129.9 cents. **********''It appears to be a realignment,'' Mr. Jackman said, ''because prior to October the West was below, and now it's slightly above, the other areas.'' He called it ''tough to figure out why'' gasoline prices rose. He said ''There's some evidence of price wars, but there's no way to confirm that.'' **********Despite the October increase, the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted, gasoline prices were 2.3 percent lower than at the end of 1983 and 13 percent below their March 1983 peak. **********Comparison of Food Prices **********Over all, food and beverage prices were up four-tenths of 1 percent last month, following a dip in September. On a nationwide basis, prices of natural gas for the home fell 1.3 percent and electricity fell 1.7 percent. **********Housing prices rose more slowly last month. They were up one-tenth of 1 percent, compared with four-tenths of 1 percent in September. Other major groups, including apparel and upkeep, entertainment and other goods and services continued to rise last month at about the same pace as in September. **********''We're in a rut right now,'' Mr. Jackman said. ''It's basically a repeat of recent trends, but relative to last three years, it looks pretty good.'' **********For the last three months, the Labor Department said, inflation has run at a compounded annual rate of 4.7 percent. This is a substantial rate by historical standards in the United States but well below the 12.3 percent of 1979 and 11.8 percent of 1980. **********2 Measurements of Prices **********The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses two gauges to monitor prices, and both showed increases in October. The more frequently cited index, for all urban consumers, is called the CPI-U. It showed that prices were up 4.2 percent since October 1983 and were rising at an annual rate of 4.7 percent in the three months ended Oct. 31, 1984. **********An older index, for urban wage earners and clerical workers, is the CPI-W. This gauge, which is widely used for setting cost-of-living increases in industrial labor contracts and Federal benefit payments, rose two-tenths of 1 percent in October and had risen 3.6 percent in the 12-month period. The CPI-W encompasses about half the urban population. **********The October level of the Consumer Price Index, based on 100 in 1967, was 315.3.

Dribbon and Dr. Sheldon S. **********Schwarzbrott, formed a partnership and purchased the South Shore Animal Hospital in Wantagh, L.I. Less than a year later, the two incorporated their partnership in order to bridge the large disparity between pension benefits permitted corporations and those available to the self-employed. **********But recent changes in Federal tax law - some of which wiped out the tax breaks allowed corporations in the pension area - are forcing physicians, architects and other professionals to re-examine their decision to do business as a professional corporation. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, which became effective this year, for example, now places Keogh plans available to partnerships on par with corporate pension plans. **********''The change in the law was instigated by the proliferation of professionals who incorporate their practices to get corporate benefits,'' said Michael F. Klein, a partner with Price Waterhouse & Company. Congress changed the rules, he said, ''to stop people from running around forming professional corporations.'' **********Do these new rules sound the death knell of the professional corporation? ''The dollar parity in the pension rules makes it less attractive to incorporate than before,'' said Ellen J. Zombek, a tax manager in the Personal Services Group at Deloitte Haskins & Sells. But, she cautioned, there are still some differences in the rules for self-employed versus corporate plans. **********The most important of those differences is the way money taken out of the plan is taxed. While money distributed from a Keogh receives no special treatment, the tax on some corporate plan distributions can be calculated using the ''10-year averaging rule,'' which lowers the tax by treating the money as if it had been received in equal installments over a 10-year period. **********These are some other differences: *********** In a partnership or sole proprietorship, certain employees who also own part of the business cannot take loans from the business's Keogh plan; corporate shareholders are permitted to take loans from their company's pension plan under certain limited circumstances. *********** A Keogh plan can be funded only with cash, while a corporate plan can receive such assets as company stock or real estate. *********** A Keogh distribution cannot be ''rolled over'' into a corporate pension plan, so someone who joins a company after working for herself loses the investment advantage of keeping her entire pension in a large, managed corporate account. **********While many tax breaks for the professional corporation in the pension area were erased by the changes in the legislation, some tax advantages remain. ''There is a big difference between corporations and partnerships or sole proprietorships in the fringe-benefits area,'' said Miss Zombek. A corporation, for example, can form a medical plan or a life or accident insurance plan and take a business deduction for the amount of the contribution. **********The professional corporation also can be used to defer tax. A shareholder who collects $100,000 in revenues, for instance, can take a salary of $75,000 and let the balance accumulate in the corporation at the lower corporate tax rates. **********Incorporating can simply be a good business move as well. While the corporate form is not a complete shield against liability, professionals typically receive more protection than they would in a partnership arrangement. If the business goes bankrupt, for example, creditors normally can reach only corporate assets, not the shareholder's personal assets. **********Unlike a partner, a shareholder in a professional corporation usually cannot be held liable for negligence or malpractice of his fellow shareholders. Similarly, the corporation may be able to sign a lease for office space or equipment without exposing individual shareholders to liability on those leases.  According to Miss Zombek, doing business as a corporation enhances borrowing power. Many states have usury laws that limit the amount of interest that can be charged to an individual borrower; these laws don't apply to corporations. ''If you're starting out and looking for capital,'' said Miss Zombek, ''a bank may refuse to deal with you unless it can charge four or five points above prime.'' **********Professional corporations also are used to assure the continuity of a business. Unlike a partnership, which is legally terminated by the death or resignation of a partner, a corporation has an existence separate from its shareholders, so ''a group of doctors, for instance, could hire new associates without affecting the business structure,'' explained Miss Zombek. **********BUT professional corporations can be expensive. Money earned by the professional is taxed twice, first at corporate rates, then as a dividend when the cash is taken out. Added legal and accounting fees incurred to comply with state and Federal corporate rules may increase day-to- day operating costs. **********Because of those higher costs, some professionals may seek to step back into a partnership. As an incentive for existing businesses, the new law includes a special provision, which expires at the end of this year, that allows professionals to liquidate their corporations with less severe penalties than they would otherwise face. Some professionals who consider liquidation, however, may be deterred by the potentially high costs. **********The special provision that would cut some of those costs permits shareholders who liquidate their corporations within one month to take out earnings accumulated by the corporation as capital gains, subject to a maximum tax of 20 percent. Normally, this money would be taxed as a dividend at ordinary income tax rates. **********Still, professionals can face substantial liquidation costs in the form of potential ''recapture'' of investment tax credits and accelerated depreciation, where certain ordinary business deductions taken by the corporation are taxed when the business is dissolved. Shareholders also may owe a tax on cash and securities distributed by the corporation. The business itself would incur some costs - formally transferring company assets, for example, or printing new stationery. **********''We probably wouldn't bother with a professional corporation today.'' said Dr. Dribbon, the Long Island veterinarian.  ''But since we already have one, it doesn't pay to liquidate.'' **********Carole Gould writes on finance from New York."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/29/business/what-s-new-for-workers-abroad-the-family-element.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Hammonds", "pub_date": "1984-07-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 396, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE FAMILY ELEMENT", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW FOR WORKERS ABROAD; THE FAMILY ELEMENT", "body_text": " **********In Britain, and in those former colonies that still exercize some form **********of British law, a man sent to work by a foreign corporation can secure working papers for his wife automatically. But a woman executive sent to London is not accorded the same privilege: Unless special permission is secured, her husband cannot seek employment. **********The problem is one of many confronted increasingly by corporate personnel managers who send executives overseas. In fact, these managers and other experts say, most unsuccessful foreign assignments - as many as 80 percent - fail because of personal, rather than professional, difficulties. And most often, those difficulties center on the family. **********''To a certain degree, the spouse in America today plays a completely different role,'' Miss Snowdon said. ''In many of the cultures she is relocated too, the woman is not allowed to work, and she now has to take a second seat. Often times that's very difficult for a woman, and it splits the family and the corporation.'' **********Alison R. Lanier, editor of ''Living Abroad,'' a publication for Americans sent overseas, adds that companies give little thought to an executive's children, especially teen-agers. ''They're never considered in the selection process, and never given any orientation. The companies just don't think it's their business - but the minute the company sends that couple overseas, they should become its responsibility.'' **********Mrs. Lanier, Miss Snowdon and others are pushing for companies to allow the spouse and children more involvement in the processes of selection, orientation and training that take place before an assignment. They believe that, in selecting an executive to work abroad, a company should consider the ''survivability,'' as Mrs. Lanier puts it, of the family as much as the executive's professional qualifications. In addition, they say, all members of the family should receive the same training in language, culture and protocol afforded the employee. **********As for the proliferation of dual-career couples, no one has ready solutions.

At Dec. 31, the most recent data available, Argentina was 86 days in arrears on public sector debt payments. The country has not made any payments on public sector debt since Oct. 17, according to bankers. The arrearage is reported quarterly. **********''It is going to be difficult to get the Argentines under 90 days before the end of the month,'' one banker said. **********Since no payments on outstanding public sector debt have been made since October, for internal bookkeeping purposes most banks have probably been classifying the Argentine loans as nonperforming since sometime in early January, when the 90- day period was broached. **********But the end of a quarter, when results must be made public, is of crucial importance to earnings results. And because of Argentina's problems, analysts say the impact on first-quarter bank earnings could be substantial. **********''The banks will have to add at least $1.1 billion to their nonperforming loan category at the end of the first quarter, and that is entirely due to Argentina,'' said Thomas H. Hanley, a vice president and banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. ''For the first time ever, the banks won't be current on their overseas loans at the end of a quarter, and that will have an impact on earnings.'' **********The rising pessimism about payment prospects stems mainly from a continuing, unresolved debate in Argentina about the direction of the country's economic policy, and the fact that the country seems to be earning more than enough foreign exchange from its grain exports to meet at least some of its interest payments. **********''The Argentines could very well bring the banks more current,'' the banker said, ''but they are building reserve levels to put pressure on us and the International Monetary Fund, saying that we won't pay you off unless you give us better terms.'' **********Mr. Hanley, who recently returned from a trip to Argentina, estimates that by the end of March, the country's foreign currency reserves should be close to $3 billion. **********''To get the U.S. banks current through January 10, which is less than 90 days, the Argentines would only have to disburse about $600 million,'' he said.

''There hasn't been much on the home office front that has been helpful,'' said Leon M. Nad, national tax director at Price Waterhouse. **********A husband and wife who were active investors devoting full time to managing their $13.5 million portfolio were denied the deduction. And so was a newspaper editor who used part of his house to take late-night telephone calls from his staff and prominent news figures. One ray of hope was the deduction granted to an executive who built a lavish lakeside office retreat by his vacation house so that he could conduct long-range planning for his company during the summer, although that decision may not have widespread application. **********But it's not impossible to get such a deduction, of course. If taxpayers who work at home meet all the tests set forth by the Internal Revenue Service, they can write off a variety of expenses relating to home offices, such as depreciation on that part of the home devoted to office use, as well as a pro rata share of utilities and maintenance. To qualify, employees must be able to show, among other things, that the home office is for the convenience of their employer and not for their personal convenience. And they must use the office on a regular and exclusive basis as a place to meet and deal with patients, clients or customers. **********The couple who maintained a home office to manage their large stock portfolio, Joe and Dorothy Moller, lost their bid for a deduction because an appeals court ruled they were not engaged in the business of trading securities. **********Initially, the United States Court of Claims had sided with the Mollers, saying they were ''active investors'' carrying on a business. But late last year, the new Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed that decision. It said that even though the couple were active investors, they were still investors engaged in managing their own portfolio and not traders working for others - and thus they were subject to more stringent rules on what expenses they could deduct in relation to their production of investment income. **********Traders, the court said, are geared to short- term trading, not long-term investing, and their income is primarily from the sale of securities rather than from dividends and interest on those securities. But the Mollers made only 71 sales for the two tax years in question, and more than 98 percent of their income came from dividends and interest, not sales. The court concluded they were investors, and as such were not entitled to a write- off for their home office expenses. **********But Warren S. Shine, a tax principal with the accounting firm of Ernst & Whinney, noted that investors are permitted to deduct a variety of expenses connected with the production of investment income, such as legal and bookkeeping fees. And he said that if the Mollers had rented outside office space rather than using part of their house, ''presumably they would have been permitted to take a deduction for the rental cost.'' **********Max Frankel, editorial page editor of The New York Times, lost his claim for a home office deduction because the United States Tax Court decided that late-night phone conversations with staff members and news figures did not constitute ''meeting and dealing with'' clients. Physical contact is required, the court ruled in a split decision earlier this year. (However, Mr. Frankel's wife, a freelance writer, was permitted to claim the deduction in connection with work she performed as a self-employed person during the same years.) **********Some analysts believe the home office rules should be revised. Present law dates back to the mid-1970's, when Congress enacted stringent rules to curb what it felt were abuses. But ''Congress is going to have to look at the deduction again,'' predicted Mr. Nad of Price Waterhouse. Increasing numbers of people work at computers at home and have no link with their office headquarters except by telephone, he noted. ''The world is changing, and I don't know why these people shouldn't be entitled to the deduction, he said.'' **********THE one positive development in recent court **********rulings concerned a $250,000 office that Ben **********Heineman, president of Northwest Industries, a large Chicago conglomerate, built near his Wisconsin summer home. The 20- by 20-foot office was suspended from the side of a cliff overlooking a lake (so as to not to obstruct the view from the main house 100 yards away) and consisted of one room with computer and phone links to Northwest, plus a rest room and small kitchen. **********For years, Mr. Heineman had set aside the month of August to review his company's long- term plans, retreating to his summer home in Sister Bay, Wis., to escape the heat and interruptions at Northwest's Chicago headquarters. He did not seek reimbursement from Northwest for the cost of constructing and maintaining the office retreat because he did not want his company to have any claim on any part of his vacation property. Northwest paid only the costs of communication between Chicago and Wisconsin. **********But he claimed, as an unreimbursed employee business expense, a total of $51,000 in depreciation and maintenance expenses for his vacation office during the tax years in question. The I.R.S. denied the deduction on grounds that Mr. Heineman could have secured isolation at Northwest's Chicago headquarters by having his staff bar interruptions, that the expenses resulted solely from his personal preference to work in Wisconsin during the summer, and that he failed to ask Northwest to bear the expenses. **********The Tax Court, however, in a decision issued earlier this spring, sided with Mr. Heineman. He had shown that it was appropriate and helpful for him to work in seclusion in Wisconsin, and since he had proved that the office was used solely for business, ''it was of no concern to the court that a less expensive facility could have been found in some less pleasant environment,'' said the accounting firm of Peat Marwick. The court also agreed that he had a good reason for not requesting reimbursement from Northwest: to avoid giving the company a possible claim against his property. **********However, Mr. Nad said the decision will not have widespread applicability because of the work involved. The impact will be confined to ''top-level people of major corporations,'' he said. **********The usual rules did not apply because both parties agreed that Mr. Heineman's office was a separate building, not a dwelling unit. But Mr. Shine of Ernst & Whinney noted that if the office were in an adjoining structure, such as an attached garage, it probably would have been subject to the tougher rules."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/19/world/state-dept-aide-says-door-is-very-much-open-to-an-accord-on-namibia.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1984-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 629, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STATE DEPT.

Haig Jr., have talked of the possibility of a breakthrough in the longstanding southern African problem since the end of 1981. The senior State Department official, who has been directly involved in the diplomacy, said that given the disappointments of the past, it made no sense to venture predictions anymore. **********State Department officials also said there had been only little variation of the basic Administration formula for a settlement - Cuban withdrawal from Angola in return for South Africa's ending its support for guerrillas in Angola and withdrawing its forces from South- West Africa, or Namibia. **********Skepticism Is Wide **********The failure of previous predictions to be borne out have produced widespread skepticism in Washington that anything will come of the Administration efforts. Any breakthrough in the next several weeks would be seen as a tangible accomplishment for the Reagan Administration. In the past, department officials said said they doubted Cuba would cooperate in a withdrawal plan because it might be seen as helping Mr. Reagan in the election. **********The senior official, however, said he was encouraged by a round of discussions this month in Lusaka, Zambia, with senior Angolan officials. He said the talks left the American mediators with the impression that the Angolans were serious in looking for a compromise to break the impasse, which has lasted for three years. **********The South Africans have said they will comply with the six-year-old United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 for the independence of Namibia, but only if the 26,000 Cuban combat troops in Angola are withdrawn at the same time. **********The Angolans, however, have insisted that the Cubans, who have been there since 1975, are necessary for their security and will leave only after Namibia is independent and the South African-backed insurgents in Angola have stopped fighting. **********But the senior American official said that despite this public position, there was more flexibility in the Angolan private stand. **********''The mood in Luanda is one of 'let's try to settle this problem,' '' the senior official said after the latest discussions with the Angolans in Lusaka. **********But he cautioned that ''the exact timing on how this open door would lead to really concrete future steps is not that easy for us to predict.'' The official gave an interview on the condition that he not be named. **********''It looks as good now as it has,'' he said. ''We're not holding back because of our electoral season. We are going full tilt ahead. If others are watching and waiting because of our elections, that's their decision.'' **********The Reagan Administration expressed optimism in February, when Angola and South Africa reached an accord on South African troop withdrawal from Angola. But since then, the South Africans have halted their troop withdrawal 21 miles from the border between Angola and Namibia, pending the next political agreement, the official said. **********Chester A. Crocker, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, returned last week from a trip to Africa that included the talks in Zambia. The senior official said, ''We had a very useful round in Lusaka.'' **********The Angolans, he said, ''brought some ideas.'' **********''We talked them over,'' he said, ''and they're chewing over some of that discussion, and I think we'll be in a position to go to the South Africans and say this is something tangible, and what do you think.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/14/world/for-the-blacks-in-france-a-farewell-to-fraternity.html": {"writer_name": "John Duka", "pub_date": "1984-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1316, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOR THE BLACKS IN FRANCE, A FAREWELL TO FRATERNITY", "print_headline": "FOR THE BLACKS IN FRANCE, A FAREWELL TO FRATERNITY", "body_text": " **********The days when Josephine Baker, the black American entertainer, was the toast of Parisian cafe society seem today like memories from another country. **********''There has been a major shift in France concerning the blacks,'' said Philippe Lafouge, the general director of the Paris Bureau of Social Aid. ''When I was young, they were very much accepted here and the Algerians were not. Today the Algerians are more accepted because they have adapted to French life. But in the last 10 years, especially since 1981, the number of blacks has grown, they have not assimilated, and thus they are not as accepted.'' **********In 1931 the number of black Africans in France totaled 16,401. Today there are officially 138,080, but the total, some officials say, may be closer to 200,000. There are also about 500,000 black French citizens from France's overseas departments in the Caribbean. **********A Cause of Tension **********At a time when France faces severe economic problems, the presence of people whom many of the French consider outsiders has caused tension. **********With 2.2 million people registered as unemployed in France, for example, unskilled African immigrants are suddenly considered competitors for the low-level service jobs that were once beneath French consideration. With French industrial production drastically reduced, thousands of black immigrants, brought over between 1945 and 1974 to work in French factories, are now out of work. **********The French Government has begun a campaign to reduce the number of illegal alien workers in the country. Last year about 7,000 were deported. **********The Government has also proposed a plan to supply aid to legal immigrants who voluntarily seek to return to their home countries. In a recent poll taken by the magazine Hebdo, which opposes President Francois Mitterrand's Government, 72 percent of those interviewed said they wanted the Government to help immigrants return home.   Questions of Racism **********These opinions, according to some blacks who live here, raise questions of racism. There are others who say that they do not sense racism and that they continue to feel loyal to France. **********''The French are becoming more and more intolerant,'' said George Pau- Langevin. Mrs. Pau-Langevin, a lawyer from Guadeloupe, is vice president of the Movement Against Racism and for Friendship Between Peoples, an influential black rights groups here. She is married to a white Parisian. **********''The French can't accept the change in their population,'' she continued. ''The French thought the immigrants would work here, then go back to their countries. But they will never go back. They stay here because there is no work in their countries. For the first time in their history, the French are facing the problem of integrating blacks into their society, as well as the reality that France will never be the way it was.'' **********In a cafe in Barb es, a section heavily populated by Arabs and blacks, a man from Mauritania sat at a table. In his hand he grasped his Livret de Famille, a document proving his origin and that he is in France legally.   Blacks 'Live in Misery' **********''Before, France was great,'' he said. ''Now, it is not so great. The black Africans live in misery. Before, the French were glad to bring us here to work in their factories. They adopted their children. Now that we are grown, they have dropped us. **********''I have worked here 23 years and never been unemployed. But most of the men are out of work. Racism doesn't come from the old, but from the young who replace us with computers. My grandfather and father fought in the war for the French. But the young have forgotten that.'' **********Officials in the social services say their main concern is the welfare of all unemployed people, or those without housing, and they refuse to draw distinctions along racial lines. **********''We do not think of differences,'' said Jasna Romon, technical adviser to the Department of Immigration. ''There is, for example, no black quarter in Paris, like in the United States. The blacks, Arabs and Turks all mix together, and with the French. The only distinction we make is that if you are a French citizen, you can hold a state job. If you are not, you cannot.''  Two Black Populations **********There are principally two black populations in Paris: French Caribbean citizens, known as the Antillais, who come from Martinique, Guadeloupe and French Guiana; and Africans, who come primarily from Senegal, Mali and the Ivory Coast. **********The Antillais have more or less assimilated into French society. Some marry white French, and they hold a wide variety of jobs, including blue-collar and professional jobs and government positions. **********The first black to have his own program on French television, for example, is a young man from Guadeloupe named Sydney Duteil, who goes by his first name. One of the leading film makers here is Euzhan Palcy, a young woman from Martinique who recently won a Cesar, a French film award that is the equivalent of the Oscar. **********Among the best-known Africans in France is Leopold S. Senghor, the poet and former President of Senegal, who recently became the first black member of the French Academy.  Yannick Noah, the French tennis star, who was raised in Cameroon, became a national hero when he won the French Open last June.  He has since moved to New York. **********Although many black Africans in France are highly educated, most are unskilled, uneducated people from rural villages, officials here say. They often find themselves living in urban squalor. **********Although there is no defined black quarter in Paris, many of the unskilled blacks, or the unemployed, can be found in Barb es, in the 18th arrondissement, or in the 14th, the 11th, the 19th, the 20th. They live in projects in the suburbs. They live in the Ilot Chalon, the one-block-square area of slums behind the Gare de Lyons where 6,000 squatters, 4,000 of them illegal, do not pay rent and coexist with gangs and drug dealers. **********Often, they live in one of the country's 300 foyers, or male dormitories. Altogether 150,000 people live in the foyers. Of these, 20,000 are black, the rest Arab, Turkish, Yugoslav and poor French. **********Sonacotra, a semiprivate organization that builds the foyers, has photo albums with pictures of rooms that are bright, well furished and cheerful. ''You could call these pictures propaganda,'' an executive there said. **********Many of the foyers are ''terrible,'' said Luc Fauchoix, a sociologist who is the chief of research at the Mayor's office of St. Denis, north of Paris.   Some Find Little Racism **********Some black Africans who live here report that they have found little racism. **********''For educated black women holding good jobs, racism almost does not exist here,'' said Marie-Ange Sy. Miss Sy, a doctor of parapsychology from Senegal, was sitting at a banquette at Ruby's, the most popular new black club in Paris. ''Racism has become a social question, not a question of skin color.'' **********It is a feeling shared by many of the young blacks, who like the young Arabs are known as the ''second generation.'' **********''There is a growing unity among blacks from Africa and the Antilles,'' Sydney said as he taped a show for Radio 7. ''They are going to the same clubs. They like the same music. They are joined more together than the older people. Our spirits and our minds are more open. **********''A lot of immigrants work here and send money back to their countries. We, the new generation, don't believe in that. We are French and black. Our parents think we are confused and that we do not know who we are. But we do. We are not confused.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/16/business/ibm-to-triple-pc-output.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1984-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 479, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.B.M.

The Association of Accounting Administrators, which was formed last January, now has 200 members, according to Clifford M. Brownstein, its executive director. He also heads Brownstein Associates, a public relations and marketing firm in Washington. **********''It is a wide-open field,'' he said yesterday, adding that more and more smaller accounting firms are seeking professional administrators. Law firms have been using administrators for some years, and architectural firms and medical groups have also begun using them. **********The Big Eight accounting firms were probably the first to use professional managers eight or ten years ago, according to John Thornton, national director of personnel and a partner of Coopers & Lybrand. **********His personnel duties can be measured in one way by the fact that in 1984 the firm hired 1,300 new college graduates with either accounting or computer science backgrounds. ''I think that we have had a longer history of hiring professional people in the personnel area than in some of the other areas of accounting firms,'' he said. **********''We have eight to ten professional personnel managers alone who have advanced to partnership rank,'' he said. The firm also has many other professional staff members who may or may not be accountants, he continued, such as the chief financial officer, the head of management information systems, marketing experts and training experts - all positions that might involve partnership rank or can lead to it. ''It's a very big business.'' he said. **********Mr. Brownstein says that the smaller firms hiring their first administrators have needs in two principal areas - financial management and marketing. **********For example, he said, some seek financial managers who can supervise the firm's billing to clients, its payrolls, its payment of rent and other office bills, investment of its working capital and the hiring of its secretaries. **********Often such firms supplement the financial manager by adding another type of manager to handle marketing, or they might use outside help. Some accounting firms tend to hire marketing experts first and then add an office manager to handle business operations. **********''Multiple administrators are found most often in firms that have multiple offices,'' Mr. Brownstein said. These might be middle-sized firms, which he defines as those with 20 to 150 accountants, as well as the large firms. **********He said he noticed that accounting firms were hiring away law firm administrators, probably because these managers have been in the field for 15 years or more. **********He said he has not yet noticed too many ''bright-eyed'' holders of master of business administration degrees in accounting firm management. ''Most firms are more interested in the job experience of their administrators than in whether they have M.B.A.'s,'' he said. **********J. Richard Hoffman, managing partner of a middle-sized firm - Hoffman, Raich, Fine & Company of Great Neck, L.I. (40 accountants plus 7 partners) - says that six months ago he hired the firm's first director of administration, John Duenges, who is paid about $40,000. **********''He has a good knowledge of accounting, a strong background in administration and a fair amount of computer experience,'' Mr. Hoffman said, explaining that Mr. Duenges, who is 40 years old and has a master of science degree in educational administration, had worked some years ago in back office operations at Price Waterhouse, one of the Big Eight accounting firms, and later served as a school administrator. **********''Late in 1985 we will add someone to handle marketing in-house,'' Mr. Hoffman said, contending that this would be more cost-effective than using outside help. Just as law firms can now advertise their services, so, too, have the taboos been lifted for accounting firms. **********That change is a break for the accounting firms, because competition has been growing. Mr. Hoffman said that middle-sized firms like his were getting ''a lot more competition from larger firms and their satellite offices looking to add incremental income.'' **********In addition, he said, sizable accounting firms are adding to their services what he calls ''projective- type thinking.'' He said that clients want, in addition to the usual auditing and tax compliance services, more advice on forecasting where their businesses might be headed.'' **********What is a good background for managing an accounting firm? Obviously, some knowledge of accounting helps, but it is not always required. What is essential is experience in administration and financial management, or in marketing, along with some computer knowledge. **********Good marketing skills are cherished by accounting firms, which require surveys of the needs of the community and businesses they serve. The firms are also interested in developing skills among the accountants for self-marketing, which might involve advising them what clubs and organizations to join to become known in a community; what type of speeches to make; what brochures the firm should publish to attract clients, or where the firm should place advertisements. **********The career path for such a manager might be to start with a small firm if he or she has little experience and then move to a larger one. At large firms, the manager can find salaries in six figures and the prestige of a partnership."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/10/business/rolm-chief-says-he-sought-ibm-link.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1984-10-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 877, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ROLM CHIEF SAYS HE SOUGHT I.B.M. LINK", "print_headline": "ROLM CHIEF SAYS HE SOUGHT I.B.M. LINK", "body_text": " **********When the International Business Machines Corporation announced two weeks ago that it would acquire the Rolm Corporation for $1.25 billion, the move was widely regarded as a strategic coup for Big Blue. Frustrated by its efforts to influence the development of Rolm products after a yearlong joint development effort, the speculation went, I.B.M. had decided it had to make the Santa Clara, Calif., company an offer it could not refuse. **********But yesterday, M. Kenneth Oshman, the co-founder and chief executive of Rolm, said I.B.M. did not make the first move at all. Instead, he said, the takeover came at his initiative, after ''internal territorial battles'' between I.B.M. staff members and Rolm's own employees ''proved to be impediments to progress.'' **********In his first wide-ranging interview since the takeover, Mr. Oshman confirmed industry reports of serious tensions between the two companies. However, he warned against ''making a big deal out of the problems, or thinking that something was wrong.'' Instead, he said, the troubles arose because ''everyone winded up posturing a lot'' in a series of discussions about the features of new products the companies were developing. **********I.B.M. first invested in Rolm last year and before the takeover had built its stake to 23 percent. Rolm makes telephone-switching equipment for both voice and data transmissions. **********''Low-level people here were protecting me and Rolm's interests,'' said Mr. Oshman, who founded Rolm in 1969 with three other electrical engineers. ''Even lower-level people at I.B.M. were protecting Paul Rizzo,'' he added, referring to I.B.M.'s vice president and chief of development.  No Examples Given **********He declined to give examples of particular disputes. But he said most disagreements centered on the question of whether telecommunications products should be designed to meet I.B.M.'s strategic needs - especially in its growing competition with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company - or whether they should meet Rolm's. ''We found ourselves paying less attention to the market and more to what I.B.M. wanted Rolm to do and what Rolm wanted I.B.M. to do,'' he said. **********The problems proved insoluble. Rolm officials worked for six months to ease relations with I.B.M., he said, but found ''there was always something in the way of working together smoothly.'' He added, ''Finally, we decided the best way to work together was to become part of I.B.M.'' **********So about a month ago, Rolm suggested that the two companies discard an agreement they reached last year that limited I.B.M. to a 30 percent share in the company. Negotiations over the merger took place largely on the telephone, Mr. Oshman said, with he heading the talks at Rolm and Mr. Rizzo at I.B.M. ''We really didn't have any negotiating hang-ups,'' Mr. Oshman said. ''The main issue was price.'' **********A spokesman for I.B.M. said that only Mr. Rizzo, who was traveling and not available yesterday, could comment on the acquisition. The traditionally tight-lipped I.B.M. has said little about the deal, while executives at the more freewheeling Rolm have begun to speak more readily.  Uncertainty on Role Expresssed **********Industry insiders have questioned whether that openness, and the ability of Rolm executives to make decisions themselves, will survive. Yesterday Mr. Oshman said he had few doubts. ''We will make our own decisions right here,'' he said. He likened I.B.M.'s role to that of a board of directors, ''which tells you that you are spending too much money, or too little, or spending it in the wrong place; those are things that I.B.M. will have ulimate control over.'' **********While Mr. Oshman said that he fully expected to stay on as Rolm's chief for some time, he admitted to some uncertainty about the exact nature of his role. ''I am committed to Rolm, and I think I.B.M. is committed to keeping it an independent entity,'' he said. ''But I don't want to become an I.B.M. mid-level manager. And if I.B.M. wants me to do that, they will discover I'm not very good at it.'' **********I.B.M., he said, urged Rolm's top executives to sign agreements to stay on, but they declined. ''Those things don't work in anyone's favor,'' he said. ''They guarantee my salary, but not my happiness.'' **********According to Mr. Oshman, Mr. Rizzo also assured him ''that we won't have 10,000 I.B.M. folks'' descending on Rolm. He also said no Rolm employees had left because of the merger.  Antitrust Case Cited **********Mr. Oshman appeared to agree with industry experts that I.B.M. would not have purchased Rolm - or any other company in its field - while it was still fighting the Government's marathon antitrust suit. The suit was dropped by the Justice Department in 1982. ''I've never discussed it with them, but the last thing you want to do during an antitrust suit is merge with another company,'' he said. **********But Mr. Oshman insisted that the Rolm-I.B.M. merger posed no antitrust problems - a view most experts seem to support - and he disputed the contentions of some critics that I.B.M. was taking advantage of a favorable political climate to race into new businesses. **********''It's a company that is increasingly aware of competition from A.T.& T. and from the Japanese,'' he said. ''But there is an enormous amount of restraint within I.B.M., and they are not eager to get into an antitrust situation again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/24/world/2-die-on-spanish-freighter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 44, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 Die on Spanish Freighter", "print_headline": "2 Die on Spanish Freighter", "body_text": " **********Two stowaways, believed to be Moroccans, were found dead today in a ship's hold when the Spanish freighter Cava de Valldemosa arrived in Barcelona from Casablanca, Morocco.

In his room on the third floor, Bishop Desmond Tutu sat with his wife, Leah, and listened to them sound with joy over his Nobel Peace Prize. **********''I slept badly last night,'' said Bishop Tutu, general secretary of the South African Council of Churches and the leading spiritual voice of blacks in South Africa. He became a visiting professor in Anglican studies at the seminary at Ninth Avenue and 21st Street last month. **********''It was almost like waiting for exam results,'' he said, holding his wife's hand. ''It had happened twice before that people said I was a strong candidate, and the letdown then was very hard. **********''Inside, we really don't believe it.'' **********Early yesterday morning, before they had heard the news, Bishop Tutu and his wife were visited by Tom Eric Vraalsen, the chief Norwegian delegate to the United Nations, who carried a bouquet of bright yellow lillies, sky- blue irises and red zinnias. **********''It was already a giveaway,'' said Mrs. Tutu. ''I had a big lump in my throat and I thought my heart had stopped.'' **********His first thought, Bishop Tutu said, was to go to the chapel ''to thank God, for I am but his agent, and to share this award with the thousands of people that I am only a representative for.'' In the halls of the seminary, ministers, students and teachers were rushing to class when they heard the bells. They stopped, embraced each other and offered thanks, and many of them went to the chapel. **********When the Bishop walked through the wooden doors, his colleagues and the students rose, and hands that had been clasped in prayer began clapping with pride.   'Bells Were Our Sign' **********''There was great, great applause and there were many tears,'' the Rev. Robert Wright, a professor of church history, said. ''The bells were our sign, and when they rang out we all rushed to be with him.'' **********Hymns were sung and Bishop Tutu had a few private moments to read the 139th Psalm, his favorite, he said. **********''The Psalm says that I am nothing but the Lord's servant,'' the Bishop said, ''that I go where He leads me and where He needs me. 'If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.' '' **********He then left the chapel to face the celebrity of his award. At a press conference in the seminary courtyard, with the rustling of the fall leaves underfoot and the gentle chirping of sparrows in the trees, Bishop Desmond charged the South African Government to realize that ''justice is going to win.'' **********''This award is a tremendous political statement,'' he said. ''It says that despite all distortions of truth, the world recognizes that we are striving for peace. It is a tremendous affirmation that our cause is just and our methods are praiseworthy.'' **********The award is not a personal one, Bishop Tutu said, adding: ''It is a corporate award. It belongs to all the black people of South Africa who have suffered, to all who have felt and lived with the evil of apartheid and are trying and striving for peace.'' **********Bishop Tutu spent the day giving interviews, taking every opportunity to shift the spotlight from his honor to his cause. He continually repeated his plea for nations to recognize and try to change the course of apartheid through political and economic pressure. 'Our Last Peaceful Chance' **********''What we have to say to those who invest in South Africa,'' he said, ''is that your investment is a moral as well as an economic issue.'' **********''This is our last peaceful chance,'' he said. ''My fears are the fears of so many that we could very well have a blood bath. It is for everyone to speak out - businessmen, bishops, everybody.'' **********He said he felt that there was no ''sense of contradiction'' in the joining of religion and politics. ''In a situation such as in South Africa, or in any question of morals, the church has to be political,'' he said. ''But not party political, only morally political.'' **********He said he was making plans to leave for South Africa to celebrate. He did not fear repurcussions in returning, he said, despite the fact that his passport has been revoked by South Africa and that he is using travel documents that list his homeland as ''undeterminable at present.'' **********He said he did not fear that South Africa would keep him from attending the award ceremony in Oslo. Last year's winner, Lech Walesa, the leader of Solidarity, decided not to attend the ceremony then for fear Poland would not let him return home. **********Apartheid and Communism ''are equal evils,'' Bishop Tutu said, ''but I do not think the South African Government will be too happy to have people draw that parallel by detaining me.''  For Scholarships and Family **********He said the prize money, about $190,000, would be put in a trust for scholarships ''to those who cannot afford education'' and, he said, ''maybe we will enjoy some of it as a family.'' **********The Bishop and his wife have three daughters and a son, and Mrs. Tutu said she spent much of the morning trying to track them down to share the news. Naomi, a student in Lexington, Ky., and Mpho, a student in Washington, were flying to New York to see their parents off to South Africa, where their third daughter, Thandi, and their son, Trevor, are awaiting them. **********After celebrating, Bishop Tutu said, he will return to finish his term at the seminary. **********In the middle of a hectic afternoon, Bishop and Mrs. Tutu took a few quiet moments to read the telegrams that started to arrive after the morning announcement. The greetings were piled on a living room table next to cards that celebrated both of their birthdays earlier this month. **********There were congratulations and blessings from colleagues at Union Theological Seminary on Morningside Heights, from Bishop John Walker of Washington and the Archbishop of Central Africa, Walter Makhuldu. Governor Cuomo wanted to come over to offer his personal congratulations, but Bishop Tutu said he was not sure there would be time. **********''It is quite overwhelming,'' he said. ''It is a very humbling and yet exhilarating experience.'' **********But to Mrs. Tutu, who said she has seen the pain in his eyes after time in jail and watched his frustration with injustice and his fear for the future, the reward was earned. **********''If I was to be on that committee, seeing who deserves it,'' she said, ''I would have to say he does.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/16/world/4-held-in-gaza-slaying-of-a-palestinian-mayor.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "4 Held in Gaza Slaying Of a Palestinian Mayor", "print_headline": "4 Held in Gaza Slaying Of a Palestinian Mayor", "body_text": " **********Four suspects were reported in custody today in connection with the assassination of the Mayor of a Palestinian city in the Israeli-occupied Gaza. **********The Israeli radio said the police detained 50 Palestinians overnight and quoted Yosef Zechariah, a deputy police commander in Gaza, as saying four were still being held. **********The report did not specify the nationality of the suspects or give further details. **********Abdul Karim el-Mansur Mahmoud Kishta, the Mayor of the city of Rafa on the border between Egypt and Gaza, was shot Friday as he walked home from evening prayers at a local mosque, the authorities said. **********The Voice of Arab Lebanon, a Sunni Moslem radio station, reported in Beirut that ''guerrillas killed him because he was a collaborator'' with the Israeli military government in Gaza.

Col. Domingo Monterrosa, whose area covers three eastern provinces where combat with insurgents has been heaviest in recent months, said in a telephone interview that he could not remember when the reconnaissance missions began. He said that in the last two and a half weeks their use had ''increased in a bigger way,'' in advance of the presidential elections last Sunday. **********Looking for Insurgents **********Colonel Monterrosa said the information from C-130 planes was generally relayed by radio to the high command in San Salvador, or could be sent directly to a United States adviser at the colonel's headquarters. **********Washington had announced an increase in the reconnaissance flights as the elections neared to look for insurgents who might try to disrupt the balloting. It has only now been disclosed that the planes have been giving operational intelligence directly to Salvadoran troops fighting insurgents on the ground.  The United States Ambassador, Thomas R. Pickering, said Monday that reconnaissance missions connected with the election campaign would continue at least through the runoff election, which is expected to be held in early May. The runoff is necessary because neither of the two leading candidates, Jose Napoleon Duarte and Roberto d'Aubuisson, got enough votes to win in the first round. **********'Part of the Scene' **********Mr. Pickering confirmed today in a visit to Washington to report on the elections that United States military spotters in aircraft were providing intelligence for Salvadoran Army troops. Responding to reporters' questions at the State Department, he said the action did not represent any expansion of the United States role in the Salvadoran conflict. **********''These kinds of things,'' he said, ''have been part of the scene in El Salvador for some time.'' **********He said United States advisers in El Salvador had come under hostile fire three times since September but said they had not fired back. **********He said there had been no change in the guidelines drawn up by the Reagan Administration to make sure that the presence of United States advisers in El Salvador does not violate the War Powers Act of 1973. The act requires the President to notify Congress when United States military personnel are engaged in hostilities. **********The guidelines, a United States Embassy spokesman in San Salvador said today, prohibit the advisers from working at a base that is likely to be overrun by guerrillas. The spokesman declined to comment on whether the use of United States planes during combat was a change of policy.   'A Step Up' **********One former United States adviser, who has returned to the United States, said in a telephone interview that, in his view, ''radio to radio'' contact between the air and ground represented a ''step up'' in 1984 in United States military support to El Salvador. **********Colonel Monterrosa, the Salvadoran commander, is based in the eastern town of San Miguel. He said the United States planes had frequently been used in reconnaissance missions in operations there and in the neighboring province of Morazan. He is also responsible for the province of La Union. **********He explained that, for operations in San Miguel, a United States adviser there would get in touch with the pilot of the C-130. ''We receive the information nearly instantly,'' he said. **********In an attack against the San Miguel base Sunday, a plane could be heard flying over the base just after the insurgents opened fire. Colonel Monterrosa said the plane was a C-130 that relayed information on guerrilla positions to the command in San Salvador and to the United States adviser in San Miguel. **********The colonel said the pilots of the planes flew high enough that a ground attack would be difficult. He said he did not know if the planes carried weapons, but said they had never given fire support. A United States military official said the planes were unarmed. **********''If you are in the air you can make sure you don't get into combat,'' the official said. ''But if you are on the ground you can get into actual combat.'' **********U.S. Ambassador's Comments **********WASHINGTON, March 29 - Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said today that information gathered by United States planes flying over El Salvador was ''shared with Salvadorans'' but he declined to discuss details of operations or intelligence activity. **********The Ambassador also confirmed three incidents in which American advisers came under hostile fire recently. Those incidents were made known only after Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, had heard of them and asked the Pentagon for a report. **********Plans for reconnaissance flights over El Salvador were announced on Feb. 8 by the Defense Department, which said Army tactical planes would be sent to Honduras. Privately, officials said the planes would fly over El Salvador to collect information. **********The officials also suggested the planes would gather information about shipments of arms believed to be going from Nicaragua to guerrillas in El Salvador, and about guerrilla movements inside El Salvador. It was implied that the information would be given to Salvadoran forces, but there was no indication then that operational intelligence would immediately be given to Salvadoran forces in the field."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/05/business/purchasing-agents-cite-higher-prices.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 415, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PURCHASING AGENTS CITE HIGHER PRICES", "print_headline": "PURCHASING AGENTS CITE HIGHER PRICES", "body_text": " **********Industrial companies reported sharp increases in production, inventories and new orders in February, the National Association of Purchasing Managers said yesterday in its monthly survey. **********But the 250 purchasing managers surveyed also said that prices were higher last month than at any time in the past three years.

In recent years, however, its function has become increasingly blurred as exports have become more important to the American economy and world competitive conditions have been buffeted by the rise of protectionism and the introduction of floating currency rates. **********As a result, business leaders, trade officials and legal authorities have begun to raise questions as to whether antitrust law needs to be updated. **********The issue took on new urgency last month when the Justice Department's antitrust division said it would block, on anticompetitive grounds, a proposed merger of the beleaguered steel industry's third- and fourth-largest corporations - the LTV Corporation and the Republic Steel Corporation. **********J. Paul McGrath, an Assistant Attorney General who heads the antitrust division, explained the basis of the decision. He said the Justice Department, in calculating the total American market for steel products, had excluded imported steel from Japan and Europe. **********The decision was sharply criticized by the nation's special trade representative, Bill Brock, and the Secretary of Commerce, Malcolm Baldrige. **********''A decade ago no other Cabinet officer would have dared to comment on this decision,'' said Harald B. Malmgren, an independent trade consultant in Washington. ''But it is fair play for other agencies to speak their minds, because they are involved. This is a policy question, not an abstract legal one.'' **********The Justice Department's ruling was doubly surprising in light of recent legislative and regulatory developments that appear to take the importance of global competition into account. **********After initially raising antitrust questions about the Export Trading Act of 1982, the Justice Department reluctantly allowed the legislation to pass without protest. A series of bills intended to ease the antitrust treatment of joint ventures in research and development are working their way through Congress. And the Federal Trade Commission has looked favorably on a joint venture in which the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation are to build small cars in California. **********Questions about the current relevance of antitrust law were recently expressed at the Conference Board's 23d annual meeting by Judge Richard A. Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. **********At the meeting, where the anonymity of people taking part in panel discussions is assured, the participants acknowledged that fear of antitrust action had in the past prompted a number of distinctly anticompetitive, inefficient reactions by business. **********Vigorous enforcement of antitrust law, they contended, had adversely affected investment and research and development decisions. The participants added that this was also at least partly responsible for the conglomerate merger movement of the 1960's and early 1970's, a trend that took some companies in ill-conceived directions. **********At the same time, however, they acknowledged that the existing antitrust laws were broad enough in scope to allow more general concerns, such as international competitiveness, to be taken into account. But until recently, the conferees said, those sorts of concerns had not been adequately addressed. **********''The strategic issue of competitive advantage has become global in scale,'' one participant said, ''and the issue of competitive advantage is one that U.S. law has traditionally had a great deal of trouble with.'' **********Douglas E. Rosenthal, a partner at the Washington law firm of Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan and chief of the foreign commerce section in the Justice Department's antitrust division during the Carter Administration, does not think the antitrust laws need to be revised. But a broader interpretation would be useful, he suggested, particularly in merger cases. **********''We are still primarily concerned with promoting competition in our own domestic market and don't need any change in antitrust laws or enforcement to reach a result that is consistent with trade and diplomatic policy,'' he said. ''The problem is in the definition of relative geographic markets, and what has been missing up to now is law enforcement which allows for policy discretion.'' **********Mr. Malmgren agreed. **********''It is no longer relevant for regulatory authorities to measure domestic industry concentration ratios,'' he said. ''What is relevant is the world concentration ratio. It is clear that Justice has progressed in its thinking from a decade ago. But they haven't gone far enough. They haven't drawn the conclusion that, to address merger issues, they must take worldwide economic parameters into account and ask the President to decide.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/23/world/around-the-world-legislature-dissolved-in-south-indian-state.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Legislature Dissolved In South Indian State", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Legislature Dissolved In South Indian State", "body_text": " **********The Legislative Assembly in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh was dissolved today, after completing less than two years of a scheduled five-year term, paving the way for a major popularity test for its ruler. **********A date for the balloting was not immediately set but the chief minister, N.

Druse spokesmen said the civilians had been massacred there five months ago when the village was under Lebanese Christian control. **********The bodies, in various states of decomposition, were counted by reporters taken by Druse to the village of Kafr Matta, 10 miles southeast of Beirut. There were reports last fall that a massacre had occurred at Kafr Matta, and international relief agency sources who visited it then said they had seen at least 50 bodies in the street or hanging from balconies. **********Kafr Matta used to be a mixed Druse and Christian village. When the Shuf mountain fighting broke out last September between Christians and Druse, the Lebanese Army, which had been separating the two communities in the village, pulled out of town because it said the village was going to be a heavily contested battle ground and it did not want to be caught in the middle. **********Fadi Frem, a leader of the Christian Phalangist militia, said at the time that his forces ''carried out a military offensive to take control of Kafr Matta from the Druse, which they were successful in doing.'' But, he said at the time, ''no massacre took place there at all.''  Accusation of Massacre **********But a Druse leader, Khawla Arslan, accused the Lebanese Army and the Phalangists of killing Druse men, women and children in the town. **********It cannot be said at this point exactly who killed these people and under what conditions they died. **********Almost all of the bodies seen by the reporters today appeared to have been civilians who had been shot. **********Some of the bodies had been piled up in the rooms of houses, some were found lying in the middle of a field crumpled up in apparently the same spot they were shot and killed more than 5 months ago, while still others were resting in the middle of the street, frozen in death where they apparently had been trying to flee. **********Some of the bodies were just skeletons that had decayed during three months of winter rain, while others were still identifiable. The bodies included what appeared to be women, babies and men of various ages.   Searching Through Remains **********Druse militiamen from Kafr Matta and nearby villages sifted through the decomposed remains trying to identify missing friends and loved ones. **********''This is my aunt,'' one teen-age Druse gunman said, pointing to a body. ''And over here is my mother.'' **********Before it was recaptured by the Druse this week, Kafr Matta had been under the control of the Lebanese Army and Phalangist militiamen since the September fighting. **********Apparently, neither the Christian militiamen nor the soldiers, who lived near the bodies, tried to bury them. **********Reporters also found a death-bed note from Clark Todd, a Canadian free- lance journalist, who got caught up in the fighting in Kafr Matta and was shot and later died in a building there. On his blood-stained pillow case he scrawled, evidently just before he died, ''Please tell my family I love them.''  Report Denied Army Role **********The Lebanese Army commander, Gen. Ibrahim Tannous, had appointed a commission to investigate the massacre report last September and it concluded that there was no army involvement in any mass killing in the village. The Druse had described the report at the time as a ''whitewash.'' **********Meanwhile, the Phalangist militia said in a statement tonight that ''as many as 70 Christians'' may have been killed in the Ras Nabah neighborhood on the dividing line between Christian East Beirut and predominantly Moslem West Beirut. Once a purely Christian neighborhood, Ras Nabha is now heavily populated by Shiite Moslems. **********A Phalangist spokesman said his militia had been unable to establish the precise number of killed, but he said that friends and families had identified 30 bodies in a morgue at the American University Hospital in West Beirut. **********It was impossible this evening to substantiate the massacre report. Sporadic fighting was still going on around Ras Nabah between Shiite militiamen and the Phalangists in East Beirut.

Her husband, she said, was in their apartment, while she was across the hall at a neighbor's. **********Gunmen knocked on her door, she said, calling out, among other things, ''Open the door, Christian dogs.'' **********She said she jumped out a window and after hiding for seven hours found her way to a Lebanese Army outpost.

But Alan D. Romberg, a State Department spokesman, said today that ''we have good reason'' to believe Libya carried out the raid. **********''Following the unprovoked attack on the Sudan by a Libyan aircraft on March 16, the Egyptian and Sudanese Governments have requested our assistance to bolster the capability of Egyptian and Sudanese air defense systems by providing early warning of air attacks,'' Mr. Romberg said. **********''Awacs will be part of combined air defense operations being carried out by Egypt and the Sudan. The purpose of these operations is to deter sustained attacks by demonstrating that the three countries can rapidly put in place the assets necessary to deal with such aggression.'' **********Mr. Romberg said the note to Libya, in the absence of diplomatic relations, had been conveyed through Belgium, which represents American interests. **********Another official said the message was, ''Our planes are there and don't mess with them.'' **********''We told the Libyans that we are deploying our own military aircraft in the region and any action against them could have serious consequences,'' the official said. **********The Awacs have two missions: to serve as long-range reconnaissance planes and as command centers directing interceptor fighters against enemy targets. Because the Sudan has virtually no air defenses of its own, Egypt, which has a defense treaty with the Sudan, is responsible for flying interceptor planes in Sudanese airspace and for providing ground air defense, State Department officials said. **********If the Awacs were to come under attack from Libyan planes, it could lead to the involvement of American planes aboard carriers in the Mediterranean. In February 1983, when Awacs were sent to Egypt because the United States feared a Libyan attack on the Sudan, the carrier Nimitz was moved closer to Libyan waters.   Long-Term Aid Being Studied **********Mr. Romberg said the United States was also ''examining what longer-term assistance we could provide the Sudan in the air defense area.'' **********Another official said the Sudan needed radar and antiaircraft weapons, either missiles or guns. The Sudanese are to receive a squadron of American F-5's, but only two have been delivered so far. **********''They had some Soviet radar, but it is inoperative,'' one official said, ''because they have no spare parts.'' **********The Sudanese have been pressing the United States for weeks to speed up weapon deliveries to help them defend themselves against Libyan and Ethiopian help to insurgents in the southern Sudan. The Libyan bombing attack, Mr. Romberg said, has somewhat changed the situation because it made it important suddenly to send the Awacs to meet an immediate problem.   Concern Over Surprise Attack **********''There is no evidence of preparation for a massive attack,'' he said, ''but, as the attack of last Friday shows, there can be surprise attack and we are concerned about that sort of thing.'' **********American officials stressed, as they did last weekend, that the aid was aimed solely at external sources of trouble and was not meant to support the Government in Sudan's civil strife. **********The United States and other powers, the officials said, have urged the Sudanese Government to be conciliatory toward Christians and pagans in the south who have risen in arms the imposition of Moslem law was ordered throughout the country last fall.

Earlier in the week, the Egyptian President said he suspected that both Libya and Iran might be involved. A few days later, Mr. Mubarak said that he viewed Libya as a key suspect.

About 20 percent of the Western world's oil supplies pass through the strait.   U.S. Vows to Keep Strait Open **********Iran has repeatedly stated that it does not wish to close the strategic waterway but would retaliate if its own oil exports were blocked, or its major supply terminal at Kharg Island was attacked by Iraq. **********Since late March, Iraq has stepped up its air attacks on ships loading oil at Kharg and other Iranian oil terminals in an effort to force Iran to negotiate an end to the war, which began in September 1980. **********The United States has warned that it would not permit the Strait of Hormuz or other vital international waterways to be closed to commercial shipping. **********Because Hojatolislam Rafsanjani represents Iran's poltical and religious leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on Iran's powerful Supreme Defense Council, his statements are closely followed by diplomats in Iran and the few Western reporters permitted to travel there. **********Ayatollah Khomeini denied last week that Iran was involved in the mining incidents, asserting that such acts were incompatible with the spirit and teachings of Islam. **********Hojatolislam Rafsanjani, in his remarks today, said retaliation was consistent with Islamic principles. ''We believe that our continued life and the evolution of our society depends on not forgetting this Islamic principle and not letting our enemies be in peace without it,'' he said.   Egypt Backs Iraq in War **********Egypt has supported Iraq in its war with Iran. But it has also tried to play a mediating role by promoting an initiative aimed at resolving the war through negotiation.

The father had emigrated from Rumania as a teen-ager with less than $5 in his pocket, and had become a rich Philadelphia topcoat manufacturer known in his heyday as ''the king of overcoats.'' He lived austerely lest anyone think him wealthy. Jacob Siegel also esteemed education as only an unlettered man can. **********''He sat me down,'' recalls the younger Siegel, telling the story in his father's East European accent, ''and said, 'If a passing grade is 60, you get 60. Why?' **********''I wasn't interested,'' says Mr. Siegel, answering the old question in a wry voice. **********A photograph of the late Jacob Siegel, with formal black suit and stiff white collar, stands in a silver frame in his wood-paneled Madison Avenue office.  Though he revered his father, the two were very different. The sort of detail and long hours that made the father successful in topcoats didn't interest the son. Nor did academics. But during his college days, Herb Siegel found two consuming passions that would become life-long interests: An unsuccessful school-boy bid for part of the Philadelphia Eagles turned into a fascination with chasing deals. And life in the dazzling world of Ann Levy, his fiancee and the daughter of a founder of CBS, hooked him on the glamour of the entertainment industry. **********Now 55 years old, Mr. Siegel still gets a thrill from those two enduring passions. He loves buying companies, which are grouped in Chris-Craft, his holding company. But he avoids the tedium of running them. And he remains fascinated by show business. **********''Herb's not the kind of guy who's going to get grease under his nails,'' says J. Ira Harris, a former executive managing director of Salomon Brothers who was deeply involved in Mr. Siegel's negotiations with 20th Century-Fox. ''He's a phenomenal asset manager rather than a business manager.'' **********Mr. Siegel's latest move, a deal for 19 percent of Warner in exchange for 42.5 percent of Chris-Craft's television station subsidiary, combines those interests into one adventure. The deal appears intended to blunt Mr. Murdoch's quest for Warner because of limitations on foreign nationals owning television stations. But many on Wall Street are inclined to view the arrangement as a ploy to raise the price of Warner for any would-be acquirer. **********Such an outcome would leave Mr. Siegel in an excellent position to pocket a handsome profit on his Warner holdings. It would continue his shrewd pattern of bailing out with a windfall after becoming embroiled in takeover battles for such big companies as Piper Aircraft, Paramount Pictures and 20th Century-Fox. **********''He's not a killer, he's a game player,'' says David Brown, a movie producer and an old friend. **********Acknowleding this, Mr. Siegel says, ''The name of the game is who owns the tickets. If Mr. Murdoch wants to pay enough he's got it. I'm a major investor but I'm not looking to run Warner.'' **********The Australian's pride could make him a determined bidder. Mr. Murdoch says his News Corporation Ltd. cannot afford ''for people to think we are a patsy that can be run over.'' He owns over 7 percent of Warner now, having increased his stake last week, and has won permission from the Federal Trade Commission to raise the total to 49.9 percent. Mr. Siegel also moved last week, increasing his Warner share to over 20 percent. **********MR. Siegel's personal style reflects his taste for wheeling and dealing. His suits have custom- tailored flourishes like cuff buttons that actually button, but he doesn't seem to mind that the suits are often rumpled. Despite the rigors of the Warner battles he still finds time to dine leisurely at the 21 Club and Le Cirque, washing down his grilled fish with glasses of fresh grapefruit juice. The moments between his puffs on Carlton menthol cigarettes are often filled with laughter. **********He dislikes being alone and spends lots of time with performers and people connected with the entertainment business. **********''The most solitary thing I do is read a book, and even then I like to have my wife in the room,'' says Mr. Siegel, a Reagan conservative and multimillionaire who and received almost $1 million in compensation from Chris- Craft last year. ''I would be insulted if the towel boy at my gym didn't say I was a nice guy. I guess it's a desire to be loved.'' **********''He had a great ability to get along with people,'' says Jackie Gleason, who was a client of Mr. Siegel's when he operated a talent agency in the 1960's - one of his acquisitions that was later sold. But he uses that ability selectively. **********''He's got a reputation for being tough and a little nasty'' in difficult situations, according to Lee Isgur, a communications analyst at Paine Webber. **********When John DeLorean was arrested, Mr. Siegel accompanied Mrs. Christine DeLorean to California. Mr. DeLorean was on Chris-Craft's board and the Siegels were close friends of the Deloreans, who only weeks before had been hosts of a birthday party for Mr.  Siegel. But within days, all ties were broken by Mr. Siegel and there is now no contact at all. **********Mr. Siegel has earned a considerable fortune as a deal-maker and a conglomerateurr of small firms, which he groups as divisions of Chris-Craft,the former boatmaker that Mr. Siegel has transformed into a cash-rich chain of six independent television stations and a hodgepodge of small manufacturers of plastics and fiber products. His television stations comprise the nation's fourth-largest non-network television organization. **********Mr. Siegel started dabbling in acquisitions at Lehigh when he tried to buy 20 percent of the Philadelphia Eagles with $60,000 from his trust fund. But the deal fell through when his older partners said the price was too high. **********Also during college, the world of show business was spread before him through his wife, whom he met when they were both Lehigh students. Through his father-in-law's contacts in the entertainment business, he decided that he liked show business more than manufacturing overcoats. Frank Sinatra, a friend of his father-in-law, Isaac Levy, sang at his wedding, and he took his bride to California for a honeymoon spent working as a production assistant on The Lone Ranger television series. **********HE went to work as a theatrical agent, but soon tired of that and turned to business. One of his first acquisition was a sentimental deal in the 1950's for his father's overcoat factory, a business he quickly sold. Negotiating the financing with his father was sticky, Mr. Siegel remembers. ''He insisted I pay him with a certified check and would take no stock.'' **********During the mid-1950's, Herb Siegel bought and sold companies ranging from a car wax manufacturer to a soft-drink bottling operation whose wild cherry soda, he now says, lost its color after a few weeks on the shelf. **********''He does business like a superb poker player,'' says Sam Chon, the legendary talent agent for International Creative Management who is a close friend. ''He'll sit at the table and ante all night long until he gets the right hand.'' **********By 1958 he had become chairman of Seeburg, a jukebox maker. ''At 28, I was the youngest chairman of a company on the American Stock Exchange and my father came when I was elected,'' he says ruefully. ''He didn't say a word about being proud of me. Instead, he took me aside and said, 'Now, you've really got to watch out, be more conservative, be more careful.' '' **********Through more buying and selling, Mr. Siegel's base became the Baldwin- Montrose Chemical Company, and in 1965 he bid for Paramount. After a year of legal battles, Paramount merged with Gulf and Western, but Mr. Siegel pocketed a $2.5 million profit. In 1968, Baldwin-Montrose merged with Chris-Craft - then a troubled boat manufacturing company that looked like a good turnaround candidate, but proved not to be. The boat operation was sold in 1980. **********Mr. Siegel has suffered other setbacks as well. **********In 1969 he began an eight-year crusade to take over Piper Aircraft. Losing a bidding battle with the Bangor Punta Corporation, he sued Bangor and First Boston, its investment banker, charging securities violations. **********He won a $35.8 million judgment, only to have it taken away by the United States Supreme Court in 1977. The lawsuit cost over $2 million in legal fees and untold energy. Mr. Siegel finally sold his Piper stock for a profit of about $2 million, but the rest of his enterprises had been paralyzed for over eight years. **********That debacle was followed by his greatest coup to date after another battle - this time lasting three years. **********Beginning in early 1978, Mr. Siegel accumulated 23 percent of 20th Century-Fox. After yet another lawsuit, he sold his interest in 1981 for a profit of nearly $74 million, plus 19 percent ownership in United Television Inc. That share has now been increased to 50.1 percent and is part of the television subsidiary.  During the negotiations to sell, Mr. Siegel turned down an early offer from 20th Century-Fox that many of his friends urged him to accept. It would have given him a $40 million profit. **********CHRIS-CRAFT had profits of $6.1 million on revenues of $84 million in 1983, down more than 40 percent from the previous year because of unusually heavy expenses to cover employee stock options plans. **********The company's stock has gone from less than 50 cents a share in 1974 to recent highs of over $31 a share, propelled by the television subsidiary's ability to generate large amounts of cash (profits plus depreciation totaled $40 million last year). **********Chris-Craft is a decentralized company whose managers have great autonomy. ''If you do your job, you won't see me,'' says Mr. Siegel, who spends much of his day checking stock quotes on the Quotron monitor beside his desk in search of other prizes. **********''He's very meticulous and careful,'' says a very close friend. ''He reads Standard & Poor's like other people read Playboy.'' **********Last month he learned that an old friend, Steven J. Ross, chairman of Warner, was in for trouble from Mr. Murdoch, who had just announced his purchase of Warner shares. Mr. Siegel had long been interested in Warner, having tried to buy its movie studio in 1968. **********One late-December Sunday morning Mr. Siegel called Mr. Ross and went straight away to his apartment to discuss his proposal for Warner. ''It was a logical place for us,'' Mr. Siegel says. ''They make feature films and have a large film library. We have mostly independent television stations and the cost of programming is going up. We're hedging our position.'' Chris-Craft's stations now buy programming from Warner. A week after that first meeting, a deal was struck. **********Since December, the struggle has intensified. On Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission approved Mr. Siegel's purchase of 19 percent of Warner, making him the largest stockholder - a position previously held by Mr. Murdoch. **********Mr. Murdoch's reaction to this bone in his throat has been to try to bite it in two. He has deluged the Federal Communications Commission with complaints, filed a lawsuit and threatened a proxy fight. He also successfully sought the Federal Trade Commission's approval to buy up to 49.9 percent of Warner's stock, setting the stage for what analysts say could be a buying war. **********On the day the Chris-Craft's purchase of Warner stock was approved, Mr. Murdoch's company denounced the deal and vowed to continue to fight it. Mr. Murdoch's pride could make the corporate wrangle a long and bitter one.  If Mr. Murdoch, or another bidder, should take control, Mr. Siegel would come away - as usual - with a handsome profit. His agreement with Warner includes an unusual provision that Warner will buy back its stock at a premium price if a third party should obtain 33 percent of the shares. **********''It was a brilliant deal for Siegel,'' said John S. Reidy, media analyst at Drexel Burnham. ''It underscores his opportunism.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/02/business/construction-outlays-up-0.2.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 447, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONSTRUCTION OUTLAYS UP 0.2%", "print_headline": "CONSTRUCTION OUTLAYS UP 0.2%", "body_text": " **********Spending on new construction in the United States edged up just two- tenths of 1 percent in April, a much smaller gain than in the previous three months, the Commerce Department said today. **********The value of new construction during the month came to an annual rate of $302.5 billion, up $500 million from March.

PLANS SALE: ITS BANK", "print_headline": "U.M.W. PLANS SALE: ITS BANK", "body_text": " **********For decades, the United Mine Workers of America and the National Bank of Washington have been a kind of odd couple. **********The U.M.W. owns National - indeed, is the only major American union to own a bank - under an arrangement that has brought benefits to both as well as a bitter lawsuit in which the union was found guilty of favoring its bank at the expense of its rank and file. **********Now, however, the relationship appears to be ending. Officials of National and the financially troubled union said today that preparations were under way to sell the bank, Washington's third largest. **********No Firm Buyer Yet **********Joseph Corcoran, the mine workers' press secretary, said he could not comment on reports of a planned sale. But another official who is informed about union financial studies - which have reportedly confirmed the wisdom, if not the necessity, of the sale - said that, while there was no firm buyer yet, the transaction could be concluded this summer, perhaps as soon as the end of July. **********The decision to sell the bank was said to be one result of a broad U.M.W. financial study by Goldman, Sachs & Company, the New York investment bankers, authorized earlier this year by the union executive board. Asked to confirm this report, Mr. Corcoran replied that the executive board authorization expressly forbade public comment on the union's financial plans. **********This secretiveness reflected the fact that any plan to sell the bank would be certain to arouse nostalgic sensitivities in the miners' union. The union made its purchase of 76 percent control of the bank in 1949, for $9.1 million, under the leadership of the late John L. Lewis, who for 40 years was the miners' autocratic president. **********Coal Company Investments **********In the 1950's and 1960's, the National Bank of Washington gave - and received - benefits through the unusual alliance. For a time, Mr. Lewis caused the bank to invest in coal companies, which thereupon promptly became union mines - but infrequently at a profit. **********More significantly, after Mr. Lewis won a pioneering, employer-financed U.M.W. health and welfare plan for the union in 1950, hundreds of millions of dollars paid in by the mine operators was kept by the union's bank in non-interest-bearing accounts, which enhanced the bank's profits at the expense of the plan's coal mining beneficiaries. **********This unorthodox practice - reaping profits for the union-owned bank by cheating the ill and needy among the membership - was not ended until it was exposed and ordered stopped by a Federal judge at the conclusion of a long breach of trust lawsuit in 1970. The suit, brought by rank-and-file unionists, recovered millions of dollars in interest proceeds never converted to benefits for miners and their widows. **********That lawsuit was a political debacle for the crumbling mine workers' regime of W. A. Boyle, Mr. Lewis's successor, who was later sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a dissident U.M.W. challenger, Joseph A. Yablonski. Over all, the bank has in recent years become a poor investment. **********In an interview, the annual dollar return to the union today was estimated by Luther H. Hodges Jr., a professional banker installed as the bank chairman through Federal intervention in 1980, as ''no more than 1 or 2 percent, about $1 million a year.'' With the same assets invested in Government securities, he said, the union could be earning $6 million to $8 million a year. **********According to the union's recently filed financial disclosure statement, required by law, the union owns a controlling majority of $48.6 million worth of National Bank of Washington stock, a figure that almost certainly understates its value. **********Mr. Hodges would not estimate the bank's value or a sale price. But he said the bank, which is limited by law to 22 branches within the District of Columbia, listed assets of $1.2 billion. **********The 1980 management convulsion that brought Mr. Hodges to the bank followed the disclosure of a series of failed multimillion-dollar loans made to friends of U.M.W. officials who also occupied bank directorships and other posts. One bad loan of $4.5 million was to a union officer's crony, the owner of a bankrupt race track. **********A succession of increasingly beleaguered U.M.W. chiefs since Mr. Lewis's retirement in 1960 have privately considered selling the bank. But the current president, Rich Trumka, a 34-year-old miner also trained as a lawyer, appears to be the first to feel secure enough politically to try to do so."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/17/business/ad-angency-stock-new-image.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1015, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AD ANGENCY STOCK: NEW IMAGE", "print_headline": "AD ANGENCY STOCK: NEW IMAGE", "body_text": " **********They are the consummate image- makers. From soap flakes to Presidential candidates, advertising agencies have sold it all, with ever-increasing sophistication. Yet until lately, Madison Avenue had an image problem on Wall Street. **********The stocks of the agencies were considered unreliable. Assets went up and down as accounts shifted from one shop to another, and employees came and went along with the accounts. Financial management had a reputation of being weak. **********Perhaps most important, most agency stocks were just too thinly traded. Sellers could not be sure of a buyer if they needed to get out fast. And most institutional buyers stayed out, leaving the stocks to individual investors. **********''Three or four years ago, many institutions would not buy ad stocks under any scenario,'' said one industry analyst, who asked not to be identified. ''Now there are few institutions that don't own them. It's been an education process.'' **********Shares Have Jumped **********Wall Street's ''education'' is a result of several factors, not the least of which is simple arithmetic: The eight biggest publicly held ad agencies rose 27 percent in composite value in 1983, outperforming the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones industrial average, which rose about 20 percent. The advertising sector did even better in 1982, rising 34 percent, compared with 20 percent for the Dow. **********Grey Advertising, the 13th-largest American agency in terms of revenues as of March 1983, was the best stock performer, rising 54 percent, while Doyle Dane Bernbach Inc. was the only loser of the eight public agencies in 1983, dropping 11 percent in the year, according to Adweek, a trade publication. **********Encouraged by the new attention, the publicly held companies issued a flurry of shares in 1983. Four concerns offered stock or debt issues in 1983, including a British agency, the Saatchi & Saatchi Company, which began selling its American depositary shares in the United States for the first time. **********Last month, Ally & Gargano, the nation's 45th-largest ad agency, became the first United States agency to go public since 1973, with the sale of a million shares. Institutions purchased about 35 percent. **********''There's been a tremendous surge of interest in the last year and a half among institutions that prior to that would not look at an advertising stock,'' said Mary Vandeventer, an analyst at Widmann, Blee & Company, a concern in Narberth, Pa., that tracks the publicly held agency issues. Some of that interest, she added, was a result of stock performance, but more important was improved financial management. **********Financial Management Stressed **********''Up until about three years ago, a number of these companies did not emphasize financial management,'' Mrs. Vandeventer said. ''Some had real financial problems both before and after going public.'' New financial officers - all from other industries - were hired at several of the larger companies. Those changes ''made a significant impact on the analysts that follow these companies,'' Mrs. Vandeventer added. **********Other analysts said that with general elections and the Olympics being held this year in the United States - two events that usually generate substantial advertising - revenue at many agencies is expected to show healthy growth this year. **********Those expectations contributed to the sharp increase in trading last year. In the six months ended Aug. 31, for example, average trading volume of the Interpublic Group of Companies - the industry's largest agency holding company - was 197,000 shares, up more than three times from the 1982 period. **********Yet even with such growing acceptance, the Ally & Gargano issue was not an easy sale. Underwriters said the offering was reduced by 80,000 shares, and the price was cut from a planned range of $14 to $17, to $12 a share. **********''It could have sold faster,'' said Craig Sanger, a vice president in the syndication department at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., the lead underwriter. He said the shares had sold well in Memphis, where the Federal Express Company, a major client of Ally & Gargano, is based. There was also a greater proportion of buyers in the New York area. **********Low Capitalization Issues **********Alan J. Gottesman, a vice president at L. F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, said attitudes about the advertising business have been slow to change. ''There's a movement,'' he said, ''but it's coming with all due glacial speed.'' Mr. Gottesman believes the biggest problem facing the agencies is a low level of capitalization, that is, the price per share multiplied by the number of shares. The Interpublic Group of Companies, for example, has 5.34 million shares outstanding, selling at about $53 a share, for capitalization of about $283 million. **********Of the 15 largest agencies in the United States, measured by total revenues as of March 1983, 10 are publicly traded or owned by publicly traded companies. But the largest individual agency, Young & Rubicam, is private - and adamant about staying so. **********''We think there's an insuperable advantage in being private,'' said Mark Strook, a senior vice president and director of corporate relations. ''You don't have to worry about quarterly earnings, or stock price. You can take a long-term view.'' **********Although several analysts and spokesmen for competing agencies suggested that Y.& R. was a prime candidate to go public, Mr. Strook said the question was not under consideration. **********The advantages of going public are twofold, analysts say. First, it is often easier for a public agency to raise capital for expansion or acquisitions. Second, it takes pressure off the managers, who in many private agencies are expected to buy stock as they progress upward through the firm, and as older employees retire and sell out. At the same time, those older managers can usually make more money going public than selling shares within the firm. Of the one million shares sold by Ally & Gargano, for example, 857,500 were offered by officers and directors, led by the founders, Amil Gargano and Carl Ally, who sold 270,000 each. **********The disadvantages include closer public scrutiny of agency operations, including salaries and compensation, increased paperwork from regulatory filings and earnings reports and potential internal conflict. At BBDO, for example, the decision in 1972 to go public set off a scramble for shares inside the firm."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/03/business/business-people-great-western-adds-a-brokerage-president.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 305, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GREAT WESTERN ADDS A BROKERAGE PRESIDENT", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; GREAT WESTERN ADDS A BROKERAGE PRESIDENT", "body_text": " **********Glen E.

Le Monde reported today that France was particularly worried about a Libyan-supplied rebel buildup in the northwestern part of the new defensive zone. **********Exactly what form French control of the new northern zone will take is likely to depend, officials and diplomats here said, on what strategy France pursues with regard to Libya - whether it chooses to emphasize diplomatic or military steps - and on weather conditions. France sent troops to Chad last August because it feared that a victory by rebel and Libyan forces would presage a major increase in Libyan influence in sub-Saharan Africa. **********One official said the French may be reluctant to move a major share of its northern-most bases into the new zone, which is mostly desert. It may prefer instead, the official said, to go into the area in force only if it is penetrated by rebel forces."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/13/business/award-to-dayco.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Award to Dayco", "print_headline": "Award to Dayco", "body_text": " **********The Dayco Corporation said it had been awarded a $19 million judgment against Edith Reich, a sales agent.

It said that ''a consensus appears to be forming in support of this important objective.'' **********The report, called ''Managing East- West Conflict,'' was issued by the Aspen Institute International Group, a panel that included many former heads of government. It was set up by the larger Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies in 1983. The Aspen Institute describes itself as ''an international nonprofit organization,'' which has often brought together prominent citizens from many countries to discuss pressing issues. **********At a breakfast meeting with some reporters today, Robert S. McNamara, a Defense Secretary in the 1960's, who was one of the signers of the document, said he was heartened by some recent moves announced by Gen. Bernard D. Rodgers, the supreme NATO commander, to improve the alliance's conventional forces and to extend the period it would take in a clash with the Russians before the allies faced the choice of defeat or using nuclear weapons.   More Meetings Are Urged **********The report, written before the announcement last week that Secretary of State George P. Shultz would be meeting on Jan. 7-8 in Geneva with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko of the Soviet Union, said that ''all thoughtful people are concerned over the state of East-West relations.'' **********''Hostility runs high,'' it said, ''contacts are sparse; rhetoric has clouded reality, and there are risks of dangerous misunderstandings. The fear of a military confrontation leading to nuclear war looms large in the popular mind.'' **********It recommended that there be more high-level meetings between East and West, including summit meetings. **********''Summit meetings are especially important,'' it said. ''If they are more frequent, unrealistic expectations will thereby be deflated.'' **********The report called for the start of negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States on controlling antisatellite weapons and for resuming the suspended negotiations on reducing nuclear arms. These are the goals of the Shultz-Gromyko meeting. **********It also recommended that the United States propose to the Russians the creation of a new body to be called a strategic panel. **********''This body would initially be composed of a small number of high-level U.S. and Soviet representatives,'' it said.   What Panel Would Do **********The group would hold confidential, informal talks and ''would be charged with establishing a security dialogue, weaving together the many strands of arms control negotiations and defense policy decisions involving NATO and the Warsaw Pact,'' the report said. **********It said that, initially, the panel ''could explore ways of reducing the numbers of nuclear weapons in Europe, controlling technological innovation, improving verification and treaty compliance, and enhancing stability.'' **********''We believe the East-West arms control agenda is long,'' the report said, ''and time is short. There cannot be winners and losers in this search for viable arms control agreements, for no nation will sign or honor an agreement it believes to be harmful to its vital interests. Arms control is a mutual endeavor whose goal is enhanced mutual security. It is time to move forward.'' **********In defending the policy of mutual deterrence, the panel said that there currently exists ''a cautious stalemate'' between East and West. ''Each side's weapons insure that the other's are not used; each deters the other,'' it said. **********''Such deterrence, in our judgment, is neither immoral nor illogical,'' the report said. ''There have now been almost four decades of nuclear peace, in spite of serious East-West crises. But deterrence may not be eternal, and behind it there always yawns the atomic abyss.'' **********''Any policy which cannot withstand a single major failure, whether of a machine or a fallible human being, is understandably questioned by thoughtful people the world over,'' it said. ''Hence the search for positive alternatives to deterrence should continue, hand in hand, with attempts to strengthen and stabilize deterrence.''  'Star Wars' Plan Criticized **********Mr. McNamara and another signer of the report, George F. Kenan, former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, were two of the four authors of an article published today by Foreign Affairs magazine that urges President Reagan to drop his plans to try to develop a foolproof defense against nuclear missiles, a program officially called , the Strategic Defense Initiative, but more commonly known as ''Star Wars.'' **********The article, also signed by McGeorge Bundy, White House national security adviser in the 1960's, and by Gerard C. Smith, head of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency under President Nixon, said that Mr. Reagan's initiative was ''a classic case of good intentions that will have bad results because they do not respect reality.'' **********In March 1983, Mr. Reagan called for intensive research to find a way to make nuclear weapons obsolete. It has been criticized by many experts as a waste of resources because they contend that no defensive system could succeed in blocking all offensive nuclear weapons. **********''What is certainly and fundamentally wrong with the President's objective is that it cannot be achieved,'' the authors said. **********The authors called on Mr. Reagan to reaffirm the American commitment to the existing treaty limiting defensive ballistic missiles and to seeking ways of limiting the size of each side's nuclear arsenals."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/19/world/8-slain-in-sicily-mafia-role-seen.html": {"writer_name": "E.

The bodies were found several hours later after the police were alerted by an anonymous telephone call. **********All of those killed were between the ages of 20 and 30. At least three had police records. The police suspect that all eight had connections with organized crime.   Higher Toll Suspected **********The authorities said that more than eight people might have been shot. When the police arrived, the father of one of those killed was trying to take away his son's body. The police made inquiries at hospitals to see if others might have escaped the shootings alive. **********Five bodies were found inside the stable and three were discovered outside. Witnesses said that the stables and the animals in them were covered with blood. **********The police set up roadblocks around the city and picked up dozens of people for questioning after they discovered the bodies in an area called ''The Courtyard of the Slaughterhouse.'' **********The stables are in a tough Palermo neighborhood that is said to be under the control of a Mafia group led by Filippo Marchese.   Cooperation by Crime Figure **********Mr. Marchese was reportedly identified by Tommaso Buscetta, the organized crime figure whose cooperation with the authorities led to the issuance of 366 arrest warrants at the end of last month, as one of the main leaders of the Mafia in Palermo. **********The Italian news agency ANSA quoted Giovanni Falcone, the magistrate leading the investigations spurred by Mr. Buscetta's confessions, as saying that the killings could not have taken place without the approval of the ''Commission'' that runs the Sicilian Mafia. **********The police theorized that the killings could be part of a settling of scores growing out of a horse-race betting racket. But they also said that the murders might be part of a broader gang dispute. **********At least three of those killed were members of the Quattrocchi family, and another was related to the family by marriage. The police were trying to determine whether the family had crime connections. The Quattrocchi family runs a horse meat shop in Palermo and, the police added, also supplies low-quality horses for use in probably illegal races.   Recent Battling by Gangs **********Fierce gang fighting broke out in Sicily from 1981 to 1983. The gang war is believed to have led to a victory of groups associated with the Greco family, and also an organized crime organization from the town of Corleone. **********The gang war was at least indirectly responsible for Mr. Buscetta's confession, since he was affiliated with groups that lost the struggle for control of Sicilian organized crime. Mr. Buscetta's testimony has implicated the victorious groups in a variety of criminal acts, including murders of public officials. **********The Marchese crime family is believed by authorities to have been split by the gang war, and the area under Mr. Marchese's control has been the scene of many killings. The police believe the neighborhood has suffered violence both from the general gang war, and from the division within the Marchese family."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/11/business/familiar-problems-confronted-leaders.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1984-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 771, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FAMILIAR PROBLEMS CONFRONTED LEADERS", "print_headline": "FAMILIAR PROBLEMS CONFRONTED LEADERS", "body_text": " **********The challenges that confronted the leaders of the seven nations at their 10th annual economic summit meeting here this weekend resembled to a remarkable degree those their predecessors faced at the first summit meeting held a decade ago in the Chateau de Rambouillet outside Paris. **********The industrial democracies are again trying to sustain an economic recovery that seems alarmingly vulnerable. A decade ago, the threats were renewed inflation and another oil price shock. Today, world recovery is menaced by high interest rates and the debt crisis in the third world. **********But both the nature of the leaders and the nature of these annual gatherings have changed. **********Those who gathered in the library at Rambouillet a decade ago - men such as President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany, Prime Minister Harold Wilson of Britain and President Gerald R. Ford with Henry A. Kissinger at his side - were all more internationalist in outlook, more experienced in macroeconomic affairs and more convinced that the governments could control their economic destiny.  Most of those at Lancaster House this weekend are ideologically opposed to government interference in the economy. And all of them appear more concerned with domestic issues than their predecessors did. **********The Original Purpose **********The summit meetings themselves have become bloated and bureaucratic. Originally conceived by President Giscard d'Estaing as a small, secret and informal meeting between the five top leaders, the roster has grown to include leaders of Canada, Italy and the European Economic Community. The agenda has become bigger and more political, while media attention has increased. **********The question is whether the summit meetings could or should do more to strengthen confidence that the economic recovery can be maintained. **********The record is not reassuring. Unemployment has increased every year since the first meeting at Rambouillet. And most of the agreements made at the meetings have failed the test of time. **********For example, the Franco-American pact on stabilizing exchange rates, which was the Rambouillet meeting's major achievement, did not stabilize exchange rates. **********The coordinated stimulation of the economies of the seven nations, pushed through by President Jimmy Carter at the London and Bonn meetings in 1977 and 1978, was undoubtedly the most ambitious proposal ever adopted at these meetings, with the United States trading unpopular energy-saving measures for stimulative fiscal action by West Germany and Japan. But the Bonn deal is now criticized by monetarist economists for edging the world toward hyper-inflation and recession. **********Overtaken by Events The joint energy savings negotiated at Tokyo in 1979 became irrelevant as the world economy was sent reeling by the second explosion in oil prices. **********The latest meetings, at Versailles, Williamsburg and London, have not saved the allies from quarrels over United States interest rates and trading with the Soviet bloc. Repeated pledges to resist protectionism have mostly been honored in the breach. **********But some argue that the world would be in an even worse mess without these annual face-to-face meetings. As David Watt, a former director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, told a seminar last week, regular summit gatherings at least ''concentrate leaders' minds on things they would rather not think about.'' **********It is also true that the current economic recovery should make cooperation easier between the allies. From Rambouillet in 1975 to the Bonn decision to stimulate the economies in 1978, the dominant concern was to promote sustainable economic growth. As the Iranian revolution led to a second recession caused by escalating oil prices, the summit leaders found themselves forced onto the defensive, concentrating their attention on saving energy and fighting inflation. **********Original Concerns Resurface **********Now the situation has come full circle, with the need to sustain economic recovery being the major concern at Williamsburg last year and at London this weekend. **********Moreover, the governments clearly can do more about the threats to the present recovery, such as high interest rates and the third world debt, than they could about oil prices linked to Middle Eastern politics.  But the problem is how to persuade today's leaders to take advantage of that power. **********Last week, former British Foreign Secretary David Owen suggested a way. Broaden the meetings' agenda to include defense and security issues, he said. That would, according to Mr. Owen, increase the room for trade- offs in fields that interest today's leaders more than international economics. **********Europe, he argued, should offer to stimulate its economies by spending more on defense, allowing the United States to reduce military spending, cut its budget deficit and lower interest rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/29/world/around-the-world-turk-shot-in-teheran-armenians-claim-attack.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 139, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turk Shot in Teheran; Armenians Claim Attack", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Turk Shot in Teheran; Armenians Claim Attack", "body_text": " **********A Turkish businessman was shot and critically wounded today in Teheran, Iran, and Armenian militants said they had carried out the attack, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said here. **********The attack took place shortly before the Turkish Prime Minister, Turgut Ozal, arrived in the Iranian capital on an official visit. **********The businessman, Isik Yonder, was hit by a bullet in the brain when gunmen fired on him and his wife, the spokesman said.

The Government, the spokesman charged, had participated in ''unmeasurable and unqualified graft.'' **********The charges fell flat. ''People here reacted by asking, 'What are they talking about?' '' a Western economist recalled. ''Everyone knows this is just about the healthiest economy in black Africa and that Paul Biya is Mr. Clean.'' **********In the 24 years since independence, Cameroon, which sits at the juncture of west and central Africa, has been one of the few countries in Africa that can claim even modest economic success. Analysts award the lion's share of that success to the policies of Mr. Biya's predecessor, Ahmadou Ahidjo, who governed for 22 years before stepping aside in 1982. **********Encouraged Agriculture **********Mr. Ahidjo, unlike many African heads of state, eschewed expensive, prestige projects. He exploited Cameroon's petroleum resources without allowing oil earnings to distort economic growth. He also encouraged agriculture. **********''You could always make a buck by growing food,'' one economist said. ''The farmers weren't sacrificed in favor of the urban population as they were in Nigeria and so many other countries.'' **********As a result, Cameroon today is virtually self-sufficient in food and the economy is growing at close to 7 percent a year, after adjusting for an annual inflation rate of between 15 percent and 20 percent. **********Mr. Ahidjo retired voluntarily, handing over power to his Prime Minister and longtime associate, Mr. Biya. As it turned out, though, Mr. Ahidjo was not prepared to relinquish full control, and before long a power struggle broke out. **********Sentenced in Abstentia **********By last summer, Mr. Ahidjo had been forced into exile in France and, early this year, a Cameroon court sentenced him, in absentia, to death for plotting against the Government. The sentence was later commuted to detention for an indefinite term. **********Then, on April 6, sections of the 1,500-man palace guard - which had been formed by Mr. Ahidjo - attempted to overthrow Mr. Biya. After three days of fighting, pro-Government units put down the resistance. **********Officials agree that conflicts over economic patronage was a major factor behind the coup attempt. **********During his tenure, Mr. Ahidjo, a Moslem from the north of the country, favored ''a clique of northern Moslems for power and money positions,'' according to officials here. **********Redistribution of Power **********Mr. Biya, on the other hand, is a Roman Catholic from the south who, according to European diplomats here, has attempted to break Mr. Ahidjo's power base and restore a more equitable regional and religious balance of economic power. He has also waged an energetic campaign against corruption. **********Both campaigns, however, have had an unsettling effect on the day-to- day running of the country. **********''What Biya has been trying to do is certainly laudable,'' a Western banker here said, ''but it has also caused a lot of trouble. Under Ahidjo, the system functioned, not more efficiently, but more smoothly.'' **********Now, businessmen and economists say, the system is in flux. **********''You've got customs officials who don't even know how to do business legal ways, who don't know what the tariff is or what forms to fill out,'' a banker said. ''You've got other officials who are afraid to so much as sign a piece of paper. You can't change everything overnight.'' **********The coup attempt and the tension and uncertainty it generated appear likely to hobble economic activity further, several business executives and economists say. ''Coup attempts, secret trials and executions just don't do much for investor confidence,'' one economist commented. **********Still, there is reason for optimism if the political problems do not worsen. Cameroon has a good balance of payments position, foreign debt is a low $2.3 billion and debt service takes only 12 percent of export earnings. **********In addition, oil production is expected to reach some 60 million barrels in 1984, with almost 80 percent going to the United States. **********''Basically, this country has a lot going for it,'' a Western economist said. ''And Biya seems to be on the right track: he's a liberal, he's against favoritism and in favor of individual initiative and he wants to clean up the economy.

We want you to be around a long time'' - and the whole group applauded. **********Given that the man they were clapping for is the hard-driving boss who has slashed the salaries of newly hired pilots and flight attendants by up to 50 percent, cut 7,000 workers from the payroll, and who is so impatient that he has been known to call 4 A.M. staff meetings, there is something paradoxical about the warmth the American Airlines employees feel for their leader. **********For while most people think of Mr. Crandall as the man who attracted notoriety - and Justice Department antitrust charges - with an expletive-filled phone call suggesting that American and Braniff could make more money if they agreed to raise their fares, his employees instead see Mr. Crandall as the man who saved their jobs during a dangerous time for the industry, and they are grateful.  ''If he was not at the helm the company might not be where it is,'' said Josephine Weisdorfer, a passenger service agent whose pay was not slashed. **********Still, most of the employees who came to Mr. Crandall's annual ''Presidential Conference'' at the Marriott Hotel near La Guardia asked questions about how secure their jobs would be and whether the new workers hired at lower salaries were a threat to the security of more senior employees. **********There are plenty of other questions that could be raised about Mr. Crandall's ambitious plan to evolve into what he calls ''American Tomorrow'': the ideas are still untested, but American is gambling on the hope that it can be the first major trunk airline to position itself to compete on both costs and fares against the newer - and cheaper - non-union lines, such as People Express and New York Air, that are attracting an increasing share of air travelers. **********American is not the only airline convinced that its future profitability - and perhaps its survival - hinges on getting its costs down to the level of the new lines. In its current labor negotiations, United is seeking concessions similar to those that American has won. Eastern recently gave its employees 25 percent of the common stock in return for one-year wage concessions of 18 percent, while Continental resorted to bankruptcy to cut wages by up to 50 percent. **********What caused all this turmoil was a combination of deregulation, which nurtured the rise of the new airlines, and the recession, which cut travel and sparked ferocious fare wars that left serious financial scars on the established airlines, scars the recovery can only partly heal. **********American was the first of the major airlines to attack the problem head- on, with a four-year campaign to convince employees that in the long run, the way to save their jobs was to agree to the hiring of new employees at lower wages. Last March, after numerous meetings with employees, Mr. Crandall finally won the new contracts without much bitterness, largely because employees hired before the agreement were guaranteed their jobs for life, with no pay cuts or benefit reductions. **********''We've got to convert the way we relate to our people,'' said Mr. Crandall, who lives in Dallas with his wife and three children, and travels to all the major installations each spring to preach the company gospel and answer questions from 36,000 employees. ''We just cannot have confrontation. If the company is going to prosper and the people are going to prosper we need cooperation. Because when customers get on American Airlines, they have to feel that same sense of enthusiasm that they feel in one of the new entrant airlines.'' **********ALTHOUGH he is neither the **********chairman nor the chief executive of the airline, Mr. Crandall is the one responsible for operating decisions. American's chairman, Albert V. Casey, ex-president of the Times Mirror Company, had no airline experience when he came to American in 1974 to replace George A. Spater, who left after admitting that he had made an illegal $55,000 corporate contribution to the Nixon campaign. **********Both men came from the financial end of their previous companies, Mr. Casey said, so in some fundamental way, they spoke the same language: ''You know, cash flow, controllership,'' he said.  Shortly after arriving at American, Mr. Casey said, he and Mr. Crandall together interviewed top people from such companies as Colgate Palmolive and Gillette, and he was so impressed with Mr. Crandall's skills that he gave him the job - senior vice president, marketing. **********''Through the questioning,'' he recalled, ''I realized that Bob had a better understanding of marketing than those we were interviewing.'' **********Mr. Crandall has made major changes at American, in marketing and other areas. He set up the nation's first frequent-flyer program; supported the expansion of the computerized reservation system, Sabre, now dominant in the industry, and, between 1980 and 1983, cut the payroll to 35,000 workers from 42,000. He is also known for helping shut down Braniff for two years - Braniff began flying again only last month - by matching its fares. **********The 48-year-old airline executive who ''moved and moved and moved'' in his youth - attending 14 schools in 12 years - has moved around a good deal in his career, too. After his 1960 graduation from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, he worked for Eastman Kodak, then Hallmark Cards. In 1966 he joined Trans World Airlines, where he rose to vice president, data services, and later vice president and controller. He left T.W.A. in 1972 and, after a six- month detour to Bloomingdale's, came to American as senior vice president, finance. **********Those who have worked with Mr. Crandall, both at American and T.W.A., say his marketing and organizing skills may give American the lead in reorganizing for the new competition - if employee support for his programs stays strong. **********''He expects people to do what they are asked,'' said Richard Pearson, T.W.A.'s vice president, maintenance and engineering. ''In the process, he creates tremendous high morale and loyalty. We just didn't want anything to fail for him. He made us better than we were.'' **********But, they say, he is no pushover. He can be stern when a task in not going well and impatient with subordinates who do not perform up to his standards. **********While his colleagues say Mr. Crandall resorts to 4 A.M. meetings only rarely, ''there are a lot of 6 A.M. meetings,'' according to Thomas G. Plaskett, senior vice president-marketing. **********''He's extremely competitive,'' said Bob Malone, the president of the Allied Pilots Association, which represents American Pilots. ''It's his personality. He is very dogmatic in his approach. Once he has made a decision he's like a bear to get him to change.'' **********Robert J. Joedicke, the airline analyst for Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., who has known Mr. Crandall many years, describes him as ''a hard-nosed businessman. He's a no- nonsense man. He doesn't suffer any lack of professionalism around him.'' **********Unlike Mr. Malone, though, Mr. Joedicke says Mr. Crandall is more pragmatic than dogmatic: ''He knows what he wants to do but also knows what's possible. He's a realist.'' **********Sometimes, though, Mr. Crandall may want to do more than what's possible. That was certainly the image left by his Feb. 21, 1982, phone conversation with Howard D. Putnam, then chairman of Braniff International - the conversation that led the Justice Department to charge that Mr. Crandall was trying to fix prices and monopolize air routes.  In that call, which was tape recorded, Mr. Crandall told Mr. Putnam, ''I have a suggestion for you. Raise your goddamn fares 20 percent. I'll raise mine the next morning.'' When Mr. Putnam said, ''We can't talk about pricing,'' Mr. Crandall answered, ''Oh (expletive), Howard. We can talk about any goddamn thing we want to talk about.'' **********Although the Federal District Court in Dallas dismissed the charges, ruling that the conversation was just a ''solicitation,'' the Justice Department has gone to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans to try to have the case reinstated. The incident is still a sore point with Mr. Crandall. He agreed to be interviewed on the condition that he not be questioned about the incident. **********Still, in the interview, Mr. Crandall, a medium-sized man with light- brown hair, admitted that some people think he pushes too hard. **********''It's not a matter of driving people so much as an impatience to define a problem and get a solution,'' he said. ''It's a matter of impatience. Let's get it done. It's a very fast-moving business.'' **********Mr. Crandall seems to have mastered that pace, though. In 1983 American Airlines had record earnings of $227.9 million, compared with a $19.6 million net loss in 1982, when the industry was deep in recession. **********American has also begun an ambitious expansion program with an order of 67 McDonnell Douglas Super 80 airplanes and an option to buy another 100 - one of the largest airplane purchases in history. The order, valued at $1.3 billion, calls for the delivery of 25 of the fuel-efficient two- crew aircraft in 1985, 25 more in 1986 and the final 17 in 1987. **********The airline plans major expansions in Chicago, where it will increase its gates at O'Hare International Airport to 29 from 16, and, by 1988, increase the number of daily departures to 272 from 154. Earlier this month, American announced plans to establish a new 25-gate hub in Denver. The airline will also increase its coast-to- coast flights, doubling its New York- Los Angeles flight to eight round trips a day. **********Mr. Crandall said that the airline has a great incentive to expand since new employees are hired at much lower salaries under the terms of last year's settlements with the Transport Workers Union, the Allied Pilots Association and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants. **********THE pay differences are dramatic. A Boeing 727 captain who **********was with American under the old contract, for example, earns $140.46 an hour, while a newly hired captain gets only $68.12 an hour. A flight attendant who worked under the old contract earns $31.16 an hour, while a newly hired flight attendant starts at $21.97 an hour. **********Being able to hire new employees at a much lower rate, Mr. Crandall said, gives American the ability to build a low-cost carrier within the shell of the old airline. **********''These new airplanes together with the labor contract allow us to go forward and create this pseudo new entrant,'' he explained, adding that the costs of the revamped airline he calls ''American Tomorrow'' should be fully competitive with other entrants. But unlike a brand new airline, he says, the ''new'' American has all the advantages of the old one - strong identity, computer reservation system, marketing resources and route structure.  Another feature Mr. Crandall considers a great asset, and one he helped develop, is American's emergence as a hub airline. American controls about 65 percent of the traffic at its hub at the Dallas/ Fort Worth International Airport - a much higher percentage than even the classic hub operation, Delta's 45 percent share of the flights out of Atlanta. **********While the hub strategy means fewer direct flights between small, non-hub cities, it also means that travelers who fly American into the hub are likely to use American on the outgoing flight, since so many connecting flights are available. **********''The hub-and-spoke strategy is one that says we must be able to offer a great deal of product,'' Mr. Crandall said. ''We can now carry you between several thousand city pairs.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/16/business/warner-to-offer-preferred-stock.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Warner to Offer Preferred Stock", "print_headline": "Warner to Offer Preferred Stock", "body_text": " **********Warner Communications Inc. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a shelf offering of 7.26 million shares of series C cumulative convertible preferred stock, the company said Friday.

Dismayed at being unable to deliver his letter, he determinedly asks neighbor after neighbor where the former resident has gone, and finally tracks her down to a fruit stand in a marketplace. He hands her the envelope and she clutches it to her heart. Then, with a beatific smile, she reaches out and shakes the postman's hand in obvious appreciation. **********Given the speed of the mail here, many Mexicans tend to believe that this type of search goes on even for the recipients of letters that are correctly addressed. But that is not the point. **********''We're not trying to tell people that the postal service is great,'' said one Government official involved in the advertising campaign. ''We're trying to say that there are some public servants who do their jobs well, and they deserve some recognition.''  Showing the Good Things, Too **********Other public servants being recognized include teachers, firemen, doctors and nurses, telephone and electric workers, road workers and agricultural extension agents. **********The advertisements were prepared for the Government's Directorate of Radio, Television and Cinematography, a division of the Interior Ministry. The division's director, Jesus Hernandez Torres, said they purposely lacked the tone of ''triumphalism'' that characterized previous efforts by the Government to communicate with the people. **********''Look, you spend time backed up in traffic on the Periferico, you go to the supermarket and the price of food has gone up a little bit - this bothers people a lot,'' Mr. Hernandez said. ''But we're trying to show there are good things, too. You turn on the light switch and there's light. You pick up the phone and there's a dial tone. Despite the fact that we're in an economic crisis, everything is not bad.'' **********The people who designed the campaign decided, however, that to tell the people this head-on would probably have little effect. A person who can endure the wait and expense of being connected to the byzantine Mexico City telephone system, for example, quickly learns that one of the surest ways to meet a stranger is to dial the telephone number of a friend. **********Similarly, the Government's frequent exhortations that everything was fine as the country plunged into its 1982 fiscal crisis did little to heighten public confidence in its pronouncements.   Aiming for the Heart **********The campaign, therefore, has been designed to avoid the errors of the past by aiming for the heart, not the head. A document describing the strategy says that the advertisements should ''not communicate directly the virtues of Government institutions,'' should ''not underestimate the people's sensibilities'' and should not use ''grandiloquent or moralistic language.'' **********Instead, they carry emotional images - a fireman rescuing a little girl's puppies from a burning building, for example - as a voice says simply: ''Behind every service that functions in this country, there are capable and reponsible Mexicans. To appreciate their daily effort is to promote their excellence. A good way to achieve the quality of service that Mexico needs is to express our recognition of good work.'' (Apparently acquainted at a young age with the way Mexico traditionally has worked, the little girl offers the fireman one of her puppies; he declines.) **********Another set of advertisements is intended to imbue a ''feeling of hospitality and generosity'' among Mexicans, particularly in the often brusque and always overcrowded capital, according to Guillermo Heitler Aroeste, the head of evaluation and analysis for the directorate. **********In one such advertisement, a photographer who drops his equipment is helped in recovering it by a group of young boys. In another, neighbors get together and volunteer their efforts to rebuild a little store that has been damaged by fire. ''Every day,'' the hidden voice says, ''Mexicans demonstrate with actions that to act with nobility is something very much a part of us.''  Reactions Called Positive **********Other efforts planned by the unit will, according to the planning document, increase ''recognition of national heroes and demonstrate how with honest leaders supported by popular will, many of the grave crises in the country's history have been overcome.'' Another, using capsule biographies of historic Mexican figures, is intended to ''reinforce national identity and expand the knowledge of history among the population.'' **********The major goals of the Government advertisements are never expressed outright, however. According to the planning document, they are to ''provide a gradual increase in the citizen's confidence in the Government's institutions and men'' and to ''insure that the statements about the moral renovation of the society are translated into tangible and operative concepts.'' **********Under Mexican law, television stations must give 2.5 percent of their advertising time to the Government, and this is being used to run the commercials at least five times a day on each station. The same theme is being used in radio advertisements. **********According to Mr. Heitler of the Directorate of Radio, Television and Cinematography, the reactions in tests among average people were quite positive. ''People would look at the advertisements and say, 'That's happened to me,' or 'They're right, we have to recognize these things.' '' And even Mexicans with a bit more cynical edge seem to be affected by the advertisements. **********''Of course it's a lie,'' said one Mexican professional as he sat before the television the other night and watched the postman track down the young woman. ''But what a good commercial.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/06/world/around-the-world-taiwan-mine-explosion-kills-2-and-traps-93.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 158, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Taiwan Mine Explosion Kills 2 and Traps 93", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Taiwan Mine Explosion Kills 2 and Traps 93", "body_text": " **********A coal mine explosion near Taipei killed two miners today and trapped 93 others deep underground, the police said.

Others cited consumer caution because of the Presidential election, although no such sales letdown was experienced in the city in the 1980 election period. Four years before that, however, sales were erratic during October. **********But most agreed that a major factor was a public that has come to expect ''sale'' prices on most merchandise because of the aggressive pricing strategy that retailers have recently been adopting. **********Retailers said that many items were now difficult to sell except at reduced prices because of this change in buyer psychology. **********Retailers participating in the spot- check are Abraham & Straus; B. Altman & Company; Bloomingdale's; Gimbel Brothers; Lord & Taylor; R. H. Macy & Company, and Saks Fifth Avenue.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said its casualty count had reached 40 dead and 360 wounded and was still incomplete. Most of the casualties, it said, were civilians. **********In Tel Aviv, the Israeli military command said the targets were two bases used by Iranian-supported Shiite guerrillas in operations against Israeli forces in southern Lebanon.

But the police in Bhamdun reported little damage. **********Today's attack in the Baalbek area, which is in the Bekaa, Lebanon's eastern valley, was the ninth Israeli air strike in Lebanon since Nov. 4, when 29 Israeli soldiers and 32 Arabs were killed in the southern Lebanese port of Tyre by a truck-bombing attributed to Shiites. **********Israeli troops occupying the southern third of Lebanon have been almost daily targets of ambushes, rifle shots and bombs.

Shiite leaders vowed to retaliate for today's raids. **********According to the Beirut radio, the raids began at 8 A.M. with 16 jets swooping low over Baalbek to deliver their bombs. The town, which dates from Roman times, is seven miles from the Syrian border. **********Ramez Ismail, a Reuters reporter who lives in Baalbek, said the first group of planes seemed to be aiming at the former police barracks, on the edge of town, but missed. The second group, he said, destroyed the barracks ''and all nearby stores and buildings.'' **********He said the bombers also destroyed 30 houses and a mosque in the refugee camp and hit a school where classes had just begun. The Beirut radio said a former vocational school that had been taken over by Shiite militiamen was ''totally devastated.'' **********Mr. Ismail said the town fell quiet for about 10 minutes. But as men and women began dragging dead and wounded from the wrecked buildings, he said, the planes returned with more bombs, ''thus adding to the number of of those killed or wounded.'' **********''Clouds of smoke covered Baalbek,'' he said.

Cooley Jr., director of sales and marketing, who had already been briefed by the word-coiners at his agency, Marsteller. **********And after spending an hour or so with him and his associates, listening to the quirks of the high-performance- imported-car-fan, one could come away believing that the word will be quite understandable to them. **********''This car gives you the drive that the others only promise,'' said David B. Brown, vice president, group management director, at Marsteller. **********''These people wear their cars,'' said Mary Nichols, ad director at Alfa Romeo North America, with headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, N.J. **********''It's an extension of their personality,'' added Mr. Cooley. **********At the moment there are two models, the GTV-6, a two-door sedan priced at about $19,000, and the Spider Veloce, a two-door convertible, priced at about $16,000.  ''There is a perception that the car is a lot more expensive than it is,'' said Mr. Brown. **********But at least there is a perception. The names of some high-priced foreign cars frequently invoke a blank stare, according to Mike Slosberg, executive vice president and creative director at the agency. Not so with Alfa Romeo, he said. And the same is true of its logotype, the circle with the name enclosing the cross and the serpent. **********In an effort to break through what Mr. Slosberg described as the clutter and mediocre sameness of advertising in the category, the logotype might show up in one ad on each blossom of a flowering bush, in another on the cape of a matador and in still another in a painting being done by a roadside artist who from the back is a ringer of Winston Churchill. **********And although 30 percent of the Spiders are being bought by females, the target audience for the Alfa Romeo campaign is males in the 25 to 54 age group making at least $40,000 a year. **********Those who are automotive buffs will see the ads, beginning in February issues, in the car buff publications.

That number was trimmed in order to obtain greater frequency against the target. While last year each publication got about three insertions, this year's plan calls for ads in every other issue, according to Mr. Cooley. **********The ad budget this year will be up a quarter of a million dollars from last year's, to $2.25 million. That may not sound like much when compared with the total amounts spent at Mr. Cooley's alma mater, General Motors, but as he pointed out, ''What we're spending on advertising per car is astronomical.'' **********The per-car amount ran $666 last year, when Alfa Romeo sold 3,002 units in the United States, putting it at the bottom of the high-performance European sports car category. **********''But,'' Mr. Cooley added, ''that's the price you have to pay to get back in the market.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/03/business/visicorp-is-merging-into-paladin.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1984-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 500, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VISICORP IS MERGING INTO PALADIN", "print_headline": "VISICORP IS MERGING INTO PALADIN", "body_text": " **********Visicorp, which became a star in the personal computer software industry on the strength of its Visicalc spreadsheet program, has become the latest and largest example of the software industry shakeout. **********The company said yesterday that it is merging through an exchange of stock with the Paladin Software Corporation, a small start-up company that is headed by a former Visicorp product marketing manager. **********The new company will be called Paladin Software and headed by Paladin's current president and chief executive, Roy Folk, who worked for Visicorp until founding the new company a year ago.

Nevertheless, margin debt by customers of New York Stock Exchange member firms amounts to more than $22 billion, indicating that this technique is widely used by many individuals. **********The rules governing what the regulatory authorities call securities credit transactions have been established by the Federal Reserve Board and promulgated in four regulations designated as G, T, U and X. In a move to update its rules and eliminate obsolete or unneeded provisions, the board has revised and simplified Regulation T, which deals with credit granted by brokers and dealers - the category affecting most individual investors. This shortened regulation will become effective on June 30. **********''This was part of a zero-based review to see what was necessary,'' said Robert S. Plotkin, the board's assistant director of banking supervision and regulation. ''The regulation was overhauled because it was very difficult to follow.'' **********''The basic thrust behind the revision was to clean up Reg T,'' added an official of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''It existed pretty much without change for many years and became encrusted. In the language of today, it wasn't a user-friendly document.'' **********Margin refers to money borrowed from a stockbroker, usually for investment purposes. The percentage of cash that must be deposited with a broker to open a margin account is set by the Federal Reserve and has been 50 percent for common stocks since 1974. Thus investors can buy $20,000 worth of stock for $10,000 in cash, borrowing the remainder from - and paying interest to - the broker by using the securities as collateral. **********The revised Regulation T contains a number of signficant changes affecting those who have such margin accounts. The most apparent are the changes in terminology to make the rule easier for the public to read and understand. For example, instead of describing maximum loan value - the most that can be borrowed on the security used as collateral - the new Regulation T talks about equity - the market value of the security minus the cash owed to the creditor. ''We've turned the glass around, saying that it is half-full, rather than half- empty,'' said the Federal Reserve's Mr. Plotkin. **********In addition, the new regulation for the first time covers such recently created financial instruments as options on stock indexes and options on certificates of deposit. Thus the definitions section includes option trading terms, which were not even mentioned when the rule was initially written. **********One of the important modifications of Regulation T is the provision that now lets an investor have more than one margin account at the same brokerage house, as long as all but the first are discretionary accounts controlled by the broker or an independent investment adviser. Previously, an individual could open only one such account at a firm, because of the fear that margin requirements might be manipulated. **********The regulation authorized other changes that are also in keeping with the modern ability of the computer to track efforts at deception by individuals or their brokers bent on avoiding the margin requirements. An introducing broker who deals with the public will be permitted to maintain separate margin accounts for the same person, if those accounts are cleared by different firms handling the back- office paperwork. Similarly, these clearing brokers will be able to maintain separate margin accounts for an individual who is introduced to them by different concerns. **********The effective date of the revision originally was last Nov. 21 and then was changed to today. The March 31 date has been postponed again for three months because of requests for delay by broker- dealers. The Fed adopted the revised regulation in May 1983. **********A related proposal by the Federal Reserve Board - but not included in the simplified Regulation T - would increase the number of marginable stocks. If adopted, the list of over-the-counter securities on which brokers and dealers could lend money to their customers will be broadened to encompass all of the securities designated for trading in the national market system portion of Nasdaq. The public comment period on this proposal is scheduled to end on April 27, after which the board will consider further action. **********To obtain a copy of the new Regulation T, get in touch with the local Federal Reserve Bank.

That was undoubtedly a factor in its better-than-expected second-quarter net earnings of $455 million, or 43 cents a share. **********But analysts say that some of those earnings stemmed from transactions that had taken place in the prior three months, and that A.T.& T. actually has a good deal more organizational surgery ahead of it before its cash- draining problems are completely under control, and its marketing abilities are up to speed. As W. Spencer Rice, senior partner with S&R Consultants, a Madison, N.J.-based consulting firm, put it, ''They've got two cylinders running and they've got six more to go.'' **********In line with its much-publicized goal of becoming a major player in both data processing and telecommunications, A.T.& T. has been hustling new products to market at a heady pace. It introduced its 3B series of minicomputers in March. In May it rolled out its System 75 PBX, a computerized office switchboard, and a month later, its version of a personal computer. **********The rapid rollout was designed to signal competitors and customers that the company intends to become a serious force in the computerized office equipment industry. ''Our blueprint is out there,'' said William P. Stritzler, a vice president for new ventures. ''Now it's a matter of improving price and capabilities.'' **********Analysts say that singly, none of the products is electrifying, but together they represent the first component package for a so-called local area network to link telephones, data processors, workstations and other office equipment. ''It's the first time I can remember A.T.& T. being first with anything,'' said Mr. Rice. ''It's given them a wonderful opportunity, if they take advantage of it.'' **********Indeed, A.T.& T. no longer can treat its cost and marketing problems as internal annoyances. The company's attempts to break into the data processing business and to stem the erosion of its position in telecommunications equipment have plunged it into deep competitive waters. The combined market for telephone and computer- equipment already is pegged at $115 billion and is growing at a 15 percent annual clip. **********To hang in, A.T.& T. must go head to head with I.B.M., one of the world's most formidable marketing organizations, against aggressive rivals such as Rolm and Northern Telecom that have grown up in an industry where cutthroat competition is commonplace, and against relatively new forces in long-distance telephones such as MCI and GTE- Sprint (see box). **********A.T.& T. clearly is playing catch-up ball. Even though equipment sales were opened to competition in 1968, marketing is still not the company's forte. Its share of PBX sales, for example, dropped from 51 percent in 1976 to 22 percent last year. **********TO recapture that share, analysts **********say, the company will have to do **********a better job of switching its management orientation from production to marketing. For example, its System 85 PBX, introduced in the spring of 1983, lacked extensive data transmission capabilities and related software. It met with such lukewarm customer response that A.T.& T. hastily announced a revamped model. **********Although the new model is having better acceptance, it arrived at a time that the whole industry was plagued with shortages of computer memory chips. A.T.& T.'s manufacturing executives had failed to foresee the explosive demand for the chips, and had canceled construction of a new chip plant at Orlando, Fla. **********A.T.& T. has since added chip capacity in Allentown, Pa., and Kansas City, Mo., and has revived the Orlando plant. The company claims it has been meeting delivery dates since February, but analysts say that it could have had a valuable edge on the competition if it had designed the right product to begin with. ''If the marketing people had been on top, System 85 would have come out a lot different,'' said Dixon Doll of DMW Group, an Ann Arbor, Mich., consulting firm. ''The people who are thinking about customers need to be put in charge.'' **********A.T.& T. has already gone through a radical reorganization to set itself up as a free-market competitor. The old phone company was organized primarily by function - for example, Western Electric handled manufacturing and Bell Labs handled research. Now the company is structured around two product lines: long- distance service and telecommunications equipment. **********In December A.T.& T. created A.T.& T. Technologies, which is expected to generate 40 percent of expected corporate revenues of $56.5 billion this year, to make and market telecommunications equipment. The new group encompasses the old American Bell, which last year became A.T.& T. Information Systems. This unit, which is dedicated to sales and service, is itself subdivided into three sections - marketing, product development and service - each with its own president. **********A.T.& T. Technologies also serves as the umbrella for A.T.& T. Technology Systems, which includes those parts of the old Western Electric that made computer and electronics products; Bell Laboratories, the research arm; and three units that produce and sell consumer telephone products, international telephone service, and switching equipment for other telephone companies. **********For now, A.T.& T. Technologies is barely profitable, and former A.T.& T managers, all of whom insisted on anonymity, say that at least part of the reason comes from an organizational structure that includes too many divisions and too many layers of management. For example, A.T.& T. Information Systems, which lost $1 billion in its first year of operations, maintains four separate planning departments to map corporate strategies as well as strategies for sales, product development, and service. Former employees say that one or two planning departments would suffice. **********SOME retrenchment has already **********occurred. A.T.& T. Technologies has closed four factories, and is consolidating office space and distribution outlets. Western Electric's Manhattan headquarters was sold for $104 million (actually, an embarrassment for the company, in that the new buyer, a New York real estate partnership, sold the property for $110 million a week later). **********A.T.& T. has sought outside help to plan further retrenchment moves. Company sources report that McKinsey & Company, a leading consulting firm, recently concluded a study of A.T.& T. Technologies. A.T.& T. will not comment on the findings, but rumors are rife both inside and outside the company that McKinsey recommended that some divisions and departments be eliminated or consolidated. That would presage further staff cuts. **********In a nationwide closed-circuit television conference to managers in June, A.T.& T. Technologies chairman James E. Olson ordered a 20 to 25 percent reduction in expenses by year-end. The sector employs about 254,000 workers, about two-thirds of the A.T.& T. work force. Mr. Olson said at the time that layoffs ''haven't been ruled out.'' In recent interviews, he has said they are ''probable.'' **********The company has been holding pep rallies to keep up employee morale and motivation. But several managers, all of whom asked that their names not be used, still paint a picture of a company beset with deep morale problems. ''The whole situation is unsettling,'' says one marketing sales representative, who admits to spending a good deal of time sitting in his office wondering ''Do I have a future with the company?'' **********Further staffing cuts, painful as they may be, are crucial. A.T.& T always has been top-heavy in management, and it still maintains 10 layers of managers between entry level supervisors and the chairman. The company's service ranks jumped by 73,000 workers in January, when people were transferred from the Bell companies. According to Eastern Management Group, a consulting firm, A.T.& T. Information Systems, for one, generates only $39,000 in revenues per employee, compared with $93,000 per employee at I.B.M. **********An early retirement incentive program has fallen far short of its intended mark of trimming 13,000 employees. Only about 5,000 workers have left A.T.& T. through attrition, resignations or retirement since the start of the year. Moreover, the company has had to add more service people to its long-lines division to take care of backlogs and to pick up administrative chores that had been handled by the Bell companies. The net result has been the addition of 1,300 workers since January. **********NEW Federal rules may help A.T.& T. get a better grip on some of its staffing problems. Since 1980, the Federal Communications Commission has required A.T.& T. to keep A.T.& T. Information Systems, which sells and services business telephone equipment, separate from other sales and marketing departments within the company. In June, the F.C.C. agreed to allow A.T.& T. Information Systems salesmen to sell long-distance services. The company has not decided whether it will cut staff as a result. **********A.T.& T., meanwhile, is growing more aggressive in its pricing and marketing. Jeffrey Matros, director of telecom market analysis at Probe Research Inc., a consulting firm in Morristown, N.J., said that A.T.& T.'s average price of $700 a line for its System 75 PBX is well below the industry average for PBX's of $800 a line. **********The company's chairman, Charles L. Brown, has turned out to be a supersalesman in his own right. Last month, when it became painfully clear that Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins would be buying $3 million worth of PBX equipment from Telecom Plus International Inc. rather than from A.T.& T., Mr. Brown paid a last-minute visit to top Paine Webber officials to assure them that, if they did go with A.T.& T., they could be assured of on-time delivery and service. **********A.T.& T. got the order. **********THE MAJOR PLAYER,BUT SLIPPING FAST **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company may be expanding beyond its traditional role as a telephone company, but for now long-distance telephone service still accounts for 60 percent of its revenues and nearly all of its profits. And lately, the mainstay phone business is contributing more than its share of the company's problems. **********A.T.& T. still is the major player in the $45 billion long-distance market, but it has slipped badly. Before divestiture, its on- time record for installing business lines exceeded 95 percent. But it has not yet perfected methods for coordinating installations with the newly independent Bell companies. The result is that A.T.& T.'s backlog of unfilled orders for line installation jumped 16 percent in June, to 41,700, while the percentage of orders completed on time fell to 22.8 percent. **********By its own count, A.T.& T. is losing 5,000 long-distance business and residential customers a day, up from 3,000 daily earlier this year, to competitors such as MCI and GTE-Sprint, which are geared toward speed and responsiveness. Both companies have dropped their monthly service fees for long distance, and ITT has said it will drop its fees in September. **********A.T.& T. has fought back. It has cut long-distance rates by 6.1 percent. It is offering special discounts for evenings and weekends, as well as promotions in which customers can get various kinds of merchandise. **********And it is making headway on cutting down delays in installations. John Blanchard, an A.T.& T. vice president who chairs a strike force to solve the backlog problem, said that more than 800 employees have been assigned to the task. The growth in backlogs for private line installation has virtually stopped, he said, while on-time rates for WATS and 800 service installation jumped to 70 percent in July, from 20 percent in March. **********But the company has a hard effort ahead to bolster customer loyalty. One angry hotel chain manager said that, when he invited A.T.& T. salesmen to make a presentation, they initially balked because they were ''too busy with the Olympics.'' And a telecommunications manager at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette got so fed up with installation delays that he has started using other vendors. ''We won't use A.T.& T. until they straighten up their act,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/16/business/getty-s-board-is-reshuffled.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Getty's Board Is Reshuffled", "print_headline": "Getty's Board Is Reshuffled", "body_text": " **********The board of directors of Getty Oil Company was reshuffled today by the company's new owner, Texaco Inc., and the losers included Gordon P.

Ray R. Irani, named to the presidency less than two weeks ago, volunteered that his 86-year-old boss has ''a tremendous amount of vision and wisdom but doesn't get into our hair.'' David Martin, head of exploration and development, spoke bullishly about a big oil find in Colombia. **********For Dr. Hammer, who assembled eight top executives late last week to demonstrate to a reporter that Occidental Petroleum was not a ''one-man show,'' such talk was heartwarming. ''Now that's the kind of optimism I like to hear,'' he said, beaming. ''The one thing that I can't stand is laziness - laziness and indifference. You have to be enthusiastic to work for me.'' **********If not enthusiasm, at least peace once again reigns at the country's eighth-largest oil company. Dissidents on the board and in the executive suite have been banished. And Dr. Hammer, who built the company in the last 25 years from an obscure, nearly-bankrupt concern, is steering it back to its core energy businesses, scrapping the company's recent diversification into beef processing. **********But Dr. Hammer's move to silence the dissidents was so swift - and costly - that the company is still trying to assimilate the changes. In the meantime, an uneasy quiet has taken hold. A. Robert Abboud, who raised vexing doubts about Occidental's direction, no longer roils meetings of Occidental's top executives; he was replaced two weeks ago by Mr. Irani. Board meetings promise to be equally calm. Last month Occidental spent $194 million - $58 million above the market price - to buy back the shares of David Murdock, the company's largest shareholder and a staunch critic of Dr. Hammer. In the process, Mr. Murdock lost his seat on the board. **********And the company's single remaining critic-in-residence, Robert L. Peterson, who did not attend last week's interview, will probably not be around much longer. The profitable meat-packing division that he heads, IBP Inc., has been put on the block with a price tag of $1 billion. **********But if the doubts have been silenced in Mr. Hammer's sumptuous office here, they persist on Wall Street, where the stock retreated more than 20 percent by last week from its 52-week high of 35 3/4. As Occidental continues to adhere to a strategy focusing on such capital-hungry businesses as chemicals, coal mining, and oil and gas exploration, nagging questions remain about what direction the company should take and about the possibility of a capital crunch. The possibility of a cut in the $2.50 annual dividend is another worry. **********Some analysts say Dr. Hammer's undying devotion to projects with long lead times and uncertain payoffs - like the company's $230 million oil shale investment and the assiduous courting of business in Communist countries - absorbs too much of man agement's resources. And there is the persistent joke - no longer amusing to those concerned with grooming a successor to Dr. Hammer - about the ''revolving'' door to the executive suite. Mr. Irani, for example, is the company's sixth president in the past 16 years. **********''For some time now, management and Dr. Hammer have been saying that management had stabilized and that they would concentrate on energy and food. And now all this,'' says Warren Shimmerlik, an analyst for Merrill Lynch. ''They seem to be rambling around without any clear direction.'' **********As far as Dr. Hammer is concerned, however, the direction is perfectly clear. He is adamant about Occidental adhering to its core businesses: its oil and gas properties, the chemicals operation and even the money-losing Island Creek Coal Company. If anything has to go, he says, it will be the meat business. **********''We've come a long way since 1958 and it wasn't done with mirrors - it wasn't done in some helter-skelter fashion,'' he argues. ''We stuck to what we knew best. That was finding oil and gas. We're better off if we concentrate on oil, gas, chemicals and coal rather than trying to become a leading food company or a leading meat company.'' **********That is a decidedly different direction than Mr. Abboud had envisioned for Occidental, and had pushed, with Mr. Murdock's support, until a few days before his departure. **********IN fact, much of the reason for the **********conflict between Dr. Hammerrt to scuttle the deal to build a strip mine in China and to reduce emphasis on synthetic fuel projects. Instead, the two men believed that IBP could, with modest capital outlays, revolutionize the hog slaughtering business the way it once did cattle slaughtering. Last year, Mr. Abboud spearheaded an aborted drive to buy the bankrupt Wilson Foods and expand further into the food business. He also opened offices of IBP in London and Tokyo, the first steps of a new export strategy. IBP - as Iowa Beef Processors - had been 20 percent owned by Mr. Murdock at the time he persuaded his old friend, Dr. Hammer, to buy the company in 1981.  In the diversification move, one of Mr. Abboud's biggest concerns was to cushion the company against downturns in the energy business. Although he agreed that Occidental should stay in oil and gas, company officials say he was less certain about chemicals, coal, oil shale, geothermal energy, Arabian horses, cattle breeding and the many other interests that Dr. Hammer has pursued through Occidental subsidiaries. **********For his part, Dr. Hammer contends that Mr. Abboud's fears were exaggerated. ''He was a good banker,'' Dr. Hammer said. ''He came to us at an important time. He served well the time he was with us, particularly with the Cities acquisition,'' he continued, referring to the company's 1982 acquisition of Cities Service. That controversial $4 billion purchase transformed Occidental into a company that had more than half of its petroleum reserves in the United States. Increasing American reserves had been a major goal of Occidental, which wanted to reduce its dependence on such volatile sources as Libya and Peru. **********Now, however, Dr. Hammer said, things are different. ''We have to pay more attention to operations and recurrent earnings,'' he said. ''Mr. Irani is a good operating man. Together we can steer this company.'' **********Indeed, when Mr. Abboud arrived at Occidental in 1980, harmony with Dr. Hammer was also forecast. According to company executives, Mr. Abboud had been as agreeable in his early years as Mr. Irani is now. **********But early this year relations became strained. Mr. Abboud, who is 55 years old, increasingly found himself on the side of Mr. Murdock at the company's stormy board meetings. Mr. Murdock, whose vision of the company's future was similar to Mr. Abboud's, was not shy about expressing his views. **********A man of huge wealth, who runs his portfolio from an office in Murdock Plaza across Wilshire Boulevard from Occidental's headquarters here, Mr. Murdock was seen as a potential a threat to Dr. Hammer's control. His 5 percent stake made him the company's largest stockholder and there were persistent rumors that he would seek control either through a tender offer or a proxy fight. **********The July board meeting was particularly heated, company officials said, and Dr. Hammer proposed ending the impasse by buying Mr. Murdock's shares, unseating him as a director and forbidding his purchase of Occidental stock for 10 years. Mr. Abboud, who would not comment on the meeting because of restrictions in his $2 million separation agreement, is said to have objected strongly, but to no avail. **********Last week, Dr. Hammer ridiculed the seriousness of Mr. Murdock's threat. ''Our only serious takeover attempt came from Standard Oil of Indiana in 1974,'' he said. ''We fought them so fiercely they dropped out.'' Although he would not discuss details of the buyback of Mr. Murdock's stock - saying he was constrained by a legal agreement - he said the price was not a bad one. ''We think our stock is worth more than $40 a share,'' he said. On Friday the stock closed at 27 5/8. **********By the August meeting, it was apparent that Mr. Abboud, too, had lost Dr. Hammer's favor. The chairman was proposing that Occidental sell IBP, the centerpiece of what Mr. Abboud thought should be Occidental's growth strategy. Dr. Hammer and Mr. Abboud drafted an amicable statement with Mr. Abboud attributing his departure to ''honest differences.'' In his shift, Mr. Abboud lost his second corporate war in the last four years. In 1980 the directors of First Chicago Corporation, revolting against management turmoil and declining profits at the bank, ousted him as chairman. **********Dr. Hammer's victory over Mr. Abboud and Mr. Murdock, however, drew mixed comments on Wall Street. **********''Armand Hammer is a great illustration of the folly of having mandatory retirement at 65,'' said Herbert Hart, an analyst with Rowe & Pitman, a San Francisco-based brokerage. ''But he makes a great case for it at age 86. If I were a shareholder I'd much rather have the exiting group running the company.'' **********But supporters do not agree. ''Their departure eliminates an antagonistic element,'' said Eugene Nowak, an analyst for Dean Witter, the company's investment banker. ''Dr. Hammer is a strong man. He's defied every parameter and rule of thumb.'' **********In fact, Dr. Hammer's unswerving vision about how his company should be run has won him quite a few supporters on Wall Street. They recall the drubbing Occidental earnings took when it went heavily into debt in 1982 to finance its $4 billion purchase of Cities Service. Now, however, it seems that the deal was a very cheap way for Occidental to acquire substantial domestic reserves. **********In a high-wire financial juggling act, in which Occidental divested several businesses in depressed markets without big write-offs, the company repaid about $3 billion in debt last year. The debt retirement was such a high priority that Dr. Hammer hand- delivered a check for $1 billion last September to Roger Anderson, then chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company so that the investment community would take notice. The two men held a news conference, posing for pictures with officials of other banks. **********PAYING off a big chunk of the debt was one major success. But that is not all that needs to be done. Dr. Hammer conceded last week that some strategic and financial restructuring was needed at Occidental. In fact, he said, the proceeds from the disposition of IBP should bring in $1 billion in cash - and that would be used to redeem some of the preferred stock, which annually consumes $244 million in dividend payments. He said the company also wanted to raise cash by selling an electrical generating plant in northern California, which is powered by geothermal energy, for $400 million. **********The strategy that Dr. Hammer has laid out will be left to Mr. Irani, who is 49 and the former president of the Olin Corporation, a chemical company, to put into effect. A Ph.D. and a summa cum laude graduate of the American University in Beirut, he joined Occidental only last year as head of the chemical division and he agrees with Dr. Hammer's position on coal and chemicals. **********Dr. Hammer, he said, is willing to absorb losses on the coal properties because Occidental's investment has been recovered many times over and the reserves will grow more promising as domestic oil reserves are depleted. In Dr. Hammer's view, any sale of those properties now would bring a meager price because the industry remains depressed. **********According to Mr. Irani, the outlook for chemicals is improving. That division, which includes Hooker Chemical of Love Canal infamy, is expected to earn $60 million this year, a sharp reversal from its $70 million loss last year. Occidental's leadership says it is unconcerned about worldwide overcapacity in the petrochemicals industry. **********''If you're good in a commodity you make money,'' Mr. Irani said. ''You can have all the overcapacity you want. If you're the low-cost producer you can make money.'' **********He estimated, however, that it would cost $400 million over the next five years to make Occidental the low-cost producer across the company's entire line of industrial and agricultural chemicals. Despite that cost, he maintained, coal and chemicals are good investments even when they're losing money, because they always generate cash. **********''The name of the game is how much cash an operation can generate and how that cash can be used,'' he said. **********Some analysts say that reasoning is fine for a highly profitable company - but, they stress, Wall Street's patience may be severely tested by several more quarters of mediocre results. Occidental's earning have been extremely weak in the last few years, largely because of the debt it assumed to buy Cities Service and poor performances by the coal and chemical divisions. Return on stockholders' equity was below 5 percent in 1982 and 1983, when the company reported profits of $155.6 million and $566 million (including Cities) respectively. **********In the first six months of this year profits climbed 39 percent, to $231.6 million. But at that rate, earnings still will not reach the $722.2 million of 1981 and the rate of return on equity will remain subpar. Dr. Hammer said he does not foresee any significant earnings jump until 1986. **********And despite Occidental's reduction of the debt it accumulated through its purchase of Cities Service, it still owes more than $3.2 billion. At the same time, it is burdened by total dividend payments of $500 million a year. There is widespread concern that the company may cut its dividend to conserve cash, which would make the stock less attractive. **********But Dr. Hammer says this will not happen. To conserve capital, he said, the company instead will continue to keep a tight rein on capital spending and research and development. ''The dividend is not in jeopardy,'' Dr. Hammer insists. ''We don't care whether the investment community becomes impatient or not. As long as our cash flow is adequate we'll continue our dividend policy.'' **********Nor is the company backing away from its foreign ventures, despite criticism from Wall Street. Recently the company nailed down $400 million financing to help build and operate the world's largest strip mine in China. ''All of the socialist countries have opened the doors to us because I'm considered a hero,'' says Dr. Hammer, whose office is decorated with a mural of Chinese peasants from Deng Xiaoping of China as well as dozens of photographs of Dr. Hammer with leaders from around the world. **********Born on New York's Lower East Side and raised in the Bronx, Dr. Hammer ran his father's drug company at the same time he was attending medical school at Columbia University. After selling the company, which later became Allied Chemical, the idealistic young Dr. Hammer went to Bolshevik Russia in 1921 to fight a plague of cholera and typhus. While there, he married a Russian woman, befriended Lenin - and made his first fortune by bartering furs and minerals for American grain. **********More than 30 years later he obtained control of Occidental for a $50,000 drilling loan he made to the company when it was on the verge of bankruptcy. A year afterward, in 1957, he became president. Building Occidental into a $19 billion company has been a major effort and Mr. Hammer never relaxed his iron grip. **********In fact, he hesitates to do so even now, at 86. ''I won't retire unless they tell me to get out,'' he said last week. ''And if I pass'' - and here he pauses, catches himself, and amends his statement, ''And when I pass, the board of directors will pick a successor. They're a good group.'' **********CANO LIMO:THE BIG DRILL **********Some supporters on Wall Street say Occidental will climb back into favor on the strength of Oxy's recent oil find in the Cano Limo field in northeastern Colombia. Estimates of reserves at the site range up to one billion barrels and Dr. Hammer says it could be a major source of foreign crude for Occidental, second only to Libya, where the company has operated for many years. **********The company has drilled six development wells in Cano Limo and proven reserves are estimated now to be above 400 million barrels, with more drilling to come. Occidental, a partner in the venture with state-owned Ecopetrol, can count half the reserves as its own. **********Paradoxically, the addition of the Colombian reserves comes at a time when the company is trying to reduce its exposure to overseas supply sources, a major reason for the Cities Service acquisition in 1982. But Occidental officials say Colombia is one of the most stable countries in Latin America, despite occasional guerrilla activity. **********The problem now for Occidental, however, is that successful development of the property will require big money. And the company seems to have more commitments than cash. ''Oxy does not have the resources to do everything,'' Mr. Abboud said last week. ''It has to pick and choose between oil and gas and its other businesses.'' **********But some analysts say that when the oil starts flowing, the revenues could avert a cash bind at the company and turn around its poor financial performance of the past few years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/30/world/around-the-world-300-reported-arrested-in-peruvian-strike.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 168, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "300 Reported Arrested In Peruvian Strike", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; 300 Reported Arrested In Peruvian Strike", "body_text": " **********The police clashed with demonstrators in several cities today, injuring dozens and arresting more than 300 during a nationwide strike called to protest the Government's economic policies, union leaders said. **********News reports said the 24-hour strike, held despite a state of emergency declared Wednesday by the Government of President Fernando Belaunde Terry, was only partly successful. **********Prime Minister Luis Percovich said 92 percent of the nation's 6 million workers were on the job.

''No one, because I will not permit it, will say that this Government has violated the fundamental rights of my people.'' **********The new President, wearing a dark suit and waving his hands above his head as he took the podium, spoke to more than 5,000 Salvadorans and delegates from 41 countries. Secretary of State George P. Shultz led the delegation from the United States, which included Senators Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Paul E. Tsongas, Democrat of Massachusetts. **********The election of Mr. Duarte has been acclaimed by the Reagan Administration as a victory in its attempt to prevent another Marxist-led insurgency from coming to power in Central America. **********In the last four years, leftist insurgents have battled with the American- backed Salvadoran military to try to force the Government to set up a provisional junta that would include representatives from the left.

He said the army's support of elections had ''changed the course of history, leaving behind the sad past when the armed forces was used as an arm of repression for those political groups that controlled the power.'' **********The 58-year-old Christian Democrat said the armed forces were unable to win the war because ''many Salvadorans watch the conflict as spectators, worried only about their own interests.'' **********''Until now, the people have rejected the violence and the war but have not acted dynamically with the armed forces to defend democracy.'' **********While the new President generously applauded the army, he spoke severely of the leftist insurgents and their political leaders, saying his Government would never share power with them. **********Mr. Duarte said negotiations with the rebels would ''negate the essense of democracy.'' He said, ''If they had the capacity to take up arms, now they must have the boldness to put them down.'' **********Speaking of the political leaders of the five guerrilla groups in El Salvador, the new President said they had ''fallen under the empire and obedience of the guerrilla commanders.'' **********''To have credibility,'' he added of the political leaders, ''they have to demonstrate hegemony over the armed sector.'' He suggested that if the political leaders held sway, the Government could be open to signing a truce with leftists, as the Government in Colombia recently has. **********The crowd reacted enthusiastically to the speech. **********''It is the most beautiful day,'' Miquel Morales, a driver said.

Diminutive in stature, but not in other ways, sharp-eyed and outspoken, the 53-year-old cleric, that is to say, is a man with a message that is yearned for. **********To the authorities, however, such talk falls little short of subversion, a challenge perceived as part of a ''total onslaught'' from within and without on ''white'' South Africa and a voice that is to be stifled. His organization, the South African Council of Churches, of which he is General Secretary, has been scrutinized by three official judicial inquiries. His passport has been repeatedly withdrawn. **********Subject of Criticism **********A former chief of security police, Lieut. Gen. Johan Coetzee, once expressed support for the view that the church council ''is manipulated by a highly politicized leadership, is funded by outside influences hostile to the present system in South Africa and gives itself an importance not reflected in reality.'' **********The award, thus, says something about the conflicting interpretations here of a message translated by the Nobel committee as peaceful. When word came today that the Bishop had won the prize, supporters danced and formed a gyrating human chain through the church council's offices in one of Johannesburg's less glittery thoroughfares. **********The office of President P. W. Botha, by contrast, issued a ''no comment'' that seemed as resentful as it was full of affront. The state-controlled television gave the first announcement 10 seconds of air time as its sixth item of news, and pro-Government commentators in newspapers read mainly by conservative whites prepared editorials heavy with outrage that the label of ''peace'' has been attached to such a man.   Was Baptized a Methodist **********The man at the center of such conflicting passions, Desmond Mpilo Tuto, was born in the Afrikaner town of Klerksdorp on Oct. 7, 1931. He was baptized as a Methodist because his father was teaching at a Methodist school, but later, the whole family switched to the Anglican Church. **********A memory of his youth, he has told interviewers, is of blacks' rummaging through garbage cans in search of food rejected by white schoolchildren. He wanted to be a doctor, but his family could not afford the fees, so he became a teacher after attending a training college run on the segregationist principles that permeate education in South Africa. **********With the high-pitched chuckles that are among his hallmarks, he recalled that black students were housed in circular huts. ''Living in rectangular buildings was Western and, I suppose, not good for our black psyches,'' he said. **********One of Bishop Tutu's early religious mentors was the Rev., later Bishop, Trevor Huddleston, a prominent campaigner against apartheid. Bishop Tutu left teaching at the age of 25 to become a cleric, believing, he said, the church offered ''a likely means of service.''  Studied in London **********He was ordained in 1960, the year of the first riots that convulsed Sharpeville, 40 mile south of Johannesburg, and he studied in London. He became the first black Anglican Dean of Johannesburg in 1975. **********In 1978, he was appointed the first black General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches, representing 12 million Christians. The post did not automatically yield a black constituency, until pro-Government figures began assailing his work at the council amd his calls for economic pressure on South Africa - providing, through South Africa's spectrum, an inverted validation drawn partly from white opprobrium. **********He became the most heard black voice to articulate the churches' opposition to apartheid. ''In the present stage of South African history,'' a spokesman for the council said today, ''we represent the cutting edge of the churches in what we call the liberation struggle.''  'Impish' and 'Feisty' **********Some of his friends say his wife, Leah, the mother of their four children - Naomi, Mpho, Thandi and Trevor - has been a great influence on him. **********The labels most commonly applied to Bishop Tutu are ''impish'' and ''feisty,'' but they do not convey the sense of a man who has escaped the nexus of imposed inferiorities borne by many of his compatriots to assume an assured self-confidence. **********He travels frequently when granted a travel document by the authorities that describes his citizenship as being ''undetermined.'' He spreads a message to Western countries that economic pressure must be brought on South Africa if change is to be produced without violence. **********At home, he has sought to project his voice across the chasm between black and white and, in doing so, faces a problem. Increasingly, in black South African politics, the tone - if not the overall thrust - is set by groups whose language is of the militant left. But Bishop Tutu has occupied a center that is bound to shift as the authorities' seeming intransigeance toward black demands heightens a mood of militant desperation. **********Thus, his anguish: in some perceptions his refusal to acknowledge, in his own words, that ''God's grace cannot operate on P. W. Botha'' may not secure a lasting constituency and may, moreover, force a hardening of his approach dicatated by mounting confrontation where conciliation has failed. And that in turn would conflict with what he sees as essentially a spiritual mission.   Voice of Black Protest **********Under his tutelage the South African Council of Churches has become an increasingly acknowledged voice of black protest. **********''Reconciliation is not saying peace, peace, where there is no peace,'' he said in an interview three years ago with a white reporter. ''We are all involved in the liberation struggle. Jesus Christ is involved in the liberation struggle. He liberated us from the bondage to sin - and oppression is an expression of sin. **********''Black don't believe that they are introducing violence into the situation,'' he said, ''They believe that the situation is already violent.'' **********In an interview with another correspondent during the same period, he said: ''I will never tell someone to pick up a gun. But I will pray for the man who picks up the gun, pray that he will be less cruel than he might otherwise have been, because he is a member of the community. We are going to have to decide: if this civil war escalates, what is our ministry going to be?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/07/business/key-rates-159683.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/06/world/around-the-world-waffen-ss-veterans-plan-west-german-reunion.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 137, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Waffen SS Veterans Plan West German Reunion", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Waffen SS Veterans Plan West German Reunion", "body_text": " **********The town director here said today that 800 veterans of Hitler's elite Waffen SS were planning a reunion at this vacation spa, where the event was billed as a conference of economic experts. **********''We are doing everything possible to stop this meeting from going ahead,'' the town director, Horst Voigt, said in an interview. **********''It's a pity that the organization is not banned.'' **********He said that the four-day reunion was scheduled to start May 17 and that the Waffen SS veterans had booked conference rooms at the town's health resort building. **********The chairman of the Waffen SS veterans' group, Albert Stenwedel, refused to comment on the meeting.

Weiss wanted to be the best account manager in New York. And for all you know, he might be. **********Then as the years passed by and responsibilities accumulated for him at Ogilvy & Mather, his one and only employer, he came to realize that ''there are no old account managers.'' **********''You don't see any over 45,'' he realized. It was then he decided that, ''if you want to stay in business, you have to be able to run a business.'' **********Luckily, O.& M. is the kind of company that trains its executives for just such an eventuality so Mr. Weiss, at 41, feels ready to move into the presidential pew at Ingalls Associates of Boston, the agency with the best growth record in New England last year but still in the shadow of the giant Ogilvy. And so he will July 1. **********And now that he is committed to leaving for the far north, Mr. Weiss, a Columbus, Ohio, native, is suddenly aware of the pluses of the Boston scene, many of them imparted by S.  Joseph Hoffman, who at 64 will be moving up to chairman and chief executive at Ingalls to make way for the new lad. **********People who know Mr. Hoffman, a copywriter-turned-manager, cite his salesmanship abilities, which he learned in the early days of the agency making cold calls for new business. Necessity then forced him to overcame an almost crippling tendency to stutter. **********In any event, now that he will soon be leaving, the Ogilvy senior vice president said yesterday that he was expecting to find ''certain freedom at work you don't see in New York.'' **********At which point his new mentor, remarked, ''New York has become super-cautious.'' **********And the departee added, ''It is hard to sell the unusual in a New York agency structure.'' **********''It is easier to say 'no' in New York,'' said Mr. Hoffman, who with his associate was framed by the huge Olympic Towers' seventh-floor window against the neo-Gothic glory of St. Patrick's Cathedral. **********Mr. Weiss, with bachelor's and M.B.A. degrees from Ohio State, was recruited by Ogilvy in the summer of 1966 and then went through its training programs, moving steadily upward surrounded by talented people. **********''Such a breadth of talent and depth of talent is fantastic,'' he said. **********Currently as a group account director he is running five or six accounts - he was not quite sure - is on the board of the New York office and the United States management council, runs Eyepatch Productions, an in- house commercial production operation, and is in charge of the account management training program. **********With management as young as it is at the very top - William E. Phillips is 54 and Ken Roman 53 - it is not surprising that an ambitious executive, anxious to try his management wings, would find himself forced into flying elsewhere. **********During the time that Mr. Weiss was moving up at the agency, now the world's fifth largest, and putting deep family roots into Great Neck, L.I., there were major changes taking place at Ingalls, the older of the two agencies, having been founded in 1911 by the late Arthur W. Ingalls, a Harvard man who loved the agency business more than he understood it and died in 1971 at the age of 82. **********Mr. Hoffman, who four years ago took over leadership from Joseph A. Maynard, his art director partner of years ago, has been building the sort of ''whole egg'' communications company that Edward N. Ney of Young & Rubicam talks about. He may not do it in as planned a way as they do at Ogilvy, but Ingalls is getting there all the same. **********For example, it owns Morris, Reilly & Kerasiotes, a political media consulting firm, and Swofford & Scharff, an investor relations company in New York. It also has its own commercial production arm and has just brought in an expert to get it started in direct marketing. **********In addition, it owns 80 percent of Stern Ingalls, a New York joint venture with a Cleveland agency based in the expensive surroundings of Olympic Towers. Ingalls itself, committed to breaking through to $100 million in billings this year, basically serves high-technology, retail and financial accounts, and Mr. Hoffman thinks very little of the talents of New York agencies in the first two categories. **********It is nowhere in package goods, and Mr. Weiss, with his years of experience with the likes of General Foods, is expected to make a difference here, even though he thinks that future advertising growth opportunities will be more with high-technology and financial services and not package goods.

THATCHER", "print_headline": "PROBLEMS PILE UP FOR MRS. THATCHER", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been thrown onto the defensive, a year after her re-election, by a series of serious economic and political problems. **********In the last two weeks her Government has had to contend with increases in bank and mortgage rates, a slumping pound and stock market, a worsening strike in the coal mines and a new strike on the docks, a sharp political reversal in the House of Lords, a crisis in Britain's relations with Nigeria and other difficulties. Her opponenents are said to sense a new vulnerability. **********The next general election is at least three years away, and so far Mrs. Thatcher's grip on the Conservative Party, which has an unassailable majority in the House of Commons, remains firm. There is no serious suggestion of a move to replace her as leader. But there is growing unrest among the backbench Tories, one of whom said this week that ''we haven't had any good news for a very long time indeed.'' **********'Paranoid,' Tory Says **********Francis Pym, whom Mrs. Thatcher ousted as Foreign Secretary, said this week that the staff at 10 Downing Street was showing every sign of being ''badly rattled'' and even ''paranoid.'' He would be the natural leader of any Tory revolt, and he recently published a book criticizing Mrs. Thatcher's style of leadership as well as the substance of some of her major economic policies. **********Mr. Pym's comments came in response to a ''background'' statement by one of Mrs. Thatcher's senior aides accusing him of complicity in a plot to undermine the Prime Minister. He denied the accusation, which he termed ''the most extreme kind of invention.'' But the mere fact that he chose to issue a formal rebuttal increased the public impression of serious disarray within the Conservative ranks. **********Behind the exchange between Mr. Pym and the Thatcher camp is a belief that the Government has lost its grip on a wide range of issues. **********That feeling has been fueled by adverse comments in the press, including several publications, like The Times of London and The Economist, which have in the past supported the Prime Minister.   Bad Economic News **********One of the most damaging developments for Mrs. Thatcher has been a spate of bad economic news. The pound has been sliding sharply and now stands at $1.32, near its record low. Stock prices have also been tumbling, losing nearly 8 percent of their value in a week. On Wednesday, the big banks increased their basic lending rate by 2 percent, and today the building societies - the British equivalent of savings and loan associations - raised mortgage rates by 2 1/4 percent. That will inevitably lead to a sharp increase in inflation. **********Taken together in political terms, the developments suggest a lack of confidence. The mortgage rate is a particularly sensitive subject in Britain, because there are no fixed-rate mortgages here; every home buyer will now have to pay considerably more each week. **********Nigel Lawson, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, told an apprehensive House of Commons on Thursday that ''this is in no sense a crisis.'' And Mrs. Thatcher, who was remorselessly heckled by the opposition, insisted that the economy was substantially sound, with output, investment and productivity on the upswing. But she said the same thing on Tuesday, and she was taken seriously neither by M.P.'s nor by the big-money men.   Miners Still on Strike **********One reason for that is the continuing dislocation caused by the miners' strike, which has lasted far longer than the Government ever expected and may now last into the fall and winter. Although episodic negotiations had raised some hope of a settlement, the miners hardened their position this week at a delegate conference. **********The miners' hand has been notably strengthened by a strike of longshoremen belonging to the Transport and General Workers Union. Technically unrelated to the miners' walkout, the dock strike is nonetheless part of an developing pattern of anti-Thatcher militancy. If the dockers stop oil imports, which have been relied upon to replace coal by many power stations, the impact could be considerable. **********Unemployment continues at record levels, and it is especially devastating in the north of England, in heavy industrial regions like Liverpool, Newcastle and here along the River Tees. Although joblessness appeared to cost Mrs. Thatcher little in the election, it is coming to the fore again as an issue as signs of distress develop elsewhere in the economy.   A Setback in House of Lords **********But not all of the Prime Minister's troubles are economic. **********She suffered a devastating defeat earlier this month when the House of Lords refused to accept the Government's bill designed to pave the way for the abolition of the Greater London Council and other metropolitan area councils. The bill provided for the cancelation of elections to the councils next year and the appointment of caretaker bodies in their place, with abolition to follow in 1986. The House of Lords, which seldom defies a Government in such a way, defeated the bill on the ground that it constituted a grievous abuse of democracy. **********Patrick Jenkin, the Environment Secretary, who is responsible for local government, had to withdraw the bill. The plan now is to leave the elected councils in place through 1986, but there are doubts as to whether the abolition bill itself will clear the House of Lords. **********Mr. Jenkin was forced to backtrack a second time by the left-wing council in Liverpool, which threatened to bankrupt the city if the Government did not provide more money. After pledging not to give in to the council's threats, he juggled the complex formulas of central Government aid in such a way that Liverpool gained new resources. The council claimed a great victory; Mr. Jenkin denied it. Many of the Tory backbenchers agreed with the statement of one of their number, Neil Hamilton, who accused the minister of yielding to ''extremists.''  The Nigerian Affair **********Finally, Mrs. Thatcher, who has made much of her determination to stamp out the abuse of diplomatic privelege, has had to suffer through the abduction of Umaru Dikko, a former Nigerian Cabinet minister now living in London. **********Despite denials in Lagos that the Nigerian Government had any part in the episode, the Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffery Howe, decided to expel two Nigerian diplomats and to make it clear that the High Commissioner, or Ambassador, Maj. Gen. Haldu Hananiya, who flew home on Wednesday for consultations, would not be welcomed back. **********The Foreign Office confirmed today that the Nigerians had expelled two British envoys from the British High Commission in Lagos, and the Lagos television said today that Nigeria had asked Britain to recall the High Commissioner. The British Government says it also expects retaliation against British companies, which maintain a huge export trade with Nigeria."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/05/world/around-the-world-argentine-says-britain-has-issued-a-proposal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 188, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Argentine Says Britain Has Issued a Proposal", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Argentine Says Britain Has Issued a Proposal", "body_text": " **********Argentina's Foreign Minister said Friday that Britain had put forward a proposal for improving relations between the two countries, but denied that secret negotiations were under way. **********The Argentine Foreign Minister, Dante Caputo, said the proposal, received through the Swiss Embassy, suggested lifting commercial restrictions and the possible transfer to Argentina of the bodies of 221 Argentine soldiers who were killed in the fighting for the Falkland Islands in 1982 and are buried there. **********Mr. Caputo spoke about the British proposal in Caracas, Venezuela, where he was a member of the Argentine delegation at the inauguration Thursday of Jaime Lusinchi as President. **********The British Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the two countries began secret consultations through neutral parties shortly after President Raul Alfonsin was inaugurated Dec. 10, with the Swiss Embassy here representing Britain and the Brazilian Embassy in London representing Argentina. **********Mr. Caputo denied such talks were being held but said Argentina ''is willing to use all the means and all the paths necessary in order to begin serious discussion of this subject.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/19/business/big-year-seen-for-airlines.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1984-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1101, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BIG YEAR SEEN FOR AIRLINES", "print_headline": "BIG YEAR SEEN FOR AIRLINES", "body_text": " **********A healthy increase in business travel and stiff resistance to profit- eroding fare wars have led airline industry executives and analysts to predict that 1984 will be a strong year. **********George W. James, senior vice president-economics and finance of the Air Transport Association of America, for example, has recently increased his estimate of 1983 industry operating earnings by about $100 million and is increasingly bullish for this year. He said the industry ended 1983 with operating earnings of about $500 million. In 1982, by contrast, the industry had an operating loss of $733 million. **********For this year, Mr. James said, although discount fares are available ''there are proportionaly more people traveling on full fare and less on discounts.'' Last May, he said, 87 percent of the traffic was on discounts, but by November the amount had dropped to 77 percent and is still declining. **********Wall Street, too, is smiling on the airline industry, at least so far. ''My feeling is that the airline stocks will outperform the market in the near future,'' said Hans Plickert, analyst for E. F. Hutton. ''Their earnings momentum is just so strong that it is not reflected in the prices.'' **********Many analysts, he said, are only now upgrading their forecasts. One reason, he said, is that most had underestimated the strong performance of the AMR Corporation, which owns American Airlines. AMR yesterday reported earnings of $115.6 million for the fourth quarter, up sharply from $3.7 million a year earlier. **********Also the Dow Jones transportation average, reflecting strong prospects for airlines among the other issues that it tracks, hit a high early in January although it has slipped slightly in the last week. **********In any case, the drop in discount traffic has increased industry yields to about 12.5 cents per passenger-mile now from about 12 cents in September. This is generally credited to an upturn in full-fare business travel. **********Russell Ray, senior vice president of marketing for Eastern Airlines, said that travel on its shuttle, a barometer of business travel, had been up during the last two months. **********'Judicious' Discounts Found **********''There has not been the wholesale discounting on fares as in the past,'' he said. ''When we have had discounts, they have been judicious.'' **********He added, however, that most travelers were making their bookings closer to the time they travel, making it difficult for the airline to plan for the future. ''We are planning for a modest increase this year,'' he said. **********Traffic, which strengthened in 1983 as the year progressed, continued to increase through the fourth quarter. It was up 8.8 percent in October from a year before, up 6.6 percent in November and up 5.93 percent in December. **********In future months, analysts noted, the traffic increase figures may look weak, mainly because of inflated figures in the early part of 1983 when traffic was high due to $99 one-way fares in many major markets.  So far the discipline in limiting fare wars has been the biggest pleasant surprise for the airline industry. **********Strength of Economy Cited **********''Last summer everyone was afraid that a big fare war would break out, but it didn't happen,'' said John V. Pincavage, analyst for Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins. ''It didn't happen because the economy was much stronger than anyone thought it was going to be. **********''Then the perception was, 'Gee, when we get into the first quarter we'll have big fare wars.' Well, here we are in the first quarter, and there have been some adjustments, but there have not been any major discounts nationwide. **********''If anything, we are seeing pressure the other way - tighten up discounts and increase restrictions on discount fares.'' **********United Airlines has decided, effective Feb. 1, to increase its discount fares $10 for trips up to 500 miles, $20 for trips up to 1,000 miles and $30 for longer trips. The move is expected to affect about 1,000 markets for United and is supported by T.W.A. and American Airlines. **********Continental's Expansion Plan **********But Continental Air Lines, whose reorganization under bankruptcy laws was upheld in court this week, has announced another major expansion of its system at fares that are lower than those of other airlines. **********Though airlines such as United have matched Continental only selectively, the continued expansion could put greater pressure on other airlines to match the lower fares, which could slow the current recovery for some. **********On the other hand, a recent move by one small carrier, Northeastern Internatioal Airways, to cut one-way fares between New York and Florida - to $75 off-peak and $89 on-peak to Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach and Orlando - has so far been ignored by the major carriers. **********If such fare discipline continues, Mr. Pincavage said, the airline industry could show a small operating profit in the first quarter, traditionally one of the airlines' weakest periods. Last year the industry lost $611 million in the first quarter. **********3-Way Basis for Improvement **********Candace Browning, analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, said the combination of an improved economy, cost-cutting labor concessions and lower fuel costs had produced ''a very significant improvement in operating earnings for the industry.'' She noted that fuel prices, which were near $1 a gallon early last year, had declined to about 85 to 90 cents a gallon now. **********She said the industry could have an operating profit of $1.6 billion in 1984. **********Andrew B. Kim, analyst for F. Eberstadt & Companny, was even more upbeat, projecting an operating profit as high as $2 billion. He said he expected a continued drop in fuel costs and continued restraint in fare discounting. **********One worry, he said, is that when labor unions see improvement in the carriers' earnings they may become reluctant to grant concessions and may again ask for large wage increases. **********Airlines Seek More Capacity **********And he cautioned that major airlines plan to add capacity this year, with United going up more than 20 percent and American planning expansion of at least 8 percent. **********Lowell Duncan, Jr, vice president of corporate communications for American, said such expansion could increase pressure to cut prices. American, in addition, is expected to be closely watching the revival of Braniff's operations from its Dallas- Fort Worth hub, which could touch off a round of fare-cutting there. **********Even if conditions remain favorable for the airlines, Mr. James noted, in the last three and a half years the industry had operating losses totaling $2 billion. ''We have quite a hole to come out of,'' he said. **********Airlines need about $3 billion in operating earnings this year just to keep up with the average profit margins of American industry, he said. None of the analysts foresee so high a high figure for the airlines in 1984."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/26/world/court-gets-latin-ranch-suit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 213, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COURT GETS LATIN RANCH SUIT", "print_headline": "COURT GETS LATIN RANCH SUIT", "body_text": " **********The Federal Court of Appeals here heard testimony today on whether the constitutional rights of a United States citizen were violated when his ranch land in Honduras was seized to establish an American-built military base for training soldiers from El Salvador and other Central American countries. **********The landowner, Temistocles Ramirez de Arellano, sought redress earlier through a Federal district court, but his suit was dismissed. **********Last December, a three-member panel of the appeals court upheld the lower court's ruling, reasoning that any move to block United States military involvement in Honduras would interfere with the executive branch's conduct of foreign policy. **********In agreeing to hear Mr. Ramirez's appeal, the court, with 10 of the 11 judges sitting, vacated the panel's ruling. **********At today's hearing, the only one to be held before the court renders its decision, Mark R.

Regan said the Fed had not done enough. **********Mr. Regan's comments, which included a suggestion for bringing the Federal Reserve under Administration control, came before Thursday's report that the M-1 measure of the money supply fell a whopping $7.1 billion in the week ended Dec. 3. **********Pressure Put on Volcker **********Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and an object of Mr. Regan's criticism more than once in the last four years, has acknowledged in recent weeks that inflation was a diminished problem. He is being pushed from all sides to loosen the money supply further. **********In addition to Mr. Regan, two of Mr. Volcker's colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board - Preston Martin, the vice chairman, and Martha Seger, the newest member, both Reagan appointees - have implied in recent speeches that the central bank could be less restrictive. **********The Volcker-led majority on the board has been reluctant to take such a step. But Mr. Martin, Miss Seger and some officials in the Reagan Administration suggest this approach accepts too large a risk of choking off economic expansion. **********Decision-Making Difficult **********Analysts agree that the recent mix of economic news makes the Fed's decision on the money supply unusually difficult. **********Moreover, some people wonder why the money supply has failed to grow even as the Fed has clearly moved to prevent the economy from sliding into a decline. **********The Fed and its defenders assert that critics such as Mr. Regan fail to appreciate how hard it is to know just where the economy stands at a given moment and they also cite the still imperfectly understood interaction, including the time lags, between money and the economy. **********''The simple fact is that it's Monday morning quarterbacking,'' asserted David M. Jones, a money market specialist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. ''It's a reactive process,'' he added, changing the metaphor, ''like a doctor diagnosing a patient.'' **********And, many analysts say, fears that the Federal Reserve will misread what is happening or overreact to it creates uncertainty in the markets that complicates the Fed's task. **********'Cross-Currents' in Data **********In any case, Elliott Platt, senior vice president of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., asserted that ''the Fed at the moment has a very difficult judgment call.'' Citing the recent economic reports, he said, ''What I see is a tremendous number of cross-currents in the data.'' **********The present business expansion, now 24 months old, has rapidly slowed from its 8.6 percent growth rate in the first half of 1984, and some analysts think growth in the current quarter will be even less than the third quarter's 1.9 percent rate. **********Initial claims for state unemployment insurance jumped in the latest week, industrial production is below its August level and the Government's index of leading indicators fell in three of the past five months. **********Yet there is also substantial evidence that the economy may soon rebound. Unemployment has fallen to 7 percent, and last week's report of a 1.8 percent gain in retail sales, although not assuring a strong Christmas shopping season, was buoyant. **********Last Spring's Tightening **********Although it is often hard to characterize Federal Reserve policy with assurance - the central bank itself couches its pronouncements in arcane and opaque generalizations - there is little doubt that a tightening move that raised interest rates last spring had an important effect in the second-half economic slowdown. **********Money growth as measured by M-1 (the narrowest but probably most significant gauge since it counts only currency, checking accounts and other easily spendable money) has barely grown in four months. M-1 now stands at $547.1 billion, compared with $546.5 in mid-July. **********Since about Labor Day, however, the Fed has taken a number of modest steps toward easing the money supply. It twice reduced the target for borrowings at its discount window by financial institutions, and the day before Thanksgiving it cut the discount rate by a half-point, to 8 1/2 percent. Then, late last week it allowed the Federal funds rate, the rate for overnight loans between banks, to trade freely below that level. **********But even when the Fed decides it wants to promote money supply growth - thereby presumably lowering interest rates and stimulating economic activity - it has relatively little short-term control over the amount of increase or its timing. **********Delayed Effect of Moves **********When borrowers won't borrow, the Fed's frustrations are sometimes analogous to pushing on a string. **********On some occasions, when the effect of its actions has been delayed, the Fed has been compared to a little boy dragging a brick with a large rubber band. The brick, which at first does not budge, suddenly flies forward and cracks him in the shin. **********As Paul Meek, monetary adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has described the process: ''Monetary growth reflects continuing interaction between the central bank, financial institutions, the money market and bank depositors. The Federal Reserve can govern the pace at which the trading desk supplies reserves to depository institutions, but bank customers determine, by and large, how much money they want to hold and in what form.'' **********In the United States, as in most other countries, commercial banks create money with the stroke of a pen or the punch of a computer key. When a bank approves a loan, it simply credits the borrower's account, while setting aside a small required percentage of the amount as a reserve. **********Potential Borrowers' Role **********The Fed can make it more or less attractive for a bank to make loans, but in the end whether money is created depends mainly on whether potential borrowers find the interest rate attractive in a given economic environment. Autumn's easing is now producing stronger money growth. **********All three of the basic money supply measures, M-1 and the broader M-2 and M-3, advanced smartly in November, and interest rates have continued to decline. M-2 is now in the middle of its 1984 target range of 6 to 9 percent growth. M-3, with the same target, shows an above-range growth rate of 10 percent. **********Several analysts predict that M-1, which remains near the bottom of its 4 to 8 percent growth target, will show a gain of as much as $5 billion when the results for the week of Dec. 10 are reported Thursday. **********Week-to-week movements can be misleading, analysts say.The figures, moreover, may change for reasons that are noneconomic."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/08/world/bonn-limits-export-of-chemical-arms-materials.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1984-08-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 565, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BONN LIMITS EXPORT OF CHEMICAL-ARMS MATERIALS", "print_headline": "BONN LIMITS EXPORT OF CHEMICAL-ARMS MATERIALS", "body_text": " **********West Germany agreed today to restrict the export of chemical manufacturing equipment that can be used to make chemical weapons, the Government announced. **********It was not clear when the restrictions would take effect.

Tonight, West German aviation officials said it was still not clear that the men had actually brought their weapons aboard at Frankfurt. **********One theorized that some of the weapons or explosives might have come aboard only after the plane landed in Iran. Another said they might have been put on the plane before it arrived in Frankfurt.   Plastic Explosives Cited **********Several officials, however, said explosives could be sneaked past the X-ray machines that examine hand luggage. These machines, effective against metal guns, can often be fooled by devices such as plastic bombs, they said. **********In addition, hijackers have been known to have confederates who can get aboard planes before they take off by holding maintanance jobs with airlines or airports. These agents can then plant grenades, guns or explosives. **********Information was fragmentary tonight as to what weapons and explosive devices the three hijackers had. **********Initial reports said the men were armed with grenades and knives. But Jonathan Shingleton, a passenger who was interviewed in Teheran after he was released, said the hijackers appeared today with submachine guns, explosives and .45-caliber handguns. Previously, he said, they had had only small explosives. ''This made a totally different ballgame,'' he said. **********Airline officials in Germany, who pride themselves on the security at Frankfurt, offered a variety of theories as to how the men might have carried out the hijacking. **********Klaus Hanicke, director of international relations and security at Lufthansa, said plastic explosives ''can be brought on in very small portions and can then be put together on board.''  Devices Can Be Disguised **********He said such explosives could be easily disguised so a security officer looking at an X-ray of a carry-on bag could be fooled. ''If they were explosives in the shape of a piece of soap or a puppet or a shoe, they might not be noticed,'' he said. ''You can have explosives in the shape of the normal things that people carry in their hand baggage.'' **********An American aviation official here said, ''Explosives are very difficult to detect, if not close to impossible.'' **********Hannsrainer Otto, a spokesman for the Frankfurt Airport, emphasized that it was still not clear if the men brought anything on at Frankfurt.  ''The investigations have not been closed,'' he said. ''We don't know if the explosives were brought on at Frankfurt or somewhere else. Perhaps they had been put on in Paris already. Perhaps they were brought in in Teheran.'' **********But both Mr. Otto and Mr. Hanicke acknowledged that even at Frankfurt, security procedures cannot be entirely certain. ''As a rule, you can say that at an airport where there are 70,000 passengers a day, despite strong controls you will have the possibility of getting something on board,'' Mr. Otto said.   Even Low-Level Workers Checked **********Officials said the possibility that confederates had planted the explosives or guns on the plane could not be ruled out, though Mr. Hanicke said even low- level airport and airline workers were given thorough security checks. ''They are more than 100 percent checked, especially in Europe and North America,'' he said. But he added that the checking of airport personnel was less strict elsewhere. **********The French state television tonight speculated that elements of the Iranian Government might have been in league with the hijackers, though the network was careful not to suggest that the Government had actually assisted them. France is giving substantial assistance to Iraq in its war with Iran, and French-Iranian relations are poor. **********But Frankfurt Airport officials said there were no Iranian planes at the airport on Tuesday, when the Frankfurt- to-Paris plane was hijacked. **********Officials in Washington suggested that the hijackers might have flown in from an airport where security was relatively lax, waited in a transit area and then boarded the Paris flight. But a Frankfurt Airport spokesman said tonight that even if the men had waited in a transit area, they would still have had to pass through a seperate metal detector at the gate before boarding. **********This would also appear to rule out the possibility, which exists at some airports, that the hijackers met someone in the transit area who had carried in weapons by flying from an airport with weak security.   Unable to Block All Hijackings **********Tom Ashwood, first vice president of the Air Line Pilots Association in charge of security, said ''the most likely scenario'' was that the weapons had been brought on the plane somewhere other than Frankfurt. **********But he added that even the strictest security measures were unlikely to prevent all hijackings. **********''How come convicts escape from maximum security jails? How do Brinks holdups occur? Why do you get leaks out of Joint Chiefs of Staffs meetings?'' he asked. ''No matter how much money you spend, no matter how secure you are, you still have the human factor, and with human error, there's always the possibility of a breach. **********''Of course hijackings are dramatic,'' he went on.

Its plans to achieve superiority over the Soviet Union, including the field of long-range cruise missiles, are not only dangerous, but illusory.'' **********The cruise missile is an unpiloted drone that can be programmed by computer to follow the surface terrain of the earth to a target after being launched from land, sea or air. **********The United States' deployment of sea-based cruise missiles was a subject of debate in Congress last summer. Opponents of deployment said the missiles made arms control difficult because nuclear and conventional versions cannot be readily distinguished so that any treaty curbs on the nuclear version cannot be verified. **********The nuclear version of the Tomahawk can reportedly carry a warhead with the explosive power of 200,000 tons of TNT to within 300 feet of a target 1,500 miles away. **********The Soviet announcement today said: **********''The armed forces of the U.S.S.R. have begun to deploy long-range cruise missiles on strategic bombers and submarines.

It attaches great significance to carrying out a massive deployment of long- range cruise missiles of all basing modes.'' **********Air-based cruise missiles were part of a weapons ceiling set in the strategic arms limitation treaty of 1979. Although that treaty has not been ratified, the two nations have said that they are adhering to its provisions. The treaty also placed a three-year moratorium on the deployment of ground- based and sea-launched cruise missiles. The United States interprets that provision as having lapsed. **********In late 1983, the Atlantic alliance began deploying the first of 464 ground- launched cruise missiles in Western Europe, along with 108 Pershing 2 ballistic missiles. **********The deployment led to a Soviet walkout from negotiations in Geneva on both medium-range and strategic, or intercontinental-range, weapons.

One was whether the United States could be moved to a greater sense of urgency and commitment on reducing the huge budget deficits that the six other governments here criticized as a fundamental cause of high and rising real interest rates and, hence, as a threat to world economic recovery. **********The second was what the seven richest countries would do to ward off an international debt crisis - a danger that has been exacerbated by rising interest rates. **********On the first issue, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan stubbornly held to the Reagan Administration's line that no connection had been proved to exist between rising budget deficits and rising interest rates. Mr. Regan held to this line despite protests from such quarters as Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, who contended that the American position was ''simple-minded.'' **********Going Easy on Reagan **********But Mr. Lawson's boss, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, refused to put President Reagan ''in the dock,'' as the British phrased it, in an election year. Nor were the other summit countries prepared, when the showdown over the conference's final communique came, to specifically criticize American fiscal policies. **********They settled for - as, indeed, the United States was glad to settle for - the bland statement that ''prudent monetary and budgetary policies of the kind that have brought us so far will have to be sustained and, where necessary, strengthened.'' **********The conference's budget plank, in its ultimate form, was definitely Reaganite: ''Not the least of our concerns is the growing strain of public expenditure in all our countries,'' it said. ''Public expenditure has to be kept within the limits of what our national economies can afford.'' **********Mr. Reagan made clear that, in his interpretation, budget-cutting was desirable if it involved cutting public spending - but not if it meant raising taxes. And the other countries were willing to take his assurances about a ''down payment'' of deficit-shrinking measures before the November election as an implied promise that there would be further action to shrink the looming deficits after the election. **********Anxieties Over Policy **********But this is a familiar story, if not to the foreign heads of government and state, then to the securities markets that continue to be plagued by anxieties over the Administration's fiscal and monetary policies. **********In mid-1984, the United States economy is in something approaching a full-fledged boom. Real gross national product expanded at an annual rate of 8.8 percent in the first quarter of this year and has continued to grow rapidly in the current quarter, although the pace has slowed considerably. Bottlenecks are starting to turn up in some industrial sectors. Inflation is starting to edge higher. **********In the view of the Administration's critics, tougher monetary and fiscal policies are necessary if the expansion is to be moderated to a sustainable pace. But the Administration has, as Secretary Regan conceded in a news conference here, pursued an ''open mouth'' policy aimed at persuading the Fed not to tighten money so much in an election year. **********Down-Payment Package **********Even if the Administration's ''down payment'' package is enacted by Congress, as it probably will be, the Federal budget would still be running deficits close to $200 billion a year for the next three years. **********The Administration continues to regard the implications of such policies for interest rates with equanimity. Secretary Regan, declaring that the Treasury could find no linkage between budget deficits and rates either in its own or other studies, called on anyone who knew of studies demonstrating such a link to send them to the Treasury. **********He brushed aside the 1984 annual report of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, headed by Martin S. Feldstein, as ''not a study.'' **********New Study on Deficit Impact **********However, a new study, ''Deficits, Borrowing and Crowding Out,'' by David T. King, regional treasurer and senior economist of Citicorp, concludes that funding huge budget deficits while the private economy is trying to expand strongly will have two principal effects: **********- First, the rate-sensitive household sector will be ''crowded out'' of the market for funds, and the resulting decrease in purchases of homes, automobiles and other durable goods will slow economic growth. **********- Second, large foreign capital flows into United States money markets will continue to raise the value of the dollar, reduce the international competitiveness of American goods and services and expose the economy to the instability of international currency markets. **********The study, published by the National Planning Association, a private research and policy group based in Washington, concludes that the persistently high budget deficits confront the Federal Reserve with a dilemma: High rates of monetary growth result in inflation, but restraining monetary growth in the face of credit market pressure results in high real interest rates. **********'Critical Issue of Our Time' **********''In short,'' the report states, ''the budget deficit has set the United States on the road to its next recession. The costs of recession are enormous, worth going to extremes to avoid. The deficit is therefore the critical economic issue of our time.'' **********Closely linked to the deficit issue, via its effect on interest rates, is the international debt problem. The Reagan Administration had earlier intended to try to keep the debt issue off the summit meeting's agenda, but this proved impossible, especially as pressure from the debtor countries intensified and as concern grew about the safety of the lending commercial banks. The near-collapse of the Continental Illinois Bank, though not directly due to its foreign exposure, increased those fears. **********The London summit conference did set forth a package of proposals to help the developing countries with their enormous debt burdens. The leaders of the industrial countries called for maintaining and, wherever possible, increasing flows of money, especially to the poorest countries, through international financial and development institutions. **********The United States was not enthusiastic about that, however; it stressed its own bilateral aid programs, such as to Central American and Caribbean countries. **********Case-by-Case Approach on Debt **********The summit talks stuck to a ''case by case'' approach to solving the problems of debtor countries. But in cases where debtor countries are making ''successful efforts to improve their position,'' the summit communique called for ''more extended multiyear rescheduling of commercial debts and standing ready where appropriate to negotiate similarly in respect of debts to governments and government agencies.'' **********Although critics of the London summit - especially those in the third world - may say it did not go far enough, it still resulted in some looking ahead and a somewhat diminished reliance on a policy of ''muddling through'' and ''fire fighting'' than existed before. **********This willingness to face up to the debt crisis could well be the most significant accomplishment of the 10th economic summit, and could do much, if future actions live up to the implied commitment, rescue the world from a looming breakdown in its financial system.  But it would be premature to maintain that the danger is now past. If the United States were to go through another cycle of boom and bust, thanks to erratic fiscal and monetary policies, it would jeopardize the ability of Latin and other debtor countries to solve their debt problems, with or without more foreign aid. **********Thus, actions by the United States and other industrial countries to adopt policies for more stable economic growth remain the great unfinished business of the 10th economic summit conference."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/05/business/executives-in-retirement-the-global-volunteer.html": {"writer_name": "Linda Keslar", "pub_date": "1984-08-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 443, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE GLOBAL VOLUNTEER", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVES IN RETIREMENT; THE GLOBAL VOLUNTEER", "body_text": " **********EDWARD SWAN took early retirement two years ago from **********his job as vice president and creative director at J.

All year long they had been building up mountainous amounts of short-term debt because the dramatically lower rates in 90-day commercial paper or from banks were too tempting to pass up. **********The expected torrent, however, turned out to be a trickle. A few big names such as Texaco, Xerox and Georgia Pacific returned to the bond market, but the vast majority of industrial corporations with balance sheets overloaded by short-term debt have elected to hold out for even lower rates. And in recent weeks, when the cost of borrowing beyond several years moved up again, the calendar of coming bond offerings has taken on a decidedly blank look. **********''Many companies are using the election as a reason to sit back and see if rates will come down,'' said David C. Batten, a managing director of the First Boston Corporation. Although there was some pickup in bond financing over the past several months, he said, ''it was relatively small considering the significant group of companies waiting for lower rates.'' **********Activity in Bearer Bonds **********Some whittling away of short-term debt is going on, however. A few well-known American corporations are taking advantage of the appetite overseas for bearer bonds, which do not require identification of the buyers. Other corporations are tapping the convertible bond market in this country because, in return for the chance to convert the bonds into stock, investors are willing to accept lower interest than they would get on a conventional bond issue. **********By declining to lock in fixed-rate long-term money just now, most corporations are counting on a slowing economy to bring down long-term rates. They are also betting that short-term rates will not abruptly soar - as they have more than once in the past few years. **********But if short-term rates do take off, many companies could be badly burned. Short-term borrowings by nonfinancial corporations have risen twice as fast since the 1982 recession as before, noted Stephen S. Roach, senior economist for Morgan Stanley & Company. And with interest costs already equal to 30 percent of corporate profits, ''the bottom line will be pinched quickly if short-term rates rise,'' he said. ''Corporations now have an unprecedented vulnerability to rising rates.'' **********The heavy short-term borrowing has stemmed from the surge in corporate acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and overall capital spending. Normally, companies would finance much of that activity in the medium- and long-term bond markets. Instead, as John Crosby, a managing director of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said, ''The short-term debt portion of corporate balance sheets remains out of whack. Long-term market rates came down, and companies did virtually nothing.'' **********The stalemate may not last long, however. Corporate financial officers are generally conservative. And unless the short-term rate advantage is overwhelmingly compelling, as it was in the second quarter, they tend to be nervous about playing interest spreads. If short-term rates rise even moderately this fall, as many economists are predicting, there is likely to be a march of companies into the bond market. **********When the Ralston Purina Company completes its recently announced acquisition of the Continental Baking unit of the ITT Corporation for $475 million next month, for instance, Kenneth N. Kermes, chief financial officer of Ralston, plans to move as quickly as possible to lock in longer- term fixed bond rates - even though it will probably be more costly. **********''I'm from the old school,'' Mr. Kermes said. ''I like to fund long- term projects with long-term money.'' **********Another such financial officer is Edwin A. Huston, chief financial officer of the Ryder System, which recently raised $100 million with a 10- year bond issue. In the first six months of this year, he said, the ratio of his company's short-term debt to long-term debt rose above normal because the lower rates on the short end were ''very tempting.'' **********'Swings in Profitability' **********But since most of the money was to finance three- to five-year fixed-payment truck leases, ''to stay short term on the liability side opened us to swings in profitability,'' Mr. Huston said. **********A great many companies seem to be getting ready to jump in. David A. Wyss, senior financial economist at Data Resources Inc., said: ''Standard & Poor's is seeing quite an increase in the number of companies coming in for a debt rating. That's usually a good indication that more of them will be coming to market.'' **********The interest-rate level at which corporate financial officers will feel comfortably committed for longer- maturity debt is a moving target. Investment bankers said that until this summer's drop in rates, the financial officers had been indicating that long- term rates below 14 percent would cause a rush to the bond market. **********Stronger Cash Flows **********Now, even though most investment grade companies can raise money at 13 percent or 14 percent, the goal is to do so below 13 percent. **********Aside from the heavy dependence on lower-cost, short-term money, the other reason why bond financing is running so low is that many companies are enjoying exceptionally strong cash flows. That eliminates the need to borrow either short or long. **********Cash flows are up because of the drive by so many corporations during the past recession to become more efficient. As sales picked up with the economic recovery, this has meant higher profit margins. In addition, the tax change in 1981 allowing faster depreciation on plant and equipment has chipped in about half of the $100 billion cash flow increase for nonfinancial corporations since the end of the recession, noted Richard D. Rippe, senior vice president and economist at Dean Witter Reynolds. **********The Exxon Corporation, for instance, continues a high level of capital spending, about $9 billion this year. But it has not recently been a long-term borrower, nor does it have any plans to be, reports Allen Harrison, assistant treasurer.   Interest Rate Swaps **********''We have a strong cash flow, resulting in part from a significant amount of cost cutting over the past few years,'' Mr. Harrison said. **********Not all companies raising funds via short-term bank loans or in the commercial paper market are necessarily subject to the risk of rising rates. **********James McKeon, a credit market analyst for Salomon Brothers, for instance, has concluded that a ''good part of short-term financing is for interest rate swaps.'' In such cases, an American company might obtain long-term, fixed-rate money at a relatively low cost by swapping its obligations on short-term, adjustable-rate debt for the fixed-rate obligation of an overseas issuer in the Eurodollar market. **********Even so, many companies are clearly betting that long-term rates will decline as the current economic expansion begins to run out of steam. If high rates persist, corporate treasurers see the advantgage they are now gaining in the short-term arenas as more than offseting any increases they might have to pay for long-term financing later on. **********The time is also coming when many companies will be facing a new round of major capital expenditures. Their plants are nearing full capacity. But, as Edward Hyman, chief economist for C. J. Lawrence & Company, said, ''There is the sense that if rates skyrocket, then the economy will turn down, and there will be no need to build new plants anyway.'' **********Investment bankers are advising corporations not to wait. ''Our economists believe rates will be higher in 1985,'' said Peter M. Sacerdote, partner in charge of corporate finance at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''If a corporation has to finance and can't wait beyond then, it should go now. The real danger is that people try to project what they wish to happen rather than what is likely to happen.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/30/business/briefs-097113.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 230, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt Ratings *********** Arkla Inc.'s first-mortgage bond ratings were reduced to Ax, from AA, and its commercial paper to A1, from A1x, by Standard & Poor's.

Volume on the Big Board broke all records for the second week in a row, with 754.5 million shares changing hands. Institutions continued to dominate the buying, apparently not wanting to miss out on a rally that has seen the Dow jump more than 100 points in two weeks, but individuals did join the action more. After torrid trading on Monday, and slower trading on Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday looked like a slow day until trading exploded late in the day. The Dow jumped more than 30 points to close up 27.94 points on the day. Friday saw a continuation of the last hour with the Dow surging 22 points in the morning. But the rally weakened and by the end of the day the Dow had lost six points, to end the week at 1,218.01, up almost 16 points on the week. **********Strength in the bond market was a big stimulus for the stock market. Amid falling interest rates and rising bond prices, investors snapped up more than $16 billion in Treasury offerings last week. Adding to investor confidence about the future course of interest rates, the money supply took a surprisingly large $2.6 billion drop for the latest reporting week. M-1 now stands below the middle of the Fed's target range, signaling that the Central Bank will at least not tighten its monetary policy. **********Turbulence.  The airline industry felt the effects of investor skittishness, when People Express announced that it would begin a Chicago-Newark route for $59 to $79 one- way. The new fares, almost 70 percent below existing coach prices, are likely to touch off a fare war with the big carriers, which include United, American, Delta and T.W.A. Fare- war fears pushed airline stocks lower, but prices recovered somewhat later in the week on the market's strength . . . Pan Am posted a $49.8 million loss in the second quarter, compared with a $10.4 million loss a year earlier. **********National Semiconductor promised   to mend its ways and not sell untested chips to the Government. The chip maker, which was charged with violating U.S. testing rules, agreed to set up an independent unit that will monitor all its Government work and insure that all chips are properly tested. In return, the agency agreed to stop attempts to block National Semi from getting Government contracts and return the company to full contracter status. **********Strike Two.  Trilogy Ltd., the creation of Gene Amdahl and once a darling of Wall Street, has abandoned its second major project in three months - the design and marketing of a high- speed superchip. Mr. Amdahl said the ''wafer-scale'' semiconductor, which is the equivalent of about a hundred chips in one large silicon wafer, had proven too costly. He said Trilogy would instead concentrate on designing and assembling circuit packages for large computer companies. In June, it dropped work on its super computer project. **********Inflation Blip.  After three months of holding steady, prices at the producer level rose in July by three- tenths of one percent. The jump was sparked by the first increase in food prices since March. But economists said the rise showed that inflation was still in check. **********Deficit Adjustments.  The Congressional Budget Office lowered its projections for the nation's budget deficits for fiscal years 1984 and 1985. Citing recent tax increases and spending cuts, it now sees a $172 billion shortfall in fiscal 1984, growing to $178 billion in 1985. Its January estimate called for a $189 billion and $197 billion deficits in the two years. **********Fed Chairman Paul Volcker suggested that certain Latin American nations - particularly Mexico and Venezuela - had made substantial economic gains recently, that they were on time with their interest payments and that bankers might now consider offering more favorable credit terms an extended maturities. But he added in Congressional testimony that such favorable treatment should be granted on a case-by-case basis. Mr. Volcker also said that he sympathized with the idea of interest- rate ceilings on Third World loans, but declined to offer any detailed suggestions to the Congressmen. **********Merrill Lynch plans to buy the struggling brokerage firm of Becker Paribas for $96.9 million in new stock. But the gaint securities firm will keep only about 300 of Becker's 2,000 employees. Merrill will not acquire Becker's retail stock brokerage, which will become a new independent company. Analysts questioned the wisdom of the purchase since Merrill reported substantial losses for the second quarter and Becker has evidently lost as much as $75 million in stock and bond trading during the last year. **********The F.C.C. yielded to some strong- arm tactics by Congress and voted to delay the planned expansion of television ownership for about six months. The Commission had ruled last month that a single owner could buy as many as 12 stations, up from seven under an earlier law. But upon the urging of three members of the House and separate Senate action, the Commission decided not to proceed with implementation of the new rule. The move did not affect an F.C.C. plan to permit expansion of radio station ownership to 12 from seven. **********More Mergers.  I.C. Industries agreed to buy the Pneumo Corporation for $560 million, or $38 a share. The move will increase I.C.'s military business four-fold since Pneumo is a large manufacturer of landing gear and flight controls . . . W.R. Grace and an investor-management group plan to pay $19.25 a share, or $360 million, for National Medical Care Inc., a Boston-based dialysis company . . . Canada's largest fashion retailer, Dylex Ltd., bid $365 million in cash for Brooks Fashion Stores. The offer is supported by the Saul family, which holds a controling interest in Brooks. **********Addenda.  R.J. Reynolds was awarded $49.8 million by the Iran- U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague on claims it made against Iran in wake of the 1979 hostage crisis.

Shultz in meetings here with Belgian and Dutch officials. An aide to Mr. Shultz said he had found the meetings ''positive.'' **********''They told us they would do their best to do their duty, but they also pointed out the problems they have,'' the aide said. **********The Belgian and Dutch Governments have encountered domestic opposition to deploying the missiles under a NATO plan, first set forth five years ago, to counter the Soviet Union's SS-20 medium-range missiles by stationing cruise missiles and Pershing 2 ballistic missiles in Western Europe.   48 Missiles Each to Be Deployed **********Belgium is supposed to deploy 48 cruise missiles starting in March, and the Netherlands also 48, in 1986. Britain, Italy and West Germany have already begun their deployment. There will eventually be 464 cruise missiles. In addition, West Germany is supposed to deploy 108 Pershing 2 missiles. **********Allied officials have said that if the Dutch and the Belgians do not live up to their commitment, political pressure may force other countries to scale back their deployment, reducing pressure on the Russians to negotiate. **********''It is harmful if undertakings are not adhered to,'' Mr. Shultz said in a news conference aboard his plane en route from Britain for the annual winter meeting of foreign ministers from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. **********''And it is certainly the case that, if the Soviets could have their way without giving up anything or engaging in negotiations, it would be discouraging to the negotiations,'' he said.   New Arms Talks Due Next Month **********Mr. Shultz opens a new round of arms talks with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko of the Soviet Union next month in Geneva. The talks are to cover the suspended negotiations on strategic arms and medium-range missiles in Europe, as well as curbs on space weapons. **********''While the Soviet decision to enter into new arms control negotiations is welcome, the road ahead will not be easy and Western patience and realism will remain the key to concrete progress in the coming months,'' Mr. Shultz said on arriving here. **********One of his seeming concerns is the spate of newspaper articles suggesting that his differences with Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger are so wide as to make it difficult to produce a workable set of proposals for the talks with Mr. Gromyko. **********''That is nonsense,'' Mr. Shultz said on his plane when asked whether the State Department would prevail over the Pentagon in preparing for the talks. **********''The point is the President will make decisions on what positions to take,'' he said. ''The issues get full discussion. It is not true that the Defense Department is always on one side of the issue and State on the other. That is not an accurate statement at all. We approach this on the basis of full discussion and lots of agreement and the President will make some big decisions.''  Differences Not Being Denied **********Mr. Shultz's aides later said that he did not intend to deny that differences existed, but to stress his belief that some accounts had been overblown. **********On the issue of missile deployment in Belgium and the Netherlands, the Belgian Government, after first announcing that it intended to go ahead, put off a decision until after Prime Minister Wilfried Martens sees President Reagan on Jan. 14 in Washington. Today Mr. Shultz met with Mr. Martens and Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans, both of whom, according to American officials, said politics forced them to move cautiously. **********The Dutch Government, faced with opposition, has said that it will make a decision at the end of 1985. It said that if the Soviet Union increased the number of SS-20 missiles, this would be a factor in favor of deployment. **********American officials have said that the number of SS-20s has risen to 387, with more being built. Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek of the Netherlands affirmed the Dutch position in conferring with Mr. Shultz today. **********Mr. Shultz told reporters that he would not be able to inform the allied ministers in detail of what he will tell Mr. Gromyko because Mr. Reagan had made no decisions. Mr. Shultz said he wanted to hear the allies' ideas.   Mediation for India and Sri Lanka **********In another development, Mr. Shultz disclosed that the United States had sent Gen. Vernon A. Walters, a roving ambassador, to the Indian subcontinent after Sri Lanka had asked for help in easing tensions with India. **********Sri Lanka has also sought emergency military support from Britain and the United States, but aides to Mr. Shultz said that, for the moment, the emphasis was on diplomacy. The British Foreign Office said Tuesday that it would not meet a Sri Lanka request for patrol boats to prevent Tamil infiltration from India. **********The Tamils are an ethnic group that lives in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and shares Sri Lanka with the Sinhalese, the ethnic majority.

For example, the package raises the possibility of Japan's buying foreign-made communications satellites - something the United States would very much like. But whether such purchases would, in fact, come about was is uncertain. Japan would like to develop its own satellites. **********Prime Minister Comments **********Similarly, an expressed willingness to open up Japan's capital markets contains little of substance, given continued disagreements with the United States over the pace of such liberalization. **********Prime Minister Nakasone said today's Cabinet action took into account ''the role Japan is expected to perform in the international economic community.'' **********He said, ''We hope that other nations fully understand the sincere intention and the efforts Japan has made.'' **********To a certain degree, the contents of the Japanese trade package are less important than its timing.

Japan says its surplus in trade with the United States totaled $18.2 billion last year, a figure that Washington considers understated. Against the Common Market, the surplus was put at $10.4 billion. **********Recurring Pattern Noted **********The latest trade package follows a familiar pattern, in which Japan waits until just before a major conference to promise reforms to Western industrial countries that blame Japan for many of their economic woes. **********The new tariff reductions affect more than 60 items, including wine, forestry products, color photographic paper and farm equipment. **********An official in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said 31 items had been designated for special cuts. Tariffs will drop by an average of 35 percent, he said, starting next April 1. In addition, the package calls for cutting tariffs a year or two ahead of schedule for many goods covered by earlier agreements. But Japanese officials cautioned that such changes depend on other countries' ''implementing their own advanced reductions.'' **********Beef-and-Orange Accord **********The Government cited its willingness to import more United States beef and citrus - an issue that has acquired considerable symbolic importance for both countries even though it means little to their overall trade problems. Under the agreement reached earlier this month, Japan will increase its quote on high-grade beef over the next four years to 58,400 tons, from 30,800 tons, and its orange import quota to 126,000 tons, from 82,000 tons."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/29/world/new-airport-still-unfinished-is-open-in-grenada.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1498, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW AIRPORT, STILL UNFINISHED, IS OPEN IN GRENADA", "print_headline": "NEW AIRPORT, STILL UNFINISHED, IS OPEN IN GRENADA", "body_text": " **********The big jet airport that Cuba began building and that the United States is helping to complete opened today with two-thirds of the terminal unfinished, most of the roads unpaved and acres of raw dirt waiting to be landscaped. **********It also opened without any regularly scheduled jet service by any airline and with the island's few hotels and guesthouses filled with government officials, businessmen and journalists. **********But the several thousand Grenadians who braved sporadic outbursts of rain to listen to speeches and festive music and watch the first commercial passenger planes land on the 9,000-foot- long runway after the opening did not seem to mind that some new problems were raised and that completion of the project was still nearly a year away. **********They were clearly delighted that finally, after engineering studies and debates going back to the mid-1950's, the island had in operation an airport that could accommodate the largest jet aircraft that fly, day or night and in any kind of weather.   Link to Anniversary Seen **********Many Grenadians said the Reagan Administration had been determined to get the airport in operation this week so as to have a major tangible accomplishment on the anniversary of the United States invasion of the island Oct. 25, 1983. **********In a letter to the Governor General, Sir Paul Scoon, that was read over Radio Grenada Saturday night, President Reagan recalled the events of a year ago and said: ''It is good to recall on this promising and happy occasion that the objectives of the rescue mission were achieved.'' **********Grenadian officials put the eventual total cost of the airport at more than $80 million, including about $19 million from the United States. **********In the main address, the Governor General called the airport ''a dream come true.'' He thanked the United States and Canada for their help with the airport but he did not mention the Cubans who, according to Grenadians familiar with the work, completed about 65 percent of the project before the United States troops arrived.   'A Good and Magnificent Thing' **********John Francis, a 49-year-old farmer in the crowd, said he did not know who deserved the most credit for the airport. But, he said, ''to all of those who helped us, we are glad and thankful.

But a handful of women in their early 20's quietly held hand-lettered posters indicating they thought the airport should have been named ''Maurice Bishop International Airport,'' in memory of the late Prime Minister who was killed on Oct. 19, 1983, six days before the invasion. The signs also thanked the Cubans. **********Sir Eric Gairy, a former Prime Minister who is backing a slate of candidates for the coming election on Dec. 3, has said that if his party wins he plans to rename the airport ''Ronald Reagan International Airport.''  Replaces Old, Distant Airport **********The airport is now named Point Saline International Airport, after its location at the southern tip of the island. It replaces the short, unlighted Pearls Airport, which opened on Jan. 16, 1943. The new airport, set alongside a sparkling sea, is a drive of about 25 minutes over mostly level ground from the capital, compared with the old airport, which was about an hour away via winding mountain road. **********For months there had been speculation that President Reagan might attend the opening. But, as announced, he sent as the United States representative M. Peter McPherson, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, which has coordinated the airport work since shortly after the invasion. **********''This is a day of celebration,'' Mr. McPherson said at a news conference today at the oceanfront hotel that serves as the United States Embassy. ''It's a proud day for freedom.''  Reagan Cited Military Potential **********During the time that as many as 650 Cubans were working on the airport under the leftist Government led by Mr. Bishop, President Reagan maintained that the airport was intended primarily for military purposes and that it constituted a menace to security in the region. In March 1983 the President went on national television and cited construction of the airstrip as evidence of what he called ''Soviet-Cuban militarization'' of Grenada. ''Grenada doesn't even have an air force,'' he said, showing a satellite photograph of the airstrip. ''Who is it intended for?'' **********Many Grenadians say that they are not sure what the Cubans had in mind, but that from the earliest studies by British engineers nearly 30 years ago, the Grenadians always saw the airport as a boon to tourism and development. **********Airport workers say that for months, more than a half-dozen long-range United States military jet and turboprop transport planes have been landing at the airport each week with supplies and equipment for about 250 United States soldiers who are still patrolling the island and helping to train a new Grenadian police force.   Landing Rights Discussed **********As the airport opened, the appointed interim Government that has been governing Grenada since shortly after the invasion was still discussing landing rights with Pan American World Airways, American Airlines and British West Indian Airways. **********Some officials of B.W.I.A. said they hoped to begin operating a DC-9 jet that could carry 112 passengers between Miami and Grenada next week. But other B.W.I.A. and Government officials said approval might not come before December. **********In the meantime, the new airport will be operating with the same 12 daily flights from nearby islands that were being handled at Pearls. **********The new airport, with sophisticated lighting and navigational systems, will operate into the night so that with connecting flights, passengers can reach Grenada from much of the world in a single day. Operations at Pearls Airport ended as the new airport opened. **********Some critics have said that the airport, which has a concrete terminal more than 150 yards long and four stories tall, is more elaborate than is appropriate for Grenada and that operating expenses could further hamstring the island's crippled economy.   Recommended Since 1955 **********Ron Smith, the Grenadian project manager for the airport construction, said colonial engineers recommended in 1955 that the government buy land for an airport at Point Saline. He said he drew the first plans for it in 1966. But, he said, Grenada could never raise the money to start the project until Maurice Bishop and other leftists took over the Government in early 1979 and obtained assistance from Cuba. The Bishop Government said other countries also aided the project, including Canada, Mexico, Venezuela and Algeria. Work began in early 1980, Mr. Smith said. **********Mr. Smith said construction crews sent by Cuba spent most of their time doing ''earthwork,'' leveling ridges, filling in valleys and laying down 10 inches of asphalt for the runway. United States officials acknowledge that a company from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., dredged and filled the bay under contract to the leftist Government and that other American companies provided the asphalt for the runway and designed the huge fuel storage tanks that the Reagan Administration has often cited as evidence of military intentions. **********Starting last summer, United States officials said, the firm of Morrison- Knudsen of Boise, Idaho, which was part of a consortium that did much of the government construction work in Vietnam, put down the final two inches of asphalt on the runway and brought two of the six bays of the terminal to within 95 percent of completion. **********A British Company, Plessey Airports Ltd., working on a $10 million contract, supplied the wiring, finishing materials and furniture for the terminal. It also built the power-generating plant and provided the air-conditioning. A Finnish company installed the airfield lighting and set up fire and rescue equipment. According to United States official, Canada is providing $7 million for finishing some parts of the airport and for training in security, maintenance and airport management. **********The first commercial passenger plane to land, at 6:28 A.M., was a 48- seat, twin-engine Leeward Islands Air Transport turboprop from Barbados with 30 passengers aboard. **********The first passenger off the plane was Robert Francis, the chief of the international division of the Federal Aviation Administration. He said four American air traffic controllers were in the control tower working alongside Grenadians in a training program. **********The pilot, Trevor Neckles, a 38-year- old Grenadian, said the landing at Point Saline was ''very different'' from landing at the old Grenada airport, where ''you had to fly into a mountain and then down into a valley to get into the airport.'' **********Twenty other passenger planes landed, including four jets, one of them a Pan Am flight from New York and another a charter from Frankfurt and London."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/11/business/city-investing-bid-studied-by-posner.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "City Investing Bid Studied by Posner", "print_headline": "City Investing Bid Studied by Posner", "body_text": " **********Victor Posner, chairman of the Sharon Steel Corporation, which owns 8.9 percent of the City Investing Company, is ''contemplating'' whether to make an offer for City, an attorney for Mr. Posner said.

More than 100 Chinese representatives from Hong Kong have been flown here as China's guests to witness the signing. **********After a 19-hour flight from London aboard a Royal Air Force VC-10, Mrs. Thatcher received a quiet welcome at Peking's capital airport from Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian and a handful of other Chinese officials. With the Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, she was presented with a bouquet of flowers by Chinese children, then whisked out of the frigid north China night for the drive into the city. **********What the official New China News Agency described as a ''warm, friendly and ceremonious reception'' for the British leader will begin in earnest Wednesday when she inspects an honor guard in Tian An Men Square and receives a 19-gun salute. Later she will confer with Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang; Hu Yaobang, the Communist Party chairman, and Deng Xiaoping, China's pre-eminent leader, before the signing ceremony at 5:30 P.M.   Chilly Talks 2 Years Ago **********It was only a little more than two years ago that a visit to Peking by Mrs. Thatcher to discuss Hong Kong ended in chilly disagreement. Mrs. Thatcher had hoped Britain could extend its sovereignty over the colony beyond the expiration of the 99-year lease or at least to persuade Peking to allow Britain to prolong its administrative control over the colony and its nearly five million inhabitants. **********At a meeting with Mr. Deng there were stiff exchanges over the historical background to British occupation of Hong Kong. This was established by treaties in 1842 and 1860 ceding Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula and by the 1898 Convention of Peking, under which the New Territories, accounting for nine-tenths of the land the colony now occupies, were leased for 99 years. **********After those talks, Mr. Deng began talking of a solution imposed by China. **********All this changed rapidly this year when Mrs. Thatcher wrote a letter to the Chinese leaders dropping the demand for continued British control. In turn, the Chinese agreed to guarantee the extension of Hong Kong's capitalist economic system and to give the territory's people a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after 1997. By July, agreement in principle had been reached, and Sir Geoffrey initialed the accord here in September.   Praise for Mrs. Thatcher **********Approval of the agreement last week by both houses of Parliament cleared the way for the signing, and Mrs. Thatcher finds herself greeted here as ''an outstanding stateswoman with vision,'' as she was called in a New China News Agency interview with Ke Hua, the former Chinese Ambassador to Britain. **********Western diplomats say the warmth expressed for Mrs. Thatcher is genuine, reflecting a widespread gratitude that she made it possible for China to redress peacefully what has long been regarded as a symbol of the 19th-century depradations wrought on China. **********Moreover, the diplomats say, British agreement to surrender Hong Kong has added enormously to the personal prestige of Mr. Deng, who needs all the momentum he can muster as he presses his economic modernization program in the face of opposition. **********Chinese leaders have been hinting that Britain will be rewarded with wider trade opportunities, which have lagged behind those obtained by the United States and other West European nations, particularly West Germany. **********The Sino-British Trade Council predicted two-way trade this year of about $720 million, compared with more than $5 billion in trade for the United States and China."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/16/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": " People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING;  People", "body_text": " ***********  Norman Sherman has been named executive vice president for marketing at Avrett, Free & Ginsburg Inc. ***********  Michael J.

Officials also say the results of the trip are likely to be a centerpiece of Mr. Reagan's re-election bid. **********For the first time, Mr. Reagan will be visiting a country that is not a staunch ally; China will be the second Communist country he has ever visited, after East Germany, where he journeyed in 1978. **********Wide Range of Issues **********Much of the news coverage is likely to focus on Mr. Reagan's visits to the sites of Peking, Shanghai and the ancient burial pits of Xian. But Administration officials say the chief significance of the President's trip will lie in how much understanding is achieved in discussions with the Chinese leaders on such issues as relations with the Soviet Union and Taiwan, trade, American investment in China and other matters. **********In almost every area, China and the United States have struggled to overcome disagreements.  ''It's clear that we've had a very up's-and-down's kind of relationship with China,'' a senior Administration official said. He added, however, that the progress in various areas had brought relations to ''a new era'' marked by productive discussions on the issues dividing them. **********Mr. Reagan arrived at Hickam Air Force Base this afternoon after spending the weekend at his ranch in Santa Barbara, Calif. The President, greeted by a few hundred cheering visitors to the base, declared that the trip would ''continue the process of reconciliation'' with China begun by President Nixon. **********The President, who is scheduled to arrive in Peking on Thursday after overnight stops here and in Guam, plans more than seven hours of private discussions with Chinese leaders. Administration aides said no major breakthroughs are expected, but they expressed the hope for progress that can lay the groundwork for better relations in the future. **********Among the topics to be discussed are these: **********- Continued American support for Taiwan, which Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang has called the biggest obstacle to improvement in Chinese-American relations. Mr. Zhao made his comment in the United States in January. **********- Disagreements on a treaty for peaceful nuclear cooperation between the two countries. The agreement is needed before American companies can sell China reactors for its program to develop nuclear power. **********- Impatience and frustration on a range of trade issues. China wants to sell more textile products and buy more high-technology products than the United States wants. The United States wants a new agreement commiting China to buy more grain. **********- Attitudes toward the Soviet Union.  After a period of blaming both Moscow and Washington for world tensions, China has lately suggested publicly that the Soviet Union is more to blame. While China and the United States share an anti-Soviet stand, China resists being seen as a counterweight to the Soviet Union. **********Mr. Reagan is expected to sign a tax treaty in Peking that will eliminate double taxation for American companies doing business in China. In addition, he plans to sign a two-year Implementing Accord of a Cultural Agreement that was originally signed in 1979. The previous accord was suspended by Peking last year in protest after the United States granted asylum to a Chinese tennis player.   Taiwan Is Biggest Issue **********Administration officials agree that the biggest irritant in the relationship with China continues to be Taiwan. The Chinese remain concerned about Mr. Reagan's longtime commitment to the Government there, despite his statements that the United States wants a friendship with ''the people of Taiwan,'' and not the Government. **********Although American arms sales to Taiwan have declined slightly, Peking wants a commitment for a cutoff date. The United States has said only that it expects a gradual reduction in arms sales in response to China's intention to resolve its differences with Taiwan without the use of force. **********Although the history of modern China is marked by disappointment in the West at the failure of markets to open up, United States officials now say that the future of American investment in China is bright. American companies are eager to provide technical help especially in the development of nuclear power, offshore oil drilling, coal mining and hydroelectric dams in China. **********Mr. Reagan has come to look on his trip to China as helping such enterprises. ''I go as something of a salesman,'' he told a group of trade officials in Tacoma, Wash., on Thursday. ''And I'll do anything I can up to the limit of not putting a 'Buy American' sticker on my bag.'' **********Administration officials nonetheless are disappointed that they have been unable to conclude the terms of an investment treaty with China, which would establish protection for American investments from nationalization and regulations that favor domestic Chinese investment. **********In addition, there had been hope that a nuclear cooperation treaty could be signed when Mr. Reagan visited. But the talks have been unable to resolve China's refusal to agree to the American demand that it get consent from the United States for any special use of processed nuclear fuel. **********Sovereignty Infringement **********The demand, which is designed to prevent the spread of weapons-grade material, is opposed by China as an infringement on its sovereignty. **********The most important economic breakthrough with China occurred last year, when Mr. Reagan moved China to a new trade category that permits it to receive a much larger amount of high-technology products. High-technology exports subsequently quadrupled, bringing big profits to American companies. But China is still upset about controls that prevent it from receiving all it wants. **********Another area of disagreement is in foreign assistance. China is seeking low-cost loans from the United States for its development programs. American officials say there are no programs that would permit such aid to China, and that in any case China should rely on private investment for its development needs. **********Mr. Reagan may also sign a scientific agreement with China permitting it to have a Chinese astronaut, or at least a payload, aboard a space shuttle flight in the next several years. Offers to have an astronaut join the American space program have been extended to Brazil, France and West Germany - but not to a Communist country. **********Although China and the United States have similar views on some issues - both oppose the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and Vietnam's actions in Cambodia - there are major differences that are to be discussed. **********China has been an outspoken critic of United States policies in Central America, the Middle East and South Africa. **********Top Reagan Administration officials have said that they welcomed the chance to explain to China that they are acting to counter what the Administration contends is Soviet aggression near the American border. **********Mr. Reagan plans to make extensive use of television in China. His speech in the Great Hall of the People, as well as a question session with Chinese students in Shanghai and with Chinese journalists in Peking, will be televised. **********Just what notes Mr. Reagan plans to sound, however, is unclear. **********Military Assistance **********Equally unclear is how much military assistance the United States will be willing to provide China. Here again, American officials said that Mr. Reagan's discussions will be important in measuring Chinese interest. **********''We're not pushing our stuff on them,'' said an Administration official. He said that up to now, the United States has only sold nonlethal items, such as communications equipment. Discussions may begin on what American officials say will be ''purely defensive'' equipment, such as antitank missiles or artillery shell manufacturing capability. **********Mr. Reagan plans to return from Shanghai May 1, after a six-day visit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/27/world/reagan-to-appoint-glitman-to-head-vienna-arms-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reagan to Appoint Glitman To Head Vienna Arms Talks", "print_headline": "Reagan to Appoint Glitman To Head Vienna Arms Talks", "body_text": " **********President Reagan plans to nominate Maynard W.

Their complaints of unfair competition prompted real estate commissioners in 15 states to prohibit Coldwell customers from using their discounts at Sears. The prohibition is being appealed, and Sears has won a favorable ruling from an Illinois judge. ''Ultimately,'' said C. Wesley Poulson, chairman of the Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group, ''we think the discount will prevail.'' **********That promotion is among the most visible of the benefits that Coldwell Banker has reaped since its acquisition by Sears in 1981. But what is billed as the chief benefit of membership in the new Sears financial empire - the opening of Coldwell booths in 121 Sears stores so far - has not yet produced a measurable effect. **********''We don't really see a pattern yet,'' the 53-year-old Mr. Poulson said. ''In our case, it's so long between the point of contact with a customer and the sale, sometimes more than a year, that it's difficult for us to measure the results.'' **********Aside from residential real estate,  however, the Sears tie has benefited Coldwell in its commercial business - and saved Sears money to boot. Coldwell has been made the exclusive broker for Allstate in the insurance subsidiary's many real estate investments. And it handles sales and leasing for the Homart Development Company, a Sears subsidiary that is the nation's largest developer of shopping centers. Thousands of dollars have thus been saved in commissions and brokerage fees once paid to brokers not affiliated with Sears, although Sears won't disclose figures. **********Nor will executives disclose the specific number of Sears customers among the buyers of the 102,000 homes that Coldwell agents sold last year. That was up from 60,000 in 1982, with the housing recovery contributing greatly to the increase. As for the 25 percent discount at Sears stores, company spokesmen say - somewhat vaguely - that it stirred lots of interest among home buyers. Nevertheless, the initial alarm of the National Association of Realtors has died down since last summer. **********The most dramatic symbol of change at Coldwell in the wake of the Sears takeover - for $202 million in cash and stock - is a burst of growth, beyond the company's earlier plans. **********That expansion has already brought Coldwell from 370 commercial and residential real estate offices in 1981 to nearly 1,000 last year - and increased its share of national home sales from 1 percent when Sears bought the company to 3.8 percent last year. Aside from the 121 stores in Sears the growth was managed through franchising or the purchase of local real estate companies. **********COLDWELL'S 7 percent drop in earnings last year - to $48 million in 1983 from $51.5 million in 1982 - looks bad at first blush. But the 1982 results were bolstered by the sale of four regional shopping centers by the Homart subsidiary in the fourth quarter of the year. In fact, profits from Coldwell's ongoing businesses (before taxes and depreciation) rose sharply as the housing market recovered. In the third quarter of 1983, for example, net income rose to $7.8 million, contrasted to a loss of $3.6 million in the comparable quarter of 1982. **********Coldwell acknowledges that Sears provided some of the financing for the expansion. And this help will continue as Coldwell tries to grow toward its goal of 3,000 offices by 1990, a residential sales force of 80,000 - and an ambitious 12 percent of the home resale market. Some 400 of the new offices are to be Sears booths, with the total reaching 250 this year. **********Coldwell Banker, founded in 1906, operated for years only in commercial real estate, which it now does with 1,800 brokers in 73 commercial offices. In 1969 it entered the residential market by acquiring the big southern California firm of Forest E. Olson. **********Coldwell also has two units that make mortgage loans for both commercial and residential real estate. That puts them potentially into competition with the Sears Savings Bank, whose $5 billion in assets ranks it 11th among California thrift units. **********According to Mr. Poulson, Coldwell has not yet exploited the potential synergies with Dean Witter or Allstate - a failure he attributes to Sears's lack of a chief operating officer at headquarters. **********''Don't get me wrong,'' Mr. Poulson said of the lack of control from Sears at the division level. ''I'd prefer to have it that way than the other way around, I assure you.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/27/business/gypsum-to-acquire-masonite.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1984-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 461, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GYPSUM TO ACQUIRE MASONITE", "print_headline": "GYPSUM TO ACQUIRE MASONITE", "body_text": " **********The United States Gypsum Company and the Masonite Corporation, the country's leading producer of hardwood, announced yesterday that U.S. Gypsum would acquire Masonite for about $380 million in cash. **********The companies said their boards had approved a tender offer by U.S. Gypsum of $38 a share in cash for all the outstanding common stock, about 9,961,000 shares, of Masonite. **********''I think it's a super acquisition and a logical product-line extension into businesses both companies know very well,'' said Laurence H. Hirschhorn, an analyst for the First Boston Corporation. He also said Masonite had received an atttractive price. **********Earnings 'About to Bubble' **********''Masonite is a low-cost producer with a strong position in the market and its earnings are about to bubble,'' Mr. Hirschhorn said. **********''I'm quite positive,'' said Jonathan L. Goldfarb, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. ''It makes sense for both companies. I think Masonite received a good price.'' **********Both Edward W. Duffy, chairman of U.S. Gypsum, and Robert N. Rasmus, chairman of Masonite, said the acquisition would enable expansion, development and efficiencies that would benefit both companies. **********Shareholders of Masonite must still approve the deal. One of the conditions of the offer is that a minimum of 5,386,000 shares, or about 54 percent of the shares outstanding, be tendered. The offer will expire at midnight, Eastern standard time, on April 20, unless extended, and withdrawal rights will expire at midnight on April 13. **********Masonite also announced yesterday that it had granted U.S. Gypsum an option to buy up to 1,842,750 authorized but unissued shares of common stock for $38 a share if for some reason the tender offer was not completed. Excercise of that option would result in U.S. Gypsum owning about 18.5 percent of Masonite shares currently outstanding. **********General Felt's Stake **********Masonite's stock stood at $24.75 a share on Feb. 22, and on Feb. 23, General Felt Industries purchased 6.3 percent of Masonite, driving the stock up $2.50, to $27.25. Masonite said at the time that it would ''aggressively oppose any effort to acquire a large position in its stock at bargain prices.'' **********Masonite stock rose $2 yesterday, to $37.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.

When Kenneth Petricig finished his job as a night proofreader at the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, he would often find Stephen L. Wallis driving the cab he rode home. **********Gradually, their conversation turned to corporate takeovers - the firm's specialty. And by November 1982 the two men had formed a partnership that seemed full of promise, but which ended two and a half years later with Mr. Wallis's arrest as he was preparing to leave for Switzerland. **********Their partnership, as outlined in court papers, was simple and, it seemed, foolproof: Mr. Wallis would pay Mr. Petricig for information on planned corporate takeovers that Mr. Petricig gleaned from proofreading Skadden, Arps documents. Mr. Wallis would then trade stock on the basis of this information. **********But before it ended, they and two other Skadden, Arps clerical employees, a stockbroker and the cab driver's woman friend found themselves drawn into a complex scheme that had them acting like characters out of a spy novel. **********Clandestine Meetings **********They held clandestine meetings in bars, movie theaters and even taxicabs. They made midnight calls on pay phones, referred to each other by code names and used foreign bank accounts. **********But unknown to them, they were being watched - by a team of investigators that grew to include the law firm itself, private investigators, the New York Stock Exchange, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. **********Investigators rifled garbage cans, retrieving slips of paper with company names and stock prices. A Skadden, Arps supervisor monitored one suspected clerk as he searched through the firm's confidential computer files for takeover information. **********In all, six people have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges related to insider trading and are awaiting sentencing. How much money was involved? According to court records, it is difficult to determine. **********Advance knowledge of takeover battles can prove extremely valuable. Investors acting on such insider information can buy a target company's stock before the announced acquisition bid and then sell when the stock price rises on the basis of the bid, which is generally considerably higher than the going price of the stock. **********Because of the powerful lure of such profits, firms that advise companies on takeover battles are vulnerable to abuse of the inside information they hold, and Skadden, Arps is one of the most important such firms. **********The Skadden, Arps case is but one of an increasing number of insider trading schemes that have led the S.E.C. and the United States Attorney's office to step up enforcement.  Recent cases have led to guilty pleas from, among others, a partner at the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and a vice president of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley & Company, according to Andrew J. Levander, an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District, which includes Wall Street. **********The Skadden, Arps case shows how a group of clerical employees, lured by promises of wealth from canny investors, succumbed to temptation and circumvented their firms' security precautions. **********Two Separate Schemes **********Investigators eventually uncovered two separate insider trading schemes, linked only by their mutual source at Skadden, Arps. Court papers filed by the S.E.C. and the United States Attorney's office outlined the schemes as follows: **********In one, Mr. Petricig, who is 23 years old, sold the 30-year-old Mr. Wallis information about planned corporate takeovers. Eventually, Mr. Petricig began pooling tips with Alfred T. Salvatore Jr., a 40-year-old Skadden, Arps proofreader and word processing operator. **********In the second scheme, Mr. Salvatore and Steven M. Crow, a 29-year- old word processing supervisor at Skadden, Arps, were sharing the tips with two stockbrokers, Aaron L. Lerman and Stephen G. Karanzalis. **********Using the information they obtained from Skadden, Arps, the brokers, Mr. Wallis and Sharon Willey, a veterinary manager who lives with Mr. Wallis, traded on the stock market. **********Their trades included the following corporate takeover battles: the Mesa Petroleum Company's bid for the General American Oil Company of Texas; the Coastal Corporation's bids for the Texas Gas Resources Corporation and the Houston Natural Gas Corporation; the Maryland Cup Company's bid for Fort Howard Paper; Calvin Klein's bid for the Puritan Fashions Corporation; the Williams Companies' bid for the Northwest Energy Company; the Evmar Corporation's bid for the Midlands Energy Company; the Gulf Broadcast Company's bid for the Conwood Corporation; Kelso & Company's bid for U.S. Industries; a leveraged buyout involving Morgan Stanley & Company and Southwest Forest Industries, and a buyout involving the First Boston Corporation and the Joslyn Manufacturing and Supply Company. **********Six Plead Guilty **********Mr. Salvatore, Mr. Crow, Mr. Lerman, Mr. Petricig, Mr. Wallis and Miss Willey have all pleaded guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy or fraud. No criminal charges will be brought against Mr. Karanzalis, although he is negotiating with the S.E.C. on its civil charges against him and plans to leave the brokerage profession, according to his lawyer, Robert J. Costello. **********The other participants in the case either did not return calls or, through their attorneys, declined to comment.  Mr. Salvatore did not return calls left on his answering machine and his attorney, Paul Grand, did not return messages left at his office. **********The following accounts of the cases are based on papers filed in court and interviews with the United States Attorney's office, the executive partner and managing director of Skadden, Arps and an official at the New York Stock Exchange who asked to remain anonymous. **********Kenneth Petricig was a quiet, reserved proofreader at Skadden, Arps, a graduate of Columbia University with an interest in movies, according to his attorney, Barry Fallick. Mr. Petricig's involvement in the case began after he met Mr. Wallis, a driver for Dial-A-Car, a cab service used by Skadden, Arps for employees who worked late. **********Mr. Wallis, who is dark-haired, bearded, a college graduate and, court papers say, something of an expert on the stock market and foreign bank secrecy laws, promised Mr. Petricig $5,000 or more for each profitable tip. **********'I Foolishly Agreed' **********In court, Mr. Petricig described their meeting this way: ''I met, by chance, someone who suggested to me that he could develop a method whereby we could both benefit financially from my knowledge. And I foolishly agreed to it.'' But Mr. Wallis, during his guilty plea, said Mr. Petricig had asked for his phone number. **********After the two had agreed to their insider trading scheme, they often met in Mr. Wallis's cab to discuss potential takeovers. By 1983, Mr. Petricig had begun pooling information with his Skadden, Arps colleague, Mr. Salvatore. **********Mr. Petricig got in touch with Mr. Wallis by calling Mr. Wallis's beeper and dialing in a pay telephone number. Mr. Wallis would then call him back at that number. During these conversations, the two arranged meetings in the cab or at a movie theater on East 34th Street. Miss Willey, who is 31, would sometimes accompany Mr. Wallis, but he said in his guilty plea that she had often waited outside or in a restaurant. **********Mr. Wallis talked to Mr. Petricig knowledgeably about the legal definition of insider trading, referring often to a famous case in which the conviction of a printer of financial documents who used his knowledge to trade in the stock market was overturned. Sometimes he referred to foreign brokerage accounts in code, saying they were in Iowa or Nebraska. **********When Mr. Wallis placed orders for stocks, he often called foreign brokers from pay phones to avoid having his name appear on brokerage records. But he also placed orders with Charles Schwab & Company and Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. **********Meetings Recorded **********Last April, after investigators confronted Mr. Petricig with evidence they had accumulated against him, he began secretly recording his meetings with Mr. Wallis. During a cab ride from Brooklyn to Manhattan, Mr. Wallis gave Mr. Petricig $1,000 as a result of profits he made from trades of Houston Natural Gas.  He also gave Mr. Petricig two guides to Swiss bank accounts. **********In early May, Mr. Wallis told Mr. Petricig that he was planning to go to Switzerland and that ''the only person I would trust is going to be accompanying me.'' The two arranged to meet for what would be the last time, on May 19, in the East Side movie theater. **********While the theater showed ''Romancing the Stone,'' a tale of adventure and intrigue in the Colombian jungle, Mr. Wallis handed Mr. Petricig $2,000. Outside the theater, Federal agents waited. When Mr. Wallis walked out, they arrested him. Then they drove to the Brooklyn apartment of Mr. Wallis and Miss Willey and arrested her, suitcases in hand, before their scheduled flight to Switzerland. They pleaded guilty on Thursday and will be sentenced in September. **********It is not known how much money Mr. Wallis and Miss Willey made from their stock market trades. Mr.  Petricig received a total of $5,000. **********Substantial Profits Suspected **********But Mr. Levander, who was in charge of the United States Attorney's investigation, said he believed the two had made substantial profits. Some of that money could be in foreign bank accounts. Mr. Wallis said in court that he had a bank account with a Bahamas branch of a Swiss bank. **********But information from Skadden, Arps was not flowing only to Mr. Wallis and Miss Willey. Mr. Salvatore, who is balding and of medium height, agreed in 1982 to share information about corporate takeovers with Mr. Lerman, a former Prudential-Bache stockbroker who was then his roommate in an apartment on Irving Place and unemployed at the time. **********Mr. Lerman, who walks with a slight limp, also shared his information with Mr. Karanzalis, who was then a broker with Prudential-Bache. In 1983, Mr. Salvatore recruited Mr. Crow, a word-processing supervisor who was studying for a doctorate. Mr. Crow used the code name ''Barbara.'' **********The two Skadden, Arps employees began collaborating in an effort to break the law firm's coded references to its clients. As one of its security precautions, Skadden, Arps routinely referred to its clients by code names, such as Mozart, and avoided disclosing real names until the evening that legal documents had to be typed and proofread. **********Pooled Information **********Mr. Crow worked the 11 P.M. to 5 A.M. shift, and Mr. Salvatore worked a slightly earlier one. Between shifts, they would meet either in the firm's word-processing center or at bars to pool their information.  First Mr. Salvatore and Mr. Crow would try to identify lawyers who were working on tender offers and get access to their confidential computer files. From these they gathered data on stock prices, numbers of shares outstanding and other relevant information, and passed it on to Mr. Lerman or Mr. Karanzalis, who would be able to identify the companies involved. **********But by the fall of 1983, Skadden, Arps knew that some of its employees were leaking information. The New York Stock Exchange's surveillance division, which uses computers to track stock trades, had noticed in the spring of 1983 a pattern of stock trading before the announcement of several mergers. The same brokers handled these trades, and in every one, the law firm involved was Skadden, Arps. The exchange notified the law firm and the S.E.C., which both began investigations. **********'We Were Outraged' **********Peter Mullen, the executive partner at Skadden, Arps, said the firm had included in its security precautions the requirement that all employees sign a pledge of confidentiality that defines insider trading. ''We lawyers are professionally obligated to hold the confidences of our clients in confidence,'' Mr. Mullen said. ''We were outraged to find out'' that some of the firm's employees were violating that trust, he said. **********Private investigators hired by Skadden, Arps followed Mr. Crow and Mr. Salvatore, stationing themselves near the two men's apartments. They saw Mr. Salvatore make late-night calls from pay phones and leave an apartment with a man who walked with a limp - Mr. Lerman. They clocked their meetings in bars in Greenwich Village and even in the lobby of Skadden, Arps's building at 919 Third Avenue. **********On several occasions last February and March, an investigator watched as Mr. Salvatore threw out a large white garbage bag. The investigator fished one of the bags out and found crumpled pieces of paper that included the firm's secret computer codes, telephone numbers of stockbrokers, names of Skadden, Arps clients and amounts of their tender offers, and analyses of the firm's confidential documents. **********In March 1984, a word-processing supervisor at Skadden, Arps secretly monitored Mr. Crow's work. The supervisor watched as Mr. Crow searched through the firm's coded computer files - files on which he had not been assigned any work. Mr. Crow programmed the computer to search for dollar signs and stopped to read all such references. **********U.S. Agents Move In **********With evidence accumulating, Federal agents moved in on March 14. That morning, a private investigator watched Mr. Salvatore walk out of his apartment to a nearby pay phone, carrying a typewritten slip of paper. **********Later that afternoon, Federal agents arrested Mr. Salvatore and Mr. Crow at Skadden, Arps and Mr. Lerman while he was sleeping in Mr. Salvatore's apartment. Mr. Karanzalis was not arrested or charged with any criminal offenses, although he is facing civil charges filed by the S.E.C. Neither his attorney nor Mr. Levander would say why. **********The four men, court papers state, had agreed to share whatever profits they made in stock trading. When Mr. Salvatore made his guilty plea, he said he had received a total of $8,375 for passing on the information. Mr. Crow received only $500, last February. **********At the same time, court papers said, Mr. Karanzalis paid Mr. Lerman $16,000 for profits connected with the Coastal Corporation's bid for Houston Natural Gas. Court papers do not indicate total profits made by Mr. Lerman or Mr. Karanzalis, although they show that the brokers' clients made substantial profits, which may have yielded handsome commissions. **********After the arrest and guilty pleas of Mr. Crow, Mr. Lerman and Mr. Salvatore, investigators discovered the second plot, involving Mr. Wallis, Mr. Petricig and Miss Willey. When Mr. Salvatore was arrested, he told the United States Attorney's office that Mr. Petricig and he had been sharing information, Mr. Fallick said. Mr. Fallick said he had advised Mr. Petricig to cooperate with the Government, which led to the arrests of Mr. Wallis and Miss Willey. **********Rudolph W. Giuliani, the United States Attorney for the Southern District, said his office and the S.E.C. were aggressively prosecuting insider traders, pressing for tough sentences in an effort to curb the practice. However, he said, many of the insider traders prosecuted have received suspended sentences. **********The S.E.C. set up a special unit under the direction of John M. Fedders to ferret out insider trading, and Mr. Fedders said he believed the commission was having some success in deterring potential abusers. **********''A lot of people got to believe that insider trading was risk-free,'' Mr. Fedders said. ''We are raising the level of risk.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/24/business/advertising-addendum.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-12-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 16, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Addendum", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Addendum", "body_text": " *********** The Mortimer Berkowitz Company is changing its name to the Berkowitz-Van Ingen Company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/26/business/advertising-shearson-tombstones-given-to-albert-frank.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 200, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "; Shearson Tombstones Given to Albert Frank", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; ; Shearson Tombstones Given to Albert Frank", "body_text": " **********In a shoot-out between Albert Frank-Guenther Law and Doremus & Company, Wall Street's best-known agencies, Albert Frank, the smaller, has walked off with the tombstone advertising account of the recently merged Shearson Lehman/American Express.

The emergency spending measure is needed because Congress has thus far approved only 4 of the 13 money bills, or appropriations, that are supposed to be enacted by the start of the fiscal year. **********Maneuver on Anticrime Package **********The House voted 243 to 166 to approve the anticrime package and attach it to the emergency spending measure. The package included new Federal sentencing procedures, preventive detention of defendants considered dangerous, tougher bail and drug laws and a more restrictive insanity defense. **********The measure, sponsored by Representative Hamilton Fish, Republican of upstate New York, was approved by the Senate last February by a vote of 91 to 1. President Reagan has repeatedly urged passage by the House, but its Democratic leaders had steadfastly refused to bring the measure to the floor until Republicans used a procedural tactic to allow consideration of the bill today. **********''This just proves that the Democratic leadership was denying an opportunity for an up or down vote on the President's package, which would pass overwhelmingly,'' said Representative Dan Lungren, Republican of California. **********Bill Has 'Better Chance' **********Representative Robert S. Walker, a Pennsylvania Republican, noted that the White House had threatened to veto the spending bill, which puts Federal spending over Administration budget levels and contains projects of interest to individual Congressmen. **********''The President's probably going to veto a pork bill,'' he said, ''If you put the crime package there, it has a better chance of being enacted into law.'' **********The Senate abortion measure, attached to a different spending bill and approved without debate, would allow the use of Medicaid funds in cases of rape or incest, as well as when the life of the mother was endangered. Under current law, such funds can be used only to save the life of the mother. **********''I don't think anybody wants to stand up in an election year and say that a woman should carry a baby to term when that pregnancy is the result of rape or incest,'' said Senator Lowell P. Weicker, a Connecticut Republican who is chairman of the Appropriation Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education. **********The abortion measure proposed by the subcommittee was approved on a voice vote. It was part of the spending bill for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services that was approved by a vote of 71 to 20. **********The Senate Appropriations Committee had voted 12 to 11 today to keep the current restrictions on abortion, but the committee action was superseded by the full Senate. **********The Senate also voted to ease the existing prohibition on the use of Federal funds to prevent organized school prayer. Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican, initially proposed language providing that ''none of the funds approved shall be used to prevent the implementation of programs of voluntary prayer and meditation in the public schools.'' **********This stricture is in current law. But rather than risk a floor fight, Mr. Helms himself proposed a modification that read, ''None of the funds appropriated shall be used to prevent individual prayer and meditation in the public schools.''  Some Deplore Speed **********Final action on the stop-gap spending bill is considered imperative before the lawmakers can return home. But some members nonetheless deplored both the haste and questioned the necessity of today's action. **********''None of us here thinks that this is the way we should do business, and I deplore it as well,'' Senator Mark O. Hatfield, an Oregon Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said at the panel's meeting. **********The House approved the spending bill by a vote of 316 to 91. But there were expressions of dismay, like Senator Hatfield's, after the House adopted seven amendments that added money for special projects. Some of these funds could be dropped in conference with the Senate. **********Administration officials have warned that the President would veto the bill if Congress, adhering to past practices, loaded it up with pork-barrel projects. The Administration regards as excessive the largest of the seven additional sums, $15.4 billion for water projects. **********''This is the inevitable Christmas tree bill, the last train leaving the staton,'' said Representative Gillis W. Long, a Louisiana Democrat who is chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. **********But the House also reduced some funding, cutting by two percent the funds for all foreign aid programs except those earmarked for Israel and Egypt. The vote was 273 to 134. Representative George E. Brown Jr., a Colorado Republican, estimated that the reduction would save the Government $280 million. **********In a separate action House and Senate conferees approved a $932 billion budget resolution for the new fiscal year, with a deficit of $181.2 billion. House approval of the conference report will constitute approval of an increase in the Federal debt limit, which is a companion resolution. That will obviate the need for a separate debt-ceiling vote in the House, which has been more resistant than the Senate to approving this perennial measure. **********Funds for Special Projects **********Both the House and Senate spending bills were replete with funds for special projects. The House approved, 336-64, a proposal to incorporate a $15.4 billion water projects bill. **********The House bill also included $159.5 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for fiscal year 1987, the level already set for fiscal year 1986; an amendment to ensure that Food Stamp beneficiaries are able to purchase an adequate diet under the Agriculture Department's ''Thrifty Food Plan,'' and $50 million to the states to train child-care staffs. **********The Senate committee bill also included $72.9 million for 23 public works projects, $30 million below the House level. The bill also included $30 million for new military construction, $9.3 million for reclamation projects, $13 million for environmental projects, $75.7 million for the Developmental Disabilities Act and $50 million for refugee resettlement. The committee bill also provides funds for the ''Thrifty Food Plan'' and would authorize the Small Business Administration to guarantee repayment of pollution control bonds."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/16/business/finance-new-issues-foreign-issue-included-in-treasury-note-sale.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 205, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES ; Foreign Issue Included In Treasury Note Sale", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES ; Foreign Issue Included In Treasury Note Sale", "body_text": " **********The Treasury announced plans yesterday to sell on Nov. 28 about $6.75 billion of new five-year, two-month notes in the domestic market and an additional $1 billion of notes with the same maturity to foreign investors.

Yakimetz. **********Mr. Yakimetz, 47 years old, held a middle-level position in the Office of Program Planning and Coordination, which makes long-range plans for the administration of the United Nations. **********According to United Nations rules, the Soviet Government should have had no control over Mr. Yakimetz. According to Article 100 of the Charter, a Secretariat employee is forbidden to ''seek or receive instruction from any government.'' **********Yet, in interviews here recently, Mr. Yakimetz detailed what is privately conceded by diplomats and officials: that Soviet citizens working in the Secretariat are expected to provide services to their Government.   'Under Mission's Orders' **********''I functioned directly under the mission's orders,'' he said. ''I did not lift a finger without the Soviet Mission knowing about it. We might be asked to analyze a certain report or to prepare materials for a particular agenda item at the General Assembly. You can be asked to spy on your division at the U.N. Certainly, you are asked to report on transfers and promotions, to find out where there might be chances to get in more Soviet employees.'' **********For two years, Mr. Yakimetz was on a six-member committee that advised the appointments and promotions board of the Secretariat. In that post, he said, he operated directly under instructions from the Soviet Mission. **********''It was my direct responsibility to see that every Russian proposed by the Government was admitted,'' he said. Another obligation was to block action on people the mission deemed undesirable. **********Mr. Yakimetz, a former physics instructor at the Moscow Physical-Technical Institute in a Moscow suburb, said Soviet employees were asked to collect scientific and technical data, and for that purpose he joined the American Physical Society. **********''I sent a lot of stuff to Moscow,'' he said. ''They were pretty interested in it. As a member of the American Physical Society, I received newsletters and magazines.''  Products on Strategic List **********He added that, as a member of the Secretariat, he communicated with American companies involved in high technology.  Not one of the papers he saw was secret. But, he said, ''some of the products, I presume, are on the strategic list, because some of the manufacturers I corresponded with were among the companies that were selling strategic equipment to Moscow through third countries.'' **********A spokesman for the Soviet Mission, Anatoly N. Khudyakov, said he had no comment on Mr. Yakimetz's remarks. **********Mr. Yakimetz said he defected because he feared that the Soviet Government was trying to cut short his career at the United Nations. He said that, in late 1982 and early 1983, the personnel director of the Soviet Mission pressed him to return to Moscow and train a replacement. He was granted political asylum in February 1983.   Contract Extension Denied **********Last December, under pressure from the Soviet Mission, the office of Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar refused to extend Mr. Yakimetz's contract. A spokesman for Mr. Perez de Cuellar said that Mr. Yakimetz, having been temporarily assigned to the United Nations by his Government, could not stay against its will. **********Most Western employees of the Secretariat are private citizens, although many have earlier served in their governments. But citizens of most Communist countries are employed by their governments and are detached to work for the Secretariat. **********Some senior Secretariat officials concede that the Russians do not technically adhere to the rules on the independence of international civil servants, and staff members with knowledge of Soviet practices say that, in effect, even when Eastern bloc citizens serve in the Secretariat they are treated as if they are still members of their own government bureaucracies. **********Mr. Yakimetz appealed the decision of the Secretary General's office to a three-person administrative tribunal headed by a Hungarian. Last month, the tribunal, meeting in Geneva, denied the request. **********In the interview, Mr. Yakimetz said that he had spent nearly 15 years pursuing his career. ''I see my life as completely disrupted by this decision,'' he said. ''Of course, the Soviet Government will be glad to hear that.'' **********Mr. Yakimetz left his job when his contract renewal was rejected by Mr. Perez de Cuellar. Since then, he said, his only income has come from occasional translation jobs.

Now Hewitt Associates, management consultants, has quantified those complaints, and has taken a look at how they translate into action. **********The firm surveyed 1,185 companies of all sizes and in all industries, and found that they are indeed spending more on health care these days. The companies said they expected their average medical claims cost per employee to hit $1,498 this year, up 9 percent from last year. **********But employees will be paying a bigger share of their own bills from now on. The Hewitt survey, which asked companies to compare their 1984 health benefits with those they were offering in 1982, showed that 63 percent of companies now ask employees to pay a deductible (an initial amount of the bill) for all hospital expenses, up from 30 percent in 1982. And the deductibles are getting higher - 38 percent of the companies that require one have set it at $150 or more, while only 9 percent asked employees to pick up that much in 1982. **********For now, employers are still trying to shield their people from truly catastrophic medical expenses. About 89 percent (up from 80 percent two years ago) put a cap - typically $1,500 - on the medical bills that an employee must pay in a given year. Full coverage kicks back in after that amount. Moreover, many companies are offering bonuses to employees who spot overcharges on particularly hefty hospital bills. Uniroyal, for one, gives its employees 50 percent of overcharges that they find. **********Still, for minor illnesses, fewer employees are home free after paying the initial deductible these days. In 1982, 67 percent of the surveyed companies picked up the full cost of hospitalization after the deductible was paid. Today, nearly half pay only 80 percent of hospital tabs. **********The purse strings have been tightened on insurance premiums, too. Single people have to pay part of the premiums at 40 percent of the companies, up from 31 percent in 1982. Companies requiring contributions for family coverage rose to 69 percent from 62 percent in the same period. **********In many cases, employees can no longer choose their own doctors and hospitals. Health Maintenance Organizations, which require a hefty annual fee but which make available to members the services of many specialists, have turned into a bonanza for employers. In 1982, the Ford Motor Company saved $5 million in insurance premiums by enrolling about 19,000 employees - only 8.5 percent of its work force - in H.M.O.'s. A Stanford University study says that there are 280 H.M.O.'s operating nationwide, with a total enrollment of 12.5 million people. The university expects that, by 1990, some 50 million people will belong to them. **********Preferred-provider organizations also are gaining favor with employers. These are groups of doctors and hospitals that contract with employers or insurance companies to provide care for prenegotiated (usually discounted) fees. Such arrangements are illegal in about half the states because they restrict a patient's freedom of choice. Still, the American Medical Care and Review Association's directory lists 70 operating preferred-provider groups, 37 about to start, and 40 being formed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/12/world/around-the-world-un-chief-is-in-moscow-for-talk-on-afghanistan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

The appointment has stirred a level of curiosity and hope rarely seen in one of the world's few surviving state churches. **********The new Bishop, Dr. Krister Stendahl, is a Swede who became an American citizen while teaching at Harvard. He is preparing to move assume his new position at a time when many Swedes consider the church only a cultural artifact. Although the Archbishop of Uppsala is technically the head of the Church of Sweden, the Bishop of Stockholm, by virtue of heading the diocese of the capital, probably holds the most visible church post. **********Some church activists argue that a tax-supported, privileged church can no longer be justified and that Christians will not have the incentive to spur a renewal of the church until it gives up its financially secure place. **********While stopping short of total agreement with this, Dr. Stendahl said in a telephone interview from his summer home in Nantucket that ''Swedes have never really been challenged on whether they should be members of the church at all.'' **********One of his immediate goals is to enhance the role of the laity. He said the church has been so controlled by the clergy that, unlike the situation in the United States, lay people rarely refer to it as ''my church.'' **********At stake is the spiritual health of the church rather than its material welfare. Physically, churches so dominate this city that its skyline looks like an exhibit of deluxe fountain pens, and 95 percent of the eight million Swedes are born into the Church of Sweden. **********But fewer than 5 percent of Swedes attend church or are active in any way. Increasingly, the church is used only for rites of passage: funerals, weddings and baptisms. So lax are church standards that baptism is not required for membership if one parent is already a member. A half million members have never been baptized. **********In talks with active laymen, clergy and church officials it becomes clear that they believe Swedish society, to a great extent, has gone its own way without looking to the church as its compass. While a reshaping of values and moral standards has gone ahead, many church officials think the church has stood idly by, largely losing its sense of purpose and meaning. **********''For a long time, the church held on to its past glory,'' said the Rev. Goran Beijer, chaplain of the parish of St. James in the heart of Stockholm, ''and it didn't react quickly enough to these changes.'' **********Soren Ekstrom, who oversees church affairs for the Social Democratic Government of Prime Minister Olof Palme, commented: **********''In Sweden, the church cannot be part of the state if it wants to be respected. If we want to be the church that is needed in the future, we have to be a free church.'' **********Five years ago the Government submitted a proposal to end the compact, which includes a provision that Parliament has final approval over the selection of bishops for the 13 dioceses. Despite backing from most church officials and the Social Democrats, the proposal was defeated because of opposition from local church councils. **********Meanwhile, there are reports that young people are growing more receptive to religious ideas and belief. In the church, the question is whether the church can respond to this interest. Many people say the church-state connection makes the church so comfortable that it has no need to win converts or loyalties. **********Dr. Stendahl, whose wry humor salts his scholarship, leans toward church independence. Many Swedes look to him to bring the lessons gained from his experience in a religiously pluralistic American culture to the problems that beset the Swedish church, but he is cautious about imposing his answers. **********''This has to be worked out in a totally different atmosphere from that in America,'' Dr. Stendahl said.

Among other things, the discussion will touch on trade in autos, copyright issues, access to Japan's high-technology markets and ''transparency,'' or more disclosure of what is being considered by the Japanese Government. **********The two leaders are scheduled to sit down together in Los Angeles on Jan. 2 for their fifth encounter since Mr. Nakasone came to power in late 1982. The importance the White House attaches to shaping an overall strategy was underscored by the decision to convene the entire Cabinet. **********Accord on Steel **********Meanwhile, American and Japanese negotiators in Washington agreed that imports of Japanese finished steel would not exceed 5.8 percent of the United States market. **********American officials said they expect that President Reagan will urge Mr. Nakasone to put into effect policies for faster economic growth in Japan, so as to draw in more imports, including goods from the United States. In July, August and September, Japan's economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 percent, a pace Washington regards as too slow. **********In support of their contention that Japan can reasonably be expected to import more, American officials assert that with the world's second- largest economy, after the United States, Japan imports only about as much as Switzerland, a far smaller country. And while the United States absorbs 52 percent of the imports of developing countries, Japan buys 8 percent, they contend. **********''The trade deficit is threatening to poison the overall relationship with Japan,'' said Clyde V. Prestowitz, counselor to Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and the top departmental aide on Japan issues. **********'Rend the Fabric' **********''The European Community and Korea have similar problems, so it's not just the United States,'' he added, noting that ''this is something that could rend the fabric of the whole trading system.'' **********The United States trade deficit with Japan is estimated at $35 billion for 1984, but in recent months it has been running at a rate equivalent to $50 billion a year. **********Japanese diplomats here said that they, too, were concerned about the deficit and were bracing for more pressures from the Administration. **********These officials said that Japan's desire to be ''cooperative'' was behind the steel trade agreement, which was reached after only three days of negotiations in Washington. **********The First to Settle **********Japan thus became the first country to settle on quotas with the United States under President Reagan's Sept. 10 pledge to cut total imports of finished steel to 18.5 percent of the domestic market. Two weeks ago, the United States acted unilaterally to bar imports of European pipe and tube steel to 5.9 percent of the American market. **********Some American officials and members of Congress have been toying with the idea of imposing a 15 percent surcharge on imports from Japan, as a dramatic way of both cutting the deficit and increasing revenues. **********On the basis of more than $70 billion of imports from Japan, such a measure would raise more than $10 billion. **********According to reports from Tokyo, the Japanese Government has been considering an export surtax that would make Japanese exports more costly in world markets. Such a tax, however, would be pocketed by the Japanese Treasury. Under the import surcharge idea, the United States Treasury would get the money. **********However, both the United States trade representative, Bill Brock, and Commerce Secretary Baldrige have come out publicly against such measures, warning that they would undermine the rules of international trade. **********One of the key American grievances is the reluctance of the Japanese to open up their markets to American telecommunications and other sophisticated products where the United States has a competitive advantage.

Mr. Gemayel is widely expected to do so, but is said to be seeking guarantees from Syria in return that it will eventually withdraw its troops from Lebanon. **********Attending part of today's negotiating session was Rafik al-Hariri, the Saudi mediator who has been trying to arrange an agreement between Syria and Lebanon that would involve canceling the May 17 accord for a withdrawal of Israeli and Syrian troops from Lebanon and for joint Israeli-Lebanese security arrangements in southern Lebanon. **********Mr. Hariri, who also met with Mr. Gemayel Wednesday night, returned to Damascus this evening to present the latest Lebanese positions. **********Meanwhile, anti-Government militiamen and Lebanese Army troops loyal to the Gemayel Government exchanged occasional machine gun, mortar and artillery fire in the Beirut area and in the nearby mountains. **********Reports from Damascus quoted Prince Bandar ibn Sultan of Saudi Arabia as saying at a news conference after an eight-hour meeting with Lebanese and Syrian representatives that negotiators had agreed to a new cease-fire for Beirut, to take effect at 11 A.M. Friday.

Most of the new troops are Christian, the official said.

Some Western officials here have said that number would be difficult to confirm; other estimates of Palestinian strenth have been substantially lower. **********The Druse radio station disputed the Israeli radio report and said the objective of the Israeli raid was to provide support for the Lebanese Army loyal to Mr. Gemayel. **********Before the Saudi mediator, Mr. Hariri, returned to Damascus, Mr. Gemayel met for three hours with key Christian leaders, including his father, Pierre Gemayel, the founder of the Christian Phalangist Party, and former President Camille Chamoun. Prominent Christians have continued to oppose any deal with Syria. **********In addition to canceling the May 17 accord, the new plan, which Syria has approved, calls for a new Lebanese Cabinet, including a Prime Minister acceptable to Syria, the resumption of reconciliation talks in Geneva, and changes in the Lebanese political system that would give Moslems more influence. **********At the airport, as the marine pullback continued, there appeared to be some confusion over who would take over the Americans' airport positions. **********Gen. Jim R. Joy, the commander of the 22d Marine Amphibious Unit, the core of the American force in Beirut, told reporters that the marines were planning to turn their positions over to Lebanese Army troops loyal to the command of Gen. Ibrahim Tannous. **********When pressed by reporters as to how loyalist units would be able to take over the base, which is virtually surrounded by anti-Government Moslem militiamen, General Joy said an agreement had been reached with the various parties involved. **********When Ali Hamadan, a spokesman for the Shiite Moslem militia known as Amal, was asked if any agreement had been reached, he said security at the airport would be handled by the Sixth Brigade, which has declared its neutrality and is not seen as loyal to Mr. Gemayel's Government. **********One official said tonight that although General Joy's comments appeared \"premature,\" discussions were proceeding to have the airport position turned over to another brigade that was still loyal to the army's central command, but would also be acceptable to the Shiite Moslem militia. **********General Joy indicated, however, that the bulk of the combat forces still on shore, roughly 1,100 men, would not be moved out to the ships until final arrangements had been worked out for guarding the airport.

Other citations were trimmed. **********Such censorship is a fact of life here. But in this case, the determination of exactly who is no longer who - or who is who but with epaulets stripped - is made possible by the existence of another book, Who's Who in Poland. It was printed in English two years ago by the Who's Who Company of Zurich in collaboration with Interpress, a Polish Government information agency. **********That book, printed in Italy and not subject to Polish censorship, formed the basis for the expurgated Polish edition that Interpress has just issued. It invites comparisons, which reveal, often by nuance, what kind of subjects and what kind of people are now not acceptable, at least not in Polish.   Walesa the 'Electrician' There is, for example, Lech Walesa. In the English edition, which was to a great extent collated by the same Government publishers that issued the new dictionary, he is described as ''electrician, trade union leader.'' **********In the Polish version this has been shortened to ''electrician.'' On the other hand, the Polish edition does add the information that Mr. Walesa won the Nobel Peace Prize in the year after the English-language book appeared. **********Then there are people like Jacek Kuron and Adam Michnik, who just came out of prison after two and a half years. They are listed in the earlier book as professors of history and founders of KOR, a Solidarity advisory group. **********They are not listed in the new book. Nor is Bogdan Lis, who was the No. 2 man in the Solidarity underground when he was arrested in June. Mr. Lis, who is still in prison, was described in the English edition as ''mechanic, trade union leader.'' **********Others who were somebodies in the English work but are nobodies in the Polish one are Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, the Silesian Solidarity leader who came out of prison two weeks ago, and Bronislaw Geremek, a medieval history scholar and Walesa adviser. **********Even with the deletions, the publication of the directory - listing the names, addresses and in some cases telephone numbers of Government officials and some Government critics - is very unusual in an East bloc Communist nation, where telephone books are sometimes classified secrets. **********Along with the Sunday broadcasts of Roman Catholic mass on the Government radio, private agriculture and regular news briefings for foreign journalists, the publication of the Who's Who, even in its expurgated form, is being cited by Poles close to the Government as a sign of incremental liberalization. **********By the same token, Government critics see the new edition as a retreat from 1982, when the Interpress publishers could and did lend their imprimatur to a book that listed Mr. Kuron, Mr. Michnik and others among Poland's most prominent figures.   Approval Reportedly Sought **********Though it was widely anticipated that the censors would excise such information, publishing sources here said the new book's compilers tried to get the censors' approval for even spare sketches of dissidents - only to be told that they would not be allowed to list the addresses and telephone numbers ''that would enable people to get in touch with our enemies.'' **********In addition to the question of which people are in print or out, sanctioned or purged, the small type of both volumes also contains much human drama. **********Jacek Maziarski was described in the 1982 book as an award-winning journalist, critic and author. The Polish edition reprints the same information but adds, ''owner of a used-book shop.'' Mr. Maziarski, in the midst of the tentative attempts at democratic pluralism, decided to leave Government-controlled journalism. Before he opened the bookstore, he paid for an advertisement in a Warsaw paper that said, ''Journalist seeks honest employment.'' **********Then there is the sense of betrayal and strain in the separate entries of Dariusz Fikus and Jerzy Urban, once co- authors. Mr. Fikus was on the editorial board of the liberal weekly Polityka until he left the paper, turned in his Communist Party card and became the second in command of the journalists union associated with Solidarity. **********Mr. Urban, as his citation makes clear, was never a party member. He left his association with Polityka to become the chief spokesman for the Government of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.   Heat and Passion **********Despite their rather cold, telephone-book typography, the two items still manage to suggest the heat and passion of human affairs. In the biographical sketch offered by Mr. Fikus there is a reference to a book, ''Society in Transit,'' that he recalled having written, with Mr. Urban as his co-author, in 1969. **********For his part, Mr. Urban does not list that book among his published works. **********As for cultural figures, perhaps the most notable gap concerns Tadeusz Konwicki, one of Poland's best-known writers, who is not mentioned in either directory. According to sources at Interpress, Mr. Konwicki did not bother to fill out a questionnaire in time to be included in the 1982 book. **********For the Polish volume, he submitted a sketch with a full list of his works, including ''The Polish Complex'' and ''A Minor Apocalypse,'' both translated and published abroad but banned here. **********The sources said this entry, along with all the others, was sent to the censors, who struck out the references to the banned books. Mr. Konwicki was asked to approve the remaining section but refused, saying a life's work cannot be trimmed to conform to the requirements of political censors. The entire item was ordered dropped. **********If there are obvious omissions in the book, there are also inclusions of people that some Poles consider dubious because the people in question apparently no longer live here. **********For example, Janusz Glowacki, a once-popular playwright, was included although he lives in New York, where his play ''Cinders'' was performed not long ago at the Public Theater. **********The new book also includes Jerzy Grotowski, whose experimental theater of poverty based in Wroclaw drew worldwide attention. A few months ago, the company disbanded with the announcement that it had been left leaderless by the director who, the actors said, had gone to California."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/19/world/around-the-world-soviet-defense-minister-still-issuing-orders.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Defense Minister Still Issuing Orders", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Soviet Defense Minister Still Issuing Orders", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Defense Minister, Dmitri F.

A police spokesman described the encounter as ''heavy.'' **********The police also reported finding two unidentified bodies of black men in Soweto, Johannesburg's main black satellite township. **********The deaths coincided with another day of unrest among students and black township residents elsewhere in the country. The violence provided a grim counterpoint to the authorities' avowed efforts to put racial change into effect in this divided nation. **********In Cape Town, meanwhile, President P. W. Botha opened South Africa's first Parliament to include nonwhite people. Addressing an assembly that includes people of Indian and mixed racial descent, but excludes the black majority, he said, ''Our gathering today indicates a continuation along the road we took to create a community of peace, prosperity and justice on the southern tip of Africa and to respect the self-determination of population groups and peoples.''  Police Offer No Numbers **********The police, according to their spokesmen, used rubber bullets, tear gas and shotguns against miners who rioted overnight at Westonaria, stoning and burning buildings. **********The spokesmen declined to give details of the number of dead, saying ''clearing up'' was continuing, 14 hours after the clashes were said to have taken place. Some 30,000 to 40,000 black miners stayed away from work Monday in a pay dispute with employers, a move that was viewed as an inital muscle flexing by black gold miners. The differences were resolved today when the miners accepted a compromise offer on vacation allowances. **********However, a spokesmen for the employers, one of them the Anglo-American Corporation, said more than 350 gold miners were injured at mines in Welkom, south of Johannesburg, and Roodepoort, just outside the city, when the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets Monday and today. **********Neville Huxham, spokesman for Anglo-American in Johannesburg, said the police were called to the Western Holdings mine near Welkom after a night of ''intimidation and picketing.'' **********''Unfortunately,'' he said, ''numerous injuries were sustained in this action, and more than 250 workers were treated at the mine hospital in Welkom, many with fractures and wounds resulting from rubber bullets. Of the 250 injured, he said, about 100 were admitted to hospital, 2 were in intensive care and 11 underwent operations.   Mainstay of Economy **********Despite its current, depressed price, gold has long been the mainstay of the South African economy, and Johannesburg, a city of high-rises built over rich veins of the metal, is fringed with pale pyramids of gold-bearing debris from mining operations. The emblems of great wealth, concentrated in the hands of white-run conglomerates, lie on the approaches to the black satellite of Soweto, home to up to two million and the scene, in recent days, of capricious unrest. **********Since mid-August, South Africa has presented two seemingly irreconcilable images. The white authorities have pressed forward with the new Constitution, which offers people of Indian and mixed-race descent a limited political voice. **********At the same time, those opposed to the new Constitution, who argue that it entrenches the system of racial separation that underpins every aspect of life here have been locked in a gathering confrontation with the authorities.   A Harsh Reminder **********In townships south of Johannesburg, more than 40 people have died in the upheavals, far fewer than in the riots of 1976-77 that spread from Soweto and claimed over 500 lives, but nonetheless a harsh reminder to the white authorities that their concept of change has not appeased the black majority, which forms 73 percent of the population. **********The issues prompting the unrest have varied from rent increases to pay grievances, but seem to reflect a wider dissatisfaction among those who see themselves as spurned by the white authorities under the new Constitution. **********When Mr Botha addressed the new Parliament today, deputies of three races crammed into a paneled chamber with green benches that, hitherto, had been a white preserve. **********Henceforth, however, the deputies of different colors will sit in separate chambers, emphasizing, in the view of its critics, the racial nature of the new Constitution. **********The arrangement gives Mr Both, formerly the Prime Minister, potentially authoritarian powers and insures continued control by the Afrikaners, the dominant white group of 2.8 million people. **********Under the new Constitution, the influence of nonwhites is severely circumscribed so that they may only make final decisions on what are termed their ''own affairs,'' such as the day-to- day running of educational and health services, but not on overall policy.   Support for 'Homelands' **********In his address, President Botha acknowledged the exclusion of black people from the new Constitution and indicated continued commitment to one of the cornerstones of his country's racial policies - the ''homelands'' to which black people are allocated according to their ethnic heritage. **********Mr. Botha, in a break with previous Afrikaner practice, has said urbanized black people must be accommodated, tacitly acknowledging the failure of apartheid - as the overall edifice of racial and ethnic division is called - to absorb all those black people living in ''white'' South Africa.

''Here in the Ivory Coast,'' he said, ''one needn't worry about such things. Here we have calm and stability always.'' **********If the official's tone was a trifle gloating, that might be understandable. The Ivory Coast and Nigeria have long been engaged in a kind of David-and-Goliath rivalry. **********Nigeria has tropical Africa's largest population and economy and is arguably the continent's most important nation. But the Ivory Coast has long been cited as one of modern Africa's rare success stories, a peaceful and attractive country with a vibrant economy. **********Based on those attributes, the country's capital city of Abidjan has increasingly outdistanced its competitors - including the Nigerian capital of Lagos - as a regional center. **********Confronting Two Crises **********Recently, however, an energy crisis and a financial crisis have descended upon the Ivory Coast at the same time. If not dealt with effectively, business people and economists say, both the capital and the country could lose the special status they have earned over the generation since independence from France in 1960. **********The most visible of the Ivory Coast's problems is the shortage of electricity in Abidjan and other sections of the country. The cause is the drought that now plagues more than two-thirds of the countries in Africa. **********The Government here relied almost entirely on hydroelectric power and prepared no alternative plans as the water level in the dams steadily declined. As a result, most homes and businesses now have electricity for only a fraction of the day, and industrial production has fallen as much as 50 percent. **********Silence From the President **********The Ivory Coast's President since independence, Felix Houphou\"et-Boigny, 78 years old, has yet to make any public statement on the energy crisis. European diplomats say that does not mean he is unconcerned about the problem. **********''He's livid about it,'' one diplomat said. ''Building this country up into what it is today has been his life's work and he's not about to let the place crumble down.'' **********But energy experts here see no short-term solution. The Government has purchased four oil-fired, 25- megawatt turbines from the French concern Alsthom-Atlantique. Two of them arrived recently, but will not be in operation until March at least. The other two will arrive several months later. **********The four turbines together will supply only about a third of Abidjan's power needs, however, and some of the hydroelectric turbines that are now working overtime will have to be shut down for maintenance when the new ones begin turning. **********Adding to the Debt **********The new turbines, diplomatic sources say, will cost the Ivory Coast between $20 million and $25 million, all to be financed through French banks. **********''They got a good deal,'' said an American economist who had hoped to see the sales go to a company in the United States. **********Even so, those who keep the Ivory Coast's books cannot be entirely sanguine about watching the new figures pile up on the wrong side of the ledger. The Ivory Coast's total indebtedness is estimated at $7 billion, a fairly high figure for a country of about 8.5 million people. **********In December, Mr. Houphou\"et- Boigny asked that the debts be rescheduled, and a series of closed-door meetings is being held in London, where it is expected that a refinancing package will eventually be negotiated. The President ''was very reluctant to do it,'' a Western banker said. ''But it had to be done. It's the only way out.'' **********Reasons for Financial Squeeze **********Economists say that the Ivory Coast ran short of money for three reasons. First, prices fell for its principal exports, cocoa and coffee. Second, the dollar soared, exacerbating the cost of debt servicing. And third, the French franc - to which the country's currency is pegged - has been slipping. **********French, American, British and Japanese banks are involved in the rescheduling talks, and a team from the International Monetary Fund was recently here to study the situation. **********''It's a long and complicated process,'' a senior Western diplomat said. ''It's likely to take at least six months.'' In the meantime, foreign business people here say that their companies are not making new investments or bringing out new equipment.   'No Big Pullouts So Far' **********But there appear to be few if any companies that are deserting the Ivory Coast for other parts of Africa. ''There have been no big pullouts so far,'' said Frederic J. Gaynor, the commercial attache at the United States Embassy here. ''But the pace has slowed. Businessmen are tending to take a wait-and-see attitude.'' **********Another Western economist suggested that those businesses that are turning a reasonable profit here are not about to give up just yet. **********''It's difficult doing business here,'' said an American who has lived in Abidjan for a dozen years. ''And it seems to be getting more so. But name a better place in West Africa to live and work. If you're going to be in West Africa, Abidjan is still basically the only game in town.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/13/business/end-for-pound-note-and-halfpenny.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 422, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "End for Pound Note and Halfpenny", "print_headline": "End for Pound Note and Halfpenny", "body_text": " **********Britain announced today the demise of its one- pound note and its 704-year-old halfpenny. **********Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson also said that the current 20- pound note would be replaced with a newer version that would be more difficult to forge. **********The halfpenny - pronounced ha'penny and also known as the ''tiddler'' - has been on Mr. Lawson's list for extinction for some time. Thanks to inflation, it has for several years cost more to make than it is worth. It will cease to be legal tender on Dec. 31. **********Handful of Transactions **********First minted as a silver coin in 1280, the halfpenny is now used for only a handful of grocery items. Transacting business successfully with the tiny coin requires better than average eye-hand coordination and there are doubtlessly untold thousands lost in the deepest corners of purses and pockets. **********''Most people are glad to get rid of them,'' Mr. Lawson said last February. The delay in ending the halfpenny's long run arose from fears that raising prices to the nearest penny would contribute to inflation. The Treasury now believes that so few transactions will be affected that there will be no measurable impact. **********The one-pound note is a monetary youngster by comparison, having been introduced in 1914 to replace the gold sovereign. It is a victim of its inherent frailty. The average life span of the note is 10 months, compared with a predicted 40 years for the small but thick metal alloy pound coin introduced last year. **********Not an Immediate Success **********The new coin was not an immediate success, although it can be used in machines issuing tickets on London's subways and many other vending machines. However, it is a boon to the blind and is now increasingly accepted. **********The Bank of England has already cut back on the printing of new pound notes. The bank will stop altogether at the end of the year, saving Britain $3.8 million next year, according to the Treasury.

Mr. d'Aubuisson, a cashiered army officer, rose to prominence in 1982 as the head of a new party, the far-right National Republican Alliance. His backers, primarily the landed oligarchy, were determined to repossess their land and save the country from what they viewed as Mr. Duarte's Communist tendencies. **********In many ways, the campaign messages of Mr. Duarte and Mr. d'Aubuisson, front-runners in a field of six, are the same as they have always been. Mr. Duarte sees himself as the sole democratic leader who can consolidate the changes and deal with the leftist insurgents. Mr. d'Aubuisson is more concerned with eradicating the guerrillas rather than talking to them, and emphasizes the importance of a healthy economy over economic changes.   U.S. Officials Are Worried **********The sharp differences in their political views have American officials worried that a victory by either man could polarize the country. But as the March 25 election nears, both the army and the American Embassy seem resigned to a contest between the two, **********Since neither is expected to win more than 50 percent of the vote, a runoff contest between them is expected early in May. In the elections for a Constituent Assembly in 1982, the Christian Democrats won 40 percent of the vote and d'Aubuisson supporters 29 percent. **********Mr. Duarte is trying to mend his relationship with the army and the private sector and the military seems to have softened its criticism of him in the last month. The United States Embassy, which has found his combativeness little to its liking, has also been more supportive of him recently. **********It was the embassy and the army that headed off a d'Aubuisson presidency in April 1982. At that time, a coalition of conservative parties in the Constituent Assembly seemed prepared to name the former army officer, who has been linked to death squads, as provisional President.   'Stolen' Victory Is Resented **********This time the embassy seems to want to avoid such a delicate situation. A high-ranking United States official said members of the National Republican Alliance, which is known as Arena, had hinted that ''they won't be as complacent'' as they were when ''the electoral victory was stolen from them by the United States in 1982.'' **********Late last year some embassy officials promoted the candidacy of Francisco Jose Guerrero of the National Reconciliation Party. They viewed him as an acceptable alternative because he represented a more moderate approach. But Mr. Guerrero has the disadvantage of being associated with a party that was responsible for decades of corrupt military rule and Salvadorans have not responded enthusiastically to his candidacy. **********Mr. Duarte and Mr. d'Aubuisson seem aware of where their competition lies and have honed their campaign speeches accordingly. Mr. d'Aubuisson's speeches are full of anti-Duarte barbs. An Arena campaign worker said Mr. d'Aubuisson's message could be distilled into a single sentence: ''He is against Commmunism and Duarte is a Communist.'' **********''It is a very simple message,'' the worker said, ''and it is appealing because everyone is against Communism.'' **********So far, Mr. d'Aubuisson has given no specifics on how he would end the war and pull the country out of its economic slump. But it does not seem to matter. He flirts with the women, jokes with the men and plays with the children. **********Where Mr. d'Aubuisson himself fails to engage Salvadorans, his organization is at work. The party seems determined to paint the trunk of every tree in El Salvador with its blue, white and red colors. Throughout western El Salvador, where there are numerous farming cooperatives, Arena has swept through with brushes and buckets of paint. **********Although Mr. Duarte has won the endorsement of the country's largest labor union, his party's green and white colors are nowhere to be seen on the western farming cooperatives and few report he has been there. **********His crowds in the countryside are sometimes smaller than Mr. d'Aubuisson's and they generally seem less caught up in what he is saying. He opens his 15-minute campaign speech with a rebuttal of Mr. d'Aubuisson's sharp words and charges that such polemics is evidence that his opponent is desperate. Most of his speech, however, sounds the ''let's work together'' theme.   Soured Relationships **********Mr. Duarte began the campaign with many army officials and business leaders firmly against him. He alienated those two sectors when as junta president he blamed them for El Salvador's problems. Much of his campaigning is now directed at mending the relationships. **********Some army officials seem to be responding to the campaign or, as some Salvadoran political analysts and politicians suggest, are looking at Mr. Duarte as the lesser of two evils. **********While the Reagan Administration's campaign against right-wing violence fell far short of what many Salvadorans had hoped for, it did make many army officials wonder what will happen to United States aid if Mr. d'Aubuisson is elected.  ''There are a significant number of officers who consider d'Aubuisson to be a liability.'' a Salvadoran political analyst said. **********The subtle turn against Mr. d'Aubuisson does not mean the army is any more enthusiastic about Mr. Duarte. If he is elected, everyone expects him to have serious problems with the conservative military. **********But some politicians believe Mr. Duarte is well aware of the need for care. ''He is not as wild or crazy as he used to be,'' a politician from a moderate party said. ''He understands that the army and the private sector won't stand for it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/10/business/mexico-to-sell-companies.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexico to Sell Companies", "print_headline": "Mexico to Sell Companies", "body_text": " **********The Government will sell off 339 companies swept up in a 1982 bank nationalization, but will retain control of 128 other companies seized in the takeover, a Government spokesman said today. **********Carlos Sales Gutierrez, under secretary in charge of the nationalized banks, told reporters that the Government would keep control of 128 companies ''in which the banks had priority participation.'' **********He said the mechanisms of the sell- off will be spelled out Monday, but added that the former shareholders would have preference in buying the shares in the denationalized companies. **********Mr. Sales Gutierrez said the total value of the 339 companies, which was set at $241 million on Aug. 31, 1982, the day before the nationalization, now stood at $470 million. **********The Government of former President Jose Lopez Portillo nationalized the banks, accusing them of capital flight that had cost the country $22 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/27/business/economic-scene-the-president-s-strategy-for-84.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1984-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 863, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; The President's Strategy for '84", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; The President's Strategy for '84", "body_text": " **********''D ID I say something funny?''

Baker Jr., to name representatives to work with the Administration on a ''bipartisan deficit reduction plan.'' **********The President's move was described by his own staff as an electoral strategy for sharing guilt with Democrats. Since the Democrats, with Representative Dan Rostenkowsi, the Democratic leader of the House Ways and Means Committee, leading the charge, joined so lustily in the tax-cutting spree of 1981, they must accept their share of guilt for undermining the nation's fiscal structure - and the responsibility for repairing it. **********The bipartisan operation is likely to reduce the deficit in the fiscal year 1985 by only $20 billion, but Mr. Reagan thinks there is a basis for agreement on a plan to cut deficits by $100 billion over the next three years. **********Since his own budget will project deficits of close to $600 billion during those three years - with the Congressional Budget Office estimating the deficits, under existing legislation, to exceed $700 billion in that period - the budgetary tide of red ink would not be much stanched if the President gets the whole $100 billion. **********He said, however, that the vital question was not whether to reduce the deficits but how. He will cut the military budget hardly at all, if he can help it. And, still smarting from the attacks on his former Secretary of the Interior, James G. Watt, and his former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Anne McGill Burford, Mr. Reagan called for increases in spending to acquire park lands and to protect the environment. **********He also wants money for what he called ''the Jackson plan'' (after the late Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington) ''to implement the recommendations of the Bipartisan Commission on Central America,'' formerly known as the Kissinger Commission before the need to appease the right- wing became so critical. **********To reduce Federal spending, he supported the 2,500 cuts recommended by the Grace Commission (no name problem here with J. Peter Grace) and told Congress he wanted line-item veto power. There is less here than meets the eye: The big cuts in the Grace Commission report would have to come in Congressionally mandated entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Federal pensions, which are well protected politically. **********Since entitlement programs and the military budget constitute more than 80 percent of the total budget, line-item veto power, even if Congress were willing to give it to him, would yield only small potatoes, even assuming the President would exercise it against programs for which there was strong political support. **********Mr. Reagan made blazingly clear that he is still determined to prevent tax increases. He called increasing taxes ''a Band-Aid solution'' (copyright protected). Indeed, he suggested that increasing taxes would be a lot worse than a mere Band-Aid: ''It poses a real threat to economic recovery,'' he said, clinging to his huge 1981 tax cut and his political knowledge that the voters do not want higher taxes. **********But it is worth noting that the Economic Recovery Tax Act, or ERTA, of 1981, which cut taxes by $750 billion over five years, was followed by the steep 1981-82 recession, and that the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, or TEFRA, of 1982, which raised taxes by $99 billion over the fiscal years 1983 to 1985, offseting 22 percent of ERTA in those years, was followed by the strong recovery of 1983. It is that recovery that has so lifted Mr. Reagan's popularity and strengthened his prospects of re-election. **********Of course, neither the huge tax cut of 1981 nor the lesser tax increase of 1982 was solely responsible either for the downswing or the upswing in the business cycle. The Federal Reserve's tight monetarism of 1981 and early 1982, and the high interest rates, resulting from the Fed's refusal to accommodate big deficits, was the primary cause of the steepest recession of the postwar period. **********And the Fed's abandonment of that policy turned the economy around and hastened the recovery, with the tax increase of 1982 helping to reduce Government pressures on interest rates. **********Mr. Reagan welcomed the Fed's desertion of monetarism and accepted the tax-increasing TEFRA, and the recovery was his reward. Good economics, he should remind himself, may make the best politics.

Mr. Bolanos said it was intact when he presented it. **********Mrs. Arg\"uello, Mr. Aviles and Mr. Bolanos are leaders of anti-Sandinista political and business groups. They and about a dozen other opposition figures say that for the last three weeks, since the national election that the Sandinista Front won overwhelmingly, they have found an array of obstacles in their way as they try to go out of the country. **********No New Policy Announced **********The Sandinista Government has not announced any new policy on travel by opposition figures, but one appears to be in effect. Senior Government officials did not respond to requests for interviews on the subject. **********Lieut. Miguel Necochea, spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said Friday night that the Government had no list of people to be prevented from leaving the country. ''We have no policy of denying visas to anyone,'' Lieutenant Nicochea said. **********As far as could be determined, all of the opposition leaders currently unable to travel have ties to the Democratic Coordinator, a coalition of political parties, labor unions and business groups that incurred the wrath of the Sandinista Front when it refused to take part in the recent electoral campaign. The coalition nominated Arturo Jose Cruz, an economist, for President, but then refused to register his name on the ground the Government was not allowing political rivals enough freedom. **********At times in the past the Government has temporarily restricted travel for some opposition leaders, but no such restrictions are known to have been imposed in the last year. Under emergency powers adopted after the outbreak of civil strife three years ago the Government has some powers to restrict travel by Nicaraguan citizens, but it has not invoked them.   A Tradition of Travel **********Travel among Central American countries is common, and many businesses rely on commerce within the isthmus. In addition, Nicaraguan opposition leaders, like the Sandinistas themselves, often travel in search of international support for their political positions. **********Some of those who have been unable to leave Nicaragua said they suspected that the Government's motive was to prevent them from denouncing the Sandinistas in foreign countries. Others speculated that because the Government fears an imminent invasion from the United States, it may want to be sure opposition leaders are in the country when it comes and are not able to escape its consequences. **********''Perhaps they would use us as hostages if anything were to happen in the country,'' suggested Mr. Aviles, a lawyer who works for the Superior Council of Private Enterprise, Nicaragua's main business federation.   Business Group Leaders **********Several leaders of the council, which is known as Cosep, are among those who have had trouble leaving the country. Mr. Bolanos, who now carries his mutilated passport as a conversation piece, is the group's president. His brother Nicolas, president of the Union of Nicaraguan Coffee Growers, which is affiliated with Cosep, said he had also been unable to leave for a planned trip to visit a daughter in New Orleans. **********''A military man at the immigration office told me my application was incomplete, but he wouldn't answer questions about what was missing,'' Nicolas Bolanos said today. ''They made me fill out a new form and told me to come back Nov. 28.'' **********Francisco Javier Calderon, executive secretary of another Cosep-affiliated group, the National Council of Professionals, told a similar story. He was planning a trip through nearby countries to meet with sympathetic political and civic groups. As is the custom in Nicaragua, he submitted his passport and other required documentation to the authorities 15 days before he was to leave.   'They Said to Come Back' **********''They told me to pick up the passport on Nov. 16,'' Mr. Calderon said. ''When I got there, they said to come back three days later. When I arrived the second time, a Sub-Lieut. Carlos Granera came out and told me that my passport had accidentally been sent to Special Zone I and could not be found.'' **********Special Zone I is the northern part of isolated Zelaya Province on the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua. **********Sub-Lieutenant Granera, reached by telephone, said he was not authorized to give any information about Government policy on travel for opposition figures. But one of his aides, Sub-Lieut. Ruth Zepeda, said the agency ''is not preventing anyone from leaving.'' **********In at least one case, an opposition leader was able to win an exit visa that was apparently being denied to him after he appealed personally to Interior Minister Tomas Borge. The leader, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Barrios, an editor of the opposition newsaper La Prensa, said he was on his way to Japan last week when authorities at the airport told him his multiple-exit visa was no longer valid. Mr. Chamorro missed his plane. But later, backed by a Japanese diplomat, he spoke with Mr. Borge, obtained the visa, and was finally able to leave. **********One of the first activists to encounter trouble was Mario Rapaccioli, leader of a faction of the Conservative Party, who was turned back at the airport Nov. 12 after an immigration officer found a page of his passport disfigured. Since then at least a dozen applications by opposition leaders for new passports, passport renewals or exit visas have been delayed. **********Mr. Rapaccioli, one of the most outspoken anti-Sandinistas remaining in Nicaragua, said in an interview that his passport was in perfect condition when he submitted it at the airport. Immigration officers at the Managua airport work in opaque booths that do not allow passengers any view of what they are doing with the travelers' documents.   No Response Received **********Several other opposition leaders, such as Luis Rivas Leiva of the Social Democratic Party, Erick Ramirez of the Social Christians and Jose Espinoza of the Confederation for Trade Union Unity, said they had received no responses to requests for visas, new passports or passport renewals. **********''Under their emergency powers, they have the right to keep people from leaving,'' said Mr. Aviles. ''I wish they would just publish a list and tell us which people are forbidden to leave and for how long, so we don't go through this charade.

One of the buildings, called Carnegie Park, went into construction this month. **********The building will have 462 rental apartments in a tower of 30 stories, plus connected smaller structures of 8, 9 and 10 stories, on the east side of Third Avenue between 93d and 94th Streets. The 60,000-square-foot site was the last one available in the Ruppert Brewery urban renewal area. The architect is Davis Brody & Associates. **********The developer is the Related Companies Inc., which in addition to this site expects to be in construction by February on three sites in the Rector Place section of Battery Park City and one in the West Side urban renewal area, on the east side of Columbus Avenue at 87th Street. **********The total is close to 1,200 apartments, said Stephen M. Ross, the 44- year-old president of Related Companies, who was a real-estate lawyer and syndication specialist when he started the enterprise in 1971. It has built and continues to manage more than 8,000 publicly assisted apartments around the country, and it now does commercial and office ventures as well. **********The financing will be in the form of a $68 million mortgage issued by the Housing Development Corporation, the city's housing finance agency, from a pool of funds that will be raised in a public sale within the next few weeks. The builder will pay a rate about 3 to 4 percentage points below the conventional mortgage rate because the bond issue is exempt from Federal, state and city taxes. **********At Carnegie Park, 80 percent of the tenants will pay market rents. These are expected to be in the range of $2 to $2.25 a square foot per month. At $2 a square foot, a 750-square foot, one- bedroom apartment would rent for $1,500 a month, or $18,000 a year. **********Using the current standard calculation that most households can pay 28 percent of their income as rent, this means the apartment would be affordable to households with annual incomes of about $54,000. **********''You must give people a life style at these rents,'' said Mr. Ross. ''The old days of renting just shelter won't work.'' **********Contributing to the life style will be a health club, a swimming pool and a private park. Above all, however, the developers are banking on the Upper East Side location to attract higher- income tenants, often from two-income households. **********Twenty percent of the apartments will get a Federal Section 8 subsidy and will be rented to people with incomes below 80 percent of the area's median income, currently $24,900. A one-bedroom apartment would rent to a subsidized tenant for about $500. **********Lance H. Wilson, president of the Housing Development Corporation, said the agency would also supply the financing for prospective rental developments on Columbus Avenue in the West Side urban renewal area. **********Some, like Carnegie Park, will have Section 8 subsidies for the lower- income units, which relieves the market-rate apartment of most of the economic burden of carrying the difference between subsidized tenants' rents and the true rent requirement. **********But with the demise of Section 8 subsidies for new construction, future projects with tax-exempt financing and the 80-20 income mix will have to be entirely ''self-subsidized'' in the building. In other words, the higher- rent apartments will pick up the rent requirements above what the lower- income tenants pay. **********Because of the high costs of construction in Manhattan, an unusually high subsidy per apartment must be paid to sustain a 20 percent occupancy by lower-income people. Mr. Wilson estimated that about $200 a month of a market-rate apartment's rent would go toward meeting the rent requirements of the lower-income tenant's apartment. **********At Carnegie Park, which gets the Section 8 subsidy, the development cost is expected to be in the range of $155 to $175 a square foot, Mr. Ross said. This includes $23 a square foot attributed to land costs. **********The tax-exempt financing, as well as reduced property-tax payments in the first 10 years under the Section 421a program, are necessary to keep the rents to higher-income tenants at a marketable level. **********Another forthcoming example of so-called 80-20 housing with tax-exempt financing will be a development called Yorkville Plaza, covering an area of 95,000 square feet on the block between 95th and 96th Streets, from Second Avenue to a point east of Third Avenue. **********Here the state's Housing Finance Agency is providing $120 million in financing for what is planned as 1,100 apartments to be built by the Milstein Organization. The developer is seeking mortgage insurance from the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. **********A spokesman for the Housing Development Corporation noted that developers who use the tax-exempt bond financing must pay a bank or some other financial institution to guarantee the bond issue. This costs 1 to 1 1/2 percentage points above the basic interest rate plus fees.

Labor won 47 seats in the 1981 elections and Likud 48. It takes 61 seats to form a majority in the 120-seat Parliament. **********Fragmented Electorate **********Likud's ability to defy the predictions was because many of its predominantly poorer and Oriental Jewish supporters, who had been wavering, in the end decided they simply could not identify with the Labor Party and returned to the Likud fold at the last minute, noted a Hebrew University political scientist, Gadi Wolfsfeld. **********This, coupled with the general decline in strength of both the big parties and the gains made by their smaller rivals, suggests an Israeli electorate that is becoming more deeply divided and fragmented then ever before. **********''The picture painted by these results is of an Israel rigidly divided into two camps,'' said another Hebrew University political scientist, Dan Horowitz. ''Whichever party will form the next government will be very weak. If a national unity Cabinet is formed, then the question is whether it will be under Peres or Shamir. Even a national unity Cabinet could probably not last long. In the long-term, Israel's democracy may be paralyzed.'' **********Since both big parties will be well short of the majority required to form a new government, they will be forced to try to cajole, entice and essentially ''buy'' support from the wide range of small parties, which divided the remainder of the seats. **********''Both parties will have to buy off everyone you can buy to form a government,'' said Daniel J. Elazar, a leading Israeli public policy expert.  This means, the analysts said, that any new Israeli government, whether it is put together by Labor or Likud, will be a highly unstable coalition of large and small parties of widely differing ideologies. Such a government would find it difficult to make any new initiative regarding the peace process or territorial compromise with Israel's Arab neighbors. It would also find it difficult to bring Israel's 400 percent inflation rate under control because it would have to promise ''payoffs'' to win the support of small parties, particularly the religious groups.   National Unity Government **********The only way to possibly avoid this would be for Labor and Likud to join in a national unity government, as Mr. Shamir has requested. But Mr. Peres has rejected the offer. Whether such a Cabinet would really be a stable alternative, however, seems questionable. As the election results indicate, there is simply no consensus in Israel anymore on questions from the economy to what shape the country should ultimately take, and a national unity Cabinet would only be papering over those differences rather then reflecting a real meeting of minds. **********Still, pressure for a national unity Cabinet appeared to be mounting today as the vote totals came in. Zevulun Hammer, the Minister of Education, announced late Monday night that his National Religious Party, which is expected to be a key power broker, would only throw its weight behind the party forming a national unity government because it was the ''only way'' to undertake the drastic changes needed to deal with Israel's economy. **********Ezer Weizman, whose small Yahad Party will also be needed by both Labor and Likud to put together a majority, also recommended the formation of a national unity Cabinet. **********No matter who forms the next government, noted Mr. Elazar, the election results have to be interpreted as a ''major defeat'' for the Labor Party. **********''Labor's ability to throw away victory after everything that has happened under the Likud - the failure of the Lebanon war, the 400 percent inflation rate, the disappearance of its historical founder Menachem Begin - really says something,'' he said. ''I think you could say that the Likud has become the majority party in Israel in the sense that it can hold voters in the face of the most incredible disasters. Labor has to be seen as the party of the last generation and Likud the party of the new generation. Labor is seen as the establishment that people do not want to come back.''  'Great Historical Achievement' **********Both Mr. Peres and Mr. Shamir were closeted in their respective party headquarters in Tel Aviv early today, negotiating with the small parties while they watched the results come in. **********Mr. Peres made a brief appearance before his party's faithful, putting the best face on the returns and telling reporters that he believed Labor could form a majority coalition. But there was already talk in the Labor camp about new elections being called in November, the Israeli television reported. **********A jubiliant Prime Minister Shamir addressed the Likud Party headquarters, talking as though he was certain to stay in power, even though he was projected to win fewer seats than Mr. Peres. **********''It is completely clear now that the Likud achieved in these elections a great historical achievement,'' said Mr. Shamir. ''People said to us, 'Don't worry, the Likud will win,' and the Likud won.'' **********The Prime Minister repeated his appeal for a national unity government and said he had already conducted preliminary discussions with several parties on the subject and received generally ''affirmative'' responses. **********The final vote count is not expected to be completed until Thursday, when the ballots of Israeli soldiers and sailors will have been tabulated. In such a close election, a swing of only one or two seats to Likud or Labor could be critical.   Awkward Position for President **********President Chaim Herzog told reporters today that only on Thursday would he begin consulting with the various parties to see which one was in the best position to form a majority government. **********If Labor continues to hold its small lead over the Likud, President Herzog could be in an awkward situation unique in Israeli political history. **********According to Israeli law, the President, after consulting all of the parties, calls on the party leader he thinks is best positioned to form a government. Since the founding of the state, the President has traditionally called on the party with the largest number of seats, but in the case of this election Labor could win more seats than Likud but Likud could be better able to form a coalition with the small parties. This raises the question of which party President Herzog will call on first to try to form a government. Mr. Shamir's exuberant remarks seemed to be directed more at President Herzog than anyone else. The situation is doubtly sensitive for Mr. Herzog, who is a life-long member of the Labor Party. **********That party leader who is asked by the President to form a government has 42 days to put together a 61-seat majority. If he cannot, the next largest party is traditionally given a chance. **********Judging from the Israeli television computer projections the Labor Party and its close allies among the small parties would gain almost the same number of seats in Parliament as the Likud and its close allies, with Likud holding only a slight advantage.   Breakdown of the Vote **********According to the Israeli television's computer projections and its straw vote conducted outside selected polling stations, Labor would win 45 seats. One close ally, the dovish Shinui Party led by Amnon Rubinstein, would win 3, and the Citizens Rights Party led by Shulamit Aloni, would win 3. Many Labor supporters appear to have deserted Labor in favor of the two small allied parties, whose positions on peace with the Arabs and social issues were much more clearly articulated than the Labor Party's. which tried to obfuscate its views to lure right-of-center voters away from Likud. **********Ezer Weizman's Yahad Party, which could go with either Likud or Labor, was projected to win only 2 seats. Tami, the Oriental Jewish Party, which could also go with either big party, was projected to win 1 seat. **********In other words, Labor with its close allies, plus Mr. Weizman's party and Tami, would have only 54 seats. This would leave Labor in need of several religious parties. **********The two predominantly Arab parties were expected to gain 6 seats - 4 going to the Communist Hadash Party and 2 going to the new Jewish-Arab Progressive List for Peace. The Arab parties traditionally vote against Likud, but Labor would never bring them into a ruling coalition. **********The Likud is projected to win 42 seats, with its hard-line allies Tehiya, led by Yuval Neeman, 4 seats, the pro- Likud one-man party of Yigal Hurwitz 1 seat and the right-wing religious party, Morasha, 2 seats. That would give Likud a total of 49. **********Likud would then have to approach the other religious parties that have been in its Cabinets for the past seven years. The National Religious Party is projected to win 4 seats and the ultra- Orthodox Agudat and Shas parties 6 seats. With the religious parties, Likud would have 59 seats and would then have to win the support of either Tami, Mr. Weizman or American-born Rabbi Meir Kahane who is projected to win 1 seat. **********Weather for the election was ideal and turnout among Israel's 2.65 million voters appears to have been above 75 percent, judging from early projections."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/15/business/sohio-to-resume-beaufort-drilling.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sohio to Resume Beaufort Drilling", "print_headline": "Sohio to Resume Beaufort Drilling", "body_text": " **********The Standard Oil Company (Ohio) said it planned to resume drilling at a Beaufort Sea site that had been an earlier disappointment.

And ever since the report sailed into view, affected groups, ranging from oil companies and stockbrokers to universities and churches, have been firing away at those parts of the plan that they think would hurt their interests. **********Most of the critics say they favor broadening the tax base and cutting marginal tax rates in general but feel a serious mistake was made when it came to eliminating their tax break in particular. If all the missiles aimed at specific parts of the Treasury proposal hit their targets, however, obviously the whole plan will collapse. **********Indeed, the impression is being created by the uproar over the elimination of some deductions and exemptions that the Treasury plan is already dead. There is genuine danger that, unless proponents (including the President) fight harder to defend an approach that actually has widespread support among both conservatives and liberals, this major effort to revise the tax system and make it more efficient and equitable will collapse. **********Oddly enough, this is not a simple case of the proponents of a fiscal plan being ranged against its opponents. Most people are simultaneously proponents and opponents - proponents in general, opponents in particular. But they may seriously damage their own interests if they do not treat the plan as a whole and ignore its likely effects on their own and national interests. **********There are many examples of this dichotomy over narrow and broad effects of the plan. As Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York said, ''Few would argue against simplifying a Federal tax code that now runs to more than 2,500 pages.'' But he then promptly proceeded, as a New Yorker, to attack one element that would be ''ruinous to our state's economy''- the Treasury's proposal to eliminate the right of individuals to deduct state and local taxes from the income on which they pay Federal tax. Senator Moynihan said he would fight this to the end in the Senate Finance Committee, of which he is a member. **********Governor Cuomo, who is a strong supporter of action to shrink the Federal budget deficit, declared that he, too, would fight against the proposal to repeal deductibility of state and local taxes and would recruit other Governors, especially in high- tax states, to the cause. **********But Representative Charles B. Rangel, who is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee and who represents an upper Manhattan district with many poor residents, hailed the Treasury's proposal, calling it ''the greatest thing that's come along.'' He said eliminating deductions of state and local taxes was relatively unimportant, compared with the improvements the plan promises in equity and simplicity. **********The low-income people in Mr. Rangel's district would benefit from raising the personal exemption to $2,000 for all taxpayers and their dependents and increasing the zero-bracket amount to $2,800 for single taxpayers, $3,800 on joint returns and $3,500 for heads of households. These provisions, as the Treasury report said, would virtually eliminate from taxation families with incomes below the poverty level. **********Obviously, if this entire tax package is being presented as ''revenue neutral,'' then some individuals and businesses are going to lose while others are going to gain as the system is revised. This is what makes the plan so hard to sell politically. However, whether one approves of the relative gains and losses depends on one's social values, and the remarkable thing about this Reagan Administration plan is that it offers advantages for those far down the income ladder. **********But even many of those who regard themselves as losers may find, if they would hold their fire and examine the proposal carefully as a whole, that they may also be gainers, especially if the overall economy is strengthened. More specifically, residents of New York and other states would also benefit from the proposed steep cuts in marginal tax rates. These need to be set off against the loss of income resulting from the elimination of deductibility of state and local taxes. **********Furthermore, the cuts in business tax rates will aid a great many companies, especially small and growing ones. But not all big businesses, even in so- called smokestack industries, have rushed to the conclusion that they would be worse off if this plan were enacted. General Motors, for example, is strongly supporting the Treasury's plan. Apparently at last it has got Engine Charley Wilson's dictum right: ''What's good for the nation is good for General Motors.'' I.B.M. is also supporting the plan, presumably on the same principle. **********One does not have to be a ''special interest'' to rush to a mistaken conclusion about the effects on one's own institution of the changes the Treasury has proposed. Spokesmen for many nonprofit institutions have rushed to the conclusion that the proposed changes in charitable contributions would hurt them. The Treasury proposes to disallow deductions of charitable contributions below 2 percent of adjusted gross income. But its proposal to permit unlimited deductibility above that 2 percent limit, instead of the old 50 percent-of-income limit on contributions, could actually benefit universities, museums, churches and other nonprofit institutions by encouraging much larger and earlier contributions. **********The affected interests would do well not to holler before they're hurt.

Gutfreund has been seen preparing meals and washing dishes at the Bronx hospital. He resolutely refuses to discuss it, saying only, ''You do what you do because you have to.'' **********Indeed, his compulsion to do what ''you have to'' goes well beyond pitching in during an emergency at the hospital where he serves on the board. Mr. Gutfreund, who has headed Salomon Brothers for the past six years, is a man who likes to be in the thick of things, a ''hands-on'' operator, in business-school parlance. And colleagues and acquaintances on Wall Street said that John Gutfreund again did what he had to do last week when he wrested control of his company from the man who bought it only three years ago. **********''Sometimes, people reach the comfort level when they make enough money, while some have to win the ball game,'' said a former Salomon partner who asked for anonymity. Now, he added, Mr. Gutfreund ''has gotten to be a real hardball player.'' **********On Wall Street, his latest move was viewed as an amazing executive suite coup. Three summers ago, the cigar-smoking Mr. Gutfreund - pronounced GOOD-friend - had orchestrated the sale of Salomon Brothers, then the nation's largest privately held investment bank, to the Phibro Corporation, one of the world's largest commodities traders. **********But last Monday, the man who headed Phibro when it bought Salomon Brothers - David Tendler - was demoted and Mr. Gutfreund was installed as the chief executive officer of the huge and unusual financial empire.  ''John understands risk, reward and timing,'' said another former Salomon partner. ''He waited for the right time in order to make his move at Phibro, and was able to do it without breaking a lot of glass.'' **********The move puts Mr. Gutfreund, who is 54 years old, at the helm of a two- pronged company with $42 billion in assets, $30 billion in revenue, $617 million in annual profits, 6,700 employees and 25,000 shareholders. It has the capability of trading virtually anything, from wheat to mortgage- backed securities. **********But the tasks facing Mr. Gutfreund are formidable. Three years after the merger of Phibro and Salomon, the two halves are yet to jell. Instead, tension has grown between employees of Phibro-Salomon's two divisions. Philipp Brothers, as the company's big commodities operation is known, has continually turned in disappointing profits even as it generates huge revenues. Salomon, a smaller operation, is one of Wall Street's most profitable investment banks. **********The new Phibro-Salomon chief was reluctant last week to discuss detailed plans for blending Philipp and Salomon, but he has mentioned to others a vision of offering financial services on a worldwide basis. He said days after his appointment that he was interested in expanding the market for securities backed by real estate mortgages around the world. Phibro, he added, might also purchase a mortgage insurance company, which could be a help when Salomon packages mortgages for sale. **********Mr. Gutfreund recognizes the challenges of his new job. He must turn around Philipp Brothers, a business about which he admits he knows little. He must also seek peace with Mr. Tendler, 46, who has been a driving force behind Philipp Brothers. Mr. Gutfreund plans to spend 50 percent of his time on parent-company affairs, and expects to set up an office at headquarters in midtown Manhattan in addition to his Wall Street office. He does not promise quick results. ''I'm a very slow person,'' he said. ''I'm not a rocket scientist.'' **********Just how Mr. Gutfreund managed to work his way to the top and topple Mr. Tendler is not entirely clear because of the secrecy that surrounds Phibro-Salomon. Phibro, because of its sensitive trading relationships, has always avoided the limelight, and Salomon, since it was privately held, never felt compelled to say much. Directors who would talk insisted on anonymity, and even Wall Street analysts who follow the company frequently asked not to be quoted by name for fear of losing access to company executives and directors. **********One thing is clear, however: Mr. Gutfreund is seeking total control of the company. ''Mr. Tendler's real job will be to run Philipp Brothers. Period,'' Mr. Gutfreund said in an interview last week. **********The story of Mr. Gutfreund's ascension opened, oddly enough, with an offer by Mr. Tendler. In the spring of 1981, Mr. Tendler and his top aides at Phibro quietly approached Mr. Gutfreund and Salomon's executive committee about the possibility of Phibro acquiring Salomon. Phibro, which traded commodities that included grain, cement and oil, saw an opportunity to move into the trading of financial instruments. **********Salomon, for its part, was also taken with the possibilities. It saw an opportunity to drum up corporate and governmental clients overseas by using Phibro's contacts, to secure additional capital and to free up the money of its 62 partners - some $304 million that they could not withdraw from the firm because it was needed to finance day-to-day operations. **********That August, the stock and cash sale of Salomon to Phibro for $554 million was announced. When the deal was completed in October, the parent company's name became Phibro-Salomon, and Mr. Tendler and Mr. Gutfreund became co-chairmen, with Mr. Tendler remaining as the sole chief executive officer. Mr. Gutfreund's primary duty was to run Salomon Brothers. **********THE two branches ran, for the **********most part, independently. But **********their earnings immediately headed in opposite directions. Commodity prices had fallen - even oil lost its luster - and Philipp suffered accordingly, particularly in the long periods when prices would remain flat, the worst of all worlds for traders. Salomon, meanwhile, was establishing itself as one of Wall Street's innovative forces, developing new products that pushed its profits in 1982 and 1983 to record heights. **********With Salomon's star rising, Mr. Gutfreund began to assert himself more at directors' meetings, questioning whether better controls were needed at Philipp Brothers, according to a source close to the board. The board, with members from both Philipp and Salomon, as well as outsiders, apparently agreed. Last September, it promoted Mr. Gutfreund to co- chief executive officer with Mr. Tendler. Both men said the promotion was only a reflection of how the company was being run. **********But the problems worsened. If tensions did not develop between the two men - they have repeatedly denied all such reports - tensions apparently did develop between the two divisions. Salomon Brothers partners were wondering whether they sold out for too little, given the surge in brokerage firm prices during the 1982 stock market rally and Salomon's terrific results. Meanwhile, Philipp Brothers profits remained depressed, putting a drag on the price of Phibro- Salomon stock, a lot of which was owned by Salomon partners. ''We're contributing more than they are'' to the company's profits, ''so the tensions developed,'' said one Salomon managing director. **********The severity of the resentment became evident in late May. Phibro- Salomon issued a terse statement saying it was considering the sale of the Philipp Brothers commodity trading business, except oil, to a group of executives and employees. Mr. Tendler, an intense, soft-spoken man with a cherubic face and quick mind, was to head the group. **********Ten days later, the deal collapsed. Analysts said the two sides could not agree on a price and how to divide tax credits between the two groups. In addition, splitting off the oil trading business, securing financing and obtaining the necessary trading licenses for the new company were more complicated than apparently anticipated, In addition, after the announcement that the deal was being considered, Phibro-Salomon's stock price suddenly dipped, signaling the market's displeasure with the proposal. **********On Wall Street, the whole episode was viewed with disdain. The long secretive Phibro-Salomon had publicly announced the proposal because word had leaked out, and then withdrew the plan when it looked unfeasible. The immediate speculation was that Mr. Tendler would resign. Some board members, according to a source close to the company, were, in fact, upset that Mr. Tendler's proposal had leaked prematurely. **********They were also upset, the source said, that contrary to Mr. Tendler's predictions, Philipp's profits remained depressed. ''The board was quite concerned about where his interests lay,'' the source said in reference to Mr. Tendler. ''The board was concerned that Tendler didn't spend enough time on Philipp Brothers'' and its day-to-day operations, working instead on the proposed spinoff. **********For his part, Mr. Tendler said last week that he, too, was unhappy about the proposal having leaked out. But he dismissed suggestions that he had spent a lot of time on it. ''It happened quick and failed fast,'' he said in an interview. **********Nonetheless, insiders said, the board was also unhappy for another reason: They saw paralysis at the top of the company. ''Having a pair'' of chief executives ''was acknowledging that there were two divisions,'' Mr. Gutfreund said. ''And if you're talking about one company, one company should probably be run by one person with a very strong group of people'' as subordinates, he added. **********According to another insider close to the board, it considered hiring a third person to head the parent company but feared only exacerbating the problem. ''You don't want to introduce an unknown into a situation,'' this insider said. **********So, last Monday, the Phibro-Salomon board did the only thing it could do, given that the company was sorely in need of repair and that it could not afford to offend Mr. Gutfreund, whose division was so vital to Phibro-Salomon's well-being. Mr. Gutfreund was named the holding company's sole chief executive and Mr. Tendler was pushed aside, given the title of chairman of Phibro-Salomon's executive committee. Mr. Tendler said the executive committee would have new importance, but a company statement said he would ''concentrate his efforts'' on commodities trading, his specialty. **********For Mr. Gutfreund, his first task is to find a way to lessen the tension dividing Salomon and Philipp. ''We want to do everything we can to eliminate those feelings,'' said one Phibro director with Salomon ties. But he added: ''Those feelings down in the ranks die very slowly.'' **********If he can lessen the tensions, the most basic and important job facing Mr. Gutfreund is finding synergy - that is, blending Phibro-Salomon's two independent businesses so that the whole is worth more than the parts. That, of course, was the original goal of the merger. **********So far, according to Mr. Gutfreund, the synergy between the two has been ''modest.'' The companies are physically separated - Salomon is at the tip of Manhattan, Philipp is in midtown - and there are only occasional meetings. Salomon's head equity trader sometimes confers with Philipp's head oil trader to get a feeling for where oil prices and therefore oil stocks may go, Mr. Gutfreund said. Or, he said, Salomon's metals analyst will talk to Philipp's copper traders about the markets. **********But basically the synergy has, to date, only been financial. At the time of the merger, Philipp had plenty of capital, as well as superb access to credit. Since its business was slow, Salomon was able to use some of the money to expand. Phibro not only replaced the $304 million in capital withdrawn by the Salomon partners, it lent another $100 million to Salomon and gave it access to additional credit. ''We would not be in our present position without having had that enormous injection of capital,'' Mr. Gutfreund said. **********Currently, Salomon Brothers, which contributes only 8 percent of the company's total revenues, is contributing 65 percent of the company's earnings and has become one of investment banking's indisputable stars, with its profits steadily growing as other firms suffer with the industry's violent ups and downs. Its basic businesses are marketing new issues of securities for corporations and governments, and trading already issued securities. **********The key to Salomon's success has been its flair for innovation and recognizing changes in the marketplace. While competitors have continued to rely on old-school ties, Salomon has leaped ahead by designing new securities and perfecting its ability to distribute large blocks of stocks and bonds rapidly. Its innovative products have included securities backed by home mortgages - it dominates this rapidly growing market - and Certificates of Accrual on Treasury Securities, which are called CATS and are, in effect, zero-coupon United States Government bonds. **********Salomon is also well known for its willingness to commit large sums of capital to facilitate the trading of already issued securities. It deals strictly with institutions - mutual funds, pension funds, money managers, banks and insurance companies - and these client ties help it to sell new, as well as already issued securities. Last year, Salomon traded more than $2 trillion in securities in the secondary market. **********Philipp Brothers, for its part, trades about 160 commodities, including petroleum, metals, cocoa, sugar and grain. A unit, Phibro Energy, is considered the world's largest non- producing petroleum trader. Philipp Brothers was originally part of the Engelhard Minerals and Chemicals Corporation, but grew so rapidly when commodity prices surged in the 1970's that it was spun off in May 1981 as a separate company. With great secrecy, it will move in and out of various goods within minutes and can trade across country borders. **********But flat commodity prices and falling oil prices have pinched Philipp Brothers since the late 1970's. For the second quarter, oil pretax profits apparently fell to nothing, from $25 million in the first quarter, according to J. Clarence Morrison, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. who is close to the company. Total Philipp Brothers profits dipped to $35 million, from $51.5 million in the first quarter. By contrast, Salomon Brothers profits climbed to $68.7 million, from $68.5 million in the first quarter. **********The man who inherits this complex operation has spent his whole adult life at Salomon. He was raised in the affluent New York suburb of Scarsdale, and his father owned wholesale meat and trucking businesses, while his mother was a housewife. He earned an English degree from Oberlin College in 1951, and briefly thought about teaching literature. But the Army drafted him just after graduation and he ended up volunteering for the Korean War. **********Upon his release in 1953, Mr. Gutfreund had lunch one day with William R. (Billy) Salomon, a family acquaintance and son of one of the firm's founders, who ultimately became the managing partner. The young Mr. Gutfreund wound up as a $45-a-week trainee on Salomon's municipal bond desk. ''You had to be able to add and subtract and just get it done,'' he said. ''In the current world, I would not be high on the roster for hire.'' **********DESPITE this modesty, it was during his nine years on this desk that he earned his reputation as a consummate trader, always ready to make a bid or offer. Like a true trader, one acquaintance said, Mr. Gutfreund always orders the first special recited by a waiter in a restaurant without waiting to hear the others. **********Mr. Gutfreund's trading instincts have become so strong, said one Salomon colleague, that he relies little on the personal relationships that other investment bankers cling to. ''He makes decisions very analytically, with little emotion,'' this colleague said. ''I have seen people who are social friends of his given no weight when it comes to business decisions.'' **********But those business skills have served him well. In 1963, at the age of 34, he became the firm's youngest non-family partner. Fifteen years later, he succeeded Billy Salomon as managing partner. Last year, he took home $2.1 million. **********Colleagues say his climb entailed plenty of competition. When William E. Simon, who has also done fine for himself financially, left Salomon in 1972 to become Deputy Treasury Secretary, ''in many peoples' minds, it was because he knew he wasn't going to beat out Gutfreund to be Billy Salomon's successor,'' said one Wall Street executive. **********Nonetheless, some acquaintances say Mr. Gutfreund is more refined than others on Wall Street who made their way up the trading ladder. **********''There's some civilizing, refining capacity here that is not present with some of these other people,'' said one Wall Street executive of Mr. Gutfreund. ''He's extremely tough and extremely competitive in getting clients. But he's held that organization together. He may not be as au courant with corporate establishment as Johnny Whitehead or Felix, but he's certainly beginning to move in those circles, and that shows a capacity for growth.'' John C. Whitehead is a co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company. Felix G. Rohatyn is a senior partner at Lazard Fr eres & Company. **********One of the reasons frequently cited for Mr. Gutfreund's mixing in better circles these days is his second wife, Susan, whom he married in 1981. They live in an opulent cooperative building on Manhattan's East Side, and friends say she has pushed him into the New York social scene. A gossip column in Women's Wear Daily refers to her as ''Social Susie'' and him as ''Solemn John.'' A recent parody in Vanity Fair said that at their home ''everything is vintage, even the Lavoris.'' **********With regard to the social scene, Mr. Gutfreund said: ''I find it relatively boring after a while, but there are some interesting achievers. They're not just the idle rich.'' **********MR. GUTFREUND, the father of three sons, ages 21 to 25, arrives by chauffeur at his Wall Street office at 7:10 A.M. and stays until about 6 P.M. He plays tennis but not golf - it takes too much time, he says - and likes brief, three- or-four-day vacations in Europe looking for antiques and visiting museums with his wife. He reads mysteries while flying and ''detests'' self- improvement books, finding them ''irritating.'' He serves on the boards of the New York Public Library and the Montefiore Medical Center.

And he said the R.E.A. was not being asked to guarantee the Public Service debt, only to support the desire of the New Hampshire cooperative to do so. **********The R.E.A., a Federal agency, backs the debts of electric cooperatives. It has backed 2.6 percent of the Seabrook obligations through cooperatives in New Hampshire and Vermont. **********'A Little Presumptuous' **********The R.E.A.'s deputy administrator, Jack Van Mark, said yesterday, ''It is a little presumptuous to assume that the owner of 2.6 percent will guarantee billions of dollars in debt.'' When work was halted on Unit 1 at the Seabrook site last month, Public Service of New Hampshire estimated that construction costs, if the plant is completed, would total $6.9 billion. **********Also at yesterday's meeting was Gov. John H. Sununu of New Hampshire, who Mr. Hildreth said was interested in supporting the rescue plan as long as any extra power bought by the sponsor remained in that state. Mr. Hildreth said the R.E.A. was considering the proposal. **********Yesterday's meeting was the latest development in the tangled negotiations that have followed the announcement April 3 by the Public Service Company that it was facing bankruptcy. **********One of the first casualties after the announcement was the ability of Public Service's 15 partners in the Seabrook project to borrow money. No one wanted to finance any investment in Seabrook at a time when the collapse of a single utility could preclude completion of the reactors. **********That is the problem addressed by the newest rescue plan.  The idea is to raise in advance nearly all of the money needed to complete Unit 1, and thus eliminate uncertainty about whether each partner can finance its share. **********But the plan is also intended to assure completion of Unit 1, which is 75 percent complete, even if Public Service is forced into insolvency by the mushrooming costs. It does not address the future of Unit 2, on which work was halted last year after $800 million had been spent to bring it to 23 percent completion. The reactors were made by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. **********New Management Structure **********The arrangement, which would be coupled with a new management structure for the project, will probably require the approval of the public service commissions of six New England states, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other state and Federal agencies.  If it is to work, it will also require inducing investors to risk up to $1 billion, money that the 16 partners are unable or unwilling to raise on their own. **********The financing could not be completed before late summer, although work on Unit 1, which was halted on April 17, could resume sooner on a limited basis. Keeping the construction hiatus short is important because fixed charges on the plant run about $2 million a week, even after the layoff of nearly 6,200 workers. **********While the outcome is far from certain, the plan is probably the only hope for Unit 1. For the partners, who approved the plan unanimously at a meeting in Cambridge, Mass., the plan represents probably the only way they can recover the $2.7 billion already spent on the reactor, which William B. Ellis, chairman of Northeast Utilities, one of the partners, referred to as ''a very valuable, very fragile asset.'' **********''While it doesn't solve all our problems,'' said Nicholas Ashooh, a spokesman for Public Service, ''it does open a door for us to pursue an overall solution to our financial problems.'' **********Plan Called Unprecedented **********The participants believe that the plan is unprecedented. ''We didn't take this out of any business book that I ever read,'' Mr. Hildreth said in a telephone interview from Boston. **********The plan appears to be entirely Merrill Lynch's creation. Mr. Hildreth described his firm as ''the leading investment banker in the electric utility industry,'' but it had not been involved in Seabrook before the project's recent troubles. **********Merrill Lynch would earn a profit by floating the new bonds called for in the plan, according to Mr. Hildreth.  Here is how the rescue is supposed to work: **********First, Public Service, which has been on an unfruitful search for credit since the beinning of April, is to borrow $75 million to $90 million in short- term financing. The hope is that finding credit will be easier now that a plan for the completion of the reactor has been approved. **********Then Public Service would sell $200 million to $300 million in long-term debt. **********Next, a new financing entity, Newbrook, would be set up. Newbrook would float bonds, backed by the project, and use some of the proceeds to buy zero-coupon bonds backed by Treasury securities. These bonds would be held in escrow, to guarantee that when the new Public Service bonds came due, money would be available to pay back the principal. **********Newbrook would also borrow enough money to cover two years of interest payments on the new Public Service bonds. **********In addition, the sponsor would guarantee an additional three semiannual payments, which would carry the project to the end of 1988. ''By that time,'' Mr. Hildreth said, ''we figure the plant will be in operation, and in the rate base, and they'll be a financially healthy utility.'' **********How Sponsor Benefits **********If Public Service were unable to meet the interest payments and had to resort to the guarantee of the sponsor, that sponsor would be entitled to one kilowatt of power for each $1,500 it put up. That represents a bargain when measured against the cost of recently completed reactors. At Seabrook's Unit 1, the owners have already spent more than $2,300 per kilowatt of capacity and now project a final price of about $3,500 a kilowatt.  If the sponsor had to step in, according to Mr. Hildreth, and wound up owning a substantial amount of electricity, ''there's no question in anybody's mind he could get rid of it at a profit.'' If Public Service met the payments, the sponsor would pay nothing and receive nothing. **********A major hurdle may be gaining the participation of investors, who now count Public Service and three other utilities around the country as being near bankruptcy and who may wonder if any amount raised in advance will turn out to be adequate to meet costs that rise with dismaying vigor. **********A Return of 20% Is Seen **********Mr. Hildreth said he believed that the wariness over the risk would be offset by the higher interest rate and predicted a return of about 20 percent. The Newbrook issues, he acknowleged, would be junk bonds, which are sold cheaply and thus yield investors more interest. **********As for completing the plant within the budget used by Newbrook, nearly everyone connected with Seabrook is counting on the new project manager, William Derrickson, who was hired by Public Service from Florida Power and Light after he supervised the completion of St. Lucie 2, an 800- megawatt reactor, in just over six years, an extraordinarily short time for an industry plagued by cost overruns and facing increasingly strict standards. **********Public Service, which was the initiator of the Seabrook project and had retained control even after reducing its ownership to one-third, has relinquished its managerial role. The partners are planning a new entity, led by Mr. Derrickson, to finish the reactor and operate it. That step would require approval of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, because Public Service is the current license holder. **********Also, Mr. Hildreth said, because Unit 1 is so far along, ''you're not starting from zero, where you have a great deal of time and problems involved.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/14/world/around-the-world-many-army-desertions-reported-in-afghanistan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Many Army Desertions Reported in Afghanistan", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Many Army Desertions Reported in Afghanistan", "body_text": " **********A wave of desertions by soldiers in Kabul, the Afghan capital, has followed a Government decision to extend the tours of duty of soldiers in the capital from three to four years, Western diplomats said here today. **********Quoting reports from their embassies in Kabul, they said many soldiers on guard duty near Kabul airport and the main army bases in southwestern Kabul had fled after hearing the news on radio and television last Thursday. **********The Government, which has taken stringent measures in recent months to shore up its dwindling army, announced the duty tour extension along with a series of other measures to fill the barracks. **********Western diplomats say deaths and desertions have reduced the army to half the 80,000-man level it had before guerrilla action began after the Communist coup in April 1978."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/25/business/consumer-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 59, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONSUMER RATES", "print_headline": "CONSUMER RATES", "body_text": " **********In percent              Passbook Savings    * 5.50       At savings institutions               Tax-Exempt Bonds   10.24       Bond Buyer 20-Bond Index               Money Market Funds    * 9.30       Donoghue's Money Fund 7-Day Average Yield               Bank Money Market Accounts    * 9.30       Bank Rate Monitor               Home Mortgage   14.72       Federal Home Loan Bank, national average               Unsecured Personal Loans       Minimum rate, 3-year maturity        Chase Manhattan, New York   16.75        Continental Illinois, Chicago   15.30        Bank of America, San Francisco   19.00"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/17/business/assessing-the-synfuels-program-a-call-for-large-commercial-projects.html": {"writer_name": "John Sawhill", "pub_date": "1984-06-17", "snippet": "WHEN synfuels legislation was enacted in 1980, Congress authorized $20 billion (with the potential for another $68 billion) for a crash national program to produce substantial amounts of synthetic oil and gas.

Production goals of 500,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent by 1987 and 2.2 million barrels a day by 1992 (more than 25 percent of our current production) were written into the law. **********These goals were unrealistic then and are now clearly impossible. With the slack oil market making the large-scale commercial production of synthetic fuels increasingly uneconomical and unnecessary, some people are now calling for an end to the synfuels program. Others suggest it be scaled back to a research program within the Department of Energy. **********I disagree. The United States needs, and can afford, a commercially oriented synthetic fuels program. The capability to move quickly into large-scale synthetic fuel production will be extremely valuable when oil prices increase in the future, and Government-sponsored demonstration plans are critical to the development of such capability. Moreover, the program can be structured to minimize the impact on the economy.  Despite the sense of well-being provided by the slack energy market, our economic and national security is likely to be threatened again by oil disruptions and price shocks. Free-world oil consumption will rise in 1984 for the first time in four years, and OPEC production will climb this year by about one million barrels a day. As OPEC's surplus production capacity is used, the question is not whether prices will increase, but when. **********Synthetic fuels can mitigate this threat. The certainty that an alternative technology would begin to erode its market share at a given price level would restrain OPEC's future pricing actions. Unlike the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is a highly valuable emergency response mechanism, synfuels could be a long-term solution to the problem of diminishing low-cost oil reserves. **********Whether synfuels are a viable solution depends on their costs. In my early days at the Federal Energy Administration, a number of studies concluded oil shale would begin to develop when the price of oil rose from about $4 a barrel to around $6 to $9. Later, as Deputy Secretary of Energy in the late 1970's, I heard the same arguments - but oil had risen to $32 and the price required to bring on synfuels was $36 to $40. This gave way to the mistaken view that an inexorable link between oil prices and the cost of building a synfuels plant would always leave synfuels uneconomical. **********The real reason that synthetic fuels' costs remain too high is that industry has little experience with these plants on a commercial scale. Until a demonstration plant has been built, operated reliably and safely, and produced usable products, the private sector will not consider it ''on the shelf.'' As a Rand Corporation study showed, first-of-a-kind plants take longer and cost more to build than expected. So industry will need an assist from Government - help that is justified because of the ceiling this technology provides on future OPEC oil price increases. **********PERHAPS the original legislation was misguided in assuming that a huge infusion of funds could rapidly create a large- scale synfuels industry. McKinsey & Company's work on new technologies shows that their development is not predictable and often accelerates after an early phase of relatively slow progress. The mistake companies often make is comparing the current cost and performance of a new technology with existing ones and assuming that both will develop at the same rate. **********Building a few plants that use second- and third-generation synfuels technologies could provide the construction and operational experience necessary to evaluate likely future improvements in these technologies. But estimates of gains such as reduced lead times and lower unit costs can come only from demonstration projects; a research program by itself will not be nearly as effective. **********Government involvement in the commercialization of synfuels is thus desirable. With some changes in the Synthetic Fuels Corporation (S.F.C.) policies, it can also be affordable. Assistance should be targeted to projects using truly breakthrough technologies - not carbon copies of existing plants. Further, these plants should use plentiful coal or oil shale; too much has been spent on relatively scarce resources such as peat and tar sands. **********To further limit the budget impact, incentives should be restructured to eliminate loan guarantees (thus requiring the discipline of private-sector financing) and to limit price guarantees to a 5- to 10-year period while capping the payments a project may receive. Congress should retain the ''semi-independence'' of a slimmed- down S.F.C to avoid ''politicizing'' the program. Following these guidelines, a budget authorization close to the Administration's suggested $7 billion should be adequate. **********With such changes, the current program would be more efficient and better suited for the realities of today's environment, and it would provide some relatively low-cost insurance against erratic and inevitable oil price increases. **********John C.

Yesterday in the Hemisphere Club atop the Time- Life Building at a Continental breakfast the team replayed its pitch for some of the graybeards of the business just to let them know what was going on. The presentation, starring Bruce McNaughton, manager of agency relations, was both pleasant and meaningful, but the bagels weren't chewy. **********Then at lunchtime more of this town's constant advertising activity bubbled to the surface at the Four Seasons Restaurant, where Marshall Ackerman, vice chairman of Rodale Press, and publisher of Prevention magazine, presided at the premiere performance of his 15-minute promotion film, ''The Health Life Style in America: New Directions For The 1980's,'' and John Naisbitt, author of ''Megatrends,'' spoke. **********That's the way it is in the ad game, one excitement after another. **********And, incidently, the Fortune gathering was especially rewarding since word leaked out about the business publication's new ad campaign before its management wanted it to, and that gives the information a special sweetness. **********The campaign will be the first advertising from its new agency, Needham, Harper & Steers, and the first general advertising effort in the history of the magazine. It will be an overall promotion of the magazine, not just pushing it as something to subscribe to or advertise in. **********The advertising will promote the magazine's readership - ''the youngest, best paid audience of a business publication'' - and will christen the group ''The Business Class.'' And with it comes the new advertising theme line, ''Required Reading for the Business Class.'' **********In addition to running in the advertising trade press where it customarily runs, the advertising will also be in the sister publications of Time Inc.; the other news weeklies; lifestyle magazines covering such areas as tennis, golf and skiing, and in newspapers in four major markets. The addition of consumer media including some outdoor will mean a healthy, although undisclosed, jump in the ad budget. **********The audience of the magazine is what the presentation ''Media is Creative'' is all about. While Mr. McNaughton was quick to aacknowledge that Fortune's advertising cost per thousand rates were higher than the competition's and its reach is not all that great, the question to be answered, he said, is ''How does a magazine communicate?'' To be creative you must figure out just who it reaches based on its editorial format and content. **********''You have to bring more to your work than CPM's,'' he said, going on to imply that the difference between Rolex and Timex, a Mercedes and a Ford, and Paris and Philadelphia is the same difference that exists between Fortune and its competitors. **********The Prevention story is an interesting one since here is a 34-year-old national magazine that only started going after national advertising in late 1981, and only because the world was catching up with it. The magazine, which now has 2.75 million circulation, started out promoting good health through natural vitamins. And since there were few places to buy such vitamins, Prevention became the natural place to run direct marketing ads for such products. And, in fact, it carried as many as 100 pages an issue with as many as 32 pages from a single advertiser. Then when the American people decided that good health was not such a bad idea and health food shops started opening around the corner, Prevention began finding one of its revenue sources slowly drying up. At the same time, however, major food companies began to get health conscious and they are just the crowd that Mr. Marshall and his team are after. **********Prevention, which was revamped in January and got a new subtitle, ''America's Leading Health Magazine,'' will carry 980 pages of advertising during the year ending July 31, and about 200 of those pages will be national ads.

''But it's more important to give them confidence in doing these night operations than to get too upset when something goes wrong.'' **********Guerrillas Have Spread **********In December Colonel Monterrosa was named commander of the country's easternmost region, where guerrilla forces have spread from their stronghold in northern Morazan to the neighboring provinces of San Miquel and La Union. **********The 43-year-old colonel, who is taunted almost daily on rebel broadcasts as a ''fool'' and held up by American advisers as a model officer, has been given the task of pushing the rebels back and regaining control of the east. **********Colonel Monterrosa criticized both the rebels, saying that at least their station should ''have some seriousness,'' and the Americans, for their need always to have a model. That model changes monthly, he said, and causes problems in the officer corps. **********Of his military mission, he said: ''They talk about areas of persistence. Well, we are going to persist here too.''  Improvement Is Marked **********On a three-day trip through San Miquel Province, where the colonel is based, the army showed marked improvements in its operations. But it is unclear if the commander will be able to make progress fast or long enough to substantially change the four-year-old civil war. **********By keeping his men in the field, he has made it difficult for the guerrillas to receive supplies and to mass for any major offensives in San Miguel in the last five months. **********Morale is high, even among soldiers who say they were forced into service. **********''He doesn't push us out of the barracks, but he's with us,'' said one of the soldiers. Most of the men seem to like their soft-spoken commmander, who often grabs a soldier by the hand after he is greeted with a salute. **********But while his men are still building up confidence for night operations, the guerrillas, who have lived in the hills for years, know the terrain and melt into the wooded mountainsides when there are large numbers of Government troops present. For the most part, it is still the guerrillas who decide when and where to fight.   Rebels Have Advantages **********The army has the benefit of American-piloted C-130's flying overhead to report on insurgent positions. But intelligence from villagers is often more timely and important, and the insurgents have had at least a six-month advantage in establishing a relationship with the residents. **********The guerrillas also keep pace in numbers. When the army began recruiting several months ago and increased its forces in the east by 25 percent to 5,000, the guerrillas also began taking new members. Officials estimate that 3,000 insurgents operate in the east. Counterinsurgency experts say a government force needs a ratio of 10 to 1 for success against guerrillas. **********While Government troops are substantially better equipped than the insurgents, difficiencies exist that affect movement in the field. Helicopters break down, and the wounded are sometimes left for hours before they can be evacuated. Like the guerrillas who commandeer trucks to move men, the army also finds it necessary to depend on local vehicles. At the San Miquel base, which has 2,000 men, the commander has one helicopter and seven or eight trucks. **********Although Colonel Monterrosa's men were unable to circle San Luis de la Reina fast enough the night of April 13, the operation was not a complete failure, he said. They managed to keep the insurgents moving and to spend time in town trying to win the people's confidence. But while the army has been through here every eight days for the last several months, the guerrillas come in almost daily, according to the people who live in San Luis de la Reina.   Few Complaints About Rebels Soldiers talked with the villagers, and some flirted with the women, one racing to get a piece of paper to write down information on a young lady he had met. While the people seemed to be comfortable with the army's presence, most did not complain about the 25 to 30 guerrillas who come in to buy supplies and occasionally hold political meetings. **********''The muchachos come every day,'' said a 26-year-old man who was setting out his goods at the Saturday street market. ''The people here don't get involved with anyone.'' **********Even the man's use of ''muchachos,'' or ''boys,'' for the guerrillas indicated tolerence. In towns where they have no influence, the people refer to them as ''subversives'' or ''terrorists.'' **********Public relations for the army is not always easy. When Colonel Monterrosa walked into San Luis de la Reina, he found more than 20 large sacks of grains unloaded from pickup trucks, and he suspected that such a large shipment might be for the guerrillas.   Lined Up, Then Excused **********The men who drove the trucks were ordered out of their boarding house at 4 A.M. and were told to line up. National identity cards were checked, and questions were asked in a blunt manner. When the men said they wanted to sell the grain to the village, they were excused to go back to bed. But once the army leaves, some of the supplies are likely to end up in guerrilla hands. **********Colonel Monterrosa seems aware that the army badly needs to improve its reputation with the population. Most officials refer to the insurgents as ''subversives,'' but at a speech in Moncagua, seven miles northwest of San Miquel, the colonel referred to the guerrillas as ''errant brothers.'' **********He later said he wanted to show the people in Moncagua, some of whom may have relatives with the insurgents in the hills, that the army was willing to forgive and accept them back. **********At the same time, the colonel has set up 20 civil defense troops in Moncagua. ''They won't be able to protect the town, but they can pass on information,'' he said.   Public Relations Goals **********The army's operations in San Miquel often mix public relations with military objectives. The weekend of April 14, Colonel Monterrosa began an offensive along the southern coast of San Miquel to prevent the guerrillas from setting up roadblocks to collect war taxes from people going to the beach. **********The result, he hoped, would be to cut off funds for the guerrillas, show the people the army could protect them, and keep the guerrillas, who often dominate the region south of the Coastal Highway, on the move. **********The operation began with 400 soldiers moving toward El Cuco Beach. By the time the army arrived, most of the guerrillas had left. The troops settled in to stay through the Easter Week holiday, guarding the roads and keeping a presence in a place where the army had not been for more than a month. **********Three guerrillas were killed in battles along the way to El Cuco. One of the rebels left behind a love letter to his girlfriend saying that they were only separated ''because of the situation'' and that things would get better."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/12/world/a-former-salvadoran-rebel-chief-tells-of-arms-from-nicaragua.html": {"writer_name": "Hedrick Smith", "pub_date": "1984-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 921, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A FORMER SALVADORAN REBEL CHIEF TELLS OF ARMS FROM NICARAGUA", "print_headline": "A FORMER SALVADORAN REBEL CHIEF TELLS OF ARMS FROM NICARAGUA", "body_text": " **********A former Salvadoran guerrilla commander who was captured in Honduras said today that virtually all the arms received by the guerrilla units he led came from Nicaragua. **********The former guerrilla, Arquimedes Canadas, known in the rebel movement as Comandante Alejandro Montenegro, also bolstered the Reagan Administration's disputed assertions that Salvadoran guerrillas have their headquarters in Nicaragua by saying that he went there secretly in 1981 and met with his top commander, the Nicaraguan Army Chief of Staff and four Cuban advisers. **********Mr. Canadas said in an interview that in 1981 and 1982 guerrilla units under his command in San Salvador and north of the city received ''99.9 percent of our arms'' from Nicaragua. **********This contradicts what several guerrilla commanders, including Mr. Canadas, said in interviews at their mountain base near Guazapa volcano in February 1982. **********Armed with American-made M-16 rifles, the Salvadoran guerrilla commanders said their weapons were either captured from Government forces, bought on the black market or purchased directly from Salvadoran Government officers. Only one admitted having gone to Nicaragua and none said they had been to Cuba.  But today Mr. Montenegro said through an interpreter that he had been under orders from his guerrilla commander in chief to give false information in 1982 by saying that the arms were captured or purchased when in fact they had come from Managua by truck aross Honduras into El Salvador. **********In a three-hour interview Tuesday night, Mr. Canadas, who was captured in August 1982 by Honduran Army units in Tegucigalpa while he was en route to Nicaragua, said he had gone to Cuba once and to Managua twice to meet with Joaquin Villalobos, commander in chief of the People's Revolutionary Army. **********The P.R.A. is the largest of five guerrilla forces linked together under the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front. **********Accepted Government Amnesty **********Mr. Canadas, who has been under death sentence by Salvadoran guerrilla forces since accepting a Salvadoran Government amnesty, was under a round-the-clock security escort arranged by the State Department's office of public diplomacy and appeared today at a White House briefing on Central America for Reagan supporters. **********Refusing to say where he was now living for his own safety's sake, the 29- year-old Salvadoran gave a long account of his personal falling out with Mr. Villalobos over what he said he saw as the increasing Cuban domination of the Salvadoran guerrilla movement starting in mid-1980. **********Last year, Administration officials who had been embarrassed when a Nicaraguan publicly recanted statements given to the State Department and Central Intellience Agency, said they had checked out information provided by Mr. Canadas and were satisfied it was reliable. At present, his availability to news organizations, arranged indirectly by the State Department, is an apparent effort to buttress the Administration's charges that the Salvadoran guerrilla movements get aid and direction from Nicaragua. **********In the interview, Mr. Canadas said that in 1981 and 1982 urban commandos and 200 guerrillas under his command in Guazapa received monthly arms shipments from Nicaragua that were trucked across Honduras, hidden in false panels and floors. He said the trucks moved through the normal customs checkpoint of Las Manos at the Nicaraguan border with Honduras and the checkpoint of Amantillo at the Honduran border with El Salvador. **********Each truck, he said, carried roughly 25 to 30 rifles and about 7,000 cartridges of ammunition. The rifles, he said, were American-made M-16's captured in Vietnam and FAL rifles formerly used by the Nicaraguan Army under Somoza. **********Sometimes the trucks arrived without rifles and carried just ammunition and in that case, he said, a typical load would include up to 15,000 cartridges, Soviet-made grenades, and explosives like TNT for sabotage attacks against Government installations. **********Since the time of his capture, American officials have said that Honduran authorities put on major efforts to halt the relatively open flow of arms traffic on Honduran highways. American military officials have now contended that the outside arms flow comes from Nicaragua on nighttime air drops or in canoes or power boats operating in the Pacific coastal waters between Nicaragua and El Salvador. **********Mr. Canadas said his one visit to the Salvadoran guerrilla command post in Nicaragua came in October 1981, when he was summoned by Mr. Villalobos, regarded by Salvadoran Army officers as the shrewdest and most important guerrilla commander.   'Taken There Blindfolded' **********''I don't know exactly where it was because I was taken there blindfolded,'' he said. ''We went perhaps 15 minutes on the highway south of Managua where we changed vehicles. Then we went another 10 or 15 minutes. We came to a very large private home with a very large garden with metal benches.'' **********''To the right of the main entrances was an office where Villalobos worked,'' he went on. ''Further in the house was a large room where the commanders of the other guerrilla groups met and where the Cubans and Sandinistas came. There were four Cubans there.'' **********He added: ''We had one meeting about two hours long one night with the Sandinista Army Chief of Staff Joaquin Cuadra.'' **********''Cuadra spoke almost entirely about the Nicaraguan situation. And they were interested to know what kind of rebellion was taking place in El Salvador, a peasant rebellion or all elements of the population. In Nicaragua, they said, it had been all elements. But the meeting was not to discuss aid. By that time, aid had reached its peak.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/26/world/around-the-world-mrs-gandhi-calls-for-punjab-unity.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mrs. Gandhi Calls For Punjab Unity", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Mrs. Gandhi Calls For Punjab Unity", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Indira Gandhi appealed in the Indian Parliament today for reconciliation between Hindus and Sikhs in Punjab and declared that army troops would not be withdrawn from the area until both groups felt safe from Sikh terrorist threats. **********''The army should come out as soon as possible, but we must also create the conditions that people feel safe - not only the Hindus but also the Sikhs,'' she said. **********Describing sectarian feelings as ''the greatest threat'' to India's unity, Mrs. Gandhi urged all political parties to help heal the hurts of the Sikhs.

Weinberger, who maintains that the equipment could be converted for military use. **********The equipment would be the most sophisticated satellite machinery ever sold by the United States to an Eastern European country, the officials said. It includes a ground station as well as computer technology to analyze information from the American system known as Landsat, which surveys land for agricultural and scientific purposes. The system is already used by the United States and 10 other countries. China is expected to have access to it by 1986. **********One of Two Cameras **********According to officials at the Commerce Department, the Rumanians have been requesting the facilities for several years. The equipment under consideration, one official said, could analyze data from a camera on the satellite that is capable of detecting objects about 300 feet wide. **********The Rumanians would not be able to use the satellite's more advanced camera, which can distinguish objects as small as 100 feet across. Both systems are expected to be in the package sold to China. **********An engineer at the Commerce Department, Douglas Ballard, said that Landsat equipment similar to the Rumanian request is designed to be ''just outside of what the military considers useful.'' But the system's computers ''could be converted for military use, if they're smart enough and want to do it,'' he said. **********The Rumanian sale would not be affected by legislation, now before Congress, to sell the five satellites operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The bill, which could reach the House and Senate floors by the end of this week, provides for the sale of the Landsat system by the Secretary of Commerce. **********If enacted, the bill would enable the Secretary to receive bids for private marketing of data gathered by the satellites over a six-year transition period. **********Weak Market **********The sale was first recommended by President Reagan in 1981 as another effort to transfer ownership of such projects from the Government to the private sector and save money. But because of the weak market for such an expensive satellite system, the legislation will provide a Federal subsidy of between $10 million and $75 million to help private industry develop future satellites during the period of change of ownership. **********The Government has owned the system since 1972. Its annual operating cost is projected to be $30 million this year, with an amortizing cost of about $150 million a year expected during the transition period. Under the proposal, the Government would become a customer of the company that wins the bid to take over ownership. The company would not be able to limit access to the data, but the Government would be able to impose curbs on access by foreign countries. **********In March, the last satellite of the system, Landsat 5, was launched.

The Hayden Publishing Company, citing inadequate advertising, folded its 11- month-old Personal Software magazine into Personal Computing. Soft Talk, an independent publication based in North Hollywood, Calif., filed for bankruptcy when it, too, could not attract enough advertising. **********A North Carolina-based publishing unit of the American Broadcasting Company canceled PC & PC Jr magazine when the International Business Machines Corporation's PCjr computer proved a disappointment. And the International Thomson Organization's List magazine will appear twice yearly, after floundering as a monthly. **********''The rate of failures will increase,'' predicted James R. Callan, vice president for marketing at C Systems Ltd., a magazine industry research firm. ''Whereas now we are seeing one computer magazine fold each month, the rate could go to two or three times that in the next year.'' Gene W. Simpson, the publisher of Byte and Popular Computing magazines, agrees. ''I would expect to see 15 more fold by year-end,'' he said. **********A Glut on Newsstands **********The main reason for the magazine publishers' distress becomes apparent with a glance at newsstands: There are far too many computer magazines. No one knows precisely how many titles there are, but the most commonly cited figure is 200. Many started before the machines they cater to were even available, and last year a computer magazine was introduced every week, according to Mr. Callan. **********What is clear, experts agree, is that there is not enough advertising revenue to support such a vast supply. **********Although the magazines' total advertising revenues have increased more than fivefold, from roughly $16 million in the first six months of 1982 to $85 in this year's first half, the proliferation of magazines has been so fast that even this increase is not enough to support the industry. **********And with the personal computer industry itself becoming more competitive each day, most experts predict that winning advertising dollars will get tougher, not easier. **********'It Is Ridiculous' **********''It is ridiculous to have so many publications in a market like this, in which 75 percent of the magazines that reach the newsstand are not sold,'' Mr. Simpson said. ''Many of them have got to go away.'' **********Not all computer magazines are in trouble. Older, established publications, such as CW Communications' Computerworld and the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation's Datamation - both aimed at data-processing managers, not consumers - have apparently never been healthier. **********Moreover, a handful of consumer journals, notably McGraw-Hill Inc.'s Byte, Hayden's Personal Computing, the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company's PC and AHL Computing's Creative Computing, are reportedly gold mines, earning as much as 25 cents of profit for every dollar of sales. In general, the magazine industry's return on sales is less than half that. **********These four titles are in the top 400 magazines in America when ranked by total revenues, according to Folio, an industry trade journal. Byte is the largest computer magazine, with $36.6 million in 1983 revenues and profits of roughly $9 million. **********A number of big publishers, however, have been burned by acquiring magazines - and then seeing them crumble. **********Probably the best example is CW Communications. According to industry sources, the Framingham, Mass., publisher paid $16 million for seven computer magazines from Wayne Green, a publishing entrepreneur. CW has since closed three of the journals, including one called Jr, aimed at PCjr users, after only five issues. **********''People thought that I.B.M. would repeat the success it had with its Personal Computer,'' said Debra Wetherbee, a CW vice president. ''Instead, PCjr flopped and so did all of us who produced magazines around it.'' A source at the company, who asked not to be named, said CW lost $1 million on Jr alone. **********A Peculiar Market **********Among the reasons that a few magazines are flourishing, while most are struggling or going under, is the peculiar nature of the computer magazine market. In part, the contraction reflects the typical consumer's habit of buying computer magazines more for ads than articles. This tendency fattens already prosperous journals and weakens marginal ones. **********The disappointing sales of home computers have also tilted the scales in favor of already successful titles. **********Moreover, all computer-magazine publishers are competing for advertising dollars with television, radio and general-interest publications. The computer magazines are being hurt because many computer manufacturers prefer to advertise in general-interest outlets, most of whose readers do not yet own machines. The specialty computer magazines are primarily aimed at computer owners. **********Only a handful of the computer publications have circulations of 500,000 or better. Some barely sell 1,000 copies. Most are losing money. ''We are seeing all the signs of a maturing market,'' said Daniel A. McMillan, vice president for publishing at the Lotus Development Corporation. **********The question now, most publishing specialists say, is how many computer magazines will continue, and in what form. Most experts agree that at least a dozen journals - those that have mass audiences, that cover a broad range of computer issues, and that are presently choked with ads - will probably survive. **********The October issue of Byte, for example, will have roughly 300 pages of ads, with an average price of $6,000 a page, said Mr. Simpson, publisher. **********Beyond the giants, a half-dozen or so narrowly focused magazines catering to users of successful home computers will also survive, experts say, although they are reluctant to pick winners from these ''machine-specific'' titles. That brings the total number of survivors to around 20. **********Ads at a Discount **********As the consolidation continues, some publishers have reportedly begun offering deep discounts on ads to keep the cash flowing in. Others are said to be giving away ad space, just to have the appearance of financial strength. **********Even healthy publishers are trying to fortify their position.

Mason, led Charter into other ventures, the company began to founder - and its problems were fatally compounded by the volatile businesses, oil refining and marketing, that had brought Charter its fortunes. **********Charter had its genesis in a Jacksonville, Fla., lumber company founded in 1919 by Mr. Mason's father. In the 1960's, the younger Mr. Mason changed its name to the Charter Company, tore down the near- bankrupt lumber yard and began making deals. **********Embargo Aided Company **********In 1970, when California's Signal Oil rid itself of some losing assets, Mr. Mason picked up 900 gasoline stations and an aging Houston refinery. When the Arab oil embargo hit a few years later and greatly increased profit margins on oil, Charter was in an enviable position. **********With money rolling in, Mr. Mason struck out in new directions. He set out to become a communications leader, with the acquisition of The Bulletin of Philadelphia, Redbook, The Ladies' Home Journal and Sport, seven radio stations and Dayton Press, one of the nation's largest magazine printers. **********In an attempt to make this rapid diversification into communications work, he brought in Karl Eller, a colorful media consultant. But the two strong personalities did not see eye to eye, and within six months the business relationship was dissolved. **********Mr. Mason diversified further into insurance, buying Crum & Forster. In 1979, he took perhaps his biggest gamble, with the purchase from the Carey Energy Corporation of a refinery - the fifth largest in the world - on Grand Bahama Island. **********Finances Stretched Thin **********Thus the company's finances were stretched exceedingly thin when problems came - and they came with a vengeance. A real estate venture in Florida collapsed. A worldwide oil glut left refineries with smaller profit margins. Charter's foray into communications proved incompatible with the corporate culture of an oil company, and it proved costly, too. The Bulletin was losing $2 million a month by the time Charter closed it in January 1982. **********In the past two years, Charter had been busy dismantling its far-flung empire. In July 1982, the president and three senior executives of Charter were killed when their helicopter crashed in Ireland after leaving a corporate planning session at Mr. Mason's castle. The revamping - with Mr. Mason fully in charge - continued as Charter sold off the remnants of its communications and insurance business. Last Sunday, it announced that it was seeking a buyer for its life insurance group. **********With the Chapter 11 filing, Charter is now seeking to protect its original source of wealth: oil."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/07/world/nato-maneuvers-in-norway.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 31, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NATO Maneuvers in Norway", "print_headline": "NATO Maneuvers in Norway", "body_text": " **********Norway announced today that it would act as host to military maneuvers above the Arctic Circle in March in which more than 25,000 troops will take part."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/04/world/salvadoran-rebels-said-to-execute-9.html": {"writer_name": "James Lemoyne", "pub_date": "1984-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SALVADORAN REBELS SAID TO EXECUTE 9", "print_headline": "SALVADORAN REBELS SAID TO EXECUTE 9", "body_text": " **********On the night of July 22 leftist guerrillas entered this small village and abducted seven of its leading residents.

Two other men taken previously were also said to have been shot. **********The reported killings followed the forced recruitment of about 150 village men by the guerrillas early in June, according to residents. They said that up to 100 of the men were later allowed to return because they were considered unsuited for military service. **********The two events have deeply shocked villagers. Speaking with fear, confusion and sorrow, they offered an account of the underside of this country's five-year civil war, in which more than 50,000 civilians have died and over a million have fled into internal or external exile.   Past Confidence Recounted **********The villagers said they had always been terrified of the Salvadoran Army, but never, until now, of the guerrillas. **********''One had the most confidence in them,'' said 32-year-old Rita Eli Rivera de Flores, the wife of the missing Mayor. ''But if they don't respect human rights they are like the army.'' **********''We are sad here, sad and afraid,'' said 34-year-old Maria Vicente Guevara. **********As Mrs. Guevara spoke, peasants crowded into the whitewashed church nearby to hear a mass for the Day of the Dead, the day when Latin Americans carry flowers to the graves of relatives and friends. A rebel slogan on the wall behind Mrs. Guevara said, ''Death to Informers.'' **********The events in Cacaopera appear to be part of a series of incidents in the last six months in this bitterly contested northeastern corner of El Salvador in which guerrilla units are reliably reported to have conscripted peasants, executed deserters and either forced suspected political opponents into exile or executed them. **********Highly reliable outside observers who know the region around Cacaopera well and who are not associated with either the Government, the rebels or the United States Embassy say that in the last year the guerrillas have adopted a more militaristic and less tolerant attitude toward villagers in the area, which lies more than 100 miles northeast of the capital of San Salvador.   Under Increased Pressure **********Rebel officials said last month that forced recruitment of peasants had ended. Several attempts were made to speak to rebel leaders about the events in Cacaopera. One official was contacted by telephone, but failed to call back to make a comment. **********The region around the village is the center of operations for the People's Revolutionary Army faction of the rebel military Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. The People's Revolutionary Army is considered the largest, most militarily effective rebel group, and has traditionally relied more heavily on combat than on political propaganda to make its presence felt. **********Recently, however, the group has been under increasing pressure from the Salvadoran Army and has changed some of its senior commanders, possibly accounting for its hardening tactics in the area. **********One reliable source in the region said guerrilla units had forcibly removed suspected political opponents from this village and the villages of San Luis de la Reina in San Miguel province, Nueva Esparta in La Union province and Corinto in Morazan province in the last four months. **********Reporters were not able to travel to all the villages named, but the account appeared to be accurate in Cacaopera.   Boy Reported Beheaded **********Several residents said about 100 rebels of the People's Revolutionary Army entered the village at about 10 P.M. on July 22. The rebels claimed to be army soldiers, the witnesses said, and forcibly entered the homes of the seven men they abducted that night. But the guerrillas later identified themselves as rebels and witnesses said they had seen some of them in the village before with rebel units. **********The villagers repeatedly said they had feared the army more than the guerrillas. One observer said an army unit last month beheaded a 7-year-old boy whose parents were suspected of being rebel sympathizers. And villagers said the army had killed several other residents in the last year. **********Relatives of the abducted men appeared bitter as they told how they had not opened their doors when the rebels first knocked because the guerrillas had warned them in the past that only army death squads would knock on their doors at night. **********Relatives of three of those abducted said the rebels had tied the men's thumbs behind their backs and had then led them to the village square with a lasso tied around their waists. The men were kept in the square overnight before being taken away the next morning, the relatives said. **********The relatives insisted that the men had been neutral in the conflict and had never informed against the guerrillas. **********But an outside observer familiar with the town said several of the men were suspected of being Government informers or with being involved in stealing land from peasants. The source said a previous army commander had told neighboring villagers to be like the people of Cacaopera who told the army whenever the rebels passed through. **********The observer's account could not be confirmed. Even if it were true, the rebels' apparent decision to execute the men appears to be a new tactic. **********Rosario Emperatriz Fuentes, 14 years old, said she did not know if her father, Casimiro Fuentes, was alive or dead. Mr. Fuentes was one of the two policemen taken away. Miss Fuentes said she had moved to the provincial capital of San Francisco Gotera, eight miles away, because she feared being taken by the rebels as well.  War Is Like This' **********Mrs. Flores said she had begged the rebels to tell her why they were taking her husband. The guerrillas assured her, she said, that they respected human rights and intended only to ''investigate'' him.  Each time rebel units passed through the village, Mrs. Flores said, she asked them for news of her husband but never received a reply. **********Then on the afternoon of Oct. 8, a unit of 50 guerrillas entered the town, she said, and told the relatives of the seven men abducted in July and two others taken in June to come to the town square.  Mrs. Flores said a rebel told them, ''Don't ask for them anymore because they have been executed.'' **********''We asked them why they had done this since they had never done anything before,'' Mrs. Flores said.

Mr. President, when Mr. Chernenko made his speech the other day, he said he wanted to maintain the equilibrium between East and West. What does equilibrium mean to you? Is there now a balance? **********A. I think that we've gone a long way toward redressing what was a great imbalance with the Soviet Union. Back in the campaign, I was referring to our problem as having opened a window of vulnerability. I think we had. I think we've gone a long way toward redressing that. But we still haven't done it to the extent that part of our redressing is still promised, that is of the deployment of the MX missile, the putting on line of the B-1 bomber. Those things, I think, are necessary to give us what I believe would be a sufficient deterrent power. I don't think it still makes us equal to them. And I still am determined that the answer for both of the superpowers is to arrive at an agreement on real reduction of nuclear weapons. And my hope is that once started down that road, we will realize those weapons should be eliminated. **********Relations With Soviet **********Q. Do you feel more optimistic this week than you did last week, as a result of Mr. Chernenko's speech? **********A. Yes, I do. Yes. **********Q. Why? Has anything happened between Mr. Chernenko and the Vice President? **********A. No. Well, they had a meeting, a half hour meeting, and I have heard from the Vice President about that meeting. While Secretary Chernenko did not retreat from his - from the basic Soviet positions, at the same time he expressed a desire for better relations. He felt that we must both take a part in seeing that regional conflicts did not get out of control, that there should be safeguards against any inadvertent use of nuclear weapons. In other words, he spoke - his whole tone and his words were such that indicated that he believed that there was an area for us to come to agreement.   Lebanese-Israeli Accord **********Q. There are reports out of Beirut this morning, Mr. President, indicating that President Gemayel of Lebanon may be on the verge of abrogating the May 17 agreement with Israel. If it were necessary for the Gemayel Government to survive, would your Administration be willing to accept the abrogation of that agreement? **********A. I have to say with regard to the agreement, since we're not a party to it, we did help and encourage the development of it; we're not a party to it, so there's no way that we should have a position one way or the other on whether it is abrogated or not. That is up to the parties involved. And, no, it would not change our position that as long as there's a chance for peace there, we're going to keep striving.   Length of Marine Tour **********Q. Mr. President, in the week before you announced the redeployment of the Marines in Lebanon, you used very strong language to criticize Speaker O'Neill and others who were calling for a pull out. There's two questions about that. One is, do you think that your statements at a time when you were, in fact, considering strongly redeployment, if not a total pullout, has created any credibility problems? And secondly, how long do you anticipate the Marines staying on the ships off the coast? **********A. The length of stay will be determined by what happens and whether we succeed or not. And it will be no different in length than it would be if they stayed in their positions on shore. **********The remark, and maybe it was facetious in a way of flippant when I responded to a question out in the Rose Garden about the Speaker's position versus ours, was because my understanding was that he was suggesting that we bug out, that we just turn tail and run. And all that we were considering and had been planning for quite some time was how to continue the mission, but with a restationing of our forces, an improvement in that. **********Q. So in other words, you expect them to stay possibly up to the full 18- month period of the authorization? **********A. Yes. We hope that it won't be that long.   Missile Deployment **********Q. Mr. President, as a gesture of good will toward the new leadership in the Soviet Union and in an effort to break the ice on the nuclear arms negotiations, would you consider suspending further deployment of U.S. Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in Western Europe for a period? **********A. No, I don't think we should. The intermediate-range missiles of the Soviet Union number well over a thousand, someplace in the neighborhood of 1,500, 1,350 or something of that kind, with nothing comparable as a deterrent force for NATO. **********Now, NATO - our allies asked for this deployment of missiles in 1979 and it was agreed to by the Administration at that time. We inherited that situation and agree with the fact that there should be such a deterrent policy - or force - there. I think that the Soviet Union made it very plain during the negotiations that their target was the prevention of our deploying those missiles. **********I still believe my original proposal of zero option on both sides was the most sensible answer to get them completely, on both sides, out of Europe. But I think the best chance of getting agreement from the Soviet Union is dependent on us having that deterrent force. And I think it would be a retreat and it would not do anything to speed up negotiations with them if we now fell back and delayed deploying."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/17/business/stocks-continue-fall-dow-off-2.51.html": {"writer_name": "Alexander Hammer", "pub_date": "1984-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 587, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DOW OFF 2.51", "print_headline": "STOCKS CONTINUE FALL; DOW OFF 2.51", "body_text": " **********Stock prices, which were under pressure last week, retreated further yesterday in slower trading. **********The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.51 points yesterday, to 1,267.59.

SANGER **********The Hewlett-Packard Company, seeking to bolster its late entry into the personal computer market last year, will introduce a lightweight ''lap'' computer in the next few weeks. Industry analysts say it will be significantly more advanced than any now made by the major computer manufacturers. **********Company officials hope the machine, code-named Nomad, will increase sales of the HP 150, Hewlett's first personal computer, which has met a mixed sales response. **********Industry sources, some of whom have seen the new machine, say it will weigh 9 pounds, will run nearly all the programs written for the HP 150 and will include at least two programs built into its permanent memory: the Lotus 1-2-3 financial spreadsheet-and-graphics package and a word processing program. **********Easy to Use, Analyst Says **********''It will be very easy to use, very elegant,'' said Adam F. Cuhney, a technology analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. ''Most of the other lap computers we have seen are somewhat clumsy machines.'' It will also be more powerful. Like the HP 150, the Nomad is a high-speed microcomputer, capable of processing 16 bits of information at a time and including a minimum of 256,000 characters of internal memory. **********Officials of Hewlett-Packard decline to discuss the new machine, other than to confirm that a portable computer will be announced next month. Analysts, however, expect the Nomad to carry a base price of about $3,000 and appeal primarily to the professional market. **********Apple Computer Inc. is expected to introduce a less powerful, $1,300 lap computer next week, aimed primarily at more casual home and professional users looking for a portable version of the popular Apple II. **********Growth Expected for Sector **********Thus, Apple and Hewlett are staking out positions at the low and high ends, respectively, of what many analysts expect may be the fastest-growing sector of the microcomputer industry over the next few years: the market for battery-operated computers weighing less than 10 pounds and designed for business executives or writers who travel a lot. **********The first such machines appeared last year, marketed by a number of small American and Japanese manufacturers, including Sharp and the Nippon Electric Company. So far the industry leader, the International Business Machines Corporation, has announced only a 30-pound ''luggable'' computer, although it is rumored to be working on several lightweight portables. **********Hewlett reportedly hopes that beating I.B.M. to the lap model market will help Hewlett's own developing line of personal computers. **********Sales Falling Short of Goal **********But initial sales of its first entry, the HP 150, have been sluggish. One analyst, Michael J. Krasko, reported last week that Hewlett was falling 50 percent short of its goal of shipping 8,000 HP 150's a month. The company has also had trouble making some programs work with its unusual ''touchscreen'' technology. This lets a user move a column of numbers, for example, just by pointing to it on the computer screen. **********''Hewlett is still defining its role in the computer market,'' Mr. Krasko said. ''They hope Nomad will give dealers the feeling that the company is committed to the business.'' **********Like the HP 150, the appeal of the nine-pound Nomad is expected to be its advanced features, particularly its built-in programs. On most desktop models, software is installed through disk drives and loaded in the computer's temporary memory. **********Some Programs Permanent **********But Hewlett-Packard, working with the Lotus Development Corporation and other software vendors, etched Lotus 1-2-3 and other programs on permanent chips known as ''Read Only Memory'' chips, or ROM's. Thus, when the power is turned on, these programs are read automatically by the machine. **********Such technology has been used before, as on the Radio Shack Model 100, currently the best-selling lap model.

Their normal pace returns until the next shell lands, perhaps an hour or two later, day and night. **********One foreign resident said that since last month, when Iranian forces began shelling Basra from their nearest positions, about 10 miles to the east, the pace of this sprawling city of around one million people had been slow and sullen. The port has been idle since the war with Iran began in 1980 and Iran cut off its use. **********To see freighters from many nations riding empty and high at their moorings for more than three years, knowing that between here and the Persian Gulf there are 80 such vessels rusting for a fourth year, does little to cheer the people of Basra, since the port and their livelihoods were one.   No Serious Food Shortage **********Many shopkeepers have padlocked their shutters and gone away, and the majority of shops that remain open have little to offer. Sharp import restrictions, because of the high cost of the war, have reduced Iraqi consumption largely to what their own country produces. **********Although some items are in irregular supply, there seems to be no serious food shortage. The smell of roasting mutton pervades the center of what was once a bustling city, and the piles of flat bread and sticky pastries seem ample. **********The local fertilizer factory has put its sacks at the disposal of those who fill them with sand and pile them in front of their shop windows. Sandbag shelters are constructed near bridges for the soldiers guarding them. **********Despite the barricade of sandbags, the Sheraton Hotel has some broken windows around its entrance doors.   Shell Hit a Hospital **********At that, the hotel was more fortunate than the hospital a few hundred yards farther down the Shatt al Arab, the waterway formed by the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates. Some patients at the hospital were killed last week when a shell hit, and others were wounded. **********A local information official said he thought three patients were killed. Total casualty figures, however, were not available. **********At least one civilian was killed Monday, at midmorning, and perhaps nine others wounded in shelling. **********Iraqis say they believe the Iranian gunners are intentionally hitting such targets as the hospital. The information officials said the Iranians had tried to hit the hospital for weeks. **********Maj. Gen. Mamer Abdel Rashid, who commands Iraqi troops in this sector, said his gunners had not hit a single civilian target in Iran. But if the orders come from Baghdad, he said, his gunners are ready to shell all Iranian cities within their range. **********''For each 100 enemy shells,'' he said, leaning on a heavy, straight cane ending in a large wooden loop, ''they will receive 3,000 Iraqi shells.''  Suspicion About Foreigners **********Basra is dirtier than Baghdad, and much rotting garbage fouls its streets. Foreigners are nowhere met with the friendly curiosity that is generally customary, and shopkeepers do not invite foreigners in for a cup of tea. Soldiers dominate the city scene and grimly inquire about a stroller's business. **********The many men trying to make a living shining shoes find few customers, and beggars get few alms. **********Although military officers briefing reporters express the belief that a battle for the city may be near, General Rashid said there was no possibility of such a battle. **********''We don't have to defend Basra,'' he said. ''We wait impatiently for the enemy to cross the border. We will annihilate him before he gets here.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/04/world/nigerians-say-british-papers-fabricated-crate-news-item.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nigerians Say British Papers 'Fabricated' Crate News Item", "print_headline": "Nigerians Say British Papers 'Fabricated' Crate News Item", "body_text": " **********The Nigerian High Commission here said today that the British press had 'fabricated' a news item about a crate to embarrass Nigeria. **********In a statement, the High Commission referred to a report in The Times of London on Saturday that Bernard Banfa, managing director of Nigeria Airways, was thought to have left London in a crate marked as diplomatic baggage. **********The Times said Mr. Banfa was wanted for questioning about the attempted kidnapping of a former Nigerian Transport Minister, Umaru Dikko, who was found July 5 drugged in a crate about to be loaded on a Nigerian plane. **********Mr. Banfa's wife said Saturday in Lagos that her husband was in Nigeria, but she would not comment further."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/20/business/a-korean-export-rise.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 37, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Korean Export Rise", "print_headline": "A Korean Export Rise", "body_text": " **********South Korean exports of electrical and electronic products rose 48.4 percent, to $2.9 billion, in the first eight months of 1984 from a year earlier, an industry trade group said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/21/business/futures-options-ginnie-mae-contracts-down-in-volatile-day.html": {"writer_name": "H.

At the close, the spot March contract was down 14/32 for the day, at 69 7/32, after having ranged between 70 10/32 and 69 3/32. The Ginnie Mae contract for June delivery fell 11/32, to 68 17/32. **********''There were several factors causing the volatility, none of which represented any surprising or significant changes in the interest rate situation,'' said Richard L. Sandor, senior vice president of Drexel Burnham Lambert in Chicago. **********As one factor, for example, Wednesday is the expiration date for the March contract. Many traders switched out of this Ginnie Mae contract and into Treasury bond futures, Mr. Sandor said. **********Also, many traders and hedgers in Government National Mortgage Association certificates may have been preparing for the introduction on Thursday of Ginnie Mae II futures in the same trading pit at the Chicago Board of Trade. Mr. Sandor said people in the financial markets expect the new contracts to be more successful than the present Ginnie Mae futures, which will continue to be traded. **********Different Kind of Instrument One reason for the optimism is the fact that the Ginnie Mae II futures will be directly deliverable instruments. The present contracts represent collateralized depository receipts, which the recipient must then exchange for an actual Ginnie Mae certificate. **********Michael P. Kamradt, the Board of Trade's financial marketing chief, said: ''Although the difference may seem technical to the average trader, who only cares whether prices go up or down and never takes delivery of the underlying instrument, they are very important to banks and other institutional hedgers. The Ginnie Mae II futures were designed to reduce and simplify the hedging costs of the growing number of mortgage originators, dealers and investors in this rapidly exapnding market.'' **********If those who grant or invest in mortgages can conveniently and economically insure their portfolios with the futures and the soon-to-be-introduced options on the Ginnie Mae II futures, they will be more willing to originate and invest in mortgages despite the uncertainty of interest rates, Mr. Kamradt said. **********Basically, Ginnie Maes are created when grantors of mortgages package them into units of $100,000 or more and sell them to the quasi-Government agency. The mortgage lender may receive a point or so above the rate homeowners pay and then presumably will have fresh cash to lend to home buyers. **********Banks and other lenders also enjoy the fees they receive for processing the monthly payments homeowners make on the mortgages. **********As for the Government National Mortgage Association, it deposits the packaged mortgages with a bank, issues certificates on the package and then sells them to investors, many of whom are attracted by the relatively high monthly interest yields on these instruments. The funds received from investors are then used to buy more mortgages from banks and other lenders, thus completing and widening the circle of available money for home buyers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/27/world/4-u-s-jews-charged-in-palestinian-attacks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 224, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "4 U.

By Wednesday morning, they were still in disagreement on several key issues, including which religious faction would win control of the Ministry of Religious Affairs.    Atmosphere of Crisis **********The atmosphere of crisis Wednesday was heightened by the fact that, just 24 hours earlier, it seemed that both parties had completed agreement on the formation of a national unity government that would have had the support of more than 80 of the 120 members of Parliament. ''We had the champagne on ice,'' said one Labor Party official.  But the celebrating was premature. Instead, the two parties spent Tuesday night locked in tense talks in the Dan Hotel in Tel Aviv. The immediate point of disagreement was whether the Ministry of Religious Affairs, with its considerable patronage and influence over the nation's religious schools and institutions, would be given to the Sephardi Torah Guardians Association, known as Shas, a right- wing ethnic splinter of the Orthodox Agudat Israel party. Mr. Shamir revealed Tuesday that Likud had promised the portfolio to Shas, while Labor had pledged to hold it in reserve for three months, ostensibly for the National Religious Party. The two religious parties, each with four seats in Parliament, are fierce rivals. **********After another long day of negotiations Wednesday, Labor Party sources said tonight that the problem had been overcome by a compromise under which the Ministry of Religious Affairs would be left vacant and would be administered temporarily by the Prime Minister's office. **********Control of the Religious Affairs Ministry is a sensitive issue here. Moreover, the dispute masks a major struggle for power within the Likud bloc between Mr. Shamir and former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon. **********Mr. Sharon, who is challenging Mr. Shamir for the Likud leadership, created a furor Tuesday evening at a meeting of the Likud Central Committee by demanding that the bloc stick by its commitment to Shas. Anything less, he charged, would be a failure of leadership. Allies of Mr. Sharon quickly took the floor during the tumultuous meeting to echo the charges against Mr. Shamir. One pro-Sharon member, David Magen, shouted that Mr. Shamir was ''not built to be number one anymore.'' **********On the defensive, Mr. Shamir returned to the negotiations with Mr. Peres. With his leadership at stake, he was under intense pressure to extract more concessions from Labor, including a commitment to go ahead with a number of new settlements on the occupied West Bank. The draft agreement worked out with Labor commits the proposed national unity Government to build only six new settlements in the first year. Likud has built 120 such settlements since taking power in 1977 and has vowed to put more than 100,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank. Labor wants to freeze the construction of new settlements. **********When it became clear that Labor and Likud could not reach agreement on this and a number of other points, the National Religious Party announced that it would be willing to commit its four seats to a narrow coalition led by Labor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/15/world/honduran-says-us-copter-flew-over-nicaragua.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1984-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 436, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HONDURAN SAYS U.S. COPTER FLEW OVER NICARAGUA", "print_headline": "HONDURAN SAYS U.S. COPTER FLEW OVER NICARAGUA", "body_text": " **********The commander of the Honduran Armed Forces has acknowledged that the American helicopter whose pilot was killed Wednesday near the border with Nicaragua was over Nicaraguan territory when first attacked. **********Gen.

Among other things, it would require wives' written approval if their husbands decided not to provide them with widows' pension benefits, protect women workers against loss of their accrued pension rights during leaves for childbirth and child-rearing, and provide pension benefits to women whose husbands died before they reached early-retirement age. **********With the women's vote a major consideration in this election year, the legislation is considered as American and noncontroversial as apple pie. Passage is considered almost certain by summer, unless Congress becomes enmeshed in controversy over the pending tax bill, and already both political parties are claiming credit for it. **********But even supporters say there may be less there than meets the eye. ''The Administration is going to get a lot of political mileage out of something that is pretty hollow, and the Democrats are jumping on the bandwagon, too,'' said Robin Block of William M. Mercer-Meidinger Inc., a New York employee benefits consulting firm. **********She and other pension experts say that while the legislation is long overdue, it will help a relatively small number of women and that further changes will be necessary before women achieve true pension parity with men. ''It will not have much impact on the ability of women workers to earn meaningful pension benefits,'' said Judith F. Mazo, vice president of the Martin E. Segal Company, another New York benefits consulting firm. **********There are three legislative proposals under consideration, but they are nearly identical. There are two versions of the Retirement Equity Act, each passed late last year by the Senate and the House Education and Labor Committee, and the House Ways and Means Committee is currently drafting a third version. All three would try to improve benefits both for women workers and the wives of men workers. First, the bills would require a spouse's written consent if the working partner decided to waive something known as the joint and survivor's option. **********This option guarantees that the widow or widower of a worker will receive a pension after the worker's death. But some workers elect not to take the option because it means they receive a somewhat smaller pension while they are alive. **********Although the joint and survivor option is automatically provided in most private pension plans, current law permits workers to waive the provision without informing their spouses. Under the proposed legislation, a spouse's written consent would be required, and the signature would have to be notarized or witnessed by a plan official. **********''It gives a spouse a controlling say about what happens to an employee's pension,'' said Miss Mazo. ''It is the harbinger of a national community property law, but only with respect to retirement plan benefits.'' **********The bills would also try to protect the accrued pension rights of women workers who take leaves for childbirth and child-rearing. Under the proposals, any pension credits that a person had earned toward his or her pension would have to be restored if the person returned to work within five years after leaving the job. Ironically, this provision might help men more than women, according to Miss Block. ''Many more men than women leave - usually for other jobs - and return within five years,'' she said. **********In addition, the bills would protect parents, including adoptive parents, who take maternity or paternity leaves. Under the bills, absences during the year or the year after a child is born would not constitute a break in service for pension purposes. **********The legislation would also allow women, who tend to enter the work force earlier than men, to join private pension plans and get credit for their work at a younger age. Workers would be allowed to participate in plans at age 21 rather than the current limit of 25. Credit for vesting (or the right to a pension after a certain number of years even if you leave your job before retirement) would begin at age 18 instead of 22. **********Third, the bills would provide survivors' benefits to women whose husbands die before reaching the earliest retirement age under their company's plan. Currently, women whose husbands die before reaching early-retirement age, usually 55, receive no pensions at all, even if their husbands had worked for the company for 25 or 30 years. **********THE three bills would ''lock in'' pension benefits for survivors at a much earlier age, although the starting times for such protection differ. Under the Senate bill, benefits would be payable once a worker reached age 45 with 10 years of service; under the House Labor Committee bill, at any age after 10 years of service, and under the House Ways and Means bill, at any age once a person had a vested right to his pension. **********Some pension consultants contend that the benefits afforded by this proposal are so small that they are meaningless. ''It's a very trivial form of protection,'' maintained Lloyd S. Kaye, a principal with Mercer-Meidinger. ''Survivors' benefits are not worth very much, even at age 55 with a substantial amount of service.'' **********He gave the example of a husband with 20 years of service to a company, who dies and leaves a wife five years younger than he. ''We're usually talking about a survivor annuity of 5 to 10 percent of the employee's annual compensation,'' he said. ''It's not nothing, but it's not much more than chopped liver.'' **********But some pension experts disagree. Anne E. Moss, director of the the women's pension project at the Pension Rights Center in Washington, estimated that the provision would provide benefits to some 70,000 women over a five-year period - ''a whole class of women who never received them before.'' **********The bill ''will make a dramatic difference'' to those it does help, said an aide to the House Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations. ''Our files are replete with letters from women whose husbands died weeks, days or hours before turning 55. For such women, it will mean a difference between nothing and something.'' Finally, all three bills would codify the differing state rules regarding the right of a divorced spouse to an ex-mate's pension when the worker is in arrears on alimony or child support. **********Most pension experts agree that many more changes are needed before women's pensions are on a par with men's, but they differ on the prescription. ''My own feeling is that women's pensions are much smaller than men's because of the types of jobs they take, but that's a salary issue and we can't solve that here,'' said Miss Block."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/15/business/business-people-ex-first-chicago-chief-starts-own-company.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 345, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-First Chicago Chief Starts Own Company", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Ex-First Chicago Chief Starts Own Company", "body_text": " **********Wherever A.

But even as it grew into a metropolitan center of more than three million people, it clung tenaciously to a modest sense of scale. **********When growth threatened to spurt uncontrollably a decade ago, the city put a two-year moratorium on the construction of buildings taller than 45 feet. Residents have repeatedly succeeded in stopping the building of expressways and other big developments; inner-city housing has grown even faster than the metallic skyline, and the St. Lawrence neighborhood, where groups ranging from labor unions to Soviet emigres have joined to form low-cost housing cooperatives on an abandoned industrial site, has drawn worldwide recognition. **********'A World-Class Way' **********But what Walt Whitman, after a visit in 1880, called ''a lively, dashing place'' is today perched on the brink of a new kind of future, even as it celebrates its 150th birthday this year. The talk is grand, and the plans grander: a domed stadium, giant office complexes, a monorail. The goal, Mayor Arthur Eggleton says, is to grow ''in a world- class way.'' **********The centerpiece of the Mayor's plans is his proposal to turn land now occupied by railroad tracks into an enormous real estate development. In the next 20 years, billions of dollars would be spent to create new office space for 40,000 to 50,000 workers and thousands of new housing units. There would also be parks and recreation and cultural centers. **********The proposal combines a convention center and hotel now being built, a new headquarters for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and continued building along the waterfront. **********''A boom city idea is beginning to take hold,'' Jack Layton, an alderman, said.   The Project Has Critics **********Critics, including Mr. Layton, say they believe the project is antithetical to the sort of measured growth that once prompted the United States Committee on Economic Development to urge American cities to be guided by ''the Toronto experience.'' **********Among other things, foes say that the development ignores the interests of 10,000 Toronto families in urgent need of public housing, that it would lead to the building of more freeways and that all the offices are not needed anyway. If they are, the critics say, they should be built elsewhere. **********Opponents say the project's biggest weakness is that much of the housing construction will not be completed until perhaps 1995, if ever. They contend that housing should be built first, arguing that since the need for housing is greater than for offices - the commercial vacancy rate is already high - more immediate jobs would result. **********Opposition is strong, reflected by the fact that 53 of 60 people who testified in public hearings opposed the proposal. **********''Do we want to be Dallas?'' said John Sewell, a former Mayor who opposes the project. ''If Toronto is successful, it's because we worried about the people who lived here, not our image.'' **********Mrs. Jacobs still lives in Toronto, but seldom appears in public and declines to talk to the press. Thus, no one is sure exactly what she thinks of the railway land development.   City Council Backs Plan **********The development, approved by the City Council in December but still requiring other regulatory approvals, parallels similar efforts in Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal and Halifax to convert under-used railway land to more economical purposes. **********In Toronto, removal of the tracks would serve an even more important purpose than simple economic advantage. The tracks effectively block the rest of the city from Lake Ontario, the geographic feature that Whitman said he thought gave Toronto its character. **********''You can say Lake Ontario is on the wrong side of the tracks,'' Mayor Eggleton said in an interview last week. He argued that his proposal would ''turn a barrier into a gateway,'' opening up ''a new frontier.'' **********His enthusiasm is matched by the two railroad companies - Canadian Pacific Ltd., Canada's biggest company, and Canadian National Railways, owned by the Government - that are putting up the land. The companies, in turn, would be allowed to develop the real estate.   Railway Station Will Remain **********Significantly, opponents may have a more difficult time this round. Their earlier success was mainly a result of concern over historic Union Station, which would have been demolished under the first proposal but not under the latest one. Most council votes have favored development by a 15-to-8 vote. **********Still, Mr. Sewell, the former Mayor, suggests that opponents can use various regulatory forums to cause the project to be halted. The way things are accomplished in Toronto, he said, is for all factions to hold seemingly endless meetings, laboriously striving toward a consensus, as was done in planning the St. Lawrence neighborhood a decade ago. Instead, Mayor Eggleton announced the project, illustrating his remarks with an elaborate scale model.   A Matter of Process **********''We've got far past that in Toronto politics,'' Mr. Sewell said. ''People will say: 'You've excluded us. We'll get you!' '' **********Indeed, many of the opponents' concerns seem to be as much over process as substance. In the 1970's, Toronto developed a broad plan gearing development to decentralized conglomerations of office buildings along public transportation lines. The idea was to ease pressure on commercial development in the core, while encouraging people to live there. **********Planners agree that the concept is beginning to work. The worry now is that extensive railway lands development will again crowd people downtown, reversing hard-won gains. **********The Mayor's thinking is that as the project goes ahead, specific problems can be addressed. He appears to have considerable support, even from some of his public opponents. **********Walter Majeski, the president of the Labor Council of Metropolitan Toronto, politically supports the project's opponents. His bottom line, however, is clear. ''In the final analysis,'' he said, ''we'll support it, because it does create jobs.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/10/world/space-arms-debate-over-value-of-a-treaty.html": {"writer_name": "Charles Mohr", "pub_date": "1984-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 850, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SPACE ARMS: DEBATE OVER VALUE OF A TREATY", "print_headline": "SPACE ARMS: DEBATE OVER VALUE OF A TREATY", "body_text": " **********A dispute within the Reagan Administration over whether an antisatellite weapons pact with the Soviet Union can be verified appears to be clouded by two factors: the parties to the argument within the Government are talking about different kinds of treaties, and they are governed by different motives. **********The argument within the Administration is proceeding against the background of a dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union over the topics to be discussed at a meeting on space weapons that the Russians proposed to be held in Vienna in September. **********President Reagan indicated a willingness to accept, but reserved the right to bring up other subjects as well, such as the discussions on medium- range and strategic nuclear missiles that were interrupted last year. **********The Soviet Union has accused the United States of setting preconditions for the proposed talks, and has said that there will be no meeting unless the two sides agree beforehand on what is to be discussed. **********Although the United States has yet to reach a bargaining position for negotiations on space weapons, some influential officials are expected to insist that any treaty at most only limit, rather than halt, the development of antisatellite weapons. When these officials say that a treaty cannot be verified, they are speaking of one that would ban possession of such weapons.   Scientists Favor a Treaty **********Advocates of a treaty include American scientists banded together in such groups as the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Federation of American Scienists, scientists acting in their own capacity, and a number of, mostly Democratic, members of Congress. **********These advocates agree that a ban on possession is probably impossible to verify. However, they want an accord that would prohibit testing of antisatellite weapons in space and deployment on the ground. **********A prohibition of testing and deployment, these advocates argue, would be verifiable, and would halt weapon development. **********Understanding the debate depends, in part, on some knowledge of the progress the United States and the Soviet Union have made in the development of these weapons and their longe- range goals. **********United States officials detected 20 tests of a Soviet ground-launched antisatellite weapon system between 1968 and 1982. American officials believe that 45 percent of these tests were successful. However, the more advanced modifications in the system that would make it more difficult to foil with American countermeasures have failed. The Soviet weapon is launched from the ground by a 150-foot intercontinental ballistic missile and, in its only successful configuration, must make two earth orbits to approach its target, an undesirable system militarily. **********The United States is now developing a more advanced weapon that permits direct ascent to the target within a matter of minutes. It consists of a small, 18-foot rocket launched from an F-15 fighter plane. There was a test of the rockets in January, but it will not be tested against a space target until late this year. Both nations' weapons can now reach only low earth orbit targets, which makes many valuable satellites immune. **********The warhead of the American weapon is a cylinder only about 11 inches in diameter and 11 inches in length. The warhead of the Soviet weapon, discounting the 150-foot booster rocket, is slightly more than 18 feet long and weighs about 4,500 pounds. **********The United States reportedly plans to build 112 antisatellite weapons, to be stationed at two F-15 wings near Washington, D.C., and in Washington State. However, a special modification kit would permit any F-15 to be converted to an launcher within six hours and any jet airfield could become a base. **********Advocates of a treaty counter arguments about verification problems by saying that if the United States weapon is fully developed, Soviet verification of United States treaty compliance would become impossible because of the relatively small size of the rocket and almost minute size of the warhead, as well as its potential deployment on any airfield.   Problems of Concealment **********But such advocates tend to agree that the 4,500 pound Soviet warhead could probably be concealed also. Such figures as Richard L. Garwin and Kurt Gottfried, two physicists who recommend a treaty, say that a treaty that prohibited space testing and ground deployment would work to the United States' advantage. They say that satellites could readily identify the deployment of the 150-foot Soviet launchers and other sensors could catch any test against a target in space. **********These and other figures argue that the present Soviet weapon is not really capable and could not be used in a conflict without further testing. **********Administration officials, on the other hand, have consistently described the Soviet weapon as already ''operational.'' **********As for motives, they have made clear that they want no treaty that would halt the development of a promising, probably superior, United States weapon. One suggestion is that they might recommend to President Reagan a treaty limiting the altitude of antisatellite weapons to low orbit targets, but no more."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/12/business/fcc-repeals-regional-rule.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 179, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "F.C.C.

Cohalan, one of Lilco's harshest critics, said he hoped the changes would mean a ''fresh look and a new approach to the Shoreham problem.'' **********A board member who asked not to be identified said last week that while the directors admired Mr. Pierce's leadership, they felt his tough stance on Shoreham and his refusal to compromise with critics had eliminated any possibility of settling the issues that stand in the way of the plant's opening. **********The board member also said the board's displeasure was compounded earlier this month when Lilco decided to withhold more than $26.2 million in property tax payments to Suffolk County and the Town of Brookhaven, in which Shoreham is situated. **********Late last year, reports said, the board went so far as to ask Mr. Pierce, whose salary was $215,000 a year, to leave one of its meetings. **********Other reports indicated that Mr. Pierce had offered to resign last year, but no action was taken.  The Shoreham project, the most ex pensive in the country, has suffered repeated technical setbacks, the most recent being the failure of the emergency diesel generators that must be approved before the plant can obtain the operating license.

In a two-sentence statement, Lilco's 11 directors said: ''We are deeply grateful to Charles Pierce for his dedicated service to Lilco throughout his 34-year association with the company. We express our sincere admiration and appreciation for his past leadership.'' **********Members of the board declined to discuss their deliberations yesterday and Jan K. Hickman, a company spokesman, refused to relay requests for interviews to Mr. Pierce or Mr. Catacosinos. She said Mr. Catacosinos would outline his plans for Lilco at a news conference on Feb. 8. **********She said the rest of Lilco's management team was unaffected by the changes.  Mr. Cohalan, the Suffolk County Executive, said, ''It seems that this is an opportunity for all of us to sit together to begin to hash out the economic solution that everyone recognizes must come about with respect to the Shoreham nuclear power plant.'' **********Analysts' Concerns **********But some utility analysts were concerned that the changes did not come soon enough. **********''If they had done this five years ago, it probably would have been a good move,'' said Charles Komanoff, a Manhattan economist who specializes in utility rates and who has been critical of Lilco. **********He added, ''I think the company has suffered from a kind of insularity, where everybody in a top managerial position throughout the whole Shoreham episode has been with the company and only with the company for a very long period of time.'' **********Mr. Pierce, who was a World War II bomber pilot, joined Lilco's legal department in 1949, shortly after he received his law degree from Columbia University. He was named president and a director in 1974 and chairman in 1978. **********Over the years he earned a reputation for smoothing the way for power plants that local residents did not want in their backyards. He also gained public recognition in 1982 and 1983 by making strongly worded radio commercials in favor of Shoreham. **********Mr. Catacosinos began working by sweeping and mopping floors in his father's grocery store in Harlem. Thirty years later, in 1969, he founded Applied Digital Data Systems Inc. in Hauppauge, L.I., and sometimes found himself sweeping floors again as he worked to get the company off the ground. **********Applied Digital lost $2.2 million in its first three years. But Mr. Catacosinos pledged his home and cars to guarantee a $350,000 loan to the struggling company, which grew to be a profitable manufacturer of computer terminals. In 1980 the NCR Corporation of Dayton, Ohio, bought it for $60.5 million. **********Mr. Catacosinos was also a founder of Corometrics Medical Systems Inc., which was sold to American Home Products in 1974 for $20 million, a deal that netted Mr. Catacosinos $2 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/13/world/around-the-world-120973.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD", "body_text": " **********Cameroon Says 70 Died In Attempt at Coup **********ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, April 12 (AP) - Cameroon said tonight that 70 people were killed and 51 wounded last week in an unsuccessful attempt by part of the presidential palace guard to take over the West African nation. **********The Government communique was read over the Yaounde radio and monitored here.

So those who monitor the involuntary resettlement of blacks count the outhouses, not the homes, to reach an estimate of how many people the Government ultimately wishes to resettle. **********Over the last 20 years, the tally has mounted to 3.5 million people prevailed upon by the authorities to leave ancestral lands and implant frail tendrils in new, unchosen places.   Successes for Civil Rights **********In recent months white civil rights groups appear to have scored some successes in slowing some resettlements, playing on the authorities' sensitivity to adverse publicity: television footage of bulldozers flattening homes, churches and schools does not, it is calculated, help South Africa's image. **********The victories, however, have been ambiguous, for they have not deflected the authorities from a policy designed to offset the arithmetical threat of the black majority by moving black people into what are called homelands: geographical creations of Pretoria's fashioning, in which blacks automatically cede South African citizenship and thus any legal claim to influence the nation's future. **********Moreover, civil rights workers concede, their victories apply only to those ''black spots'' that come to public attention, not to those where removal is enacted without public scrutiny. Even in those places where the authorities are temporarily restrained from evicting settled populations, the delay produces more anxiety about a fickle future than relief at a postponement of uncertain duration. **********Thus, at a place called Mathopestad, close to the town of Boons, 60 miles west of Johannesburg, a community ''has been living under the threat of removal for years,'' according to a white civil rights worker from an organization called Black Sash. The authorities, and the people there, know removal is scheduled, but no one will say when it will take place.   Resistance Is Scattered **********At Magopa, 30 miles to the southwest, some of the 300 families resisted a Government edict ordering them to move late last year. The rebellious villagers, whose ancestors bought the land 70 years ago, are still at Magopa, clinging, despite the bulldozing of schools and churches after some of their clanspeople left and resettled where the Government instructed.  On Wednesday 300 families at a place called Badplaas refused to leave their homes in the Eastern Transvaal, 200 miles east of Johannesburg, a region associated by most whites with vacations in the hills, trout fishing and mineral spas. **********The authorities had given them until Wednesday to move or face eviction. They did not move, indeed vowed to stay on, and they were not forcibly removed, apparently because activists had been able to publicize their plight. **********Their case, thus, is pending, somewhere in the void between official intent and official action. In the temporary standoff, black resistance faces attrition, for the threat of eviction is not removed. All in all, Black Sash officials said, some two million blacks are still on the Government's waiting list for removal.   13 Percent of the Land **********Critics dispute the process by which millions of blacks will be herded into the 13 percent of South Africa's surface area that forms the homelands. **********But in the logic that obtains here, a senior official said that if black-ruled Africa's great showcase of democracy - Nigeria - could not survive, why should one man, one vote fare any better in, or be urged upon, South Africa? **********The arguments derive from the ideology of apartheid, which holds that those of differing skin pigmentation, and even those of the same color but of different tribe, must be kept apart. **********At Badplaas the justification for the eviction is derived from a law stipulating that blacks with certain rights may only reside in what are called ''prescribed areas.'' Badplaas is, indeed, a prescribed area. But, under a related law, blacks must also live in areas formally proclaimed as townships. The Badplaas settlement has not been proclaimed a township, despite the fact that the people have lived there since the end of the 19th century, because the Government chooses not to do so. Their residence, thus, is deemed illegal. **********The authorities want to move them to another place 20 miles away that lies, by the Government's cartography, not in South Africa itself but in KaNgwane, the ''homeland'' set aside for people of Swazi descent, an entity recognized only by Pretoria.  Poor Opinion of 'Homelands' **********The leader of the Badplaas families is Chief Johannes Dhlamini, who is also the chairman of the Swazi Council of Chiefs in South Africa. He would not, it seems from interviews, oppose the incorporation of Badplaas into Swaziland, the recognized, independent kingdom that lies close by, from which he claims ancestry. But he does not want to move away from his ancestral lands and he does not want to go to a homeland. Life in the homelands is viewed as hard. **********His opposition to the eviction, assisted by Black Sash activists, was made easier by what may be an irredeemable flaw in the authorities' own tactics. When the Government served eviction orders, they set a deadline for departure. The deadline, in turn, enabled Chief Dhlamini to determine the day to invite the press along as a deterrent to the authorities. **********A Black Sash worker said that, in the past, the authorities used deadlines as a way to intimidate people into moving ''voluntarily'' instead of awaiting eviction. Now that the deadlines had effectively become a tipoff for activists, the Black Sash worker said, civil rights workers feared the authorities would enforce their will without advance notice. **********The people at Badplaas are required to move to one of three farms in KaNgwane. At one of them, the authorities have built 75 tin homes whose walls are too hot to touch at midday. But that may not fully represent the Government's long-term plan for the place. Beyond the 75 homes the rows of outhouses march resolutely on, as far as the eye can see."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/06/business/dispute-over-fighter-exports.html": {"writer_name": "Charles Mohr", "pub_date": "1984-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DISPUTE OVER FIGHTER EXPORTS", "print_headline": "DISPUTE OVER FIGHTER EXPORTS", "body_text": " **********The Defense Department says it is ''pressing hard'' to encourage developing countries to purchase fighter planes that are made specifically for export and are relatively cheap to buy and easy to maintain. **********At the same time, department officials conceded in Congressional testimony last week that not one of these FX, or fighter export, aircraft has been sold. Instead, they said, in the last three years the United States has sold 1,100 of the more complex and expensive jet fighters now used by the Air Force and Navy. **********By some estimates the market for export fighter planes could reach $30 billion or more in the next few years because of the need of many foreign countries to replace their aging air forces. **********The Northrop Corporation, which will have spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars by the end of the year on one such export fighter, The F-20 Tigershark, complains that Government efforts to promote FX sales have been ''notably lacking.'' **********Several members of the Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs of the House Foreign Affairs Committee have also been critical of the Administration's efforts. **********Despite the stated policy, the Administration overturned longstanding United States practices and began in 1981 to sell so-called inventory jet fighters, specifically General Dynamics' F-16 and McDonnell Douglas's F-15 and F-18 planes, to some less developed nations. Before that, Northrop's F-5 Freedom Fighter, made specifically for export, was the plane sold primarily to foreign countries. **********William Schneider Jr., the Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, told the House panel that once Washington began making exceptions to established policy, the acquisition of United States ''inventory'' aircraft became a matter of prestige among the leaders of third- world countries. The result, he said, was that marketing efforts by the makers of two FX fighters ''have met stiff resistance.'' **********Mr. Schneider testified, however, that the United States would now begin what he called ''comparative briefings'' to foreign governments, pointing out the benefits and superiorities of an FX fighter force over the costly, hard-to-maintain planes in use by the United States.  He conceded that until now the Government had been reluctant to offer such advice to some countries on the ground that they were the best judge of their own security needs. **********Two aircraft have been officially designated export fighters, or FX's, by the Air Force. One is Northrop's Tigershark, the first combat aircraft wholly designed and financed by a private company in 32 years. **********The other is the F-16/J79, built by the General Dynamics Corporation. It has the same airframe as the Air Force's F-16, but has an older engine and fewer electronic refinements than the two models of standard F-16's. **********Big Market Seen **********For Northrop and General Dynamics a pro-FX effort by the Administration could produce a lot of business. ''What is really at stake is a competition among the aerospace companies for a market of at least $30 billion, but maybe much more, in the next few years,'' said a Government official, who asked not to be identified. **********For example, about 2,500 relatively simple F-5 Freedom Fighters, which have been built since 1964 by Northrop and sold to many countries, are now aging and will need to be replaced, along with other aircraft nearing obsolescence in foreign air forces. **********The breakdown of the FX policy has been more frustrating for Northrop than for other aircraft companies, because it has all but eliminated its foreign sales. **********General Dynamics, on the other hand, has sold F-16's to Pakistan, Venezuela, South Korea and Turkey. And McDonnell Douglas has sold its new Navy fighter, the F-18, to Spain, Canada and Australia, and previously sold 52 of its F-15's to Saudi Arabia. **********Singapore's Plans **********The small island nation of Singapore recently expressed an intent to buy eight F-16/J79's, but officials said that if Washington ultimately agreed to sell Thailand and the Philippines the regular F-16's, which they are requesting, Singapore would probably ask for the same treatment. **********Northrop's inability to sell any F-20's does not appear to be related to any shortcomings in the combat capability of the aircraft. In fact, the Administration refused permission for its sale in two potentially lucrative markets, Taiwan and India, on the ground that it was too good. **********Its high performance was believed unacceptable to the Chinese Communist Government for sale to Taiwan, and the Air Force refuses to permit the F-20's advanced combat electronics to go to India, where there are ''too many Russians.'' **********''What Northrop is doing is the best I've ever seen,'' the Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. Charles A. Gabriel, told the House Appropriations Committee last month. **********A Key Problem **********Both Government officials and Northrop executives agree that a major problem inhibiting purchase of the F-20 is that foreign leaders conclude that because the Air Force has no plans to buy any F-20's it must not be as good as inventory airplanes. **********Brig. Gen. Thomas Baker, the Air Force FX program manager, told the committee that the Air Force did not plan to buy the F-20 in part because it was not designed to have exceptionally long range and thus did not meet Air Force requirements for ''worldwide commitments.'' **********Thomas V. Jones, the chairman of Northrop, said that less developed countries, on the other hand, did not need long-range fighter planes because ''their enemies are so near.'' **********Northrop argues that the F-20 has a faster ''scramble,'' or takeoff time, than other fighters, and generates more daily flights because of its reliabililty and ease of maintenance. General Baker testified that ''we find the Northrop numbers very reasonable'' on such factors. **********Another Explanation **********Despite General Baker's brief explanation, another Pentagon official, who did not want to be identified, said that both the Air Force and the Navy had preferred to promote sales of their own fighters to ''amortize costs and to keep production lines open.'' **********This official and other authorities said that the Pentagon ''procurement community'' disliked privately designed aircraft, like the F-20, no matter how capable. **********Mr. Jones of Northrop testified that the corporation believed that no real attempt had been made to promote the F-20, and said that ''passive approval'' of the aircraft would not overcome the urge for prestige among third-world buyers. The Northrop chairman said that the White House should order the Air Force to tell other governments of the low costs and high performance of the plane. **********The testimony of Mr. Schneider and conversations with other officials made clear that one reason the Administration had not strongly pressed foreign governments to buy FX rather than inventory aircraft was the determination by the Reagan Administration in 1981 to stress what it perceived as a strong increase in the ''threat'' posed by the Soviet Union."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/24/business/chrysler-rebounds-in-quarter-and-year.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1984-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 560, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chrysler Rebounds In Quarter and Year", "print_headline": "Chrysler Rebounds In Quarter and Year", "body_text": " **********The Chrysler Corporation reported today that it earned $118.3 million, or 91 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1983 and a record $700.9 million, or $5.79 a share, for the year. **********Chrysler said the sharply improved results came despite a $223.9 million write-off to reflect the declining value of its 15 percent stake in P.S.A.

Record 1984 Earnings Seen **********\"As good as 1983 was, the numbers will look anemic compared to 1984,\" said Scott Merlis, an analyst with Shearson/American Express. **********He pointed out that Chrysler produced its record 1983 profit on unit sales of only 1,493,961. The auto maker's previous record profit - $422.6 million in 1976 - came on sales of 2,370,509 units. **********Chrysler's earnings for the year were helped by a tax credit of $399 million, carried forward from the $3.5 billion the company lost during the slump in auto sales that lasted from mid-1979 through late 1982. Robert S. Miller, Chrysler's executive vice president for finance, said the company still had available for use $1.6 billion in tax loss carry-forwards, plus $260 million in unused investment tax credits, which all but assures that the company will not pay taxes this year. **********Chrysler wrote down the value of its Peugeot stock, which it received in exchange for its European operations in the 1970's, on the recommendation of its auditors, Mr. Iacocca said. As a result, the auditor, Touch Ross & Company, gave the company a \"clean\" opinion on its financial statement, eliminating the qualifications included in recent years. **********Chrysler's return to prosperity will be reflected in its executives' paychecks.

''Clearly this is positive for home building stocks on a short- term basis.'' **********The amelioration of interest levels, which really began in May, and the eventual frenetic stock market rally have indeed been a boon for several home building stocks. Some have risen as much as 20 percent above their recent lows, and many analysts feel those issues could climb another 20 percent over the short term, should interest rates continue to fall. **********On Monday, for example, the Veterans Administration lowered its rate ceiling on basic home loans to 13 1/2 percent from 14 percent. **********The ''bulls'' maintain that over the long haul, say 18 to 24 months, prices of some home building stocks could easily double. With economic growth likely to slow by that time, they reason, interest rates should decline further, setting the stage for another strong housing cycle. **********All the same, even the most optimistic analysts stress the inherent vulnerability of home building equities. Indeed, the long-term rates have just jogged a bit upward, a development that some analysts expect will be short-lived.  And then, of course, there was last year's sudden turn, a catastrophe investors in home building are not likely to forget. The stocks surged to all-time highs in mid-May 1983. Then the prices of several of the better-known issues plummeted more than 70 percent and are still down in excess of 50 percent from their highs of 1983. The drop was precipitated by a pervasive rise in interest rates that many experts felt might bring the home building boom to an end. **********More recently, although some of the home building stocks have made impressive gains, traditional uncertainty over the course of rates has caused many analysts to lower their short- and long-term earnings estimates. **********Mr. Wilson of Shearson Lehman noted that while home building stocks tend to be very volatile - moving inversely with interest rates - there is relatively litle opportunity to hedge because only U.S. Home has options. He added that the investor could, of course, always sell another home building stock short to protect profits. **********At least for the moment, however, a sense of optimism has returned to the home building sector.

Opposition Seen Likely to Win **********After it began to appear likely that Mr. Neves would win the presidency, even under the Government's rules, reports began circulating that changes in the rules were being prepared. **********Establishment of the principle of party loyalty in Electoral College voting could upset the opposition's calculations because 361 members of the College formally belong to the Democratic Social Party. Brazil's Supreme Court is expected to rule on the issue this week, although some opposition spokesmen believe their candidate could still win a majority of the votes cast if pro-Neves members of the governing party boycotted the College. **********Mr. Maluf, a wealthy 53-year-old former Governor of Sao Paulo, has also suggested replacing the planned roll- call vote with a secret ballot. The opposition fears this would enable Mr. Maluf - who has been accused of trying to buy support - to recover votes from some College members who would not back him publicly.   Some Officers Favor Changes **********Foreign diplomats here said moves to change the rules had the sympathy of several Army officers and civilians in top positions in the departing administration, including the Army Minister, General Walter Pires; the head of the Presidential Guard, General Newton Cruz; the chief of military intelligence, General Octavio Medeiros, and the Justice Minister, Ibrahim Abi-Ackel. **********The diplomats said these officials were anxious to prevent leftists from recovering political ground and were concerned that a Neves government might be unable to prevent investigations into allegations of corruption or human-rights abuses under recent military Governments. **********But the diplomats stressed that most senior generals opposed perpetuation of the military Government and could tolerate a victory by Mr. Neves, a 74- year-old former Governor of Minas Gerais who is an avowed anti-Communist and who has promised to preside over a moderate transitionary Government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/09/world/beirut-violence-debate-canceled-beirut-lebanon-march-8-reuters-rocket-propelled.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 226, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BEIRUT VIOLENCE DEBATE CANCELED BEIRUT, Lebanon, March 8 (Reuters) - As rocket-propelled grenades exploded overhead, a special meeting of the Lebanese Parliament called to consider an inquiry into the latest upsurge of violence was postponed today for lack of a quorum.", "print_headline": "BEIRUT VIOLENCE DEBATE CANCELED BEIRUT, Lebanon, March 8 (Reuters) - As rocket-propelled grenades exploded overhead, a special meeting of the Lebanese Parliament called to consider an inquiry into the latest upsurge of violence was postponed today for lack of a quorum.", "body_text": " **********Only about 30 deputies braved shelling and shooting in central Beirut to attend the meeting.

(Personal Finance, Jan. 15), fails to mention that significant changes in divorce-taxation rules are imminent. Part of the unfinished business of the last session of Congress, the Domestic Relations Tax Reform Act of 1983, contains divorce tax revision unopposed by the I.R.S., the White House and both sides of the aisle, and probably will be adopted in 1984. **********This bill would eliminate the **********Davis  rule by which transfer of appreciated property as part of a divorce settlement results in a capital gains liabiity to the transferor. Instead, the transfer would be treated as a gift. The **********Davis  rule has been a thorn in the side of many a divorce settlement negotiation and a trap for the unwary. It has been said that the divorce lawyer who doesn't know divorce taxation is engaging in malpractice. This reform is long overdue. Meanwhile, some pending settlement negotiations should be delayed to avoid capital gains taxes that probably will be eliminated by act of Congress before the end of 1984. **********Transfer of the family home to the custodial parent as part of the settlement will be facilitated when the I.R.S. no longer has a seat at the equitable distribution table. **********The pending legislation would make other important changes in divorce taxation, including the excessively complicated rules as to who may take the dependency exemptions for minor children. The new rule, if enacted, would give the custodial parent the right to take the dependency exemptions for the children regardless of the amount of child support being paid by the noncustodial parent, unless the custodial parent had waived the right in writing. The bill also would eliminate the ''periodic'' requirement in the definition of alimony. JOHN V.

Gromyko held what was called a ''forceful and direct'' discussion today of the sharp differences between the United States and the Soviet Union. **********After the three-and-a-half-hour White House meeting and lunch, it was announced that Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Mr. Gromyko would hold further talks Saturday at the State Department. Mr. Shultz and Mr. Gromyko met for three hours in New York on Wednesday. **********Mr. Shultz, who spoke to reporters after the White House meeting, said Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gromyko had repeated their known positions at some length and with some force. He did not hold out the likelihood of an early narrowing of the gap between the two nations. **********'An Intense Discussion' **********''At the end of an intense discussion like this, it's not the sort of thing where you agree, 'All right, we'll do x, y and z,' '' he said, defending the value of a meeting in which there were apparently no tangible accords. **********(In Moscow, the Soviet public was told for the first time of the meeting during the national evening news broadcast, which included a two- minute videotape of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gromyko chatting before a White House fireplace. The broadcast did not include any commentary on Mr. Reagan's first formal meeting with a top Soviet leader, The Associated Press reported.) **********Mr. Gromyko issued a statement later through the Soviet press agency Tass in which he said the Soviet Union was still unconvinced ''about practical positive changes in the foreign policy course of the U.S. Administration.'' He noted that the President had called for more frequent meetings of senior officials from the two countries as a way of improving relations. He indicated that this would be a positive step, if it were combined with changes in the American stances at important negotiations. **********''But this is not the case,'' he said. **********Looking for 'Practical Deeds' **********''The Soviet Union will continue to judge real intentions of the U.S. side by its practical deeds,'' he said. ''The future will show whether Washington intends to adjust its political course.'' **********Tass said Mr. Gromyko had repeated the Soviet concern that the United States was seeking military superiority over the Soviet Union and was stepping up the arms race. But it added that Mr. Gromyko ''reaffirmed that the Soviet Union is ready for normalization and all-around development of relations between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. on the basis of equality, mutual respect and noninterference in the affairs of each other.'' **********''Such development of relations would make it possible to start serious talks on limiting and reducing arms, which would be of decisive importance in the entire international situation as well,'' Tass said. **********A White House official said Mr. Reagan opened the meeting by reading a statement he had written himself, in which he said the United States recognized the Soviet Union was a ''superpower'' and although the two countries differed in their political systems, they shared a moral responsibility to insure that their competition was peaceful. The official said Mr. Reagan said they also shared a responsibility to act together in reducing arms and in curbing regional disputes. **********On specific issues, he told the Soviet Union that if negotiations were held on banning the militarization of outer space, the United States would be willing to adopt ''restraints'' - suggesting a moratorium, as advocated by the Russians. But he said it was important to make progress in all areas of arms control, a reference to the American desire to combine talks on arms control in outer space with the resumption of negotiations on medium-range and strategic arms, suspended by the Soviet Union last year. **********Administration officials had been cautioning reporters not to expect breakthroughs, given the deep-seated distrust between the two sides, and the pending American elections. And afterward, Robert C. McFarlane, the national security adviser, said the discussions ''went about as expected.'' **********State Department officials said they hoped Mr. Reagan's strong appeal for the two sides to work together would be acted upon after the Nov. 6 election. They said that given the Soviet Union's preference for the arms-control positions held by Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic Presidential candidate, it was unrealistic to expect any positive response now to Mr. Reagan. **********Today Mr. Mondale issued a brief statement expressing disappointment that Mr. Shultz had not revealed more about the meeting. ''I hope that we are going to hear more about what was accomplished than what we heard from Secretary Shultz this afternoon,'' he said, ''and I hope they make progress in their meeting tomorrow.'' **********Mr. Shultz said the President's objective was to stress to Mr. Gromyko, as a member of the ruling Politburo, that ''we need to have a more constructive relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union and to express the many ways, again, he believes this can be done.'' **********''I'm sure that from the President's point of view, this position was made clearer,'' he said. Mr. Reagan, since last January, has been saying that because American military strength has been improved, he felt it important to seek better relations with Moscow. Last Monday, he devoted most of his speech at the United Nations to outlining ways that Soviet-American relations could be enhanced. He also stated his desire for arms-control accords. **********Mr. Gromyko, in his speech to the United Nations on Thursday, repeated the Soviet position that it wanted the United States to produce ''concrete deeds'' and that ''verbal assurances'' were not sufficient. He blamed the United States for wrecking the framework of arms-control negotiations and said it was up to the United States to repair the situation. **********Mr. Shultz said the exchanges were ''intense'' and ''forceful and direct.'' **********''The meeting was a very strong personal interchange between two individuals,'' he said. At one point, at the close of a two-hour meeting in the Oval Office, Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gromyko met alone for about 10 minutes, speaking in English, without interpreters. Mr. Shultz said the President had some thoughts he wanted to address to Mr. Gromyko without any advisers listening.   Heavy Press Coverage **********''Mr. Gromyko, of course, expressed his views very powerfully and aggressively, as he always does,'' Mr. Shultz said, indicating that the Soviet official had covered in private what he had said publicly. **********The discussions, which included a 90- minute working lunch, took place against a background of extremely heavy coverage by reporters and cameramen, which at times seemed to unsettle both Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gromyko. **********Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said there was ''a record number'' of television cameras at the White House today. Mr. Gromyko at times seemed to tease the cameras, holding his hands high over his head, clasped, as if he had won a fight, as he departed the White House after the meetings."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/04/business/group-withdraws-bid-for-southland-financial.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1984-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 344, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GROUP WITHDRAWS BID FOR SOUTHLAND FINANCIAL", "print_headline": "GROUP WITHDRAWS BID FOR SOUTHLAND FINANCIAL", "body_text": " **********The Southland Financial Corporation said yesterday that the Carpenter family group was withdrawing its previously announced proposal to acquire the company ''in view of current stock market conditions.'' **********The proposal, made Sept. 14, had called for Southland Financial to be acquired by a company to be formed by certain members of the Carpenter family, including Ben H.

Packaging all engine, transmission and other propulsion components in the front of the car permits smaller, lighter vehicles while still preserving interior roominess, automotive engineers say. **********''We want to expose the rear-wheel- drive buyer to everything he is saying 'no' to now, before he drives out in a rear-wheel-drive model,'' said John O.

The difference is not quite so pronounced for Olds and Buick because the styling of the new 98's and Electras is closer to existing models. **********Look-Alike Styling Criticized **********In any case, the cars have received only a lukeware welcome from the auto enthusiast magazines, which are an important influence on some buyers and often an early indicator of consumer acceptance. One particularly sharp criticism has been the look-alike styling that makes it hard to distinguish between versions of the car being sold by different divisions. **********''At first glance, Oldsmobile's version of the C car, the new 98, may look virtually identical to Buick's Electra,'' Motor Trend magazine said. ''At second, third and fourth glances, it still does.'' Leon Mandel, the editor of Autoweek, said: ''The car is an expression of wind tunnel ugliness. It is arrogantly drab and arrogantly utilitarian.'' **********However, auto executives and dealers say buyers in the past have gotten over the shock of different-looking, smaller cars.

''People will find out that the new cars have more head and hip room than the old ones.'' **********Fuel Economy a Factor **********The new C-body cars were designed in 1980 and 1981, at a time when it was anticipated that gasoline would cost as much as $2 a gallon by the time they were introduced. The assumption was that buyers would be willing to pay a premium for fuel economy of 21 miles a gallon in city driving, compared with 17 in the older model. **********But fuel prices have remained steady, at about $1.20 a gallon, and large cars have increased in popularity. As a result, Cadillac is keeping its large, rear-wheel-drive Fleetwood Brougham for another year. **********Oldsmobile and Buick, however, are dropping their old Electra and 98 models. Prices for the new front- wheel-drive cars will not be announced until next week, but it is possible that the highest-priced models in those divisions will not be the largest for the first time in many years. The slightly downscale Oldsmobile 88 model, for example, is 218 inches long, compared with 196 inches for the new 98. **********Analysts noted, however, that G.M. had little choice but to proceed with the smaller cars, since it is already falling below the Federal corporate average fuel economy standards. **********G.M. has estimated its fleet average at from 23.5 to 25.1 miles a gallon for the 1984 model year, compared with a standard of 27 miles a gallon. Only credits built up in the years when small cars were most popular is keeping the company from paying millions of dollars in fines. **********Younger Buyers Sought **********G.M. executives say they hope to lure younger buyers with the new cars, since the average age of current buyers of luxury models is over 50. The new cars, whose total development cost is estimated at more than $2 billion by Donald DeScenza, an auto analyst with Nomura Securities International, are also aimed at the better educated professionals who have been buying European luxury cars in increasing numbers. **********Mr. DeScenza said General Motors' decision to build the C-cars at new assembly plants outside Pontiac, Mich., and St. Louis was an indication that the company felt it had to improve the quality of its luxury cars to match the imports. **********Mr. DeScenza estimated the company's profit margin on the C-cars at about 20 percent of the wholesale price, or $3,000 on a car wholesaling for $15,000 and carrying a $17,400 sticker price. The luxury cars probably account for 15 to 20 percent of G.M.'s total profit, he said. **********Whether the company's claim to better quality will be enough to woo buyers from imports is questioned by some analysts. ''People who used to buy an Olds 98 every three years, but who switched to an import will be hard to get back,'' said Harvey Heinbach, who analyzes the industry for Merrill Lynch. ''The people who bought the BMW's and Volvos and Saabs seem to be pretty happy with them.'' **********G.M. is also introducing the cars into a market whose appetite for luxury models appears to be increasing. The company is estimating that luxury-car sales by all manufacturers will top 1.1 million in 1984, compared with 980,000 in 1983."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/28/business/texas-instruments.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Texas Instruments", "print_headline": "Texas Instruments", "body_text": " **********Texas Instruments Inc. reported yesterday that its earnings for the second quarter rebounded sharply from the previous year's deficit that reflected losses in the company's home computer business. **********Earnings totaled $85.9 million, or $3.57 a share, in the latest period,compared with a loss of $119.2 million a year earlier. **********In last year's second quarter, the company's pretax loss from its home computer business was $183 million, The company formally bowed out of the home computer business last October. **********Sales jumped 32.7 percent, to $1.46 billion, from $1.1 billion. **********The company, which is based in Dallas, attributed its strong showing to increases in sales of semiconductors, military electronics, metallurgical materials and electrical controls. **********The company said its semiconductor orders and shipments set records during the quarter.

The Israelis said he was involved in intensive negotiations with President Assad to allow him to return to Damascus, possibly in the near future. **********Only a Small Core Is Left **********If he goes back, however, he will find little left of his old power network, the Israeli sources said. All that remains of the once 10,000- to 15,000-man Defense Companies is a small core, and it is not clear at this time who is even commanding it, they said. **********Most of the soldiers who made up the Defense Companies - most of whom belonged to the same small Alawite Moslem sect as the Assad family - have been transferred to a variety of regular army units, according to the Israeli sources. **********''Rifaat was a power because he had a dagger in his hand,'' a senior Israeli official said. ''He was a man feared and hated and created enormous controversy inside Syria when Hafez was ill. Hafez, because he needed to keep his house in order, had to take the dagger from him. But he is still Hafez's brother. He is still Rifaat, and I would not write him off.''  Instrument of Intimidation **********The Defense Companies were Rifaat Assad's main power base and the tool he used to try to intimidate his rivals for power in the Syrian Army and political leadership after President Assad fell ill last November. In the power vaccum that developed during President Assad's hospitalization, Rifaat Assad and his rivals maneuvered their troops and tanks around Damascus, trying to get maximum tactical advantage for a quick seizure of power if the President died. **********The Defense Companies had primary responsibility for protecting Damascus and providing security for the Assad family - tasks that also appear to have been turned over to regular trusted army units.   Rivals Retain Their Power **********Not only has Rifaat Assad lost his main sources of strength, the Israeli sources said, but, equally important, his two rivals have not been deprived of their power bases.

Or an executive might mention how well everything is going for the A. H. Robins Company, and then add, ''Except for that one thing.'' **********That one thing is the Dalkon Shield, an intrauterine birth-control device that the company hasn't made for a decade but that continues to haunt it. **********One of the most tainted names in the annals of consumer products, the Dalkon Shield was touted for its exceptional reliability in preventing pregnancy. But thousands of women who used the plastic oval suffered infections, sterility and septic abortions (badly infected miscarriages) that they say stemmed from the Shield. The device has been blamed for 21 deaths. **********30 New Claims a Week **********These sorry events touched off a blizzard of liability lawsuits against A. H. Robins, and the suits show no signs of letting up. In recent months, an acceleration in the disposition of pending cases along with a growing number of hefty jury awards, many of them not covered by insurance, have begun to have a jarring impact on the company's finances. Litigation costs so far this year are already more than double those for all of last year, and about 30 new claims a week are being filed. In addition, the company received a recent tongue lashing from a Minneapolis Federal judge, Miles Lord. **********The nova-like history of the Dalkon Shield is a graphic illustration of how a product of fringe benefit to a company can imperil its very future. **********Between 1970 and 1974, Robins sold 4.6 million Dalkon Shields throughout the world. Profits from the sales amounted to about $500,000 - far less than those from its Chap Stick lip balm or Robitussin cough medicine. **********Since Robins scrapped the Shield - so small a part of its operations that nobody was laid off - the contraceptive has cost it $101 million in litigation expenses. Its insurer has paid out an additional $132 million, and it is anyone's guess how mammoth the final bill will be. **********Morale a Problem **********Moreover, the Shield has rocked Robins's corporate culture and bruised its morale. **********Various employees are periodically summoned to testify. Two have suffered minor heart attacks that the company feels are linked to the stress. ''No matter how much we would like the legal department to handle this,'' said E. Claiborne Robins Jr., the company's president, ''it still enters into other peoples' decisions and lives every day.'' **********Robert Watts, Robins's executive vice president, said, ''I was a teen- ager during World War II. I would read the papers, and any time I'd read that we lost something, I would get depressed and I'd go outside and look up in the air for the planes.'' Similarly, when Robins's employees read about the Shield litigation in the newspapers, he said, morale has ''some aberrations. It shows itself in lunchroom conversation. What's happening to us? people want to know. Are we really sick? It's like a kid with a sick parent.'' **********Though Robins says it has little turnover and doesn't know of anyone who has spurned a job offer because of the Dalkon Shield, it has no way of knowing how many potential recruits sidestep the company. ''I think that if I were out in the marketplace looking for a job, I wouldn't come to this company,'' said Mr. Watts. ''I could go to another company and not have to worry about this thing.'' **********'Monstrous Mischief' **********It's unclear to what extent A. H. Robins is to blame for the Dalkon Shield debacle. Opposing lawyers have charged that the company inadequately tested and knowingly sold a deadly product. The most cutting blow was delivered in March by Judge Lord. **********After approving settlement of a number of Dalkon lawsuits, he told A. H. Robins: ''Your company, without warning to women, invaded their bodies by the millions and caused them injuries by the thousands. Your company in the face of overwhelming evidence denies its guilt and continues its monstrous mischief. You have taken the bottom line as your guiding beacon and the low road as your route.'' **********The judge also instructed several top officers to read an astringent speech on corporate irresponsibility he had delivered to a church group, and told them ''I hope it burns its mark into your soul.'' **********In retaliaton, A. H. Robins filed a complaint with the court system, accusing the judge of ''a gross abuse of judicial discretion and power.'' Mr. Robins devoted much of his remarks at the company's recent annual meeting to a rebuttal of Judge Lord, declaring that he ''wasn't prepared to be impartial, as befits a judge. Instead, he was prepared to destroy, to tear down and to demean.'' **********Harassment Charged **********Plaintiff attorneys have also accused Robins of harassing defendants by posing embarrassing questions about their sex lives to dissuade them from going to trial. Philip Zauderer, a Columbus, Ohio, lawyer, says that one woman dropped her suit after Robins asked her if she had had group sex. Robins argues that sexual habits are germane. **********''There are other causes of infection,'' said William A. Forrest Jr., the company's general counsel, ''one of which is the sexual life style.'' **********Robins acquired the rights to the Dalkon Shield in June 1970 from the Dalkon Corporation, a group of investors that included the two doctors who invented it. Robins says it tested the device rigorously. The use of any I.U.D. entails risk, it adds, and those risks were disclosed to the public. **********Indeed, something of a feeling of persecution pervades the company's headquarters here. ''Why doesn't the American public realize that a company that is over 100 years old would n't make a decision that could destroy it in a matter of minutes?'' Mr Robins muses. ''Yet the people, the courts, the newspapers are trying to destroy it. It bothers me that the integrity of my father is being questioned. I don't like the image being projected about A. H. Robins. It hurts.'' **********E. Claiborne Robins Sr., the chairman of Robins, won't talk about the tribulations of the Shield. His son said the elder Robins wouldn't even discuss it with him. **********Though A. H. Robins went public in 1963, much of the stock remains in family hands. The elder Mr. Robins owns about a quarter of it. The company likes to make much of its benevolence. In 1969, Mr. Robins donated $50 million worth of Robins stock to the University of Richmond, his alma mater. At the time it was the largest individual bequest to a university. On their birthdays, employees receive a card from the chairman and president, along with a check for $25. **********Dalkon Shield lawsuits were filed as early as 1972, but the litigation stepped up in late 1974, after Robins withdrew the product and offered to buy back any Dalkon Shields in the marketplace. By now, 7,350 cases have been disposed of - virtually all by out-of-court settlements - and 3,675 are pending. **********In the 37 trials, Robins has won 19 and lost 18. The biggest award was $6.8 million to a Colorado woman who said she suffered a septic abortion and nearly died after using the Shield. **********The Aetna Life and Casualty Company has been Robins's insurer, though the limits of coverage have largely been exhausted. The company has no insurance beyond 1978. Robins is currently in the throes of litigation with Aetna over the manner in which the insurer assigns cases to specific years and over its policy of deducting defense expenses from liability limits. Should Robins prevail, it could pick up millions of dollars in additional coverage. **********Record Operating Earnings **********Robins's executives, who remain sanguine that the company will survive the Dalkon threat, have tried to keep the Shield problem from hindering other operations. And the company, apart from the litigation, has been sailing along. **********Last year, revenues reached a record $563.5 million, and operating earnings a record $100.4 million. But Dalkon Shield expenses amounted to $18.7 million. In the first half of 1984, when operating earnings climbed 33 percent, litigation costs came to $42.3 million, almost quintuple the burden in the first half of last year. **********Despite Robins's strong operating results, no Wall Street brokerage house recommends the stock. ''It's frustrating trying to follow them,'' said Joseph Riccardo, an analyst at Bear, Stearns. ''The company appears to be doing exceptionally well. Its product line appears to be strong. But that's clearly not the issue. The issue is the Dalkon Shield. You can't estimate their litigation expenses.'' **********Many analysts would like to see Robins set up a reserve fund to cover litigation costs. But the company thinks it cannot do so until it has an idea of what those costs might be. It thinks it may get one once it detects a decline in the filing of new cases. Although the rate seems to have leveled off, there has not been any clear evidence of a slackening. **********Shield Still in Use **********One of the wild cards in the Dalkon Shield saga is that, strangely enough, the Shield has never been banned. And there are surely women who continue to wear them. ''Who they are, how many there are, where they are, we don't know,'' a company official conceded. **********A. H. Robins traces its roots to an apothecary shop founded by Albert Hanley Robins, the grandfather of E. Claiborne Robins Sr., in downtown Richmond in 1866. After World War II, it emerged as a company of some substance, having introduced Robitussin and a product called Donnatal for gastrointestinal disturbances. **********In 1963, the company began to move toward its present-day form when it acquired Morton Manufacturing, maker of Chap Stick, the biggest-selling lip balm and the fastest-moving product in drugstores. In 1967, the Polk Miller Products Corporation was bought, which made the Sergeant's pet-care line of flea collars and animal shampoos. Prescription drugs continue as the company's major sales generator, spearheaded by the Reglan family of promotility agents. **********Robins recently entered the medical instruments and broadcasting businesses, since the younger Mr. Robins wants to steer the company into markets less heavily policed by the government than drugs. Robins bought two radio stations in Greensboro, N.C., as well as the Quinton Medical Company, which makes such things as stress-testing equipment. **********To the younger Mr. Robins, there is no product that wouldn't conceivably pique his interest - save one. ''If you said you have an intrauterine device you'd like me to look at,'' he remarked, ''I'd have to say, no thank you. No thank you.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/19/business/market-place-technology-stock-slump.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1984-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 795, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Technology Stock Slump", "print_headline": "Market Place; Technology Stock Slump", "body_text": " **********TECHNOLOGY stocks took a beating yesterday, for two unrelated reasons, and helped to **********keep the market on the downside. **********First, worry over problems with a disk drive hurt Control Data and Burroughs. Second, the semiconductor issues were battered by a bearish brokerage house report on Motorola. **********Burroughs opened down 2 3/8 yesterday morning after an order imbalance. The drop in Burroughs, which closed the day at 53, off 3 5/8, followed Control Data's slide. On Monday, Control Data dropped 2 1/8 points, and it lost an additional 3/8 yesterday, to close at 26 1/8. **********Control Data, according to analysts, encountered problems with a thin coating on the disk. ''If that chemical compound is not virtually perfect, trouble ensues,'' said Ulric Weil, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''We are talking about tolerances the thickness of a human hair.'' **********Control Data had shipped 500 of the 33800-series disk, which is compatible with the International Business Machines Corporation's units. If the media, or chemical compound, is not right, the disk drive can stop suddenly. **********Analysts heard of the Control Data problem Monday and began to cut earnings estimates of the company. Then they realized that Burroughs might have a similar problem and turned their attention there. **********Control Data and Burroughs have two joint ventures, said Michael Geran, an analyst at E. F. Hutton. One is a media joint venture, and the second is the disk drive head joint venture, with Burroughs responsible for the media side and Control Data for the head side. ''As they attempted to escalate the production of the media with new equipment and new people, they kind of lost the recipe,'' Mr. Geran said. ''When you put the media on the heads, there apparently is a problem.'' **********Both companies independently ship 33800-series equipment to I.B.M. plug-compatible markets. Burroughs's Memorex subsidiary, which makes the 3680 disk drive storage system, said it had suspended shipments but expected to resume them in two weeks. **********What is surprising about the media problem, Mr. Weil said, is that I.B.M. had the same situation three and a half years ago when it was developing its high-performance disk drive and was able to solve it. ''You would have thought they would have hired somebody from I.B.M.'' to solve the problem, Mr. Weil said of Burroughs and Control Data. ''When you're working at the leading edge of technology, things can go wrong.'' **********Analysts cut earnings estimates for both companies, with Control Data getting the worst of it. Mr. Weil, for example, cut his estimate for Control Data on an operating basis to $1.70 a share from $3.35. Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds reduced his Control Data estimates to $2.40 from $3.40 this year and to $3.50 from $4 next year. Mr. Stevens reduced the rating on Burroughs to a hold from a buy/hold. Control Data was already a hold, which is a neutral stance. **********The analysts were kinder to Burroughs, in part because of the strength of the rest of the company. Mr. Geran, for example, took 15 cents a share off this year's earnings estimate. Mr. Weil adjusted his Burroughs estimate to $5.50 from $5.75. **********As for semiconductor producers, Stuart Johnson of Wertheim & Company has become bearish on Motorola. After Mr. Johnson took the stock off the recommended list, it fell 2, to 40 5/8, in active trading. **********Among other declining semiconductor issues, Texas Instruments dropped 3, to 133; Advanced Micro Devices 1, to 39 1/4, and National Semiconductor 3/4, to 14 3/4. Electronics distributors were also hurt. Arrow Electronics, for example, dropped 1 7/8, to 20 1/2. Mr. Johnson said his decision on semiconductors reflected concern that orders in the fourth quarter would not turn up ''with a great deal of vigor.'' **********Other analysts disagree. Adam F. Cuhney of Salomon Brothers maintains his recommendation on Motorola, as well as on Texas Instruments, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel and National Semiconductor. He expects an order upturn in the final quarter if the economy is not hurt by a strike at General Motors. **********Richard Billy, an analyst at L. F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, said the summer months into September were ''pretty weak,'' with an ''ongoing inventory correction and seasonality.'' **********His firm is recommending some of the companies that have a niche in the industry. He specifically mentioned Advanced Micro Devices, Monolothic Memories, National Semiconductor and some of the electronics distributors. But Rothschild is not recommending Motorola or Texas Instruments. Mr. Billy said these companies were exposed to the problem of too much capacity should the economy soften. **********The recent problems of Texas Instruments with the Government hold no fear for Mr. Cuhney of Salomon Brothers. He said the press had exaggerated the situation, in which the Defense Department said Texas Instruments microchips had been faultily tested. Mr. Cuhney recommended using weakness in the stock as an opportunity to load up."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/20/business/advertising-066283.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ADVERTISING;", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING;", "body_text": " **********Foote, Cone Acquires Dutch Agency Interest **********Foote, Cone & Belding Communications, which already had an outpost in Amsterdam, has just acquired a majority position in Hammerschmidt House there and will be moving in some of its accounts from FCB Amsterdam.

Robert O. Goodman Jr. and declared that the flier's return presented ''an opportune moment to put all the issues on the table'' between the United States and Syria. **********''All of us here are delighted, of course, that this has taken place,'' Mr. Reagan told reporters this morning shortly after speaking by telephone with Lieutenant Goodman and with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, whose visit to Damascus ended in the flier's release. **********A week ago, White House officials warned that a trip to Syria by Mr. Jackson could hinder rather than help the Administration's efforts to gain Lieutenant Goodman's release. **********Praise From Both Parties **********Today Mr. Jackson was extolled by Democrats and Republicans alike, and it appeared likely that his campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination would benefit. Administration officials also said they were pleased that the United States had not had to make any diplomatic concessions in return for the flier's freedom. **********The White House said today, for example, that the United States would ignore Syrian protests and continue aerial reconnaissance missions over territory held by Syrian-backed forces in Lebanon. **********Mr. Reagan praised Mr. Jackson for the success of his mission. Asked if the civil rights leader and Democratic Presidential candidate had performed well, the President said, ''You don't quarrel with success.'' **********This afternoon, Mr. Reagan announced that he had sent a message to President Assad expressing ''appreciation for this action'' and calling on Syria to ''work with the United States to bring greater stability to Lebanon and withdrawals of foreign troops.'' **********Mr. Reagan offered no new proposals, however, and White House aides said he continued to oppose a withdrawal of American marines from Lebanon, in spite of rising appeals from Congressional leaders that such a step be considered. **********White House officials had said earlier that Mr. Reagan was considering ''new ideas'' to break the stalemate in Lebanon, but today they declined to specify what these were. The officials said Mr. Reagan had instructed his staff not to make them known, but suggested that no changes in approach were imminent.   President Sees Mideast Envoy **********Mr. Reagan met this morning with Donald Rumsfeld, the special Middle East envoy, in preparation for a trip by Mr. Rumsfeld to the region. The special envoy was to fly to London tonight but the Administration refused to give out his subsequent itinerary. **********A White House official said there was widespread doubt in the Administration that the release of Lieutenant Goodman portended a warming in the relationship with Syria, although he said that the recent climate of threats and hostility might change for a time. **********The official noted that Syria had taken other positive steps in the past. Last July, for example, the Adminstration credited the Syrians with assisting in the release of David S. Dodge, acting president of the American University in Beirut, who had been abducted a year earlier by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems. **********The United States has blamed Syria, however, for providing military support to the Shiite and Druse factions in Lebanon that oppose President Amin Gemayel's Government.   Flier Was on Bombing Mission **********Syrian antiaircraft batteries have fired on American reconnaissance missions in Lebanon, and the United States has responded with air strikes and naval shelling. Lieutenant Goodman, a 27-year-old navigator-bombardier, was shot down Dec. 4 while on a bombing mission. **********Adding to the tension with Syria has been the Administration contention that there was evidence of Syrian backing for the terrorist group that blew up the Marine headquarters in Beirut on Oct. 23, killing 241 American servicemen. **********Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, emphasized today that the reconnaissance flights over Lebanon would continue. He said one such flight was carried out this morning shortly before the announcement of Lieutenant Goodman's release. **********Mr. Speakes said Mr. Reagan spoke for 10 minutes with Mr. Jackson and Lieutenant Goodman this morning. **********He quoted the President as having told the civil rights leader: ''It is a great day here in Washington. All Americans thank you. There have been a lot of prayers in Washington. I have been praying for you. I couldn't be happier.''  President Sees Progress **********In his statement this afternoon, Mr. Reagan said that ''progress has been made'' toward achieving the ''twin goals of national reconciliation and troop withdrawals'' in Lebanon. **********''We are continuing our support of these efforts,'' he added. ''The work ahead is difficult. But with determined international effort, and the good will of all the parties, we believe that continued progress will be made.'' **********Mr. Speakes, speaking at a regular White House briefing, was careful to play down a suggestion that the flier's return might improve the Administration's negotiating efforts in the Middle East. **********He said only that the United States remained ''hopeful'' President Gemayel could resolve differences with his political opponents and that this could lead eventually to a withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon.   Plea for Patience **********Another White House aide said Mr. Reagan was hoping that the Administration could persuade skeptics in Congress to wait two or three weeks more to see if Mr. Rumsfeld's new mission could bear fruit. **********Administration officials generally assessed Lieutenant Goodman's return as a plus for Mr. Reagan, even if it was also a plus for Mr. Jackson, who has been one of the President's most acerbic critics. **********''Everybody gets something out of this, and it doesn't cost anybody anything,'' said a White House official. **********He said it came as an enormous personal relief to the President that Lieutenant Goodman was coming home. ''He could have gone through the summer and fall and still have this poor guy locked up over there,'' the official said. **********Last week, Mr. Reagan suggested to reporters that a trip by Mr. Jackson to Syria could be ''counterproductive.'' **********Today, however, a White House official noted that Mr. Reagan, Mr. Speakes and others who had expressed similar sentiments had been careful never to ask Mr. Jackson to abandon the trip. **********''We always said it was up to him whether to go,'' said the official."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/07/world/around-the-world-63-students-arrested-during-clash-in-chile.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "63 Students Arrested During Clash in Chile", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; 63 Students Arrested During Clash in Chile", "body_text": " **********Riot policemen arrested 63 students during two hours of clashes Friday between hundreds of pro-Government and anti-Government demonstrators at the University of Santiago. **********Eleven students and employees were reported injured and university officials said there was $70,000 in damage to campus facilities. **********The clash erupted between participants in two rallies on the campus.

They were reportedly reassured by commitments that they would eventually be allowed to emigrate to the West. **********Bonn Aide Voices Optimism **********In East Berlin, where he has been engaged in wide-ranging talks, Ludwig Rehlinger, a senior Bonn official, suggested to journalists that the ultimate resolution of the problem at the mission could open the way to wider agreements between the two governments. **********''There is reason to assume,'' he said, using the German initials for the German Democratic Republic, ''that the appropriate authorities in the D.D.R. will grant emigration departures in the context of family reunification when the situation in the mission is normalized - that is, when the last ones are gone.'' **********The entry into the mission by East Germans desperate to flee to the West forced Bonn last Wednesday to close the building, after several scores of people seeking asylum had been turned away. The closing followed an unsuccessful attempt by a young East German to set himself on fire in front of the mission. **********Mr. Rehlinger's talks, according to a number of accounts, were broadened to cover agreements between the two German states that both sides would like to conclude before Erich Honecker, the East German chief of state and Communist Party leader, makes an official visit to West Germany in late September. **********According to West German television reports and other information available tonight, the tentative agreements touch on these points: **********- A new private bank loan to East Germany, to be guaranteed by the West German Government. A consortium led by the Deutsche Bank, according to banking sources, has put together the loan, which is said to be somewhat smaller than a $396.8 million credit extended last year. **********- A reduction of the mandatory foreign exchange required of West German visitors to East Germany, which is a major deterrent to closer human contacts between the two states. The newspaper Bild will report in tomorrow's issue that the daily amount will be reduced from 25 deutschemarks, or about $9, to 20 deutschemarks, or $7.20. **********- A reduction in the age at which most East German women are permitted to visit West Germany. According to various accounts, the limit would be dropped from 60 to 45. **********- Permission for 5,000 more East Germans to emigrate legally to West Germany in 1984.  So far, in the biggest wave of legal emigration since the building of the Berlin wall in 1961, more than 25,000 East Germans emigrated to the West earlier this year. **********- The complete dismantling of the deadly, booby-trapped automatic firing devices along East Germany's walled and fenced frontier wih West Germany.   Bonn Offers No Denial **********Without denying the reports, the Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl issued a mild disclaimer tonight, saying they were based on ''speculation.'' **********But the statement conceded that the two German governments were engaged in discussions over ''further practical arrangements'' to improve ties ''in the interest of people in both parts of Germany.'' **********''These discussions are not yet concluded,'' the statement added. **********According to Western diplomats, Mr. Honecker is eager to have the accords concluded before he becomes the first East German party leader to visit West Germany. He is said to believe that in an atmosphere of general good feeling he will be guaranteed a warm reception. **********The trip has not been officially announced. In an interview last week with the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, Mr. Honecker said he ''did not want to participate in speculation over whether I will visit'' West Germany ''this year or not.''  Tension at Mission Reduced **********The relaxation of tension at the West German mission in East Berlin appeared to enhance the possibility of a broader agreement. Last weekend, after Mr. Rehlinger began talks with Wolfgang Vogel, an East Berlin lawyer with close ties to Mr. Honecker, some of the East Germans in the building started to leave it. **********A number of those seeking asylum had been sheltered in the modern edifice on Hannoversche Strasse for weeks, straining its diplomats' capacity to work normally. **********At his news conference, Mr. Rehlinger clarified that the four adults and two children remaining in the embassy did not include three ''problem cases'' - a navy deserter, an army reserve captain and an official said to be familiar with the layout of the East German state security headquarters. The three, like others, had ''returned to their home areas'' in East Germany, Mr. Rehlinger said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/10/world/guatemalans-in-mexico-not-where-the-heart-is.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Meislin", "pub_date": "1984-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1200, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GUATEMALANS IN MEXICO: NOT WHERE THE HEART IS", "print_headline": "GUATEMALANS IN MEXICO: NOT WHERE THE HEART IS", "body_text": " **********Horacio Perez and his family arrived here today to settle reluctantly into their second home in as many years. **********The first was in the jungles of the Mexican border state of Chiapas, to which Mr. Perez, his wife and their four children fled in February 1983 from the Guatemalan village of Gracias a Dios - ''Thanks to God'' - after deciding that the safest choice between the Guatemalan Army and the leftist guerrillas was not to choose at all. **********The second was to the well-hidden encampment growing slowly outside this tiny community south of Campeche, farther away from his homeland than Mr. Perez ever expected to be. ''It was an order from the Government,'' he said. ''We had to agree.'' **********After two years of trying to decide what to do with the growing numbers of Guatemalans seeking sanctuary along its southern border, Mexico has started moving some 46,000 refugees to new villages being constructed in the interior of the country - whether they like the idea or not. **********The Government says that here it will be able to supply them more easily with food and medicine, allow them to lead more productive lives and protect them from attackers who, it says, have crossed the border from Guatemala to assault and sometimes kill the refugees in their camps.   'They've Arrived' **********But the move has bewildered many of the refugees, as well as the residents of the small village to which they are coming. Florencia Che, a short, squat resident of the village, stood barefoot on the railroad platform as some 250 refugees - the first Guatemalans she had ever seen in her ''more or less'' 40 years - disembarked before her. ''We don't know why they are coming,'' she said, ''but they've arrived.'' **********The embankment below her was abuzz with refugees, hauling about cloth and burlap sacks containing all the worldly goods they had managed to carry with them or collect since leaving their homeland, looking for family members who had come ahead of time to help construct their new camp, breast-feeding babies or simply chatting in Spanish or Canhubal, an Indian language common to the Guatemalan highlands. **********Francisco Felix Mendez had just been reunited with his father, wife and seven children and had a clear idea of why he was here: ''So that the Government and army of Guatemala don't kill us,'' he said. ''Thanks to President Miguel de la Madrid!'' **********Mr. Felix Mendez, 52 years old, had come here from the camp at El Chupadero on the southern border. ''They killed six of our countrymen,'' he said. ''They castrated the men they killed.'' **********The attack, which took place the night of April 30, provoked an angry diplomatic exchange between Mexico and Guatemala, and gave the final impetus to the Mexican Government's decision to move the refugees from the border.   Some Didn't Want to Go **********Not all the refugees were as sanguine about the move as Mr. Felix Mendez. Some who arrived here today said that as many as half the people of their border encampments had not wanted to leave; several told of heavy pressure from the Mexican Government, of being offered a choice of either moving here or returning to Guatemala and an even more uncertain future. **********Those who arrived here, however, did not find the accommodations wanting. Despite complaints about the warmer, more humid weather - one woman's arms were full of sores that she attributed to the change in climate - all of those interviewed said the camp was equal to or better than their living situation at the border. **********Many said they looked forward as well to the creation of plots of land, promised by the Mexican Government, on which they will be able to grow some of their own food. The rest of their needs will be provided for, as they have in the past, by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. **********The camp itself is carved out of a swath of national forest. Long rows of rectangular huts made of inch-round branches are covered with corrugated tar-paper roofs of alternating red and black color and shaded by stands of trees. A larger building along one end will serve as a meeting hall and school, according to officials of the Mexican Commission for Assistance to Refugees.   Sharing Schools, but Not Jobs **********The Governor of Campeche, Eugenio Echeverria Castellot, said that in cases where the refugee camps were close to Mexican villages, the refugees would share schools and medical offices with Mexicans. What they will not share, he said, is employment, particularly in the petroleum industry, which is one of this state's major sources of work. **********''They are not capable of it,'' the Governor said. ''They are capable of agriculture, cattle raising - this is what they are capable of.'' The restriction is also intended to prevent the development of the type of job competition between Guatemalans and Mexicans in southern Mexico that now exists between Americans and illegal Mexican immigrants in the southern United States. **********The first group of refugee families, who moved here earlier this week, appear to be well settled in. Teresa Miguel Pascual, who worked in a bakery in Guatemala, is already running a Pepsi concession at the entrance of the hut where she lives with four other members of her family. In many of the huts, straw mats are spread over mounds of dirt for beds; guitars are commonplace, one way of passing the long idle hours.   'Don't Know What's Happening' **********Despite what comfort may be found here, however, thoughts still turn to Guatemala and the idea of going home, a place that seems increasingly distant, both physically and mentally. Some talk of relatives they have not seen or heard from in years. ''Really, we don't know what's happening there,'' said Miguel Angel Garcia, a grizzled-looking 45-year-old peasant wearing sandals and a straw hat typical of the countryside. ''We don't hear anything.'' **********Many, like Francisco Diego, a 31- year-old refugee from San Miguel Acatan in Guatemala's Huehuetenango Province, said he heard on the radio that ''the war is still continuing.'' Mr. Perez, from Gracias a Dios, said that ''the Government here said they will tell us'' when it is safe to return. **********Mexican officials, meanwhile, say the flow of new refugees has just about come to a halt. When asked why this does not mean it is safe for the refugees to return to Guatemala, an Interior Ministry official answered with a shrug. **********Some have resigned themselves to living out their lives as refugees in a foreign land. At 95 years of age, Felix Francisco of Nanton, in the Guatemalan province of Quiche, sat with a small plaid-cloth bundle of his belongings near his 75-year-old wife, Elena. ''We came because of the war,'' he said, his moustache quivering. His wife added, ''We came happily, because we were afraid.'' **********Of returning to Guatemala, he no longer had any hopes. ''No more - no more,'' Mr. Francisco said. ''Once we are here, here we will stay.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/09/business/british-telecom.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Telecom", "print_headline": "British Telecom", "body_text": " **********The British Government is still considering plans by British Telecom and the International Business Machines Corporation to form a jointly owned British electronic information network, an Industry Department spokesman said, but it might take several more weeks for a decision to be reached.

General Matthei had denied the report on Monday, and today's decree said the station had ''alarmed the populace.'' **********There had been speculation that General Matthei might resign because of what appeared to be a disagreement within the Government over the timetable to return Chile to democracy. In early October, General Matthei said he favored early legislative elections. President Augusto Pinochet said he would adhere to the timetable in the 1980 Constitution, which calls for presidential elections in 1989. **********The air force commander has since denied that he said anything new or anything that disagreed with General Pinochet. **********Foreign diplomats said that there did not appear to be any split in the junta, and they were perplexed by General Matthei's statement. **********General Vidal has the authority to impose press restrictions under the state of emergency that was put into effect in March 1983. **********Last March, General Vidal restricted the coverage of four magazines run by opposition parties for one month.

Chernenko. American officials said the comments suggested that the door might be open to reviving a dialogue. **********Senior Reagan Administration officials said Mr. Chernenko's speech, which he gave after being chosen as the new General Secretary of the Communist Party, broke no major new ground. But they said it appeared to respond indirectly to President Reagan's call for a new ''constructive dialogue.'' **********Late this afternoon, President Reagan arrived at the Soviet Embassy in Washington and signed the condolence book for Yuri V. Andropov that was opened to the public this morning. The White House said Mr. Reagan signed this message: **********''Please accept my condolences on the death of Chairman Andropov and convey my sympathy to his family.'' **********The White House said Mr. Reagan had signed a similar book after the death of Leonid I. Brezhnev in 1982. **********In responding to Mr. Chernenko's speech, State Department officials glossed over his tough-sounding words. Instead they focused on his comments about Soviet readiness to ''cooperate with'' countries that were prepared to help lessen tensions ''through practical deeds.'' **********From the context of his remarks, he could have been placing responsibility on the United States to come up with ''practical deeds,'' a position voiced earlier by Mr. Andropov in responding to Mr. Reagan's overture. **********But the State Department chose to put a more positive interpretation on Mr. Chernenko's remarks by making it appear that it was the Soviet Union that was ready to offer ''practical deeds.'' **********The senior Administration officials said they expected Mr. Chernenko to move cautiously in foreign affairs and rely, perhaps more than had any previous Soviet leader, on collective decisions within the ruling Politburo. **********Nevertheless, the intelligence officials, who are experts on the Soviet Union, said Mr. Chernenko appeared committed to the policy of detente fostered by his mentor, Mr. Brezhnev. **********The intelligence officials said Mr. Chernenko, 72 years old, who took part in the last Soviet-American summit meeting, set a more moderate tone by avoiding detailed criticism of American policy. **********The State Department, in a statement that deliberately avoided any mention of Mr. Chernenko's criticism of ''some leaders of the capitalist countries,'' said, ''We do of course welcome his expressed support for solving international disputes through negotiation.'' **********Mr. Reagan, in an interview with the Knight-Ridder newspapers, today rejected the idea of a ''get- acquainted'' summit meeting with Mr. Chernenko but expressed interest in a meeting with the Soviet leader that would consider an ''agenda'' of substantive issues. **********Visit Possible in '84 **********Under an agreement with Knight- Ridder, the White House is not making public the text of the interview with the President until Tuesday. The thrust of his comments were reported tonight by The Washington Post, a Knight-Ridder news service subscriber. **********Mr. Reagan's remarks were consistent with recent statements by the White House. Shortly after the death of Yuri V. Andropov last week, a White House official said that one of the reasons Mr. Reagan had decided against going to the funeral was his hope that he could visit the Soviet Union later in the year, but only after he had received some assurances that there was a good likelihood for a successful outcome to the meeting. **********In the last months of Mr. Andropov's tenure, substantive talks between the two countries virtually ceased and relations seemed to harden on both sides. Now, on the basis of President Reagan's emphasis in the last month on opening serious talks and the hints in Mr. Chernenko's speech, the mood within the Administration is clearly one of sensing that an opportunity might develop.   Bush Asks to See Chernenko **********Vice President Bush, who will be in Moscow for the Andropov funeral on Tuesday, has asked to see Mr. Chernenko, and State Department officials said Mr. Bush was authorized to stress an American desire for talks that might lead to a summit meeting. **********''I think we have bottomed out in relations,'' one senior State Department official said, ''and we're probably going to see a gradual probing on both sides, leading perhaps to enough progress to warrant a meeting between Reagan and the Soviet leaders later in the year.'' **********The official said he used the term ''Soviet leaders'' because it was possible that Mr. Chernenko may have to share power, as occurred in the first years of Mr. Brezhnev's tenure.  American analysts of Soviet affairs, in examining the text of Mr. Chernenko's speech, said they were struck by the lack of any direct criticism of either the United States or Mr. Reagan. His criticism instead pointed at ''some leaders of the capitalist countries.'' Mr. Andropov, in his statements in recent months, often singled out the Reagan Administration for attack.   Chernenko Comment is Quoted **********Mr. Chernenko said the Soviet Union ''will cooperate in full measure with all states that are prepared to assist through practical deeds to lessening international tensions and creating an atmosphere of trust in the world.'' **********The State Department statement spoke of the Soviet Union's own ''readiness to 'assist through practical deeds in lessening international tensions' '' and went on to say: **********''As the President has stated, these are our goals as well. What is needed is to move from words to deeds in building a more constructive U.S.-Soviet relationship.'' **********Mr. Chernenko has built his career as a senior apparatchik, mostly under the direct patronage of Mr. Brezhnev, whom he first met in Soviet Moldavia after World War II when Mr. Brezhnev headed the party there.  Mr. Brezhnev promoted him in the late 1970's to become a party secretary and then to be a member of the ruling Politburo. **********Over all, one authority on Soviet affairs said today, Mr. Chernenko has developed the reputation of being a ''team player.'' Mr. Brezhnev relied on him completely, the analyst said. **********In Mr. Brezhnev's last years in office, when he was physically able to work only an hour or two a day, Mr. Chernenko was inseparable from him, an analyst said, performing tasks that would usually be assigned to personal aides rather than to a Politburo leader.   Role at Vienna Talks Recalled **********He was with Mr. Brezhnev at the Helsinki conference on security and cooperation in Europe in 1975 when Mr. Brezhnev met with President Ford. And he was in Vienna in June 1979 when Mr. Brezhnev and President Carter signed the treaty on limiting strategic arms. **********At the Vienna meeting, Mr. Chernenko did not leave much of an impression on the American participants, who said they tried and failed to engage him in serious conversation at a dinner Mr. Carter and Mr. Brezhnev held with only a few aides. Zbigniew Brzezinski, then the national security adviser, said Mr. Chernenko ''was jovial and quite amiable in private conversation'' on peripheral matters, but cautious and close-mouthed on significant issues. **********Former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance said Mr. Chernenko was ''very much in the background at the dinner and did not say anything of significance.'' **********''However,'' he said, ''in recent years I have talked to a number of officials in the Soviet hierarchy who have told me that in the last few years, Mr. Chernenko has assumed a stronger and more positive role and has not hesitated to speak out.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/01/business/union-oil-to-buy-more-of-venture.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Union Oil to Buy More of Venture", "print_headline": "Union Oil to Buy More of Venture", "body_text": " **********The Union Oil Company of California, a subsidiary of the Unocal Corporation, has agreed to acquire an additional 25 percent of a geothermal energy venture from the Diamond Shamrock Corporation. **********The companies valued the transaction at about $285 million.

''It had ruptured the social equilibrium.'' **********Established in 1966 **********The maquiladora industry was established by law in 1966 to bring development to Mexico's northern border. **********Under Mexican law, manufacturers are allowed to import parts without normal duties or restrictions for assembly here so long as the assembled products do not remain in Mexico. Under United States law, the companies pay duties on the return trip only on the value added in the assembly process.  Thus many companies produce parts in a factory on the American side of the border, ship them to their plants in Mexico for assembly, and then ship them back. **********Employment in the assembly industry in this city soared by 19 percent last year, to 63,000, largely because the steady devaluation of the Mexican peso has made labor costs increasingly attractive to American business. An assembly line worker here now earns the equivalent of $28 for a 45-hour workweek. **********Border-wide, the growth was about 11 percent in 1983. Some 140,000 people were employed in the assembly industry at the end of the year, producing about $900 million worth of goods. More than half consisted of electrical and electronics products. **********Why Women Are Employed **********The companies involved, which include RCA, Sylvania, General Motors and Chrysler, say they have traditionally employed women because women are more suited to the repetitive tasks involved in the assembly process. A 1979 study by a Stanford University political scientist, Michael Van Waas, also found that the ''passivity'' of Mexican women made them more attractive to the American concerns. **********But as the industry grew, labor shortages developed and ''the women began to take advantage of the situation,'' Mr. Castro said. ''If they didn't like what they were doing, they would just quit because they knew they could find work someplace else.'' **********In addition, because employment outside the maquiladoras is hard to find in Mexico's hard-scrabble border towns, many men found themselves with nothing to do while their wives went to work. This led to ''a type of social disequilibrium,'' said the city's new Mayor, Francisco J. Barrio, that brought increases in crime, alcoholism and divorce. **********Mr. Castro said that by the end of last year, nearly one in three workers at the assembly plants were men. The goal is to raise the proportion of male workers to 60 percent by the end of the decade, he added. **********Men Now Cautious **********Word of the change has been slow in getting out, and many men are hesitant to seek jobs in an industry identified as ''women's work.'' **********Only about 10 percent of the maquiladora workers in Juarez are unionized, far below the national average. ''If you don't feel the need, you're not going to unionize,'' Mr. Castro said. ''All you have to do is treat them like human beings - people who have feelings, who cry, who get sick.'' **********Mr. Van Waas's study found that payoffs to union officials and a few well-publicized shutdowns in the wake of strikes also helped to diminish union activity. **********Few Mexican Products Used **********Thus far, the maquiladora industry's benefit to Mexico has been almost solely in providing employment. Few Mexican products are used in the assembly process, according to a study by the Banco Nacional de Mexico, partly because of ''restrictive practices'' of the manufacturers and partly because of ''poor quality, insufficient supply and deficient deliveries, as well as lack of interest on the part of local manufacturers.'' **********So while several of the border plants assemble high-quality, moderately priced televisions, for example, a similar product remains dear - and often shoddy - in the Mexican marketplace. A 12-inch black-and- white set in Mexico City costs 30 percent to 50 percent more than its counterpart in New York City. **********The National Association of Manufacturers recently estimated that as a result of this discrepancy in price and quality, one of every two appliances in Mexican households was reported to be contraband. **********''The industry here has not had enough time in the country for us to share our skills with the rest of the country,'' Mr. Castro said. He added that import restrictions also limited its ability to produce high-quality, competitive goods for local buyers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/01/business/briefs-debt-rating.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 319, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": " Debt Rating", "print_headline": "BRIEFS;  Debt Rating", "body_text": " **********Citicorp said average rates of 11.314 percent for 91-day paper, down from 11.37 percent last week, and 11.404 percent for 182-day paper, down from 11.623 percent, were set at Tuesday's weekly auction. ***********  General Telephone Co. of California , based in Santa Monica, had ratings on its first-mortgage bonds raised to single A3, from Baa1, and on its debentures to Baa1, from Baa2, by Moody's Investors Service Inc.

An aircraft carrier task force led by the nuclear- powered Kitty Hawk is operating routinely in the North Arabian Sea; it includes two destroyers, two frigates, one cruiser and a supply ship. **********Although they normally operate at a higher level of readiness than American warships in other parts of the world, none of these vessels, or any Navy ships in the Mediterranean, have been specially positioned in recent days because of tensions in the region, the Navy spokesman said. **********Officials have refused to speculate on military contingencies for American forces, other than to say that Washington has discussed with gulf countries the possibility of providing air cover for commercial oil tankers. But if the United States was called upon to defend gulf shipping against further attacks, the most crucial factor would be availability of bases in Saudi Arabia, according to military experts. **********A source on the House Armed Services Committee familiar with military operations in the gulf region said that there were enough United States forces in the area now to provide protection but that the problem was bringing them close enough to operate efficiently. Maintaining continuous air support over gulf ports from the Kitty Hawk stationed in the Arabian Sea, for example, would be technically feasible but very expensive. **********Eugene J. Carroll Jr., a retired Navy rear admiral now with the Center for Defense Information here, who commanded the Sixth Fleet carrier group from 1975 to 1977, said a likely contingency if United States forces were called into action would be to pull the Kitty Hawk into the throat of the Gulf of Oman. Combat air patrols of F-14 jet fighters, probably requiring airborne refueling by the Kitty Hawk's KA-6 tankers, would then be continuously maintained. **********A far superior alternative, Mr. Carroll said, would be if Saudi Arabia agreed to permit American military operations on its territory. In this case, he said, squadrons of Air Force F-15's could be flown out of Dhahran on the Persian Gulf's western shore. It would take about 36 hours, he added, to bring the F-15's from Air Force bases in the United States. **********Although the United States imports only about 5 percent of its oil from gulf countries, Western Europe and Japan are heavily dependent on supplies from the region.

One British source put Soviet losses in the Panjshir Valley at 500 men, plus 2,000 more throughout the country since the offensive started in mid-April. **********The analysts - in Washington, in other NATO capitals and Pakistan - said the losses were considered serious for a force that reportedly had lost only 5,000 men since the Soviet intervention began in late 1979. **********Some experts on the Soviet order of battle said they believed that, as a consequence, Soviet forces were being strengthened by the addition of fresh units. One estimate is that the reinforcements will push total strength to about 120,000 men. **********Militarily, the most significant development of the operations has been the extensive and successful use of the air force. According to neutral observers citing insurgent information, Soviet pilots performed with efficiency against insurgent strongpoints and troops caught in the open.   Firebombs Reported Used **********According to Jane's Defense Weekly, the Russians also used liquid firebombs.  These burst into flame on contact with the ground. There have been reports, never verified, that munitions of this type had been used earlier. **********The bombing, both at high altitude and at low level, appears to have been effective. Camouflaged and well protected rebel positions have been taken out by fighter-bombers guided to their targets by forward air controllers flying in helicopters and marking the targets by smoke. Casualties among civilians are believed to have been high. **********The Su-25, code-named Frogfoot by NATO, appears to have been the most effective fixed-wing aircraft. Operating in pairs, the Su-25's have used their guns, rockets and antipersonnel bombs against key targets. The tactics are to come in at a low level after the target has been marked and the results were described by one analyst as devastating.   Up to 100 Sorties a Day **********At the height of the operations, the source said, the air force was flying at least 100 sorties a day. A sortie is one mission by one aircraft. **********Some of the planes flew from bases in the Soviet Union, a British source said. Others were based in Afghanistan. **********One result of the success of the Soviet air tactics has been the movement of thousands of refugees into Pakistan. Common misery, a Pakistani source said, has not brought unity among the insurgents. **********He and other well-qualified sources report that rivalry among insurgent bands continues to the detriment of the military effort. He said he knew of cases in which one insurgent group, learning that another was about to attack the Russians, would inform the Soviet side to insure the defeat of the rival faction. **********American military sources, reviewing the offensive, noted that the Russians appear to have achieved a marriage between their helicopter forces and ground troops.   Coverage of Ground Attacks **********Infantry and armored fighting vehicle attacks were invariably covered by helicopter forces that engaged hostile ground forces and prevented attacks on the Soviet flanks. The ground attacks, allied sources report, customarily followed bombing by fixed-wing bombers carrying out carpet bombing of the operations area. **********The Russians also used helicopters successfully to land ground forces on mountain summits commanding the Panjshir Valley and its tributary valleys. Ground forces were also landed when reconnaissance reported insurgent units gathering for attack. In one such operation, south of the Salang Tunnel on the main highway from the Soviet Union, it is estimated that an insurgent force of 1,500 men was routed by helicopter-borne infantry. **********In contrast to American operations in Vietnam, helicopters with or without infantrymen aboard are able to spot insurgents unshielded by jungle. Many intelligence sources believe that the recent operations were evidence of a higher sophistication in planning and maneuver than earlier operations.   No Way of Checking Rebel Claims **********The quality of the rebels is difficult to assess, intelligence sources say. **********By their own testimony, the guerrillas inflicted serious losses on the Soviet forces, but there is no way of checking their claims. Their own losses, intelligence analysts said, probably were high and they must expect to take similar losses until they are armed with the antiaircraft and antitank weapons they require to check Soviet attacks. Few such weapons have been reported by neutral obseervers. **********Disunity among the guerrilla bands and a low level of training remain their weakness. One Pakistani source, familiar with the situation, said that in his opinion the insurgents' combat efficiency was well below that of the Vietcong in Vietnam or the Algerian insurrection against the French. **********His view of the future, echoed by Western intelligence analysts, is that the Russians have now cleared the Panjshir Valley to the extent that convoys can move through it.

Rather than continuing to moderate between now and year-end - as projected by many governmental and private economists - the rate of economic growth, some analysts now predict, will increase instead. **********In their interpretation, these economists tend to play down recent Government reports as well as activity in the credit markets that suggest softening conditions. Rather, they focus on renewed vigor in consumer spending, on the positive aspects of speedy resolution of labor negotiations with the automobile and coal workers and on a stabilization and possible improvement in the nation's foreign trade deficit. **********As a result, these analysts now suggest that the gross national product, after adjustment for inflation, could expand at an annual rate of 4.5 percent to 6 percent in the fourth quarter. **********The Summertime Slowdown **********If realized, that would represent a substantial jump from the 3.6 percent rate of rise the Commerce Department announced last week as its ''flash'' estimate of third-quarter growth. **********''There was a definite slowdown in the economy during the summer, particularly in consumer spending, which was at its worst in early August, when we were watching the Olympics,'' said M. Kathryn Eickhoff, executive vice president at Townsend-Greenspan & Company, an economic consulting firm. ''But a reacceleration is already under way. Consumer spending has picked up, auto sales will continue to be strong and the softness in nonresidential fixed investment is not likely to continue.'' **********Miss Eickhoff said that six weeks ago she was projecting a 6 percent growth rate for the third quarter, falling to 4 percent in the fourth quarter. Now she expects output in the fourth quarter to be around 5 percent. **********Contrasting Opinions Held **********But the view that business conditions will firm up during the next three months is not universally held. Many economists continue to stand by their earlier forecasts, which call for a further moderation in growth in the fourth quarter to between 2.5 percent and 3 percent. The Commerce Department's third-quarter estimate, which showed the economy expanding at barely half its pace in the second quarter - a revised 7.1 percent - is no aberration, they contend. **********''In all of the data there is a clear, soft undertone to business at this time,'' said Allen Sinai, a managing director at Shearson Lehman/American Express. ''We don't just have here a pause with a rebound to 4 percent to 5 percent growth in the fourth quarter. We have something more fundamental.'' **********He and others find support for the position that economic growth may stay subdued by noting a reduced level of housing and residential construction activity, a less active consumer and a marked reduction in private credit demand. **********Big Banks' Actions Watched **********The latter development prompted the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company to shave its prime rate by one- fourth percentage point last week, to 12 3/4 percent. **********''I still think that we will have a pretty strong expansion that will continue into late next year,'' said Francis H. Schott, chief economist at the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. ''But when major banks judge that something important has happened that warrants a cut in rates, then I have to wonder if they know something that I don't.'' **********As is often the case, the main battle among economists trying to foretell the future centers on consumers, who after six quarters of heavy spending appear to have contributed little to growth in the third quarter. **********''Consumers decided to take a vacation over the summer, especially when the Presidential candidates were talking about messing around with their taxes and there weren't enough cars around to satisfy demand,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities. **********Consumer Spending Outlook **********''If the auto industry goes full throttle and the cars they produce get bought up,'' he said, ''you could possibly see a 6 percent G.N.P. number in the fourth quarter.'' **********Mr. Sinai disagreed. ''Consumers are shifting away from purchases of big ticket items like houses, cars and appliances and are moving toward greater savings,'' he said. ''And if consumer sales slow down, that has to reverberate back to production, orders and employment and income growth.'' **********In its ''flash'' estimate, the Commerce Department said it did not make any adjustment for the effects of the automobile strike, adding that if the strike had continued for the final 10 days of the third quarter, it could have reduced G.N.P. growth by as much as three-tenths percentage point. **********However, Mr. Yardeni and others pointed out that the threat of a prolonged strike did have an effect, as businesses slowed hiring and production plans. And had the walkout continued into the fourth quarter, the effect would have been considerable. **********If the Strike Had Continued **********''If the strike had gone on for all three months of the fourth quarter, it would have knocked the growth rate down by 6 percentage points at an annual rate,'' Townsend-Greenspan's Miss Eickhoff said. ''Now that the strike has been settled, a lot of the risk has been removed from the fourth quarter.'' **********By comparison, a walkout by coal workers, who agreed to a new pact before their strike deadline, would have had a modest effect on the economy, Miss Eickhoff said. **********''If the steel industry was operating at a high rate and coal went out on strike, then it would have had an effect,'' she said. ''But steel is producing so little. And the electric utilities, which were buying up coal in anticipation of a strike, appear to have enough to get us through the winter.'' **********In spite of their differing views on output, economists of all stripes seem agreed on one thing: Inflation will remain quite moderate. **********''The inflation numbers still look terrific,'' said Donald Straszheim, a vice president at Wharton Econometrics. ''As measured by the Consumer Price Index, an inflation rate of between 4 percent and 5 percent is likely in the fourth quarter.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/25/world/us-army-unit-in-st-kitts.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 65, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Army Unit in St. Kitts", "print_headline": "U.S. Army Unit in St. Kitts", "body_text": " **********-Nevis, Aug. 24 (UPI) - A team of 18 United States Army officers has arrived to conduct a security training program for the St. Kitts Special Services Unit, a Government statement said Thursday.

Oliveira, who uses it to track a score of salespeople for the Equipment Sales Company here in Lowell. ''But it is so incredibly fast, and easy, that we can do far more.'' **********Driving this headlong overhaul of business practices are not the small computers themselves, but the remarkably popular genre of personal computer programs known as electronic spreadsheets. **********The spreadsheet software is an electronic version of the pale-green columned paper, pencils and erasers that small companies have used for generations to lay out, in neat rows and columns, sales for the month or pending orders - all in an effort to figure out where their business stood at any particular moment. **********The task was tedious and uninviting. Changing one number in one column could require recalculating dozens of other entries. **********Now, with the press of a button, the computerized spreadsheets can execute tasks that used to take hours. The spreadsheet programs have led the flourishing software market and, experts say, spurred sales of personal computers. **********The spreadsheets have also opened up dozens of new applications. Some owners of small businesses, who concede that until lately they would not have known what software was, say they now crave statistical information they never before knew they needed.  It is not uncommon today, for example, for the shoe store owner to turn to a computer to figure the value of his inventories, product by product, in an effort to keep costs down. Nor is it rare for a small-town builder to use the computer to prepare a bid for building a house, breaking out each component of costs for labor and materials, rather than relying on guesswork. **********''It has been something of an amazing revolution,'' said Douglas F. Cobb, vice president of the Que Corporation, an Indianapolis publisher that turns out a newsletter for spreadsheet users. ''I have never seen a single tool that people tried to use for more different things than an electronic spreadsheet.'' **********Nowhere is the effect of this quiet revamping of small-business practices more visible than in Lowell, a revived mill town, at the offices of Equipment Sales, which both sells equipment that tests electronic circuit boards and assembles many boards at its factory. **********For years, Mr. Oliveira, executive vice president of Equipment Sales, kept track of his 20 traveling salesmen with a calculator and a wide, green sheet of paper he spread across his desk. He painstakingly created half a dozen columns across the page and detailed who sold what, how much each of the salesmen was owed in commissions for each of 30 separate products and how their performance compared with the previous year. **********'An Unspeakable Pain' **********It was boring, repetitive work that Mr. Oliveira dreaded. ''An unspeakable pain in the neck,'' he said. **********Now the ruled pad and calculator sit untouched in a desk drawer, replaced by an International Business Machines Corporation Personal Computer and 1-2-3 software from the Lotus Development Corporation. Mr. Oliveira has become so enthralled that he uses the computers and software to track the whereabouts of thousands of circuit boards the company assembles. **********Thousands of executives have purchased electronic spreadsheet programs, which sell for $100 to $600, and modified them to fit the exact needs of their companies. The financial data must still be entered by hand, but the endless process of revision and recalculation is gone. **********Hit on Wall Street **********The programs are a particular hit on Wall Street for designing and testing financial models. But they are also a hit in less likely places, like Caldwell, Idaho, where Johnson's Llamas maintains its modest offices. **********The Idaho enterprise is run by O. David Johnson, a physician who decided a few years ago to raise llamas on the side, selling them as pets and to companies that run pack trips. But keeping track of more than 70 animals and figuring the cost of feeding and boarding them in summer and winter became an overwhelming task. Now all of that information is stored in his Apple II and a spreadsheet called Visicalc. **********''At any moment, I have a printout of what llama is where, and how much it costs me to keep him,'' Dr. Johnson reported. ''There is no question it has saved me money.'' **********Spreadsheets were orignally intended to save time, not money. The first, Visicalc, was the product of a Harvard Business School student's frustration at endlessly erasing and recalculating numbers used to analyze corporate strategies in the school's case study methods. The student teamed up with a computer programmer, and the result was Visicalc, a ''first generation'' spreadsheet. It has been followed by ''integrated programs,'' such as Lotus 1-2- 3, which not only keep track of the numbers but also spit out pie charts and line graphs that illustrate the data, or merge the financial information into a letter or report. **********A Coach's Blackboard **********No matter what refinements are added, however, the programs are as instantly recognizable to business people as a blackboard would be to a football coach. ''It's something every businessman has created sometime, even if he didn't know what to call it,'' Mr. Cobb said. **********A typical use might be in an auto parts store, where the owner has to take inventory. He might start by making at least three headings across the top of a piece of paper. The first might be marked ''Number of Units in Stock'' and the second, ''Price Per Unit.'' The third, arrived at by multiplying the figures in the first two, might be marked ''Value of Units in Stock.'' Additional columns might figure the cost of sales - such as the overhead involved in storing the part - and the profit margin on each item. **********On each line, the store owner would enter the figures: on one line sparkplugs might be listed, on the next rear-view mirrors, and so on for hundreds of items in stock. By tallying the values in the third column, the worth of all the store's stock could be determined. **********If done on paper, a revision of any single number on the spreadsheet could throw off all the totals, and the records could quickly fall out of date. But in electronic spreadsheets, whenever a single number is changed, all those below it are automatically refigured. **********'What If' Projections **********That is why the ''what if'' projections are so popular: A food manufacturer, for example, could figure out how much it would cost to change ingredients, and how that would affect profit. **********The electronic spreadsheet is no panacea. It takes users of most of the programs a few days to get accustomed to what can appear to be an intimidating new language. And all of the data must be entered into the computer, a task no less tedious than writing them out on paper. **********But the calculations, the hardest and most error-prone steps, are done by the computer. Many who use the systems say they find themselves getting so proficient ''speaking the language'' of computers that they have quickly designed customized spreadsheets that answer questions they never before had time to ponder. **********Alan Axelrod, for example, never before had an efficient way to keep track of the dyes he uses to color yarn at the Crown Yarn Dye Corporation of South Attleboro, Mass. **********''The dyes keep changing all the time, and so do their prices,'' he said recently. ''We used to keep that on paper, but it was a mess - cross outs, scribbles, a real disaster.'' **********Now he keeps that information on a spreadsheet that runs on his sophisticated Fortune Systems computer. He also uses the spreadsheet to track how much oil and steam he uses; when the figure on steam jumped one week, he discovered a leaky pipe. **********At Equipment Sales in Lowell, the results have been dramatic. The company, which last year became a unit of the Esterline Company, not only sells electronic test equipment to other manufacturers, but ''stuffs,'' or inserts components onto printed circuit boards that form the core of computers and other equipment. **********A Spur to Salesmen **********The spreadsheets were first put to use in tracking sales. ''I essentially made the same sheet that I used to do on paper,'' Mr. Oliveira said. But he added a few things: not only does the sheet determine sales and commissions, but it also calculates this year's sales as a percentage of last year's. Each month the charts are printed and mailed to the salesmen. **********''It's a fabulous tool for us and for them,'' he said. ''There is also a subtle pressure. They see that line,'' he said, pointing to the place at which commissions total more than $100,000, ''and they really go for it.'' **********It is also a diagnostic tool, used for early warning of troubles. By analyzing the reports quickly, Mr. Oliveira discovered recently that sales in parts of California, a prime market for the company, were faltering badly. ''It's something we otherwise would not have seen for several months,'' he said. **********But the real efficiencies did not begin until last October, when the company spent two weeks modifying a spreadsheet to track each of the thousands of printed circuit boards it assembles. While large manufacturers often have automated inventory controls, Equipment Sales was never big enough for that. **********''We used a clipboard and white- lined paper,'' said Valerie Comerford, data services manager for the company. **********Every day, someone would wander through the factory, counting up how many of dozens of different types of boards were still awaiting assembly, how many were assembled but not soldered, how many had been tested, and how many were sitting on the loading dock. ''Even while you are counting, people were picking up the boards and moving them to the next stop,'' she said. ''It was a mess.'' **********Now every afternoon each unit in the factory takes a census that is reported to Miss Comerford and entered into a spreadsheet. The next morning, the data are ready for the daily production meeting, where the company tries to overcome bottlenecks. The data are also used to determine the cost of each step in the manufacturing process, crucial information when the company is bidding on assembly projects."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/13/business/handling-growth-recession.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1188, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HANDLING 'GROWTH RECESSION'", "print_headline": "HANDLING 'GROWTH RECESSION'", "body_text": " **********Fourteen years ago, as the American economy dawdled, an economics professor, Solomon Fabricant, coined the term ''growth recession'' to describe a period in which the economy slows dramatically but keeps sputtering forward. While the economy was still growing, he suggested, the decline in the rate of expansion could seem almostas traumatic as an outright contraction. **********Not everyone approved of the term. Herbert Stein of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers suggested that one might as well call a dog ''a growth horse.'' But the concept stuck, and in the last few months it has became fashionable to describe the current economic slump as a growth recession. (Gross national product grew at an annual rate of only 1.9 percent last quarter, compared with 10.1 percent in the first quarter and 7.1 percent in the second quarter.) **********The problem in many growth recessions has been that the readjustment that takes place has been painful. Even though the economy continues to grow, some production lines are closed down and unemployment often rises. The question that typically arises, then, is what to expect next. Does the growth recession require the kind of measures that would be taken to revive an economy that is contracting, or is the growth recession likely to be self-correcting? **********For the most part, economists today see the slowdown as a useful phase following a period of rapid growth. And while there has been a consensus that faster monetary growth is called for to help revitalize the economy, the pain from the slowdown seems to have been less than might have been expected. Unemployment, for example, has remained almost steady this fall and actually dipped to 7 percent in November. **********The best advice, said David A. Levine, an economist with Sanford D. Bernstein & Company, is ''to be very philosophical'' about the current slump. Slowdowns of this sort tend to be largely self-correcting, he noted, expressing a view held by many economists. And since inflation is not a threat, he added, there is room for a more relaxed monetary policy. **********Economists Optimistic **********In fact Mr. Levine and others say that it is quite common for an expanding economy to move into a period of subdued growth. In most cases, such a pause has allowed the economy to digest its previous growth, and to spring forward with new vigor. So far as the current growth recession goes, economists are optimistic that it will be a beneficial one that paves the way for further growth. **********''Is it bad? Is it good? Is it a prelude to a recession? That really depends on what else is going on,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of Shearson Lehman/American Express, of the current pause in growth. ''It's not necessarily bad; indeed in this case - it sounds perverse - but I think it is positive. Less than potential growth sets up diminished demand- pull inflation. Less inflation suggests lower interest rates. The pair, less inflation and lower interest rates, would lengthen the expansion.'' **********Saul Hymans, professor of economics and director of forecasting at the University of Michigan, also believes this growth recession will lead to nothing worse. He predicts a strong surge of growth next year, fueled in part by declining interest rates. **********Each Cycle Is Different **********Each business cycle is different. In most recoveries, however, various segments of the economy bound ahead, some more strongly than others. This eventually leads to imbalances. Inventories may begin to mount faster than sales, or interest rates may soar to levels that discourage borrowing. As business is reined in, the economy slows. In the current slowdown, inventories accumulated and the trade deficit deteriorated, both of which acted as a drag on growth. **********A growth recession usually returns to full steam by some of the same mechanisms that return a real recession to growth. Typically, interest rates are tugged down by declining economic activity, until eventually they are so low that people start borrowing again. In addition, inventory surpluses are gradually eliminated, and new orders pick up. Moreover, the slow growth usually eases worries by the Federal Reserve about inflation, so it eases its grip on the nation's money. **********One reason why many economists are bullish for 1985 is that the record of past growth recessions is encouraging. In most growth recessions, the economy grows at an average of 2 percent or less for two or more quarters. (Economists use varying criteria to measure growth recessions.) Of the 19 quarters between 1950 and 1984 when economic growth was positive but less that 2 percent, 13 were followed by quarters in which the gross national product increased at an annual rate of 2 percent or more. **********Geoffrey H. Moore, an expert in business cycles at Columbia Business School, identifies three growth recessions and seven true recessions since World War II. The slowdowns he isolates occurred in 1951 to 1952, 1962 to 1963 and 1966 to 1967. **********''This resembles more the growth recession than the real one,'' he said, referring to the present slowdown. ''But we haven't completed our research. This is still preliminary.'' **********Likewise, Goldman, Sachs & Company expects the economy to bounce back next year, based in part on comparisons with growth recessions in 1962 to 1963, and in 1976. In 1976, for example, G.N.P. boomed at a 9.1 percent clip during the first quarter, but then fell to a rate of about 2.5 percent for the next six months. After climbing to 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter, the economy registered a zippy 8.9 percent in 1977's first three months. **********Helpful Decline in Rates Seen **********Rosanne Cahn, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, said she expected the declines in interest rates to help pull the economy back into gear next year. But she, like other economists, does not expect more of the 8 percent growth that the United States enjoyed from mid-1983 to mid-1984. **********Mr. Levine of Bernstein said that most of the period since the Korean War could be divided into ''booms'' followed by slowdowns. He isolates 11 booms - of which the latest recovery was the last - and believes we are now entering the 11th slowdown. **********Because these slowdowns have lasted an average of 3.3 quarters, depending largely on how quickly inventory growth slowed, he believes the present slowdown will last about a year. Inventories continued to pile up in the third quarter, after the growth recession began, he noted. **********A minority of economists believes the present phase in the United States is not a growth recession at all but simply a transition to a real recession. Roger Williams, former chief economist at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, who now publishes an economic newsletter in Orangeburg, N.Y., said he expected a recession because of the drag on the economy from the trade deficit, large inventories and other factors. **********''Because of the lag in reporting, we don't know how far the slide has gone,'' he said. ''And it may well have slipped into the negative column this month. This means, of course, the beginning of recession by any definition of the word.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/19/business/american-stores-in-ftc-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "American Stores In F.T.C.

Building materials companies, appliance manufacturers, savings and loans and other ''interest sensitive'' businesses tied to the housing industry have rapidly fallen from favor. Likewise, large electronics and computer companies, aluminum manufacturers and transportation companies that saw their stock prices rise steadily last year have fallen back. **********But domestic oil companies, up 7.9 percent and international oil companies, up 2 percent, have performed better, in the last five weeks, than every other segment measured by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, although analysts are quick to point out that ''doing well'' in such a market becomes relative. And the analysts recall that the oil companies, as a group, were not only lackluster when the bull market began rolling forward in the second half of 1982, but also declined in value when most other issues were soaring. **********Besides the two oils segments, only New York City banks, copper companies and property insurance companies generally avoided stock value declines.

Marshall Acuff Jr., director of portfolio management for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. He added that stocks that have either gained value or declined only slightly in the downturn are issues ''where expectations have been low all along.'' **********Indeed, changing expectations have meant that ''high beta stocks,'' or those that tend to respond in an exaggerated way to changing economic conditions, have been among the worst performing issues, said Elaine M. Garzarelli, a senior investment strategist for A. G. Becker Inc. Among these ''high beta'' issues, all of which had performed well early in the bull market, were electronics companies, airlines and building materials concerns, she said. **********Among decliners, mobile home makers and aluminunm companies, which had been the earliest and most dramatic beneficiaries of the bull market, fell the most. Air freight companies, furniture and appliance manufacturers, and agricultural machinery companies, other stellar performers early in the bull market, also ranked among the five biggest losing categories on the S. & P. list. **********Yesterday, the stock market resumed its bearish trend, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing off 5.13 points. On Tuesday, in a widely unexpected advance, the average rose more than 13 points. **********No Rally Seen **********But many of Wall Street's ranking money managers and investment strategists said they expected stock prices to continue declining for at least another month and then rise slowly, if at all. Their reasoning: Mounting fears about the huge Federal deficit and possible higher interest rates will force institutional money managers away from the stock market into bonds and other fixed-income instruments. **********''It may be a case where the big money managers are so anxious to get out of equities that they can't squeeze out the same exit,'' said L. Howard Nichol, who follows the electronics industry for Advest Inc. **********In fact, some of the large electronics companies, whose stocks had been rising steadilly since the onset of the bull market, have fallen for the first time during the last five weeks. These include International Business Machines and Control Data. Institutional accounts have tended to be heavily weighted with these stocks. **********Interest-sensitive stocks, which tend to rise in value when rates fall and consumer credit becomes more obtainable, have almost all plunged. The exception: The automobile group, usually hurt by the expectation of higher rates but ''holding up well because auto company earnings had been underestimated,'' said Mrs. Garzarelli of A. G. Becker. **********Analysts said the oil companies, which have stood out as the best performing stocks in recent weeks, have benefited from a spate of merger and takeover proposals, and the expectation of more to come. In addition, a relatively cold winter here and in Europe has raised oil demand and apparently made stability of international oil prices more likely. **********Banks and Insurers **********The two other stock groups that performed relatively well - both of which would normally be hurt by the expectation of higher interest rates - were New York City's major banks, and insurers that specialize in property and casualty policies. **********In the case of the New York banks, the analysts said stock prices were supported because fears that some underdeveloped nations would default on their loans have been reduced. As for insurance companies, Donald E. Franz Jr. of Smith Barney said stock prices had fallen sharply between mid-December and mid- January, and the slight rise in recent weeks was merely a correction. **********Meanwhile, reflecting the complexity and changing expectations in the current market are the conflicting performances of aluminum company stocks, which have recently ranked among the worst performers, and copper stocks, which have been among the best. **********William G. Siedenburg, who follows both industries for Smith Barney, said aluminum stocks had far outpaced the bull market. **********''The aluminums still look good, but the market apparently thinks they moved too high,'' he said. **********On the other hand, the stocks of copper companies rose far below the average of the bull market last year, he said. And now, with new orders for copper coming in from Europe, where the economic recovery is now picking up steam, investors are belatedly looking at the copper companies with favor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/25/business/bancal-s-tokyo-connection.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1984-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANCAL'S TOKYO CONNECTION", "print_headline": "BANCAL'S TOKYO CONNECTION", "body_text": " **********Mrs. Fields's Chocolate Chippery spent a long and frustrating year trying to rent space for a store in Tokyo before turning to its bank, the Bank of California. **********In short order, the bank's parent, Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. of Japan, helped the Fields organization rent a storefront in the Ginza shopping area - not a major business transaction, perhaps, but a clear demonstration of how Mitsubishi can help the Bank of California attract the medium-sized corporate clients it wants as the core of its business, according to BanCal's chairman, Ross P. Williams Jr. **********For Mitsubishi Bank, the deal provided a valuable glimpse of how to tap a segment of the American market, one in which Mitsubishi has very little experience, according to Junji Hatano, BanCal's new executive vice president. **********''One of the main purposes in buying the bank,'' Mr. Hatano said, ''is to have a better approach to the American 'middle market' '' - one he defined as companies worth $5 million to $200 million. **********Mitsubishi and BanCal are also collaborating on several other projects similar to the Fields cookie deal, in which Mitsubishi is using its Japanese contacts to draw in business for BanCal, Mr. Hatano said. The bank helped Avalon Bay Food Inc., an Oakland-based seafood packager, begin operations in Singapore, for example. **********Shareholders of the Bank of California, the state's eighth largest, approved its $282 million merger with Mitsubishi Bank, now ranked seventh in the world, last January. The board's recommendation to accept Mitsubishi's $50-a-share offer, following a higher last-minute offer from Wells Fargo Bank, drew criticism from analysts, who questioned why BanCal chose the lower offer and a foreign company over a domestic one. **********Japanese Presence on Coast **********The merger brought to nine the number of Japanese banks, wholly or partly owned, in California, according to Gary Palmer, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Of the state's 10 largest banks, three are Japanese-owned: California First, ranked seventh and owned 76 percent by the Bank of Tokyo; BanCal, and Sumitomo Bank of California, ranked 10th. **********The attractions for Mitsubishi and the other Japanese banks are evident, said J. Richard Fredericks, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ''The Japanese are part of the whole Pacific Rim, there is a very large Japanese population here, and California itself is a tremendous marketplace,'' he said. **********But so far, according to both Mr. Fredericks and Donald K. Crowley, a senior vice president with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in San Francisco, the state's Japanese-owned banks have kept a low profile, reporting moderate earnings and, in some cases, slight declines in profitability.   Earnings Had Slipped **********When Mitsubishi bought BanCal, the 120-year-old bank had been reporting lower earnings, in part because the bank had decided to sell all but 20 of its 49 branches and concentrate instead on building up its ''private bank'' - a range of services for corporate clients and wealthy individuals. **********The bank's assets as of June 30 of this year were $3.5 billion, down from $3.9 billion in the comparable quarter last year. It reported a second-quarter loss of $3.64 million, in contrast to an $11.56 million profit in last year's quarter. The loss reflected merger expenses and some bond trading losses. **********But BanCal had attractions for Mitsubishi, which already owns the Mitsubishi Bank of California, a retail bank. Mr. Hatano cited BanCal's emphasis on corporate banking for medium-sized companies, a charter that predates the Glass-Steagall Act and allows operations in Oregon and Washington as well as California, and its experience with financial deregulation. **********Through its ''private bank,'' BanCal has offered a number of investment and other services that Mr. Hatano said could position Mitsubishi to compete better in the Japanese market, now slowly being deregulated. **********''This is sort of a pilot,'' he said. ''Financial services, discount brokerages, trusts, the whole area of how to react to deregulation is one of the interests that Mitsubishi has.'' **********Nevertheless, Mr. Hatano and Mr. Williams said they would like to see BanCal report better earnings, expand its three-state activities and increase its share in the middle market.  ''Our bottom-line results have not been particularly spectacular,'' Mr. Williams acknowledged. Nor, he said, had the bank taken full advantage of its right to operate in three states. **********Tough Competition **********Richard Rosenberg, vice chairman of the Crocker Bank, said that BanCal would face tough competition in the middle market - some of it from Mitsui Manufacturers Bank, another Japanese-owned bank. **********Mitsui, he said, ''is one of the best of the middle-market banks.'' He added: ''Middle-market companies have enormous loyalties. I think it's a very tough go.'' **********But Mr. Fredericks of Montgomery Securities said that the bank's new strategy had begun to pay off. ''Mitsubishi should leave BanCal alone on that one,'' he said. ''They were just about to turn a corner. The reputation building in the marketplace was quite good.'' **********Mr. Hatano said that Mitsubishi not only approves of that strategy but also intends to continue it. He and Mr. Williams cited a number of steps BanCal had taken to move toward these goals. First, Mr. Hatano said, Mitsubishi had to reassure BanCal's employees - especially the women in the company - that personnel matters would be ''completely American style.'' In general, women in banks in Japan hold secretarial positions. **********Next, Mr. Williams said, the bank was reorganized to trim overhead costs. Mitsubishi has also encouraged BanCal to make long-term investments in systems development, advanced technology and promotional materials to expand its reach in California, Washington and Oregon, Mr. Williams said, even if it must forgo short-term profits to do so. **********Mr. Williams added that one way the bank was trying to increase its presence in Washington and Oregon was by providing introductions in Japan for the ports of Tacoma, Wash., and Portland, Ore., which are both eager to attract more international business. **********One project that Mitsubishi and BanCal have in the works involves a large American ice cream manufacturer that wants to distribute in Japan, where most ice cream, being low in butterfat, tastes like American ice milk. **********Mr. Hatano acknowledged a personal interest in that deal. When he and his family came to the United States more than a decade ago so he could study at the Stanford Business School, they were delighted by the taste of American ice cream. Now, although Baskin-Robbins has outlets in Japan, he said he would be pleased to see more American ice cream in his homeland."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/10/world/president-vows-to-try-to-help-israeli-economy.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1984-10-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 920, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRESIDENT VOWS TO TRY TO HELP ISRAELI ECONOMY", "print_headline": "PRESIDENT VOWS TO TRY TO HELP ISRAELI ECONOMY", "body_text": " **********President Reagan told Prime Minister Shimon Peres today that the United States would ''cooperate the best way we can'' to resolve Israel's pressing economic problems. He specifically promised to provide emergency help if Israel was faced with a balance-of-payments crisis. **********After listening for two days to Mr. Peres's detailed plea for billions of dollars in additional American financial support over several years, the Administration, however, put off until next year any move to increase Israel's military and economic aid above the current annual level of $2.6 billion. **********Instead, Mr. Reagan announced an agreement to form a Joint Economic Development Group of government and nongovernmental experts from the two countries to examine questions dealing with aid, investment and other financial issues. This group is not expected to reach any conclusions before January, a senior American official said. **********Lebanon Also Discussed **********One official said the group would take on many of the functions of the International Monetary Fund in trying to force austerity on a country seeking more loans. Mr. Peres, in appearances on Capitol Hill and elsewhere in Washington, has stressed that Israel recognizes that it must tighten its economic belt but wants to do so with the certainty of more American aid. **********Although Israel's economy dominated the talks here, the Israelis and Americans also discussed in detail the prospects for an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. Mr. Reagan indicated, however, that the United States remained unwilling to become a mediator between Israel and Syria. One official said there was no point in the Administration mediating until all parties knew the result of the Presidential election on Nov. 6. **********Through the joint economic group, the Administration hopes to halt Congress's practice of increasing aid to Israel in an unstructured way, a State Department official said. In recent years, pro-Israeli members of Congress have been able to increase aid to Israel by hundreds of millions of dollars above Administration requests. The Administration hopes that by having aid recommendations come from this panel, it can persuade Congress not to tamper with its recommendations. **********Israel's Next Step **********With Congress ending its session this week, it would be impossible for a new aid program to be approved now, a senior State Department official said. The prospect, other officials said, is for Israel to press in the coming year for a major increase in aid, perhaps as much as 50 percent. That would inevitably lead to a similar request from Egypt, which receives more than $2 billion annually. **********Mr. Peres went out of his way to stress his satisfaction with the results of the meetings and was liberal in his praise of Mr. Reagan. Mr. Peres plans to meet Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic challenger to the President, before leaving the country at the end of the week. **********''I found in the White House,'' Mr. Peres told reporters in the Rose Garden, ''a true friend of Israel who understands our problems and dilemmas.'' He said that in his meetings here he found that relations between the United States and Israel ''have reached a new level of harmony and understanding, which I am very grateful for.''  Private Meeting Reported **********In a private briefing later for Israeli journalists, Mr. Peres said he was particularly pleased by the President's statement that the United States would help avert any balance-of-payments crisis for Israel as it tries to solve economic problems, such as the 400 percent annual inflation growth and mounting trade deficits. **********According to an Israeli journalist, Mr. Peres also said he had met with Mr. Reagan today with no advisers present, and additional promises were made. He declined to say what they were. **********With Mr. Peres standing next to him, Mr. Reagan said, ''We've made clear our willingness to continue our dialogue and to cooperate with Israel in the best way we can as Israel proceeds with its plans.'' **********He noted that Israel had already taken some steps - such as a cut of $1 billion in its $23 billion budget, a curb on imports of foreign luxury goods and a limit on how much foreign exchange can be taken abroad.   Short-Term Solution **********Congress has just passed $2.6 billion in aid - $1.2 billion in economic aid and $1.4 billion in military aid - for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Mr. Reagan stressed that the Administration would make available the full $1.2 billion immediately, without Israel having to wait for quarterly disbursements, as other recipients do. **********This money ''will enable Israel to develop its programs without having to divert undue attention to balance-of- payments problems,'' Mr. Reagan said. **********''Should such problems arise,'' he promised, ''the U.S. Government will work closely with the Israeli Government to avert them.'' **********The Treasury Department has authority in emergency situations to provide stop-gap loans to help nations keep their credit rating, State Department officials said, in explaining what Mr. Reagan meant. **********The two men also agreed to tell their negotiators to complete within 30 days the details on creating free trade zones between the two countries. **********A senior Administration official said that Mr. Reagan raised with Mr. Peres the American concern about maintaining good relations with moderate Arab states and supplying them with military equipment. The Israelis replied, the official said, that they did not oppose arms being given to Egypt, the only Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel, but did oppose arms for other Arab countries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/23/business/optical-coating-laboratory-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OPTICAL COATING LABORATORY INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "print_headline": "OPTICAL COATING LABORATORY INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/14/world/chernenko-shuns-allied-overtures-on-nuclear-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1984-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 769, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHERNENKO SHUNS ALLIED OVERTURES ON NUCLEAR TALKS", "print_headline": "CHERNENKO SHUNS ALLIED OVERTURES ON NUCLEAR TALKS", "body_text": " **********Konstantin U.

On Tuesday, two Senate Republican leaders, Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee and Charles H. Percy of Illinois, urged President Reagan to seek a meeting with Mr. Chernenko to ease East-West tensions. **********In restating Moscow's position, Mr. Chernenko said that when more realistic proposals are made, the Soviet Union stands ready for ''a dialogue that is honest, and talks that are serious.'' **********He called the London declaration ''a screen to somehow cover up the transformation of the territories of some of the Western European countries into launching pads for the new United States missiles.'' **********The position of the United States and its allies has been that the American missiles were deployed under a NATO decision of 1979 to begin countering existing Soviet missiles with new American weapons in late 1983 unless an agreement on limitation could be reached. **********The Soviet Union has said it is prepared to return to the Geneva arms control talks if the American missiles are removed. The United States has offered to restart the talks ''anywhere, at any time, without preconditions,'' but has declined to cancel the missile deployment. **********In response, Mr. Chernenko said today: **********''We hold that these issues be considered in earnest at the negotiating table as soon as the American side withdraws its essentially peremptoryconditions for talks. **********''To aim new United States nuclear missiles at the Soviet Union and its allies and, at the same time, to urge talks - is this not political duplicity?'' **********While the Soviet Union has declined to resume the Geneva talks on strategic and medium-range missiles, it has been pressing the United States for negotiations aimed at a ban on antisatellite and other space weapons. **********Washington has been cool to such negotiations, partly on the ground that such an accord could not be verified. On Monday, Mr. Chernenko, in calling again for such talks, insisted that a ban could be verified. **********In the interview with Pravda, Mr. Chernenko also commented on some of the economic aspects of the London meeting, saying that its participants had failed to address the ''acute socio- economic problems that are intrinsic to the capitalist system, particularly unemployment, inflation and rising living costs.'' **********He defined the West's economic philosophy as ''the rich get richer and the poor poorer,'' and was critical of what he called ''ruthless exploitation by the industrially developed capitalist countries, mainly the United States, of the economically weak countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America.'' **********Much of the evening news program on Soviet television was given over to ceremonies in connection with a three- day economic meeting being held here by leaders of the Soviet bloc. **********No substantive reports on the work of this meeting have been issued so far, but several political and economic declarations are expected to be released when it ends Thursday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/15/business/us-petroleum-data.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Petroleum Data", "print_headline": "U.S. Petroleum Data", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/30/business/money-fund-assets-climb.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Money Fund Assets Climb", "print_headline": "Money Fund Assets Climb", "body_text": " **********Assets of the nation's money market mutual funds continued their surge, rising $2.76 billion, to $208.04 billion, in the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday. **********The assets have grown in 12 consecutive weeks by $28.2 billion to reach their highest level since Dec. 29, 1982, when assets stood at $211.24 billion, the institute stated. **********Assets of the 68 institutional funds accounted for the largest increase, $1.68 billion, climbing to $54.48 billion, the institute said. **********The 85 broker-dealer funds posted a $753 million increase, to $90.12 billion, and assets of the 184 general purpose funds gained $332 million, for a total of $63.43 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/02/business/prospects-keeping-the-sharks-at-bay.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1984-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEEPING THE SHARKS AT BAY", "print_headline": "PROSPECTS; KEEPING THE SHARKS AT BAY", "body_text": " **********''Shark repellents'' - antitakeover changes in corporate charters and bylaws - will be used with increasing zeal by companies facing unfriendly suitors, investment bankers say.

Other Moslems at the housing compound near Mr. Ansari's weaving and dyeing factory were not as fortunate. **********As Mr. Ansari and his son fired shots from the windows of a barricaded living room, they caught glimpses of swords flashing into necks and stomachs and heard the screams of wounded men as they were set on fire alive. **********When it was all over, as Mr. Ansari told it in a mournful return to the killing ground today, 27 Moslems lay dead in his yard or nearby, hacked or burned to death. It was the most gruesome single incident in the wave of Hindu-Moslem fighting and rioting that has swept the Bombay area since last Friday. And more than any other single incident, it has sent tremors of horror and revulsion across the country over this latest round of strife that perennially plagues India.   Three Hours of Carnage **********A large part of the more than 130 people who have been killed so far in the riots that later spread to Bombay died in those three hours outside Mr. Ansari's bungalow next to the now ruined factory. Much the same has happened elsewhere, with Moslems usually the victims in predominantly Hindu areas, and Hindus the victims in Moslem areas. **********The situation appeared tense but less deadly today after a deployment of army troops across the area. But sporadic violence and destruction continued in northern Bombay and along the industrial corridor stretching northeastward from there to this prosperous textile and pharmaceutical manufacturing town 30 miles from Bombay.  On the road out of Bhiwandi this afternoon, visitors passed a factory, a private house and two trucks, all freshly set afire and blazing. Lines of refugees, suitcases and bundles on their heads, trudged out of town, many of them leaving behind homes that had been burned to the ground. About 12,000 people in the Bombay area have been left homeless as a result of arson. **********In Bhiwandi, where more than 65 people died, all seemed quiet. But evidence of the battle Saturday could be seen outside the burned-out home where Mr. Ansari and his family were rescued by the police just as their final defenses were about to be breached. **********In the front yard, charred clothing lay alongside a puddle of congealed blood, the only reminder that a man was run through on that spot with a sword, doused with kerosene and set ablaze. **********Nearby, the small factory that had been the livelihood of Mr. Ansari and many workers in this town of 250,000 people lay in smoking ruins.  ''I never thought that his could happen,'' the 50-year-old manufacturer said as he looked around. ''The last time I protected my Hindu neighbor, and I never thought this would happen.'' **********The last time was 1970, when Bhiwandi went through similar violence. Later, some townspeople say, relations between Hindus and Moslems appeared to improve in this town, where Moslems are in the majority. **********But as Mr. Ansari said, ''Bad feelings have been there right from the partition'' of India and Pakistan in 1947, and nothing has really changed that much. **********Last week, Moslems, in an expression of group pride and assertiveness, raised the green flag of Islam over their homes in a symbolic battle with the followers of the Hindu Maratha activist organization, the Shiv Sena, who had raised their own saffron flags. Soon stones and bottles were being thrown, and then the killing and burning began. **********Other residents say that as Bhiwandi has grown and prospered as a vital part of India's rapidly industrializing economy, it has attracted many unsavory characters. Among them are criminals who have been driven out of other states and now live in the sprawling shantytowns on the outskirts of town. **********The criminals, along with unemployed youths, are being blamed for much of the killing and burning.   Knew Some of the Attackers **********All Mr. Ansari knows is that there were a lot of them who atacked his home and that most of them were young. He said he knew many of them personally and some pursued trades like liquor making. He insisted he knew of no personal animosity any of them bore toward him. **********On the morning of the killing, he said, about 50 Moslem families, fearful of being attacked in their homes nearby, sought refuge in the Ansari factory and bungalow compound just outside town. The women and children joined the Ansaris in the house. The men remained outside. **********The Hindus attacked at about 10:30 A.M. Mr. Ansari said he was not sure how long it took for the 27 men to die, but it was probably not long. Some were cut down where they stood, and others were killed as they tried to flee. **********The attackers systematically destroyed the factory, he said. ''Every 10 minutes a jeep would bring some kerosene,'' he said. **********A few of the attackers were arrested, but most escaped and are presumably in hiding. **********''They are misguided,'' Mr. Ansari said of the attackers who destroyed his livelihood and made his home ground, where he had planted every shrub and tree himself, a slaughterhouse. **********All that is gone now.

Officials said they believed that the new charges would involve the illegal importation of the weapon used in the shooting. **********Officials said the judge's decision was scheduled to be announced at Rome's central courthouse on Friday. **********Bulgaria Denies Any Role **********The decision sets the stage for a potentially sensational courtroom test of a purported Bulgarian role in the wounding of the Pope on May 13, 1981. **********Bulgaria has denied any connection with the shooting. **********The central witness for the prosecution will be Mr. Agca, who has given the Italian authorities elaborate, if sometimes contradictory, descriptions of the purported role of the Bulgarian secret services in the shooting. **********The prosecution's case is expected to rest to a major degree on Mr. Agca's credibility as a witness, and the changes in his testimony over time are expected to play a major role in the defense's case. **********What has become known as the ''Bulgarian connection'' is a matter of bitter controversy and enormous political importance. **********State Prosecutor Antonio Albano, who wrote a report to Judge Martella this year recommending that the case be brought to trial, said in June that he doubted that Bulgaria would have acted without the approval of the Soviet Union. **********The motive for the involvement of Bulgaria, the Soviet Union's most loyal ally, was the Eastern bloc's concern over the rise of the Solidarity trade union movement in Poland. **********The rise of Solidarity, according to Mr. Albano, was ''perceived as a mortal danger'' by East European Communist leaders, who believed the dissidence was ''mostly due to the fervent religious character'' of the people, strengthened by the election of ''the first Polish Pope in history.'' Killing the Pope, according to this theory, would help curb the Polish opposition.  Only one of the three Bulgarians indicted, Sergei Ivanov Antonov, is in Italian custody.

He predicted that Mr. Antonov would be cleared. **********Credibility Challenged **********Mr. Consolo said Mr. Agca's lack of credibility as a witness would be central to Mr. Antonov's defense. He said he would cite Mr. Acga's frequent shifts in testimony and his retractions of various charges. **********''Sixty to seventy percent of what he said he denied himself, and the other 30 percent is credible?'' Mr. Consolo asked rhetorically. ''Why? If he's a liar on 70 percent, he's a liar on everything.'' **********Mr. Consolo said he hoped the case would come to trial soon, but he feared that a backlog in the Italian courts might delay it for up to a year. **********The defense attorney said he believed that the Italian judiciary, having invested so much in the case, felt an obligation to bring the men to trial. **********'Didn't Know How to Dismiss It' ''I think they created this case and they didn't know how to dismiss it,'' he said. ''Otherwise, everyone would have said they had been investigating the case for two years and now they dismiss it.

''Agca is convincing in his reconstruction of the historical case of the attempt on the Pope's life.'' **********The prosecutor acknowledged ''changes, discords, contradictions'' in Mr. Agca's testimony but said they were ''never contingent to the juridically and penally relevant aspects'' of the case. **********25,000 Pages of Testimony **********Although Judge Martella was not obliged to follow Mr. Albano's recommendations, his report - based on 25,000 pages of evidence - is expected to follow the logic of the prosecutor's position. **********The four Turks who will be brought to trial are Oral Celik, who is at large; Bekir Celenk, a reputed leader of the Turkish mafia who is now in Bulgaria; and Omer Bagci and Musar Cedar Celebi, who are in Italian prisons. **********On May 13, 1981, the Pope was standing in the back of an open car moving slowly among more than 10,000 people who had gathered in St. Peter's Square for his weekly general audience. At 5:19 P.M. shots rang out and two bullets struck the Pope. He was wounded in the abdomen, right arm and left hand. Two passers-by were also wounded. **********Mr. Agca, who fired the shots, was set upon in the square by bystanders, who knocked the pistol out of his hand. He was then arrested. **********Another Man Seen Fleeing **********There were initial police reports declaring that Mr. Agca had acted alone, but witnesses said they saw a man fleeing from the scene. **********Later, it emerged that an American tourist and television executive, Lowell Newton, had taken a photo of a young man with his back to the camera running out of St. Peter's Square a few seconds after the shooting."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/16/business/bank-gives-up-colorado-fight.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bank Gives Up Colorado Fight", "print_headline": "Bank Gives Up Colorado Fight", "body_text": " **********United Banks of Colorado Inc. said it had agreed to end its hostile takeover bid for Affiliated Bankshares of Colorado Inc. and to support the proposed merger between Affiliated and the Intrawest Financial Corportion.

Page A6. **********KASSALA, the Sudan - Refugees by the tens of thousands are streaming into this desert nation from neighboring Ethiopia, fleeing drought, famine and war. **********They walk for as many as eight weeks from their villages and cross the frontier to reach the wretched patch of hills and sand that is the refugee center of Tekl el Bab, outside this town in eastern Sudan. The bleakness of the place that to them is a balm eloquently underscores the degree of misery they escaped. **********For most of the more than 25,000 people in this place, the only shelter is provided by the looming crags that shield them from the chill of the night and the small, scraggly bushes that give meager respite from the piercing sun. Their ever-growing numbers have seriously strained supplies of food, water, drugs and the energy of relief workers. **********According to relief workers, government officials and humanitarian organizations, they are also straining the limited resources of the entire country, where, as in huge swaths of the continent, millions are suffering from hunger because of drought. **********In addition to the problems posed by the current wave of refugees, this pro- Western nation is sapped by enormous development problems: an economic quagmire, an insurgency in its southern region, and the demands placed on it by a previous tide of refugees. There is growing concern that, with the continuing influx of refugees and their impact on the social and economic fabric, the nation may soon be overwhelmed. **********An Open-Door Policy **********The Sudan, the largest country in Africa and one of the world's most impoverished, has traditionally had an open- door policy toward refugees. It has taken in more than one million in recent years. **********The country's Office of the Commissioner for Refugees is responsible for administering many projects of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. And the Sudan's law on the right of asylum is considered a model in Africa. **********The majority of the refugees are Ethiopians, mainly from the northern provinces of Eritrea and Tigre, who began arriving in 1967 to escape guerrilla wars. But there are also Ugandans, Chadians and Zairians. Their arrival highlights the plight of a nation.  For even as the Sudan's borders serve as a magnet for thousands of refugees, an estimated 4.5 million of its own 22 million people have also been victimized by the drought. **********The majority of those now flocking into the country are children, whose pencil-thin bodies, clothed in little more than rags, transmit tales of suffering and tragedy. About two members of every family, most often the very old and the very young, die struggling to make their way here. Each day, measles, malaria, malnutrition, tuberculosis and other ailments claim the lives of about 20 of those who do make it. **********These refugees are among more than 110,000 from Eritrea and Tigre, where guerrilla warfare complicates the process of getting food to people. **********Since Nov. 1, they have been entering at the rate of 1,200 a day. Relief officials say that another 50,000 may now be on their way. At the same time, more than 100,000 victims of drought and armed conflict have crossed Sudan's western border from Chad. **********There have been rumors that the Government would close its border with Ethiopia, spurred by a measles epidemic among the refugees. But the Sudanese Commissioner for Refugees says he does not believe that this will be considered, especially if the nation receives enough international aid. Others, however, fear that there may be increased internal pressure from drought-affected Sudanese to limit or stop the flow of people coming in.   'A Big Problem' **********''I'm expecting tens of thousands to come in the coming few weeks,'' Abdel Beshir el Ahmadi, the Commissioner for Refugees, said. ''It is a big problem that is going to face us. There should be a balance in really helping Sudan. When you have between 1,000 and 1,500 a day crossing the border to come to us and this number will be multiplied in the coming weeks, we hope the international community will come and help so these people will not come and die in the Sudan.'' **********Thousands of the new refugees are traveling to drought-affected areas, making an already serious situation worse. Refugees who came in previous years and were relocated in permanent rural settlements, with the aim of avoiding pressure on already overburdened urban services and helping the refugees to become self-sufficient, are now experiencing total crop failures and may need additional support. **********New arrivals have been chopping down trees for fuel, contributing to the problem of desertification that aggravates Africa's food problems. In the Sudan, the Government says the desert is advancing three miles a year. The whole situation has led some to ask whether the generosity of the Sudan toward refugees is ultimately in the best interests of its people. **********''Some of the area the new refugees are living on here is usually cropland,'' said Mohmed Osman Ali, a Sudanese refugee counselor. He stood at the border of the Wad Sherifie refugee center, near Tekl el Bab and a short distance from a Sudanese village that has been virtually abandoned because of crop failure.   33,000 Refugees at Center **********More than 33,000 are said to have found their way from Ethiopia to Wad Sherifie on foot, by donkey or camel in recent weeks. **********It is estimated that the drought in the vast Sudan, almost one-third the size of the continental United States, would result in a deficiency in food production of from 800,000 to up to 1.2 million tons, excluding the needs of the arriving refugees. **********The worst-hit areas are, in essence, the nation's granary. Figures provided by Western donor nations suggested that the harvest of sorghum would be 700,000 tons short of the 1.8 million tons reaped last year. Production of millet was expected to drop from 300,000 to 250,000 tons. The wheat harvest, the victim of the worst shortage of river water in more than 70 years, is expected to be cut from about 160,000 tons to 15,000. **********The drought has caused people to flee the worst-hit areas, driving tens of thousands of them into the cities in search of food. More than 50,000, by some estimates, have camped on the periphery of Omdurman, a city on the Nile a short drive from the capital, Khartoum. **********According to William R. Smyser, the United Nations deputy high commissioner for refugees, who arrived in the Sudan from Geneva to assess the situation, problems in the camps, including water and food shortages and inadequate health care, were being immediately addressed. He said that measles vaccine brought in recently had diminished the epidemic. The primary medical problems arise not after the people arrive in refugee camps but are a result of the trip to get there, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/01/world/father-and-daughter-a-remembrance.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1588, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FATHER AND DAUGHTER: A REMEMBRANCE", "print_headline": "FATHER AND DAUGHTER: A REMEMBRANCE", "body_text": " **********The writer of this article is executive editor of The New York Times and was its correspondent in India from 1954 to 1958. He has revisited India often, most recently in January and February this year. **********In India's great years of hope, when Jawaharlal Nehru was Prime Minister and the people called him their beloved jewel, the young woman was almost always with him, usually not at his side, but a few steps behind. **********Indira, Mr. Nehru's only child, appeared with him at receptions and meetings in New Delhi, smiling, nodding, holding her hands together gently to her forehead in greeting, murmuring a word now and then. **********In villages far from New Delhi she walked behind him down dusty roads. She sat motionless on platforms while he talked to city crowds of hundreds of thousands, millions sometimes, usually scolding them for their faults, a father quite loving but quick to anger. **********Boosts Up the Ladder **********She was close to him and he favored her. He gave her boosts up the political ladder within his Congress Party. Then, in 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru died, and two years later, Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister. **********And now she is dead herself, one more victim of the religious hatreds of India against which her father used to harangue the crowds. Now she is dead and her son Rajiv is Prime Minister. Rajiv, whom she had selected as her heir when her first choice, her younger son, Sanjay, died in a wild, senseless airplane stunt over New Delhi, almost within sight of his mother's offices. **********Because of Indira Gandhi's open and obvious preparation to turn over rule to one of her sons, the theory of Indian dynasty has been growing and now will become written into history. Father to child to grandchild, just like the old Indian rajahs.   Closeness and Aloofness It is a neat theory, fitting comfortably into the stereotypes of India, but at best it is only half true - and it will take time to discover whether even that half holds. **********For the fact is that there is no evidence that Jawaharlal Nehru ever really thought in dynasty terms, of turning over office to Indira. **********There was a closeness between them, but also a certain aloofness. For years - the years he spent in fighting for Indian independence and the years in prison that were part of that struggle - he was remote, a father she knew mostly from his jail cell letters. Then her mother, the lonely, sad, often neglected Kamala, died and Indira went off to school abroad, far from home and father. **********All this was in the 1920's and 30's, and it was only when Nehru became Prime Minister after independence in 1948 that Indira and her father seemed to become close. She became his hostess, his comrade, his helper. But she was shy and withdrawn, and Indians with long memories cannot recall that they ever thought of her as his real confidante, that he turned to her for advice, or that he thought of her as his successor. **********Her duties as a sort of First Daughter of India kept her close to him and distant from her home, from her husband, Feroze, and from her little boys. The marriage withered. Indira became president of the ruling Congress Party in 1959. Nehru always insisted that he did not groom her for the job and was not terribly keen on it at all, but it seems a realistic assumption that her relationship to him did her no harm. Krishna Nehru Hutheesing, younger sister of Jawaharlal and no admirer of her niece at all, wrote that Jawaharlal had said that he did not want to encourage a dynasty and that it would be ''wholly undemocratic and undesirable.'' **********When he died there was no real talk of her succeeding him. Lal Bahandur Shastri, Nehru's successor, made her Minister of Information. It was not much of a job, and to this day Indian politicians say she got the job not because she was powerful, but because she was powerless - Nehru had left her little estate, and she needed the job and the house in New Delhi that goes with ministerial posts. She seemed bent and always full of sorrow, not a figure of power at all. **********Then suddenly in 1966 Mr. Shastri died. Almost condescendingly, India's national politicians turned to Mrs. Gandhi. She was to be a figurehead, a bridge between the past and the future, while the great big men of power figured out what the future was to be.  First the Office, Then Power **********It turned out that Indira had decided that the future was to be Indira. First she took office, then power. As the years passed and India and Indira seemed inseparable, it became quite plain that she intended not only to stay on in the office but live on in it through Sanjay. **********It was only then that the dynasty theory became a reality. Sanjay was crown prince and acted like one. He had his own toughs, his own political entourage, his own picture on billboards, his own political funds. Seeing Sanjay - if he would see you - became the way to get things done in India. **********Sanjay did not follow demurely behind his mother, as she did her father. When he spoke to his mother he did so with confidence, full voice and swagger. She simply adored him. **********Parlor psychiatrists in New Delhi liked to say that she was full of guilt feelings toward her sons because in the years that she was her father's shadow she was distant from them. Nobody knows, nobody can say, but it was plain she thought the Indian sun rose and set in her Sanjay.  Quiet Until His Death There were Indian politicians who loathed him and saw him as a danger to India. But they did not say much about it at all until he was safely dead, and even then softly, softly so Indira would not hear. **********Even as her grief for Sanjay was deep and searing, Mrs. Gandhi turned at once to Rajiv, who was an airline pilot. He was two years older than Sanjay, but unlike his brother had never shown the slightest interest in politics. **********But immediately, all India knew that Rajiv was the man to see, the man to wheedle and flatter, the man who could get things done. Soft-voiced and much less openly arrogant than his brother, Rajiv became the heir apparent, and yesterday, the heir. **********So the dynasty theory seems half borne out - Mrs. Gandhi planned it though her father did not. But whether Rajiv was selected because Indian politicians want him permanently, or think he will be a convenient time-server will take time to tell. And it will take time to discover whether Rajiv will be docile or, his mother's son, take power as well as office.  Harshness and Gentleness In some ways, Jawaharlal and Indira were quite similar - both aristocrats born, both very much aware of it, both capable of harshness, rudeness and of considerable gentleness. **********Nehru laughed a lot, and told jokes and had a roving eye. It was only in her last years, and then briefly, before the tragedy of the Golden Temple of Amritsar, that Indira Gandhi seemed to allow her neck muscles to relax in public. **********Both were strong leaders, without much confidence in their subordinates. Perhaps Mrs. Gandhi was even the stronger, for where Nehru grew to power and nobody ever questioned him, Mrs. Gandhi, in effect, took it from men who had made the terrible mistake of underestimating and patronizing her. **********The great irony of the story of the father and daughter who in turn ruled one of the largest nations in earth is that they would probably have turned out to be political opponents had Jawaharlal lived while Indira reigned. For what the father lived by, the daughter tried to destroy.  Fought for Democracy For all his irritability - he used to slap his bald pate in sheer annoyance a dozen times a day - Jawaharlal Nehru to the day he died fought for and believed in an India growing under democracy, and only under democracy. **********The people would plead with him to rule them forever and he would brush them aside as he used to brush away the sticky garlands of marigolds that Indians love to drape around the shoulders of guests. He would shout at Indians, berate them, denounce their own religions, but he preached and lived a democratic philosophy and consistently refused to become dictator, something he probably could have accomplished by telephone. **********But in 1975 Mrs. Gandhi, as Prime Minister, suddenly created a political coup d'etat, and swept away the democratic guarantees of her father and his independence generation, established authoritarian rule, and arrested thousands. That iron rule ended, and India returned to democracy, when Mrs. Gandhi, misjudging her hold on the people, put her Government to the vote, and was swept out of office. She returned later, and nobody knows whether she would have tried rule by fist again. **********But there was a bitter joke in New Delhi during the days of her dictatorship - ''Indira is in the Prime Minister's house and Jawaharlal is back to writing letters to her from jail again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/27/business/advertising-mitsubishi-drive-by-chiat-day.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 656, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MITSUBISHI DRIVE BY CHIAT/DAY", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; MITSUBISHI DRIVE BY CHIAT/DAY", "body_text": " **********THE Mitsubishi Electric corporate print advertising campaign **********that begins today will be another offering from Chiat/Day, the creator of last year's most honored ad, worldwide. **********And like the TV commercial ''1984'' for Apple Computer's Macintosh model, the Mitsubishi work has the impact to break through the clutter around it. Although similar in format, with much illustration and little copy, the print campaign has startling graphics, with each so different that they almost seem to come from different campaigns, even though all have the Mitsubishi Electric logotype. **********The first ad, keyed to the spirit of the season, is dominated by a huge picture of a baseball infielder in intense action. The copy talks about the company's Diamond Vision, those large picture boards that can follow the play in stadiums and arenas. **********The other three ads in the campaign feature the company's projection TV, its digital compact disk player, and its semiconductors. The seen message is one of superior, quality products. The unseen one is that the products are worth the premium price being charged. **********According to Robert H. Wolf, the agency's general manager in New York, and Joseph P. Palladino, management supervisor, the campaign is out to reach and impress upscale consumers who might buy the products and top management at the corporations that are potential customers or suppliers. The two also hold the titles of executive vice president and senior vice president, respectively. **********Jay Chiat, chairman, chief executive and late arrival at the meet-the- press session, suggested that the campaign might also be a way for the giant parent, Mitsubishi Electric, a public company in Japan, to prepare the American financial community for a listing on a stock exchange here. But when Mr. Palladino checked with the client later in the day, they said that was not really what they had in mind at this time. **********The campaign is not print alone. Of about $4 million put behind it, some $2.5 million will be spent on news and information shows on network television aimed at both target audiences. **********While the print campaign was created in the agency's New York office, the Los Angeles shop, the original Chiat/Day installation, created the single, eye-catching 30-second spot, which was directed by Brent Thomas. Mr. Thomas, who now works on a freelance basis, was the art director for the widely acclaimed ''1984'' commercial. **********The Mitsubishi TV ad is a triumph of computer animation, as it follows the electric pulse of a picture from deep in the depths of a TV picture tube until it explodes into sight as a picture, first on one, then another and then the third of the company's electronic picture-producing products. **********The spot ran for the first time during ''Night Line'' a late-night show on the ABC-TV Network, which will get all of the Mitsubishi spending, because, according to Henry Antosz, vice president, media director in the Los Angeles office, it was the most efficient buy for the news and information programs that would deliver the desired audience. The spot will be on during ''20/20'' tonight. **********Checking its files, the Television Advertising Bureau could not find any record of another Japanese company doing corporate TV advertising in this country. But a number of those companies are quite active in print, especially in business publications. **********NEC Electronic, Hitachi, Sumitomo, Matsushita, Mitsui and Toshiba are all corporate advertisers, according to Don Garson, director of corporate communications at Forbes, while James Hoefer, associate publisher of Fortune, said he gets more action from Japan than he does from all of Europe. **********Fortune is on the Mitsubishi schedule, along with Business Week, but The Wall Street Journal is getting the big bite, half of the entire print budget. **********The copywriter-art director team for the television spot was Bill Hamilton and Rick Bayko.

It agreed to make purchases from Japan, with payment due in yen several months later. The difficulty was that the value of the yen could - and did - swing sharply in those intervening months, altering Apple's dollar costs. **********Usually, to hedge such risks, companies agree to buy the yen, marks, pounds or other currency needed several months later at a fixed price in the forward market, paying in dollars. Apple, however, chose a new hedge, the currency option. **********Options are the right to buy or sell a set amount of a currency at a specified date. They eliminate the risk of a loss due to exchange movements, but unlike a forward contract, still give the holder a chance to come out ahead if the currency fluctuations are in its favor. **********As a result, Apple calculates, it saved $3 million. The company's head of foreign exchange operations, Robert Saltmarsh, now speaks of options like a religious convert. **********''Options have significantly reduced our foreign exchange risk,'' he said. ''They are perfect for giving you peace of mind over movements in the market.'' **********Mr. Saltmarsh's enthusiasm sets him apart, but not his interest in this complex financial instrument. There is much questioning in corporate treasuries about how to use them, but it is generally agreed that, for hedging certain kinds of transactions involving foreign currencies, they are better than forward or futures contracts, and that their use will become commonplace. **********''These things aren't a panacea for all companies, but when used properly, they're the ultimate hedging tool,'' said Scott N. Dillman, manager of options at the Marine Midland Bank, a major operator in the market. **********Although the Eastman Kodak Company does not use currency options yet, Eric Nelson, director of foreign exchange planning, said ''They are a terrific foreign exchange management tool and will occupy a significant portion of hedging activity somewhere down the road.'' **********Seemingly Whimsical Turns **********Foreign exchange fluctuations can play havoc with corporate planning. Hard-won operating gains can be wiped out by the seemingly whimsical turns of the currency market, or profits can be created. But the changes often cannot be forecast accurately. **********For the past year especially, the market has been a minefield, with the dollar defying predictions it is about to drop and constantly rising. ''We think all of our advisers are good, but all of them have been wrong on their forecasts,'' said Lawrence J. Lanza, assistant director of international treasury operations at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. **********Many experts regard currency options as one potential solution to currency rate volatility, although there has been initial corporate resistance to their use. First, the term ''options'' can scare away more conservative corporate managers, who associate options with speculators. **********''I can tell people at companies that options are the safest way to hedge,'' said S. Waite Rawls, managing director of the capital markets group at the Chemical Bank. ''But about three- fourths of them will look at me like I'm crazy because of the reputation.'' **********Premium at Beginning **********Also, currency options require that a premium be paid when the contract is entered into, whereas forward contracts generally involve a cash transaction only at maturity. **********''If you treat that premium as an insurance policy, it becomes far more acceptable,'' said John Prout, director of options trading at the Continental Grain Company. ''The purchase of an option can be far less risky and more flexible than a future or a forward.'' **********Forward contracts, which are the obligation to buy or sell a currency, are traded on a very well-developed and efficient interbank market, not an exchange floor. They have also been formalized as currency futures, which are traded in the pits of several international exchanges. Most corporate users say that the net result of the two is almost identical for hedging purposes. **********A currency option reduces risk to the premium paid, while still allowing the user to enjoy the benefit of favorable rate movements. The premium can run from about 1.5 percent to 5 percent of the contract's value, depending on the term of the option. As enticing as currency options sound, there is still a lot of educating to be done before they become more accepted. **********'Difficult to Explain' Paul Newhart, head of foreign exchange operations at E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, said that the company was studying options and was likely to become a user. But he needs to do more convincing first. ''They are difficult to explain, especially in detail,'' he said. **********A company as large as Du Pont could enlarge the market significantly since it handles several hundred million and up to $1 billion in foreign exchange exposure at any one time, Mr. Newhart said. ''We feel we don't have a choice but to consider options seriously,'' he added. **********Most experts agree that currency options are not likely to replace forward contracts completely. Their primary application is where the full extent of foreign currency payments or receipts is not certain or for longer- term contracts. **********''They are best for us when bidding for a contract denominated in a foreign currency,'' Mr. Lanza said. ''If we think we have a chance of winning the contract, we may still want to go ahead and hedge our exposure. With the option you buy protection but are n't locked into buying or selling the currency. When the exposure is defined, we would go to a forward.'' **********The currency options market still shows signs of its relative youth, which is another factor keeping some potential users on the sidelines. **********At Banks and Exchanges **********Companies can buy or sell options at the two exchanges where they are traded, or go directly to a bank. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange has been trading options in the Canadian dollar, pound, Swiss franc, West German mark and yen since 1982. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange trades just a mark option at present but expects to offer others this fall.  The Philadelphia exchange is enjoying the greatest activity. In July, it had record volume of 137,271 contracts and open interest of more than $2 billion, the exchange announced. **********But most of the writing of currency options is being done by banks, which will customize the option, with maturity dates and sums beyond the standard exchange contract. Many companies would also rather deal with a bank because they do not like the exchanges' margin requirements. **********Banks, in turn, have developed a nascent over-the-counter market where they trade options among themselves. They are also the largest players on the exchanges, where they hedge the risk they take when they sell an option to a customer. **********Relative Inexperience Seen **********Some corporate treasurers, however, say that the banks' relative inexperience shows in a number of ways. **********Mr. Saltmarsh of Apple said that when he shopped for options he found prices varied widely from bank to bank. ''They really don't know how to price them yet,'' he said. Mr. Saltmarsh takes the lowest price at the banks, but will not deal with the exchanges because he cannot get a customized contract there. **********Also, many banks are said to be doing a poor job of hedging their risk. ''The only perfect hedge for an option is another option,'' Mr. Prout of Continental Grain said. Nonetheless, many banks try to protect themselves with spot or forward contracts, which experts say amounts to trying to hit a constantly moving target with a fixed instrument. **********Citibank leaves its currency options positions almost completely unhedged, according to Bruce Krasting, head of options trading. At the opposite extreme is Marine Midland. Mr. Dillman said that the bank was at least 50 percent hedged at all times. ''If we sell an option, we try to buy an option,'' generally on the Philadelphia exchange, he said. **********Banks Expanding Role **********Aware of this weakness, banks are taking a more active role on the Philadelphia exchange to build expertise. Citibank, Marine Midland and the Bank of America are expected to take part soon in joint ventures with experienced traders as market specialists, said Arnold Staloff, director of new products on the exchange. **********The developments are being greeted with optimism, even if many continue to call currency options an emerging product. But the benefits are regarded as so attractive that there is little doubt options will become a normal risk management tool within several years and perhaps sooner if the dollar remains volatile. **********''At a cost,'' Mr. Prout of Continental Grain said, ''the company has a chance to have its cake and eat it, too.''     forex A hypothetical example of an American manufacturer making a purchase paid for in Japanese yen  If the Yen Rises After the three months the yen rises to 220 yen per dollar.  Since the dollar buys fewer yen the American company must pay almost $10.9 million to purchase 2.4 billion yen.  The American company exercises the option and purchases the necessary 2.4 billion yen at 240 yen per dollar.  Savings: about $700,000 (the $900,000 in added cost because of the higher yen exchange rate, less the $200,000 cost of the option).   If the Yen Is Stable After three months the yen stays at 240 yen per dollar. Since the rate is unchanged, the American company's purchase price stays at $10 million.  The manufacturer allows the option to expire unexercised.  The cost of the transaction is increased by the $200,000 cost of the foreign currency option.   If the Yen Falls After three months the yen falls to 260 per dollar.  Since the dollar buys more yen, the American company can now buy 2.4 billion yen for about $9.2 million.  The Americans buy the yen at the more advantageous rate in the spot market.  Savings: about $600,000 (the $800,000 savings in the purchase price less the $200,000 cost of the option)."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/20/business/interest-rates-turn-down.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1984-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 747, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTEREST RATES TURN DOWN", "print_headline": "INTEREST RATES TURN DOWN", "body_text": " **********Interest rates declined yesterday as new data confirmed a slowdown in economic growth at the same time as the Federal Reserve showed its willingness to help sustain the recent drop in overnight interest rates. **********By late in the day, rates on Treasury bills and other short-term securities were lower by as much as a tenth of a percentage point, with the six- month issue bid at 10.31 percent, down from 10.41 percent. Lower short-term rates, plus a modest amount of investor buying, helped raise note and bond prices by amounts ranging from 1/8 to 3/4 point. **********Among active issues, the 12 1/2 percent bond rose to its highest price since it was auctioned in August, and was offered at 103 19/32, to yield 12.05 percent. The 12 3/4 percent notes due in 1989 were offered at 101 26/32, up about 6/32, to yield 12.23 percent. **********Two-Year Treasury Notes **********At the regular monthly auction of new two-year Treasury notes, the 11 7/8 percent issue sold at an average yield of 11.94 percent, well below the 12.27 percent level that prevailed a week ago, and down from 12.43 percent at last month's sale. The two- year issue was offered at 11.97 percent. **********The move to higher prices and lower interset rates was helped along shortly before noon when the Federal Reserve temporarily bought Treasury securities, thereby adding reserves to the banking system. Since the rate for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market was 11 1/4 percent at the time of the Fed's purchases, traders concluded that the central bank was satisfied with an overnight Federal funds loan rate of less than 11 1/2 percent. **********''Those who doubted that the Fed wants funds below 11 1/2 percent ought to be convinced now,'' one Government securities dealer said after the Fed's temporary purchases. Over the last week, the overnight funds rate, which is a benchmark for other short-term interest rates, has averaged about 11.45 percent, down from 11.52 percent in the previous week and 11.62 percent in the previous six weeks. **********Today the Commerce Department is expected to announce an early estimate for the gross national product for the third quarter that will be well below the 7.6 percent inflation-adjusted growth rate for the second quarter and the 10.1 percent rate during the first quarter. **********Weakness in economic data published over the last week has led many economists to revise downward their forecasts for economic growth during the current quarter to 4 percent or less, compared with 5 percent or more when the quarter began. A rate of 4 percent or less helps reduce interest rates because traders and investors associate slower economic expansion with weaker credit demands by businesses and consumers, less inflation and slower money supply growth. **********Raul Nicho, a vice president at Money Market Services of Belmont, Calif., noted that the economic analysis firm expected third-quarter growth of 4 1/2 percent as recently as Sept. 6. But that forecast has been revised downward as employment data and retail sales were weaker than expected. The latest reducton to 3 percent growth from 3 1/2 percent was made yesterday in response to a modest five-tenths of 1 percent gain in personal income. ''The data suggests that the increase could actually be less than 3 percent,'' Mr. Nicho said. **********New Housing Issues **********Among this week's new single- family housing issues, the Colorado Housing Finance Agency's $150 million of Aa/Ax rated bonds were tentatively priced by a Smith Barney group with yields on serial bonds ranging from 7.25 percent in 1986 to 9.50 percent in 1995. Longer-term bonds, all of which may be put, or redeemed by investors in 1995, included 9 3/4 percent bonds due in 2002 and 2012 offered with a yield of 10 percent. A zero coupon bond due in 2015 was offered with a 10 percent yield, and may be put by the investor in 1995 when the issue is convertible into a long term fixed rate bond. **********An $80 million issue of the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency was tentatively priced by a Salomon Brothers group with yields ranging from 7 percent in 1986 to 10.10 percent in 1999 and 10 3/8 percent in 2007. The financing, rated Aa/Ax, included zero coupon bonds due in 2016 offered at a price of 2.88, or $28.80 per $1,000 to yield 11.50 percent. **********Following are results of yesterday's auction of new two-year treasury notes: **********(000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price99.887Average Yield11.94%Low Price99.939High Yield11.97%High Price99.836Low Yield11.91%Accepted at low84%Total applied for$18,159,305Accepted$8,510,195N.Y. applied for$14,328,240N.Y. accepted$6,533,760Noncompetitive$1,192,000Interest set at11 7/8%The two-year notes mature Sept. 30, 1986."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/25/business/executive-changes-199373.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 344, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " ***********  H.

Businesses are moving their computers back from employees' homes to the office. And workmen have dismantled the emergency telephone banks where, braving the cold and the rain, people stood with hands cupped over their ears, shouting into the receivers. **********It took 22,800 repairmen working night and day to restore telephone and telecommunications services knocked out by a fire in a Tokyo underground utility tunnel on Nov. 16. Telephone company officials first predicted a monthlong wait for service in Setagaya, one of 23 wards in Tokyo. But as complaints flooded in from the area of more than 815,000 people, officials quickly stepped up the pace. **********Over the weekend, telephones began to ring in homes and offices throughout Tokyo's Setagaya ward, three weeks ahead of schedule. On the other end of the line was a formal apology, in extra- polite Japanese, from the telephone company. **********It was a week that did not do wonders for Japan's image as the ultimate in efficiency. The fire left hundreds of thousands of people without telephone service and many bank customers unable to withdraw money, particularly if they wanted to use electronic cash machines.   Rains Add to Discontent **********But if it was urban breakdown, it was urban breakdown Japanese style - no more inconvenience than absolutely necessary, and no effort spared by the legions of workmen deployed by the telephone company. **********In one of those nasty coincidences that seem to dog such disasters, the phones went out just as Japan ended a monthlong drought. Torrential rains from a passing typhoon soaked Tokyo - and the people using outdoor emergency telephones. At one such phone bank in Setagaya's Nozawa neighborhood, people huddled under umbrellas as they squatted to use telephones placed on low rocks. **********But by the end of the first day of rain, tarpaulins sprang up over every emergency phone bank. Each bank was equipped with lights, tables and a list of important phone numbers. **********The phone company provided facsimile services and posted signs on public telephones declaring them out of order. Even at Narita airport, lists appeared of telephone exchanges that were not working, an advisory to the unsuspecting traveler.   Calls Routed Through Sapporo **********But some problems persisted. The telephone company set up special lines to allow people to call the Setagaya ward office for emergencies or information. The plan backfired when people discovered that a 10-yen call - the equivalent of about 4 cents - lasted only a few seconds rather than the customary three minutes. **********The calls were able to go through because they were first routed to Sapporo, in the northern island of Hokkaido, and then were bounced back by satellite to Setagaya. But the customers were being charged the normal long- distance rate to Sapporo, rather than the local rate. That mistake, too, was quickly rectified. **********Marooned without telephones, businesses all over Setagaya were driven to new heights of ingenuity in an effort to stem their losses. Some businesses temporarily relocated, posting their new telephone numbers on vacant office windows. Others packed word processors in trucks bound for homes of employees with working telephones. **********A sushi shop near Komazawa University that relies on telephone calls from students for business decided to get their orders in person. Every morning employees walked over to the university to take lunch orders. **********But businesses were still estimating serious losses from the fire. Mitsubishi Bank's national banking network was paralyzed, with full service not restored until last Tuesday. Although the bank would not specify the damage, it is thought to run in the millions of dollars. **********Muto Kogyo, a drawing instruments company, lost communications between its head office in Setagaya's Ikejiri neighborhood, its plants and 15 branch offices. The company set up a provisional office and used air freight for messages, at a cost of more than $30,000. **********Small businesses suffered as well. Asanoya, the noodle shop, relies on telphone delivery orders for more than half of its business. For a week, it delivered no noodles, said Sayoko Natsui, whose father runs the shop. ''When they were estimating one month without phones,'' she said, ''my father said he felt as though his life had been turned upside down.''  Free Message Service **********The obliging telephone company set up a free message service, with clerical employees dispatched by bicycle and car and taxi to deliver important messages. By 10 P.M. Sunday, when the service was disbanded, employees had delivered 19,300 messages, according to a spokesman for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's public telephone company. These ranged from the tragic to the mundane: **********From a family to a relative: ''Grandma died. Funeral on the 20th.'' **********From a magazine to a writer: ''Is your story done yet?'' **********From a husband to a wife: ''I will return at 7 P.M. Have dinner ready.'' **********For some, the week without phones proved an unexpected windfall. The emergency phones may have been outdoors, but they were free, and customers could call anywhere in Japan. Every night at the Nozawa outdoor telephone bank, teen-agers monopolized the telephones, engaging in seemingly interminable conversations punctuated by giggles. One student who lives in Nagasaki, in the southern island of Kyushu, said he had called home an unprecedented three times in one week. **********Patience wore thin, however, as the lines grew longer. One elderly woman was seen happily chatting on the phone while a man in business clothes waited behind her. Finally he lost his temper and began to upbraid her as people nearby pretended not to hear. **********With the phones back in order, the question of how to compensate customers for lost service remained. The telephone company said it had decided to compensate all affected customers. But there was one catch. Since the company is a public corporation, levels of compensation are set by law. N.T.T. estimates that it will make payments of about $6.25 for household users and about $17.90 for business customers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/31/world/around-the-world-weinberger-in-greece-for-talks-on-us-bases.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Weinberger in Greece For Talks on U.S. Bases", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Weinberger in Greece For Talks on U.S. Bases", "body_text": " **********Defense Secretary Caspar W.

(3) **********As the situation in Lebanon has deteriorated in recent months, it has posed increased dangers to the United States armed forces participating in the multinational force in Lebanon and has prohibited them from performing the peacekeeping mission which was the original justification for their presence in Lebanon. **********(4) **********As the Department of Defense Commission on the Beirut International Airport Terrorist Act of 23 October 1983 (commonly known as the ''Long Commission'') concluded, United States policy with respect to Lebanon has emphasized military options and the expansion of the United States military role and there is an urgent need for a reassessment of alternative means to achieve United States objectives in Lebanon in light of the changed circumstances.   (5) **********The Investigations Subcommittee of the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives, in its report dated Dec. 19, 1983, concluded that, ''Sustained deployment of personnel in the situation of almost certain further casualties should only be undertaken if the policy objectives are visible, profoundly important and clearly obtainable. Failure of the Administration to adequately re-examine its policy and relate it to present conditions will only mean that such re-examination will have to be done by Congress.''  (6) The United States Marines in Lebanon have performed superbly despite the lack of a realistic United States policy and the confusion about their mission, and every effort must be made to insure that, pending their withdrawal from Lebanon, measures are taken to protect their security which are commensurate with the risks of further terrorist and other attacks.   (7) **********The situation in Lebanon, which is mired in internal domestic stalemate because of internal fighting and the refusal of the parties to the conflict to make the promises necessary to promote progress toward a peaceful resolution of the country's problems, requires a United States policy which gives higher priority to diplomatic and political solutions.   (8) **********The situation in Lebanon is drifting out of control and the Administration's policy regarding Lebanon is not working. The United States is reacting to events rather than implementing policies which are in the national interest of the United States.   (9) **********The Administration has failed to impress upon the Government of Lebanon the urgent need for it to develop a viable reconciliation plan, which might include such objectives as more equitable power-sharing, early parliamentary elections, a new census and the formation of a government of national reconciliation.   (10) The Administration has allowed the situation in Lebanon to dominate the United States agenda in the Middle East to the detriment of efforts for progress in the broader, and ultimately more important, Middle East peace process.   (11) **********The failure in the Administration's policy has led to widespread concern among the American people that continued participation by United States armed forced in the multinational force in Lebanon is not in the national interest. **********B **********Therefore, the Congress declares that United States policy toward Lebanon should include the following elements:  (1) **********The prompt and orderly withdrawal of the United States armed forces participating in the multinational force in Lebanon, in consultation with other members of the multinational force.   (2) **********A concerted diplomatic effort at the United Nations to replace the multinational force in Lebanon with another international peacekeeping force under United Nations auspices as called for in Section 5 (C) of the Multi-National Force in Lebanon Resolution, such effort to include discussions with the Secretary General of the United Nations, the President of the Security Council and all members of the Security Council. If this is not successful, the United States must intensify efforts to obtain agreement by other countries to assume peacekeeping responsibilities in the Beirut area.   (3) **********Advising the Government of Lebanon of the urgent need for that Government to develop a reconciliation plan which recognizes the legitimate aspirations of all confessional groups.   (4) **********Development of intensified diplomatic efforts with Syria, as soon as possible, to achieve acceptance by Syria, and the factions it supports in Lebanon, of a reconciliation plan for Lebanon.   (5) **********Promotion of continuing dialogue between the Governments of Israel and Lebanon concerning security arrangements and a reconciliation plan for Lebanon.   (6) **********Continuation of other efforts to achieve the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon and the re-establishment of a sovereign independent Lebanon, taking into account the legitimate security concerns of Syria and Israel.   (7) **********Renewal of efforts to pursue vigorously a broader Middle East peace to reduce tensions through the region as a step in facilitating peace and reconciliation in Lebanon.   (8) **********Intensification of United States efforts to retrain and re-equip the Lebanese armed forces, including efforts to increase military assistance and the delivery of defense articles and defense services to enable the Government of Lebanon to assume the responsibilities of the multinational force in Lebanon and enable local security forces to assume internal security functions among various communities in the country.   (9) **********Implementation of an economic assistance program for Lebanon with funds already appropriated and with the immediate assistance of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to start sound economic reconstruction and development projects and energize the Lebanese Government to provide better services and more presence in as much of the country as possible.   (10) **********Implementation of a series of plans, including military contingency plans, to protect against the increasing threat which terrorism poses to the United States and its friends and interests in the region. Such plans should include improvements of United States intelligence gathering, coordination and assessment capabilities in Lebanon in order to protect United States interests, citizens and armed forces in Lebanon to guard against terrorist attacks. **********C **********Not later than 30 days after the adoption of this resolution, the President shall submit a written report to Congress on the actions he has taken to implement these policies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/08/business/sony-us-plant.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sony U.S. Plant", "print_headline": "Sony U.S. Plant", "body_text": " **********The Sony Corporation of America, as expected, said it would build a laser videodisk facility in Terre Haute, Ind., provided it can get tax-exempt financing and Federal grant funds.

But one Foreign Ministry official said Moscow and Damascus were prepared to accept a United Nations force under certain conditions. **********The comments today by Mr. Sharaa and Mohammed Haider, director of the Baath Party's foreign affairs section, were the first official statements of Syria's position on two critical issues affecting Lebanon's future: the fate of Mr. Gemayel and finding a replacement for the multinational forces. The two men spoke in separate interviews. **********Gemayel Is a Domestic Matter **********Regarding the political prospects of President Gemayel, the two officials had slightly different positions. Both asserted that his fate must be determined by the Lebanese. But Mr. Haider said that if Mr. Gemayel canceled the May 17 pact with Israel and worked toward a government of national reconciliation, he would be able to stay on as President. Mr. Sharaa said that although canceling the agreement was ''the only way he could survive,'' Syria's Lebanese allies were bitterly opposed to him. **********''They don't want to express their disappointment in him publicly,'' Mr. Sharaa said. ''But they believe he's a liar. They can't trust him.'' **********Syrian officials invariably argue that the Lebanese must decide internal Lebanese issues. But the presence of up to 50,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon and Syria's support for Lebanese factions opposed to Mr. Gemayel gives Damascus significant weight in shaping political developments in that country. **********Mr. Haider made a number of other points: **********- Syria has neither ''demands nor ambitions'' in Lebanon. He said Syria's troops would be withdrawn from Lebanon ''within hours'' if Israeli, American and other foreign forces were pulled out and a national reconciliation government asked the Syrians to leave. **********- If the United States continues shelling opposition and Syrian-held positions in Lebanon, Syria will ''respond and repulse this aggression with all the force we can muster.'' **********- The emergence of a coalition of Arab powers - Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestine Liberation Organization - which are seeking a joint plan for negotiations with Israel was ''the most dangerous'' political development to date. Because it was aimed at ''liquidating the Palestinian question once and for all,'' Syrian resistance to such a coalition would be ''stronger than to any other previous development.'' **********- Damascus was deeply saddened by the death of the Soviet leader, Yuri V. Andropov, in part because it forced the postponement of joint high-level planning meetings here at a critical time in the region. **********- If the United States changes its policies in the Middle East, Syria will be willing to ''meet America more than halfway'' in finding ways to resolve the Lebanese and the broader Arab-Israeli conflict.   American Strategy Criticized **********Mr. Haider said President Reagan's two-pronged decision on Tuesday to move the marines to ships offshore and to shell Syrian and Lebanese rebel positions that fire on Beirut was not a change in American policy. The Administration's approach to the area, he said, was based on ''aggression and imposing an American view by force.'' **********''America is still looking at the Arab- Israeli conflict in pieces,'' he said. ''It believes in partial solutions to the problem.'' **********He said Syria, by contrast, supported a comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict based on resolutions approved by the United Nations and by various Arab summit meetings, especially the one held in Fez, Morocco, at the end of 1982.   Peace Agreements Opposed **********Syria has long opposed the peace agreements signed by Israel and Egypt in 1979 and the peace plan put forth by President Reagan in September 1982 as piecemeal solutions to the conflict. Mr. Haider did not mention either of them today, but other Syrian officials privately expressed anger that neither the Camp David peace process nor the Reagan plan explicitly contained provisions that would enable Syria to reclaim the Golan Heights, lost to Israel in the 1967 war. **********Western analysts here said Syria's fear of being excluded from American- sponsored Mideast efforts was also responsible for Mr. Haider's expressions of alarm today over the recent emergence of an Arab coalition seeking negotiations with Israel. Mr. Haider warned that Syria would fight this ''most dangerous'' trend with ''different methods.'' Asked to elaborate, he replied: ''Political steps and others.'' **********King Hussein of Jordan has accused elements in Syria of responsibility for the recent spate of attacks against his ambassadors abroad and bombings at home. Syria has denied responsibility.   Friendship With Soviet **********Mr. Haider said Syria and the Soviet Union, which has an estimated 7,000 military trainers and advisers in this country, would continue their ''coordination and search for common interests between friends.'' **********At the same time, he emphasized at several points in the interview Syria's desire to improve its relations with the United States, provided the Reagan Administration was prepared to ''modify'' its policies here. **********Specifically, he called upon the United States to drop its support for the May 17 accord. This, he maintained, would be the ''first step forward'' toward a resolution of the conflict in Lebanon, and an indication of the ''fundamental modification'' of American policies that Syria has been seeking."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/29/business/patents-dry-etching-of-metals-by-gas-and-laser-beam.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1984-12-29", "snippet": "Methods of dry etching metals by use of gas and a laser beam were patented this week for the International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, N.Y.

The S.E.C. charged in a civil suit that Paradyne, in vying for the contract, violated the securities laws by making misrepresentations about its ability to perform. **********The S.E.C. has also charged that Paradyne intentionally misled Social Security officials by repackaging the products of another company and demonstrating an information-coding device that was ''nothing more than an empty box with blinking lights.'' Paradyne has vigorously denied the charges. **********Mr. Brooks said that the Social Security agency ''relaxed its testing requirements'' in awarding the contract to Paradyne. ''As a result, the system acquired from Paradyne continuously failed to meet contractual performance requirements for at least two years after the first terminals were installed and serious questions remain over the operation of this equpment.'' **********The G.A.O. report, however, did say that there had been improvements in the equipment's performance in the last several months. **********In a statement issued before the hearing, Robert S. Wiggins, chief executive of Paradyne, said, ''The most important fact, the crucial, dispositive fact concering Paradyne's performance under this contract, is that the Paradyne equipment works, and works extremely well.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/13/business/late-rally-lifts-dow-26.17-points.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1984-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 800, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LATE RALLY LIFTS DOW 26.17 POINTS", "print_headline": "LATE RALLY LIFTS DOW 26.17 POINTS", "body_text": " **********Stock prices surged in late trading yesterday in the market's biggest rally in more than a month as institutional investors shrugged off early hesitations and rushed to buy. **********The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 1,157.14, up 26.17 points, marking its biggest daily gain since Feb. 24, when it rose 30.47 points.

''We want to show you our readiness and our good will,'' he said. **********''It serves well,'' the priest continued, holding up the pin. ''but only when it has been opened.'' **********The Pope accepted the gift with evident bemusement. But in his speeches during the day, he overrode criticisms of the church and its policies by seeming to reject or ignore them. **********Father Fischer made his gesture at the end of a speech in which he, as representative of the German-speaking priests of Switzerland, laid 10 grievances before the Pope. They largely concerned issues in which priests, like many other Roman Catholics, believe John Paul takes stands that are too conservative. **********In his reply to Father Fischer and the priests who had spoken for the French, Italian and Romansch linguistic communities of this country with four official languages, the Pope cast doubt on whether the priests were truly representative.  ''I do not know whether they correspond to the thinking and the concerns of the majority of the clergy in Switzerland,'' John Paul said. He added that rather than address most of the issues that had been raised, he would speak about atheistic materialism, which he called ''the crucial problem.'' **********On at least one issue that Father Fischer had raised, celibacy of priests, many of his colleagues showed by applauding the Pope emphatically that opinions among the Swiss clergy were indeed divided. **********The ovation came when John Paul reaffirmed that he opposed any weakening of priestly vows of chastity. ''In a sense, fidelity to a state of life that one has accepted is required for the very dignity of the person,'' the Pope said. **********But he joined in general laughter when Father Fischer, noting that even the Apostle Peter had been married, asked, ''Why did our Lord Jesus heal the mother-in-law of Peter?'' **********The Pope dealt summarily with a series of the young priest's grievances that asked in effect that the status of laymen in the Roman Catholic Church be raised. The Pope declared firmly that he rejected what he called ''attempts to 'clericalize the laity' or 'laicize the clergy.' '' **********To underscore his points, Father Fischer, as well as many of the other priests, wore a business suit instead of priestly clothes.

The sources could confirm only that one ship was hit. Iraq also warned that it planned to step up strikes against ships calling at Kharg Island, the only point in the Persian Gulf where Iran can still deliver oil to its customers. **********Early this morning the 260,000-ton Swiss-owned and Liberian-registered tanker Tiburon put out a distress call, saying its engine room was on fire and several crewmen were injured. Shipping sources in Bahrain and in Zurich said they believed the ship had been hit by an Exocet missile fired from an Iraqi warplane. A salvage tug was on its way from Bahrain to give assistance. **********Iran's Islamic leadership immediately vowed revenge for the attack. **********After a Cabinet meeting in Teheran, Iran's Prime Minister, Mir Hussein Moussavi, said, ''We will deliver a blow for every blow we receive.'' He also warned that Iran would strike back at other gulf nations that support Iraq, saying, ''Security in the gulf must apply to all or to none.''  Lull Ended Sunday **********The attack on the Tiburon was reported to have occurred about 100 miles south of Kharg Island, where several other ships have been hit by Iraqi planes this year. The attack came three days after Iraq first broke a two- week lull in attacks on gulf shipping. On Sunday an Iraqi plane damaged the Greek-owned tanker Alexander the Great with an Exocet missile while the vessel was loading oil at Kharg Island. Some oil-loading installations at the terminal were also reportedly damaged in the attack. **********An Iraqi military spokesman said today on the Baghdad radio that the latest attacks showed ''Iraq is tightening its blockade of Kharg Island and other Iranian ports on the gulf.'' **********He called the strike ''further proof of Iraq's resolve to carry out its previous warnings to all shipping companies to end their dealings with the Iranian regime.'' The spokesman said future attacks would be ''even more severe.'' **********The Iraqi Government of President Saddam Hussein, at war with Iran since September 1980, is trying to weaken the Iranians by cutting off their oil sales, which Teheran relies on to pay for arms and munitions.   Backing for Iraq **********The leaders of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other gulf nations are backing Iraq, contributing billions of dollars to its war effort, because they fear the destabilizing effect of an outright victory for Iran's revolutionary regime. **********Iran's leaders have responded to the attempt to blockade Kharg Island by launching several air strikes against tankers carrying Saudi and Kuwaiti oil. They have also made a vague threat to blockade the gulf by closing the Strait of Hormuz, through which 17 percent of the non-Communist world's oil supplies pass. **********Since April 18 Iraq is believed to have attacked 10 tankers moving through the gulf and Iran is believed to have attacked 5. **********In the last few days Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations have sent their air forces to fly protective patrols over tankers and other ships using their ports. These fighter planes are being helped by Awacs reconnaissance planes on loan from the United States.   No Response So Far **********So far this protective air shield has deterred Iran from trying to retaliate for the two Iraqi attacks this week. But diplomats in Bahrain say they remain apprehensive that Iran might soon seek revenge, further heightening the war. **********It is unclear whether the two latest Iraqi air attacks are deterring vessels from going to Kharg Island. Earlier this year Iran was reported to have seen its Kharg Island sales fall from the usual level, about 1.8 million barrels a day, to under a million barrels a day as a result of the fighting. **********Kuwait and Saudi Arabia suffered less, partly because they offered to replace lost oil free of charge and also because they used their own tankers to ferry supplies down the gulf to foreign vessels waiting in the safe waters of the Arabian Sea. **********In the two-week lull in the fighting, Iran's exports were reported back to normal levels.   Accord on Civilian Targets **********Earlier this month Iran and Iraq accepted a limited cease-fire in their land war, with each side agreeing not to hit civilian targets. But Western intelligence has reported that about half a million Iranian soldiers are now massed along the front line with Iraq, apparently in preparation for a new offensive. After the Iraqi attack last Sunday on the Alexander the Great, the Baghdad radio warned that Iraq would destroy the Kharg Island terminal if Iran launched a new ground assault. **********Further evidence of support for Iraq came today from Jordan, where the official press agency quoted King Hussein as telling King Fahd of Saudi Arabia that Jordan would ''stand by its brothers in defending their lands, waters and sovereignty.''

Congressional critics of the Stinger sale have argued that the Stingers could fall into the hands of terrorists for use against civilian planes. **********In another development, the White House said that Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Arabian Ambassador, met for 15 minutes with President Reagan and conveyed a message from King Fahd about the situation in the Persian Gulf. **********Afterward, Prince Bandar said the Saudis were hoping that ''common sense will prevail'' in the region and prevent the war from escalating."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/16/business/stores-reduce-problem-of-losses-in-inventories.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1984-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 777, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STORES REDUCE PROBLEM OF LOSSES IN INVENTORIES", "print_headline": "STORES REDUCE PROBLEM OF LOSSES IN INVENTORIES", "body_text": " **********The nation's retailers call it ''shrink,'' and it costs them a fortune every year. They don't know whom to blame most - crooks, clerks or ghosts. **********Shrink is retail inventory shortage, the billions of dollars worth of goods that seem to evaporate from stores each year through shoplifting, internal theft and bookkeeping errors. **********But shrink may be shrinking. **********For the third consecutive year, retailing experts say, inventory shortages have declined. The shortage rate in 1983 was the lowest in at least five years, despite the retail industry's higher sales. **********Even so, the experts estimate, last year the nation's department, general merchandise and apparel stores lost goods with a wholesale value of about $1.8 billion or a retail value of about $3.6 billion. **********Retailers' Hopes Brighten **********Though still staggering, These numbers may represent a narrowing trend, raising retailers' hopes of trimming shortages further and thus improving profitability. **********''The lower trend in shrinkage will improve the retailers' bottom line and take some pressure off their need to increase their margins,'' said Jay Scher, vice president of the financial executives' division of the National Retail Merchants Association, a trade group. ''Therefore, the consumer should benefit by not having to pay higher prices.'' **********Touche Ross & Company, the accounting firm, says the 1983 shortages of $3.6 billion were 1.82 percent of retail sales, totaling $197 billion. The 1982 shortages of $3.66 billion were 1.99 percent of $184 billion sales. The 1981 shortages of $3.73 billion were 2.09 percent of $178.5 billion sales. **********Trend Continuing This Year **********Irwin Cohen, head of Touche Ross's national retail industry group, said, ''The lower trend in inventory shrinkage is continuing in 1984 so far.'' **********Merchandise that vanishes is merchandise that cannot be sold. Reducing the shrink, therefore, slows the potential-sales drain. According to retailing experts, this means higher profits for many retailers. For some, where the problem is so severe that shrinkage has equaled profits, the slowing could actually create profitability where there had been none. **********A retailer typically sets aside a reserve fund to compensate for shortages. A declining shortage rate would mean that less money must be diverted to such funds. **********Surprisingly, the decline in inventory shortages comes despite increases in both inside theft and shoplifting, according to specialists. **********Inventory Control Improved **********Many merchants credit the decline to new computerized merchandise information systems that allow tighter inventory control with fewer bookkeeping errors, such as ringing up the wrong amount, incorrect recording of goods received and failure to keep track of goods returned to suppliers. **********''Shrinkage is more a function of back-office discipline than of shoplifting,'' said Herbert Wittkin, a New York retailing consultant and a former group vice president at the Allied Stores Corporation. **********''During the recent recession,'' he said, ''there were more reasons for bookkeeping mistakes, such as many more markdowns, producing twice the amount of paper than in better times. Last year there was less merchandise shrinkage because of exceptionally good business compared with 1982's recession.'' **********Problem of Theft Persists **********But theft is still serious. Pilferage, by customers and employees alike, grew about 10 percent last year, according to another accounting firm, Arthur Young & Company. **********Experts disagree about how much of the stores' shrink is due to theft. **********According to Touche Ross, internal theft accounts for about 33 percent of shortages, external theft 32 percent, record-keeping errors 31 percent and other reasons 4 percent. **********But other experts come up with sharply different figures. Mr. Wittkin, for instance, estimates that shoplifting and internal theft account for only about 15 percent each of shortages while bookkeeping errors are responsible for about 70 percent. **********Stores Found to Vary Widely **********''I've been in some stores where 100 percent of the employees were found to be stealing,'' said Peter D. Berlin, head of shrinkage control for the Price Waterhouse retail industry services group. ''I've been in other stores where I didn't believe any employee was dishonest.'' **********Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the 670-store discounter based in Bentonville, Ark., expects to cut its shortages to only 1.2 percent this year from 1.5 percent in 1983 and 2.2 percent in 1979. **********David Glass, Wal-Mart's president, attributes much of the decline to an incentive program for employees; they obtain up to $200 each for recommendations that work. Some of their adopted ideas include posting a ''greeter'' at each store's entrance as a sort of quasi-watchman. **********''A lot depends on making the employees aware of the problem,'' Mr. Glass said in an interview.''We tell them that a big part of shrinkage is in sloppy paperwork, such as markdowns that aren't recorded or price changes that do not go into the computer. And we find that people have lots of ideas when they are involved in solving the problem."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/11/world/around-the-world-guatemala-s-opposition-criticizes-high-official.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Guatemala's Opposition Criticizes High Official", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Guatemala's Opposition Criticizes High Official", "body_text": " **********Guatemalan opposition leaders are calling for the resignation of Interior Minister Gustavo Adolfo Lopez Sandoval, saying he has been unable to halt a recent surge in political violence. **********A communique issued on Thursday by the Guatemalan Christian Democratic Party said ''it is evident that the Interior Minister has shown irresponsibility and negligence in the face of the growing wave of violence that has hit the country.'' **********The communique called for the official to resign, a move it said would help secure guarantees for the coming Constituent Assembly elections.

The suit seeks to block any takeover, or further purchases of St. Regis stock, by Mr. Murdoch. **********In anticipation that Mr. Murdoch would buy more stock, St. Regis shares jumped $2.125 yesterday, to $39.875, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

He said the banker told him he had learned that ''a consortium of banks was putting together a $750 million credit facility to be raised for the possible takeover of St. Regis.'' **********Mr. Schumann said the banker phoned him two days later to say he had attended a meeting of several banks in London that same day and that Midland was ''a coordinator of the meeting'' and that ''a bank from Boston was also involved.'' **********The main reason for the meeting, Mr. Schumann said, was to hear a presentation from Mr. Murdoch. **********''Up to $55 Per Share' **********As related by Mr. Schumann, Mr. Murdoch told the bankers that he had ''not yet made a final decision'' about his plans for St. Regis but ''would like to be in a position to proceed promptly'' to buy enough stock to give him 50.1 percent of St. Regis ''at a price of up to $55 per share.'' **********Mr. Schumann said Mr. Murdoch had told the group he needed about $950 million for such an acquisition, and that $750 million of the total would be in bank credits. **********The deadline for them to commit themselves to take part in the bank loan, Mr. Murdoch was quoted as having said, would be tonight. He was quoted as stressing the need to move quickly because of ''his belief that St. Regis was building its defenses.'' **********The affidavit said ''Mr. Murdoch mentioned that he had retained Allen & Company,'' the Wall Street house, ''as his investment advisers.'' **********Mr. Schumann said the publisher had told bankers that once he acquired 50.1 percent, he might seek the rest. **********He said Mr. Murdoch had told the bankers that St. Regis was worth between $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion and that its timberlands were worth $1.7 billion. **********He said Mr. Murdoch forecast that St. Regis would resist, and that it might find a friendly company to buy it, possibly at more than he would pay. In that event, Mr. Schumann related, Mr. Murdoch said he would not get into a bidding contest but would take a profit on his investment. **********Mr. Murdoch was further quoted as saying that he would be willing to dispose of interests he holds in an Australian airline and the Reuters news service, if necessary, to raise additional funds. **********'True Intentions' **********St. Regis, contending in its suit that Mr. Murdoch did not disclose his ''true intentions'' to stockholders, said it would ask Mr. Murdoch to testify in Dallas on July 16. It said it would subpoena Stanley S. Shuman of Allen & Company, a personal adviser to Mr. Murdoch, to produce documents dealing with the transaction. St. Regis sued Mr. Murdoch in Texas because the company owns the Angelina Casualty Company, a Delaware company operating largely in Texas. **********The Florida Insurance Commission earlier obtained a Federal court order in Tallahassee preventing Mr. Murdoch from buying more stock. He is contesting the order. **********Before deciding to fight Mr. Murdoch, St. Regis gave Sir James Goldsmith, the British industrialist, some $50 million in profits by buying back his 8.6 percent St. Regis stake. The company then made a deal to sell the Georgia-Pacific Corporation a plant it wanted in exchange for Georgia-Pacific buying another block of St. Regis held by the Loews Corporation, giving Loews a $38 million profit.

However, it is the route that Janice Brown, now a New York freelance textile stylist but once an employee for a large manufacturer, chose when she was hauled on the carpet by an executive who, she quickly discerned, represented a large faction that was out for her boss's hide. **********''I was told they didn't support him, they felt his direction was not correct,'' she said. ''My choices were to defend my boss, whom I personally liked, or to turn on him with 'inside' evidence of his unsuitability. I could only lose. I would alienate one or the other side.'' **********Miss Brown felt like a conspiracy suspect who had been asked to turn state's evidence. When she got home that night, she wrote a two-page letter to the executive who had put her into this uncomfortable position. In that letter, she distinguished clearly between her boss's authority and her own, delineated those areas in which she felt unable to comment on his abilities, and, as she decribes it, made it quite clear without saying it in so many words that she had absolutely no intention of either fingering her boss or protecting him. **********Miss Brown removed herself from the line of fire by choosing a middle ground between the two factions. Indeed, as she remembers it, ''Once it was in writing that I did not intend to either protect my boss or attack him, I never heard another word on it.'' **********The ploy saved her from unpleasantness in the short run, but it probably scuttled her chances for getting ahead in the job. A few months later, her boss was fired and she was passed over for his job.

Middle-management loners are nearly always doomed to stagnation or failure. **********Picking the right faction with which to align oneself can be a truly crucial career decision. Many executives who have found themselves in this position say that the best way to select the group is to focus on risks rather than opportunities. In other words, rather than pick the group that might give you what you want - a promotion, say - pick instead the group that could help you avoid what you dread - a demotion or a transfer. **********Most veterans of corporate political wars say that choosing the faction that looks as though it will win is a short-sighted maneuver. It is unlikely that anyone who goes where the wind blows will be accepted as a true insider in the group he or she has suddenly chosen. By the same token, a reputation for turning against friends the minute the going gets tough is unlikely to help the cause of a budding executive who wants to get ahead in the corporation. **********It makes more sense, they say, to support peers and higher-ups whose policies seem best.

The four ships pulled up alongside a large cargo terminal in darkness early this morning, and then allowed dozens of South Korean laborers on board to unload 25,000 tons of cement intended to aid flood victims in nearby Seoul. **********It was a landmark contact between countries that have been implacable enemies, maintaining a steady war of propaganda and mutual denunciation since their three-year shooting war ended in 1953. **********Yet for all the novelty, Inchon residents seemed to pay no attention to the North Koreans, whose ships carried Red Cross banners and not the national flag. The unloading dock lay well behind closed gates, protected by a few guards. Outside, no one gathered on the sidewalks or streets to peer across the terminal for a possible glimpse of the visitors.   Port Was 1950 Invasion Site **********From the decks of their ships, 190 North Korean seamen, officials and journalists got only the most meager view of Inchon, where United States forces landed in September 1950 and helped repel northern invaders who had overrun the South. **********On the dock, where they discussed details of the transfer of the supplies, South Korean Red Cross officials invited their counterparts from the North to rest at a downtown hotel. But the North Koreans turned down the proposal and went back to their main ship, the Zang San. **********South Korean customs officers stood at the heads of gangways to keep unwanted visitors from boarding and, presumably, to prevent unauthorized people from leaving. There was little conversation between the northern sailors and southern workers, who all day long hoisted sacks of cement by crane onto dockside trucks. **********Four other ships, carrying 35,000 tons of cement, arrived this afternoon at the port of Pukpyong on South Korea's eastern coast. Yet another four are due in Inchon on Monday. Meanwhile, more than 650 North Korean trucks resumed shipments of rice, medicine and cloth that began Saturday through Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone at the border.   Gifts Sent by the South **********They returned home with truckloads of gifts from the South, 800 suitcases that South Korean officials said each contained $500 worth of transistor radios, wristwatches, cosmetics, clothing and household items. **********The northern aid had been volunteered for victims of severe floods that killed 190 people and left 200,000 homeless in Seoul early this month. It was a surprising offer and - just as surprisingly - South Korea accepted, saying it was doing so to reduce tensions on the divided peninsula, not because it needed help. **********The exchanges over the weekend produced hopeful speculation that they might lead to more substantive discsssions, but South Korean officials and foreign diplomats warned against expectations of sudden political breakthroughs. Although the aid offer was one of several conciliatory gestures by North Korea this year, the South called it a propaganda device intended to soften the North's hard-line image.   Fifth Ship Reported Aground **********They went along, officials in Seoul said, because they wanted to show their interest in improved relations. **********The four ships that arrived today had departed from the North Korean ports of Nampo and Haeju. A fifth ship had set out, too, but it reportedly hit a reef and ran aground soon after starting its southward journey. **********Whatever ultimate significance the events of today may have, they served immediate publicity purposes for each side.

Regan predicted it would pleasantly surprise business because of what he portrayed as its generosity. **********Under the present depreciation system, enacted in 1981, assets are placed in one of five categories and written off in from three to 15 years, but under the new system - if Congress adopts it - there would be seven categories and the depreciation period would range from five to 63 years. **********However, the new system would allow for the first time the indexing of assets according to inflation. The Treasury contended this allowancewould provide a more generous depreciation for many properties than did the 1981 system. **********By 1990, according to the Treasury, the new depreciation schedule would yield an additional $80 billion a year in revenues at the lower corporate tax rate the Treasury has proposed. It would also, the Treasury contends, remove biases in the tax code toward heavy, capital-intensive industries, the main benefactors from the 1981 business tax cuts. **********The depreciation proposal was part of the second volume of the Treasury's tax simplification plan, the first volume of which was published last week. The second volume, out today, also provided details on the proposed repeal of various tax breaks for banks, timber, coal, insurance, farming and oil companies. **********The Treasury tax plan has elicited a lot of interest in the White House and in Congress, but budget cuts and the deficit are regarded as a more important priority. Consequently, Congress may not write a tax bill until the 1985 session is some months old. **********Secretary Regan, speaking at the National Press Club, asked businessmen to compare the new depreciation plan with the old system, called the accelerated cost recovery system, or A.C.R.S., and to take account of the Treasury's companion proposals to cut the corporate tax rate to 33 percent from 46 and allow a partial deduction for dividends. **********'Equal to or Better' **********''Volume Two will show that our plan is equal to or better than A.C.R.S. that was enacted in 1981, period,'' the Treasury Secretary said, adding that ''I think people are going to be pleasantly surprised.'' **********But John K. Meagher, a lobbyist for the LTV Corporation who leads a multicompany lobbying group, took a dim view. He also challenged a basic tenet of the Treasury plan, that tax rates should be more nearly equal. **********''The basic problem with the Treasury proposal is that it doesn't account for the fact that U.S. companies have to compete with foreign companies who have greater incentives and thus less costs,'' said Mr. Meagher, who is chairman of the Basic Industries Coalition, a group of heavy industry companies and trade associations. **********As to the Treasury's goal of narrowing variations in tax rates among American companies by eliminating preferences such as A.C.R.S., he said: ''There is little or no relevancy in saying a McDonald's franchise should pay the same tax rate as a steel company.'' **********New System Applauded **********Some businessmen said they needed more time to study today's report, while some tax experts who support the Treasury proposal applauded the new depreciation system. **********Joseph J. Minarik, a research associate with the Urban Institute and a former tax analyst with the Congressional Budget Office, said the new depreciation system was one of the ''salient'' points in the whole proposal and that the current system ''is quite generous given the current state of low inflation.'' **********Mr. Minarik added, though, that the new depreciation schedules could be ''more complicated and troublesome for small-business men'' and that the Treasury proposal, on the whole, might not raise so much business revenue as intended if inflation exceeded the Treasury's assumption. **********According to the Treasury, the new depreciation rules, called the Real Cost Recovery System, would allow cost recovery of the ''real,'' or inflation-adjusted, cost of business assests, rather than only the original, or nominal, cost. For years, business complained that inflation made recovery of original cost inadequate to finance replacement of old equipment. That was one of the arguments for the acceleration enacted in 1981 at the behest of capital-intensive industries. **********The Treasury plan would also revise the assignment of property among recovery classes. **********Most of that reassignment would involve business equipment. For example, assets now assigned to a single category of business equipment and depreciated over five years would be assigned to one of four classes and written off over five to 25 years. **********Rates Vary Year to Year **********Under the 1981 system, depreciation rates vary from year to year of an asset's write-off period, with most of the recovery occurring in the early years. Under the new proposal, recovery would be spread uniformly over the allowed write-off period. **********In summarizing its rationale for its new cost recovery system, the Treasury maintained that the lowering of the overall corporate tax rate, the introduction of indexing and the allowance of a 50 percent credit for dividends would remove differences in effective tax rates among all forms of investment, regardless of inflation. **********For ''many types of property'' the proposal ''is more generous than the alternative approaches, including current law,'' the Treasury said. **********Other Details in Report **********Today's report includes details on these other business tax proposals: **********- Instituting year-to-year uniformity in the accounting rules for long- term contracts so that expenses and income are more evenly matched. Currently, according to the Treasury, there is a ''mismatching of receipts and expenses'' in a number or industries, such as timber, farming, coal, oil and vineyards. The new rules would be phased in over periods ranging up to 10 years. **********- Repealing the special treatment of royalty income from coal, iron ore and timber, which can now be treated as a long-term capital gain. The Treasury would end this ''preferential treatment'' following a three- year transition period for assets held prior to Jan. 1, 1986. **********- Repealing the ability of banks to deduct interest costs incurred in buying or carrying tax-exempt bonds. Starting in 1983, banks and other financial institutions were denied 20 percent of these dedcutions. The Treasury would allow the 20 percent disallowance to apply to obligations acquired between 1983 and 1985 and repeal all deductions for obligations acquired thereafter. **********The Treasury would repeal by 1986 a series of preferences for energy and natural resources, including energy tax credits, percentage depletion, expensing of intangible drilling costs and hard mineral exploration and development costs, and deductions for mining and solid waste reclamation. Most of these preferences, according to the report, are used to an unfair extent by upper-income taxpayers or are not economically necessary."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/21/business/advertising-american-petrofina-goes-to-levenson-hill.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "American Petrofina Goes to Levenson & Hill", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; American Petrofina Goes to Levenson & Hill", "body_text": " **********When American Petrofina management decided that it wanted an ad agency in Dallas, its hometown, that was bad for Geer DuBois of New York, its agency for 20 years. **********But it has turned out to be good for Levenson, Levenson & Hill of Dallas, whose winning of the account was announced yesterday by the client. **********The last ad budget of the oil company was $2.75 million. **********American Petrofina, with annual sales of more than $2.5 billion, has two operating groups, the American Petrofina Company, which, among other things, markets the Fina brand of gasoline, and the Cosden Oil and Chemical Company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/09/business/argentina-unsure-how-much-debt-is.html": {"writer_name": "Marlise Simons", "pub_date": "1984-04-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1030, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARGENTINA UNSURE HOW MUCH DEBT IS", "print_headline": "ARGENTINA UNSURE HOW MUCH DEBT IS", "body_text": " **********After four months in office and an international flurry over a near default in its interest payments abroad, Argentina's new Government is still unable to decide the exact size and breakdown of its foreign debt or how much it is willing to recognize. **********Although the country is listed as having the third-largest foreign debt in the developing world, after Brazil and Mexico, Argentina's previous military regime apparently kept no central records and left behind what Government officials and financial experts have described as an ''administrative nightmare.'' **********''We still don't know the debt - there were no registers in the central bank,'' said Bernardo Grinspun, Argentina's Economics Minister, before leaving Friday night for the United States for crucial debt talks with the International Monetary Fund. **********''With most loans,'' Mr. Grinspun said, ''we could not identify the purpose, the amount, the interest or the grace period.'' **********In Argentina's central bank and justice ministry, more than a hundred of ficials are still searching through stacks of papers piled six feet high on marble floors.

A full accounting, he added, is not expected until May. **********Since the elected Government of President Raul Alfonsin took over in December, it has asked for a six- month suspenion of Argentina's foreign debt payments, and it has bargained hard and played for time to gain better repayment terms. **********Bankers' View of the Morass **********Foreign bankers here have recognized that the Government needed breathing space not only because of a lack of funds but also to sort out its books. **********''We ourselves and the new Government underestimated the mess here,'' said the vice president of a large United States bank who asked not to be named. The banks were drawn ever deeper into the Argentine morass, he said, partly because ''we were always reading information more than 12 months old and inaccurate.'' **********Officials said the maze included the debts of Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, the state-owned oil company and the nation's largest debtor, as well as the conglomerate of military industries that employ 40,000 people and have been managed by the military for the last 40 years. **********''We believe the military ran up some debts which may not exist or never entered the country,'' said one financial expert involved in the debt puzzle.

These dollar loans were obtained by Argentine individuals and companies abroad entirely for the purpose of speculation and were already guaranteed by the collateral of dollar deposits maintained by the borrowers in the creditor banks. **********Exploiting Currency Conversion **********''The devaluation was not keeping up with inflation or interest rates,'' said one American banker, ''so people borrowed money and invested it here, and when it was converted back into dollars you might have 50 percent profit. Through the Government foreign-exchange insurance, people could get dollars at a subsidized rate and pay off their loans.'' **********Several foreign bankers said they knew about the arrangement, and they said many Argentines had made fortunes through this and various other schemes. **********The back-to-back loans ''were perhaps unethical but not illegal,'' said a Canadian banker. ''It was a great way for the banks to lend money and make an easy buck because, with the collateral, there was no risk involved.'' In Argentina the scheme was known as ''la bicicleta'' - the bicycle. ''The idea was that you kept pumping your dollars round and round,'' the Canadian financier said. **********Mr. Grinspun said the nation's central bank would not sell dollars to pay off any debts guaranteed by collateral abroad. **********Paying Debts That 'Really Exist' **********''We will only pay legitimate foreign debt,'' he said, ''no debts that do not really exist.'' **********Of Argentina's total foreign debt, close to one-third, or $14.5 billion, is believed to be in private hands. **********While Government investigators said they were trying to trace the speculative schemes, foreign bankers said they believed it would be very difficult without full disclosure of the accounts held abroad.

But this year's high interest rates, drop in exports and weak grain prices have aggravated many farmers' cash-flow problems and have kept equipment orders extremely low. **********Dealers, company officials and Wall Street analysts say one or two companies may go bankrupt or abandon production of farm equipment in favor of their other operations. **********The industry - which employs 100,000 people, only half as many as in 1979 - remains one of the few in the nation that is losing money almost two years after the economic recovery began. ''Everyone is trying to keep their head above water,'' said Paul Whelan, an analyst with Pershing & Company. **********Last week Deere & Company, the world's largest maker of farm equipment, reported a loss in its basic business. The previous week the International Harvester Company, which has restructured its debt to help stave off bankruptcy, announced another loss. **********The other leading manufacturers - the Allis-Chalmers Corporation, Massey-Ferguson Ltd. and Tenneco's J.

In the first seven months of the year, tractor sales were up 1.9 percent from a year before.

Their balance sheets have deteriorated as a result of declining land prices, and their cash flows have been squeezed by deteriorating commodity prices. **********''All this means that the farmer just plain doesn't have any money to buy new equipment,'' said Larry D. Hollis, an analyst with Robert D. Baird & Company in Milwaukee. **********Comment by Deere Official **********L. Neel Hall, Deere's senior vice president for farm equipment, expressed hope. ''Perhaps with the advent of the better harvest this year, even though prices may not be quite all they'd like to have, our customers will be fairly satisfied,'' he said. ''This, we hope, will be reflected in some recovery of sales in the late fall.'' **********John E. McGinty, an analyst with the First Boston Corporation, predicted that, among the top five manufacturers, Deere would best weather the industry's storm. ''They have 40 to 45 percent of the market,'' he said. Deere is the lowest-cost producer and has the most sophisticated manufacturing techniques, he added. **********For the short term, however, said Mr. Hollis, the Milwaukee-based analyst, Deere will have more problems than the others.

''There's no question Harvester is making a lot of progress,'' he said, attributing most of its gains to sales of heavy trucks. **********Two weeks ago Harvester announced a loss of $7 million for its fiscal third quarter, ended July 31.

Case is doing a fine job now, Mr. McGinty said, but he is not so sure that Allis-Chalmers will stay in the farm equipment business. **********Several analysts said Massey-Ferguson would keep a strong role in the industry, especially as farm equipment supplier to the third world. **********In its latest quarter Allis-Chalmers had a loss of $12.5 million, and Massey-Ferguson, based in Toronto, earned $2.4 million, its first quarterly profit in four years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/18/business/careers-intensive-mba-programs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 825, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Intensive M.B.A. Programs", "print_headline": "CAREERS; Intensive M.B.A. Programs", "body_text": " **********INTENSIVE programs for master **********of business administration degrees are becoming increasingly popular. Generally, students are selected and financed by major corporations with the idea that the graduates will climb higher on the management ladder. **********One unusual accelerated program has been started recently by the General Electric Company with Purdue University's Krannert graduate school of management. **********Explaining how candidates are picked, Roger W. Hessenius, manager of G.E.'s professional development programs in its corporate information systems operation, said: ''We get managers involved. We have asked for high-performance individuals.'' **********A few are middle managers, while others are what Mr. Hessenius calls ''individual contributors,'' such as systems designers and project leaders who work independently under the supervision of a manager. **********Knowledge of computers is one ability the students share, according to Mr. Hessenius. ''Those selected all have been working with computers, some in heavy manufacturing, some in engineering, some in the management information systems area,'' he said. ''We are trying to draw from all functions.'' **********The reason for the program is that G.E. wants its technical people to develop a business perspective along with the ability to communicate more effectively with general management. **********''We have found that the changing technology has forced our people to become more business-oriented,'' Mr. Hessenius said. ''The program gives them a broader perspective of business and allows them to compete with other business managers on a functional basis. The students will become more integrated into the business function.'' **********Like other accelerated programs for managers at business schools at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University, the Purdue- G.E. program requires outside study plus class attendance for short, intensive periods. **********For example, the first G.E. class consists of 24 students who began a year ago. They started with a 10-week period in the spring of 1983, when they received books, reading lists and assignments. While working at their jobs, they were expected to do homework at nights or weekends and transmit it by computer to Purdue professors. **********The program required two weeks of intensive study on campus at West Lafayette, Ind., early in the summer and another two weeks a month later. On campus, the students attended classes six hours a day for six days a week and had four hours or so of homework at night. **********''In many courses the case method is used and students often work in teams,'' Mr. Hessenius said. **********When back on the job in the fall, the students again underwent a period of additional reading for six weeks and homework assignments sent to Purdue by computer. Then they were free until this spring, when the routine was repeated. **********The class that began in the spring of 1983 will complete the program next summer, after the third round of summer work, or a total of 12 weeks of intensive on-campus work, plus the periods of homework. Then they will receive master of science degrees in industrial administration, which is Purdue's equivalent of the master of business administration degree elsewhere. A second class of 23 students began this spring. **********The background of the students and the intensive use of computers for homework makes the G.E. program a little different from most other M.B.A. management programs. **********Most of the G.E. students have undergraduate degrees in business, engineering, computer science or liberal arts, with computer science as a minor, but a few have not completed requirements for a bachelor's degree. They, too, will receive a master's degree once they complete the program. **********The students range in age from 27 to 45 years, with an average age of 37 in the first class. In the second class, one person is 50 years old, according to Mr. Hessenius. **********''The basic management information systems course is too elementary for this group,'' he said. So Purdue designed a special advanced program of lectures focusing on such subjects as artificial intelligence, office automation and telecommunications, as well as on such social issues as job displacement because of computers. **********What does G.E. hope to get out of the program? ''I hope that they are getting a little mind-stretching,'' Mr. Hessenius said. ''Technology is so pervasive that we need technical people with a business perspective.'' **********He hopes, too, that G.E. can ultimately get more general managers out of this area - managers who combine technical knowledge of information systems with management ability. He said that was ''something we have not been so successful in doing in the past.'' **********Dr. Dan E. Schendel, who heads the program at Purdue, said that such an executive program was also available for other companies, small as well as large. He said the other program had 21 students enrolled from companies such as TRW, Dow Chemical, Hewlett-Packard, Ford, Eli Lilly and Honeywell. The Coast Guard is also represented. **********Stressing the importance of the electronic linkage, he said, ''We try to monitor the work the students are doing by using the computer.'' Students are selected on the basis of college marks, Graduate Management Aptitude Test scores of 550-600 or better, and job experience."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/03/business/executive-changes-123680.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 510, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " **********Allied Stores Corp.  has elected to its board John Phillip Diesel, president and chief operating officer of Tenneco Inc. ***********  AMC Entertainment Inc., Kansas City, Mo., has named Robert L.

During a visit to Canada last year, Mr. Gorbachev took part in two hours of give-and- take with Canadian legislators. **********Today he visited the Karl Marx Memorial Library, where Lenin worked, and the British Museum reading room used by Marx.

But to a 42-year-old farmer named Sukardji, Indonesia's ''transmigration'' program has a more concrete definition: his own home, on his own piece of land; a kerosene lamp, a radio and a new life. **********A year ago, Mr. Sukardji was a landless farm laborer in Java, living with more than a dozen people in a house he did not own. In February, he and his wife, Suhartini, and their three children were one of 600 pioneering families to open a settlement called Koya Timur, on virgin farmland carved from a relentless jungle here in West Irian, Indonesia's part of the wild, remote island of New Guinea. **********The Indonesian Government has set a goal of moving about 750,000 families over next five years from the country's overpopulated islands - Java, Madura and Bali - to sparsely populated and undeveloped corners like this one in the vast Indonesian archipelago. More than 500,000 families, or about 2.5 million people, were ''transmigrated'' during the last five-year plan, ending on March 31, 1984, the Government says.   Land, Food and Fertilizer **********In a program now and then reminiscent of the homesteading of the American West, each family gets a plot of land, a house and a year's supply of basic foods and fertilizer in return for its commitment to open new territory. **********Human rights groups, environmental organizations and community development workers have criticized the project for a variety of reasons. **********There are concerns that people thrown into new and often hostile environments do not get adequate support services; some of them have reportedly gone hungry when land proved infertile. **********There are criticisms that fragile and often primitive local societies - particularly here in West Irian, with its native Melanesian population barely a generation out of a stone-age culture - will be overrun by the country's predominant ethnic Malays, especially the Javanese. **********Tribal landowners are not always compensated. Eko Sarwoko, who directs the transmigration program in West Irian, said in an interview that the tribal chief who relinquished the thousands of acres of hunting land around Koya Timur ''didn't ask for money.'' All he wanted, Mr. Eko Sarwoko said, were a house, a school, a clinic and a building for his clan's cultural activities.   Separatist Group **********Diplomats in Jakarta say that the Free Papua Movement, a separatist group fueled by opposition to transmigration in West Irian, may pose a long- term problem for Indonesia because dissidents seek to draw support from and find refuge in neighboring Papua New Guinea, an independent nation of ethnically similar people. **********There are also charges, which transmigration officials have denied, that some migrants are moved involuntarily, or that resettlement is used to rid the cities of undesirables. **********Java, Madura and Bali, where more than 90 percent of Indonesia's 160 million people live, already have at least 23 million more people than the land can support, officials say. While there are about 690 people per square kilometer in Java, the larger neighboring island of Sumatra has only 59 per square kilometer; the Moluccas have 19; Kalimantan, part of Borneo, has 12, and West Irian has 3. **********Vast areas of land are available for development, but spontaneous, unassisted migration, now also being encouraged, has been negligible in Indonesia's nearly 40 years of independence. Many Indonesians blame the Dutch colonizers for creating a labor- intensive plantation system in Java, leading to the island's overpopulation, and for total neglect of other parts of the country. Many of Indonesia's islands are without docks, roads or any forms of communication.   Preparing for Second Crop **********In Koya Timur, at the end of a muddy, 25-mile drive from this small provincial capital of Jayapura, Mr. Sukardji was preparing his rice paddies for this year's second crop when visitors arrived at his new home. He and his neighbors are lucky to be within a few hours of an established town. Many settlers in West Irian are in the trackless wilderness, reached only by air. **********Mr. Sukardji's home is the standard three-room, dirt-floor wooden house allocated to each migrant family. He had filled his with furniture he made himself from wood cleared from the fields.

In fact, he even predicted that this would begin last Monday, Dec. 10. **********As it turned out, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed nine points that day and six on Tuesday. But Mr. Generalis, like some other technical analysts these days, is mostly negative about the longer-term prospects for the stock market. He thinks that the market's climb to slightly more than 1,200 should last only four to seven days and will be over by Christmas. By April or May of next year, he said, the Dow should trade in the 1,020 to 980 range. **********Like other technicians, Mr. Generalis follows the dynamics of the stock market, charting price patterns, advance/decline ratios of stocks and investor sentiment, among other statistics. Some more traditional investors consider analysis by technicians to be comparable to astrological charts, but the numbers of technical analysts on Wall Street are significant enough to merit attention. **********Just as with their more traditional counterparts who analyze the fundamental aspects of stocks such as profits and sales trends, there is wide confusion about the direction of the market among those who study technical data. The numbers, like fundamental information on a stock, can be interpreted to mean different things by different people. **********But many of Wall Street's technicians, including Mr. Generalis and Alan R. Shaw, senior vice president of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company are still pessimistic about the market's prospects over the coming six months. For example, Mr. Generalis said that according to his indicators, ''leg two'' of the 1982 bull market is ''not on the horizon.'' **********He sees the market going up in early 1985 but not hitting a ''marginal new high,'' which would be above 1,287 on the Dow, the high reached in 1983. After that mild rally, the market should drop in reaction to a continued weakening of the economy, he predicts. ''You do not need an economic collapse for the Dow to trade at 1,020,'' he said. ''You merely need a perception starting to evolve that you are in a recession or that this is the last chance to lock in double-digit interest rates in bonds.'' **********At Delta Financial Management in Hingham, Mass., president Frank J. Weldon Jr. describes himself as neutral. ''What we're looking for are extremes,'' he said. In analyzing institutional investors' cash levels and pricing activity of the 15 most active stocks on a daily basis, he said that he and his partner ''haven't seen the fear'' on the part of investors that typically signals a time to buy. **********Delta's analysis indicates that the stock market will continue to be ''locked in this trading range for a while longer.'' And while Mr. Weldon concedes there may be a year-end rally, he does not think it would be sustainable. **********He admits that he does not care about such things as a company's earnings record, its dividend or economic prospects for its industry, when the firm invests its $30 million in client assets. Rather, he looks at price patterns of the stocks and their patterns relative to the 700 other stocks they monitor. **********AS a result of this analysis, Mr. Weldon sees attractive pricing patterns in some drug, cosmetics and photography stocks. In addition, he still likes the interest-sensitive groups such as utilities, some banks and insurance companies. Groups he avoids include energy and technology. **********In the bullish technical camp is Richard Eakle, vice president at Morgan Stanley & Company. Describing himself as very bullish, Mr. Eakle claims the current market is in an ''intermediate pullback,'' but he thinks that this phase will be followed in the next three or four months by an ''explosive move on the up side.'' He is looking for the Dow to reach the 1,380 to 1,420 range in the next four months. ''For all intents and purposes, the market has seen its lows,'' he said. **********Mr. Eakle is encouraged that there was ''no follow-through'' selling when the Dow traded around 1,160 on Monday. ''Some people started to sober up,'' he said. While he admits that he thought I.B.M. would drop only to 118 a share (it closed at 116 1/2), he was relieved that the low ''didn't really produce any volume or selling intensity.'' He believes that I.B.M., as well as other blue chips such as General Electric, General Motors, Eastman Kodak and Westinghouse, have all seen their lows. **********Stock groups that have been strong and that Mr. Eakle believes will remain so are airlines, autos, banks, mobile homes, savings and loan companies, retailers, brewers and computer companies. ''A lot of these groups should come back with a lot of strength when the market reasserts itself,'' he said. Stocks that he thinks should be avoided include those of the energy companies and commodity- based companies, such as the metals and mining companies. Further, he said he was turning negative on food stocks and grocery chains, which have been strong performers this year. **********A Boon for Small Stocks **********DESPITE the poor performance of the small- capitalization stocks since June 1983, pension funds have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into funds managed by Dimensional Fund Advisors, a firm that specializes in buying an index of these smaller stocks. The Chicago-based firm has been so successful in attracting business, in fact, that it has had to limit its new client funds to $100 million a month this year. Its portfolio was down almost 8 percent through November, compared with the 3.5 percent increase of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. **********Last month, D.F.A. received approval on a new trust fund and has already attracted almost $100 million from two clients, including I.B.M.'s pension fund. This new fund will invest in an index of stocks that are larger than the small stocks it now buys but smaller than most of the stocks in the traditional index funds patterned after the S.&P. index. The fund will invest in stocks of companies that have market capitalizations of between $100 million and $300 million. **********ALONG with the Union Carbide Corporation, the **********chemical industry in general is suffering, and **********not just from the tragedy at Bhopal, India. Some analysts aren't very sanguine about the prospects for the group's stocks. James M. Arenson, vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, in fact, is recommending only four chemical stocks: Monsanto, Imperial Chemical, Morton Thiokol and Sealed Air. And in most cases, he favors these four because of their specialty niches, such as agriculture and health care. **********Mr. Arenson's lack of enthusiasm stems from price cutting in the industry, which has penalized profit margins, as has the strong dollar. Mr. Arenson thinks that chemical stocks were better investments early in the recovery. ''I think it's late in the cycle for the chemicals,'' he concluded. **********But Emily S. Plishner, senior analyst at New York's Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc., has become more bullish on the group in the past month. She expects price cutting to stop early next year with a resulting improvement in profit margins. And like Mr. Arenson, she is recommending Monsanto because of its relatively low price. **********Anise C.

It holds the remains of 8,700 soldiers. **********President Mitterrand invited Chancellor Kohl to Verdun last May.

But they were expected to meet again in Bonn next month. **********The battle of Verdun lasted 300 days and was one of the bloodiest of World War I. **********Of the two million thrown into the battle, about half a million men died and hundreds of thousands more were wounded. According to French figures, 360,000 French and 335,000 German soldiers were killed. **********The French troops were commanded by Henri Philippe Petain, later disgraced after he led the Vichy French Government that collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II.

''We knew who was planning the attack and generally where in West Beirut they were located,'' said Robert B. Oakley, the director of the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism and Emergency Planning. **********Little was written about it at the time, but American officials point to the swift response to the threat as an example of what has to be done if the United States is to counter the continuing threat of international terrorism. **********Armed with advance intelligence, American and Lebanese forces mobilized. Half the American staff was evacuated, the Ambassador was secretly flown out of the country, the perimeter defense at the residence was reinforced and pushed outward, antiaircraft weapons were put on the grounds and the air lanes above the residence were closed to all traffic. **********It is impossible to know for sure whether these measures blocked the terrorists from making good on their announced plans to hit another American target before election day, but the fact is that Nov. 6 passed quietly. The only scare occurred about a week later when a private Saudi Arabian plane strayed over the residence and nervous guards opened fire. **********The sense of relief in the State Department the day after the election was palpable. ''It's not that the danger is over - it isn't,'' Mr. Oakley said. ''But in this case, at least, effective preventive action succeeded in blocking an attack.'' **********Ever since a truck laden with explosives devastated the United States Embassy near East Beirut on Sept. 20, counterterrorism has been a top item on the official agenda in Washington. In fact, the Sept. 20 bombing had at least one result that the terrorists never intended: It seems to have galvanized the Reagan Administration, the bureaucracy and Congress into concerted action against the continuing threat of international terrorism. **********In the 10 weeks since the embassy bombing - the third terrorist attack on an American installation in Lebanon in 18 months - Administration officials say they have taken specific steps to improve intelligence, enhance the protection of American embassies and diplomats abroad and increase the readiness of secret counterterror teams that are trained to rescue hostages, storm hijacked airliners and break up terrorist cells overseas. **********Secretary of State George P. Shultz has made counterterrorism a top priority by conducting personal security inspections of embassies he visits on trips abroad and demanding daily status reports on conditions at high-risk embassies. In addition, Congress moved quickly after the attack to adopt antiterror legislation and authorize $356 million in the current budget to enhance security abroad. **********Interagency teams have visited 22 embassies in the Middle East, Latin America and elsehwere to try to identify the most vulnerable. Eleven embassies are being built around the world with blast-absorbing walls and new technological devices to increase security. The National Academy of Sciences is working with the State Department to design a prototype embassy of the future that is both functional and secure.   New Attitude Reported **********''We've accomplished more in the last two months than we have in a long time,'' said Mr. Oakley. ''The Sept. 20 bombing was a watershed. There is a completely different attitude now about the problem, a kind of interagency and intergovernmental cooperation that didn't exist before. The danger is still there, but we're more alert.'' **********At the same time, interviews with top Government officials indicate that there remains a basic policy split in the Administration on whether the United States should use military force to pre-empt or retaliate against terrorist attacks. **********Mr. Shultz has made the case for pre-emptive and retaliatory action in recent speeches, arguing that the United States must be prepared to use force lest it become ''the Hamlet of nations, worrying endlessly over whether and how to respond.'' **********Key Administration officials disagree with the Secretary, however. **********Vice President Bush and Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger have both spoken out against the Shultz approach. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are also said to oppose it. **********''You don't want to shoot a gun into a crowded theater in the hope that somebody's there who might have done something,'' Mr. Weinberger said recently, echoing an argument made earlier by Mr. Bush.   Reagan Has Reservations **********President Reagan has not come down conclusively on either side of the argument, but he has repeatedly expressed his reservations about using force. ''You don't want to just carelessly go out and maybe kill innocent people,'' Mr. Reagan said in an interview last week in response to a question about why the United States had not retaliated for terrorist actions. ''Then you're as bad as the terrorists.'' **********Although the policy dispute is unresolved, many officials and private experts on terrorism express the belief that the United States is closer today to taking pre-emptive or retaliatory action than it has ever been. **********''We're moving toward a consensus on using force to deal with terrorism,'' one senior official said. ''We're not there yet, but we are close. For one thing, our intelligence is better now, so pre-emption becomes a more achievable thing to do.'' **********Militarily, the United States has been poised for some time to make a retaliatory or pre-emptive strike. In the Middle East, for instance, the 90,000-ton, nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Eisenhower has been on station in the eastern Mediterranean for two months. Its aircraft could easily strike targets in Lebanon should the political decision be made in Washington. **********Brian Jenkins, a counterterrorism expert for the Rand Corporation, also believes the moment of retaliation is not far off. ''There's a red line somewhere in all of this,'' he said in a telephone interview, ''a line that, if crossed, will produce a response of the kind Shultz is talking about. Is it after 5 embassy bombings? Or 25? I don't know.   Concern About 2 A.M. Decisions **********''My concern is that we will cross that line before thinking through our options,'' Mr. Jenkins said. ''I'm afraid we'll end up with the kind of decisions that are made by Presidents in their pajamas at 2 A.M.'' **********A similar concern expressed by Robert H. Kupperman, a terrorism specialist at the Georgetown Center for Strategic and International Studies. **********''There are the gravest risks in following the Shultz scenario too literally,'' he said in an interview in his office here. **********''Just imagine what might have happened if we had retaliated after the bombing of the Marine barracks by sending a team into Baalbek,'' he said. Baalbek is the suspected headquarters in Lebanon of the Hezballah, or Party of God, a militant Shiite Moslem group that American intelligence has identified as being involved in all three of the bombings in Lebanon. **********''Suppose four or five of our team had been caught, tried and hanged,'' he continued. ''Then we'd have to raise the ante militarily, the Soviets would match it and the situation would escalate very quickly.'' **********Effective retaliation, Mr. Kupperman said, would require a careful conditioning of public and international opinion in advance, along with consultation with other nations. ''Shultz is laying the groundwork for that now,'' he said.   Talks With Allies Begin **********William E. Colby, the former Director of Central Intelligence, said he was surprised that the Administration had not retaliated already for the attacks in Lebanon. ''We have the tools to do it and we've identified the target,'' he said. ''I think public opinion would support it 100 percent.'' **********On the international scene, the record of concerted action against terrorism is spotty at best. **********At the economic meeting in London last June, the seven leading industrialized democracies pledged themselves to a new effort to fight terrorism. An ''experts group'' held a follow-up meeting in London in September, and American officials say intelligence-sharing and coordination has improved, especially with Britain and Italy. **********A prime example of international cooperation came last week when the Italian police rounded up seven Moslem terrorists who were reportedly plotting to blow up the American Embassy in Rome. **********The Italians acted in response to a tip from the Swiss authorities, who had arrested a man in Zurich as he tried to board a plane for Rome with four pounds of explosives. In the man's pocket they found a note with the names and address of his accomplices in Rome. When the Italian police moved in on the group in a hideout near Rome, they found more explosives and photographs and maps of the embassy grounds.   A Warning at Dinner **********The first word of the roundup reached Maxwell M. Rabb, the American Ambassador to Rome, as he was eating dinner in a restaurant the day after Thanksgiving. It came in the form of an urgent call from Marcello Monarca, the Rome police chief. **********''He wanted me to be very careful because he didn't know for sure how many terrorists were involved,'' the Ambassador recalled in a telephone interview. ''It was a prime example of two governments working together to do something about terrorism,'' **********But a coordinated response to terrorism, especially state-supported terrorism, still elludes the alliance. This was underscored recently when the United States and France were unable to agree on measures against the Libyan Government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, whom Washington accuses of fostering subversion and terrorism worldwide. **********The latest French-American consultations on the subject followed a week in which Egypt revealed a bungled Libyan plot to assassinate a former Libyan Prime Minister in Cairo and in which France was forced to admit that Libya had reneged on its pledge to remove its troops from Chad. Top American officials, meeting with Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson in Washington, argued that the Libyan actions reinforced the need for Western nations to ostracize the Qaddafi Government with sanctions and other means.   U.S. Officials Disappointed **********The French were not persuaded. Mr. Cheysson emerged from his meetings to tell reporters that France wanted normal relations with Libya, from which it obtains substantial supplies of crude oil. The logic of the American argument, the Foreign Minister said, could lead to military action against Libya that ''no one would recommend.'' **********The French reaction was a keen disappointment to American officials dealing with counterterrorism. ''The Libyans have been identified as terrorists for a long time,'' one official said.

These incentives were offered to encourage employees to move to Westchester when the company relocates, beginning in July.

They also illustrate how an employee benefit package can increase an individual's wealth. **********''We were interested in attracting and keeping better- than-average employees,'' said Leo F.

''Knowing that we have a better- than-average benefits program helps make that clear.'' **********Often, more than 40 percent of the net worth of senior executives comes from benefits, such as stock options, deferred pay programs and savings and investment plans offered by their employers. Financial planners say that middle-income individuals can also add to their net worth by understanding and using the benefit package. **********''The most under-utilized asset of the middle-income family is employee benefits,'' said George E. L. Barbee, executive director and co-founder of the Consumer Financial Institute, an independent financial planning company in Newton, Mass. ''The problem starts with the little booklet they give you when you first go to the company. It is not often written in layman's language.'' **********MONY runs seminars and constantly updates employees on the changes and additions to its benefit package, but employees of other companies often hardly know what their plans offer. ''If you don't understand something about your benefits, you should schedule an appointment with personnel to see what it is they have,'' suggested Mr. Barbee. **********Timothy J. Sullivan, 63, a field vice president in Chicago for the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, estimates that company benefits account for more than 40 percent of his wealth. ''You would have to have closed your eyes and ears to not know what was going on in this company,'' said Mr. Sullivan. He added that the company regularly sponsored employee forums, sent out newsletters and had slide shows to inform the staff of uses for benefits and changes in the plan. **********When he started with John Hancock 38 years ago, he said, ''They offered modest life insurance. Now everybody has two- times-salary, company-paid life insurance,'' and health insurance went from contributory to noncontributory. **********Just recently he accepted the company's offer to defer up to 12 percent of his salary toward his retirement years, a measure that will result in lower tax on earnings now, because the current salary is reduced. **********Mr. Sullivan also plans to take early retirement and leave John Hancock at the end of the year. For accepting this company offer, he will receive a year-and-a-half's salary beyond his actual retirement date, and will still be on the payroll for the length of the payment, enjoying all company benefits. Because of these and other different incentive savings plans, he believes he has had many opportunities ''to accumulate money in addition to pension and Social Security.'' **********Mr. Barbee said that this opportunity was available in most companies. ''The failure to recognize and integrate profit-sharing plans and pension plans that are available to people at fairly low levels in a company has caused many peo ple to miss one of the greatest hidden assets a company has to offer,'' said Mr. Barbee. ''The tax-advantaged nature of these benefits is extremely useful,'' he continued. **********''You can't isolate the benefit handbook. As in any kind of worthwhile financial planning you have to evaluate your company benefits as a part of your overall financial package,'' said Neil B. Kauffman, partner in Kauffman & Drebing, a firm of financial advisers in Philadelphia. **********Since many companies now offer employees a choice of benefits, planners advise that personal and family goals be taken into consideration when selecting options. **********''There are many things the company can offer employees that are responsive to needs of the individuals,'' said Robert H. Felder, director of corporate benefits at the American Can Company in Greenwich, Conn. ''That's what human resources is all about,'' One example is the yearly cash allowance of $1,000 to $1,500 for day care that American Can offers employees. ''It's an important support system to a dual income family,'' said Mr. Felder, who has a working wife and a four-year-old child in day care.  In 1979, American Can was the first company of its kind to offer what is known as the ''cafeteria plan,'' encompassing the major benefit areas - medical, life, disability, vacation, retirement and capital accumulation. **********Under the plan, the company offers each employee a choice or ''menu'' of benefits, instead of providing the same package of benefits for everyone working there. All employees receive the same amount of ''credits,'' and can allocate them among the various benefits as they see fit. Most companies require that their employees take certain minimum benefits before selecting their personal preferences. **********At American Can, people devise their own packages. Someone who wanted more retirement money and less life insurance would put more credits into retirement and less into life insurance. An employee with no children might take a less expensive medical program. Similarly, in a joint income family in which the spouse has a fixed plan that provides medical coverage for both, the partner with the ''cafeteria'' plan would be able to choose another benefit. A person with health problems could take extra disability; a young healthy worker might want more vacation days. **********The cornerstone of the benefit package is the pension plan, said Mr. Kauffman. There are two basic types: the de fined contribution plan, which usually includes a profit-sharing plan, a stock-purchase plan or, in the case of the 401(k) a deferred salary plan, and the defined benefit plan. **********The 401(k) is a defined contribution plan that is becoming increasingly popular, according to Mr Kauffman. It allows an employee to save part of his earnings and not pay taxes on it until it is withdrawn. Mr Kauffman explained that under plan 401(k), people who make, say, $40,000 a year can take part by contributing up to a certain limit annually. If, for example, they contribute $2,000, at the end of the year their W-2 lists earned income as $38,000, instead of $40,000, so taxes are reduced, and $2,000 goes into an interest-bearing fund. **********The 401(k) is like an I.R.A. except that it is only done through a company. Individuals cannot set it up on their own. ''It's the biggest thing since sliced bread,'' said Mr. Kauffman. ''Except for administration, there may be no direct cost associated with the plan, and from the employee's point of view, it's a nice convenient way to save and get a tax break at the same time.'' Some employers have matching programs, by which they make either partial or equal contributions to be added to those of the employee. **********One disadvantage of contributory plans is that there is no way of knowing for certain how much money will have been accumulated by retirement. The only way of arriving at any kind of figure is to calculate the amount invested, assume a rate of interest and work out an approximate answer.  Most companies offer defined benefit plans rather than the contributory plans, because this was the way they were traditionally set up in early negotiations between employers and unions, said Mr. Kauffman. These plans provide workers, upon retirement, with a fixed sum that is paid at regular intervals (usually once a month) for the rest of their lives. Employees receive a yearly statement that shows, how much they have accumulated so far. Projecting ahead from these figures, however, assumes continued employment with the company and calculation of expected salary increases, as well as accounting for projected inflation rates. **********If a company offers a pension plan, it is important to know how long it takes to become vested - to acquire undisputed right to one's portion of the plan. Mr. Kauffman advises people, all things being equal, to favor companies whose plans vest early. Many companies vest after three years, but faster vesting is becoming the trend, he added. **********Benefits Near One-Third of Total Wages **********According to a 1983 U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey, approximately $510 billion in employment benefits was paid to workers across the country in 1982.  This represented 32.5 percent of total wages and salaries, estimated at $1.6 trillion. Employees in private industry received $406 billion in benefits, while public sector employees received $104 billion. **********Legally required benefits, such as unemployment and workers' compensation, amounted to 9.5 percent of total wages and salaries, or $149 billion.  ''Agreed-upon'' benefits were 8.5 percent, or $133 billion. **********Among the most common agreed-upon benefits were pensions, which accounted for 3.6 percent of total wages and salaries, and insurance, such as health and life, at 4.4 percent. Benefits paid during time not worked - for example, during vacations and holidays or while employees took sick leave - amounted to 9.8 percent of total wages and salaries. For disabilities not covered by law, employers paid an estimated $9.4 billion. Bonuses and profit-sharing payments were $14 billion, or 0.9 percent of total wages and salaries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/09/business/key-rates-249151.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/27/business/baldwin-plan-gets-group-s-backing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Baldwin Plan Gets Group's Backing", "print_headline": "Baldwin Plan Gets Group's Backing", "body_text": " **********The executive committee of the American Council of Life Insurance, an industry group, endorsed a plan under which life insurance companies would contribute money ''on a voluntary basis'' to holders of annuities issued by the Baldwin-United Corporation. **********The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents insurance regulators from each state, has been pressing the life insurance industry to make a contribution, estimated at $50 million, toward paying off Baldwin's 163,000 policies. **********Life insurance agents sold about a fifth of the single-premium deferred annuities issued by Baldwin, which filed for reorganization last September.

And in fact there is substantial evidence that this is slowly happening. **********Their hope also is that the rate of energy conservation will slow in the industrial nations and that the substitution of coal, nuclear power and natural gas for oil will reach its limits - and these trends are already evident. Their ultimate hope, of course, is that prices will rise. **********Simply put, these hopes and dreams are OPEC's strategy. The 13 OPEC members hold most of the world's oil reserves; theirs is by far the cheapest to produce, and they are biding their time until the non- OPEC countries run out of crude, putting OPEC once again in the driver's seat. **********But while they wait, ample supplies are available elsewhere and that will be the case ''until the early 1990's,'' says James Schlesinger, former Secretary of Energy. Adds John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation: ''All the pressure on oil prices is down in this decade.'' **********That downward pressure was dramatically evident earlier this month when Norway, then Britain and finally Nigeria cut the prices of their high-grade crudes by as much as $2 a barrel, and oil company stocks plunged for a few days as fear spread that the drop would have no bottom. By far the biggest blow to OPEC was the action of Nigeria, one of its own. ''For all practical purposes, Nigeria has left OPEC,'' says Stephen A. Smith, a senior vice president of Data Resources Inc. **********The OPEC oil ministers are meeting tomorrow in an emergency session in Geneva to keep the initial price cuts from sparking a pell-mell downward price spiral. They are likely to be successful this time, even though the Mobil Corporation last week took the extremely unusual step of lowering its domestic oil prices on the eve of an OPEC meeting. **********NEVERTHELESS, there is a lingering concern that someday later this decade, perhaps even next year, oil prices might suddenly unravel, plummeting downward in uncontrolled fashion. If that were to happen, the world would experience an oil shock as severe in its economic impact as the two it suffered when prices rocketed upwards in the 1970's. **********''It would kill off Mexico - a major non-OPEC producer - along with some banks down in Texas,'' says a former high government official. Other national and regional economies would be virtually flattened, oil companies would give up most of their drilling as unprofitable and scores of banks with huge loan portfolios tied to energy would face the prospect of failure. **********Not the least of the casualties would be OPEC, which is hardly eager to lose huge chunks of income while it awaits the turnaround in the 1990's. Indeed, in the new economics of oil, the United States and the OPEC nations are beginning to share the common goal of a stable, relatively high oil price, although they part company on details. The United States would applaud a moderate decline in prices; the OPEC nations would resist even that. **********''A precipitate fall in oil prices by a substantial amount, to say $15-to-$20 a barrel, could have an immediate impact on many countries,'' said Walter J. Levy, an energy analyst. ''Major banks would be very worried. It would effect Britain disastrously. And oil states such as Texas and California would be severely harmed.'' **********But if an unraveling of prices is to be avoided, there are also powerful arguments in favor of a moderate decline in oil price - one that might eventually settle at about $24 a barrel, or $5 below the current benchmark price of $29 a barrel that OPEC is trying to preserve. Already, economists are talking about the beneficial results of the last OPEC price cut, in the spring of 1983, when similar pressures from Nigeria and Britain prompted OPEC to cut its crude prices by $5 a barrel. **********That 1983 price cut helped to push down the inflation rate in the United States and, in the opinion of many economists, may have been as much a reason for the current economic recovery as President Reagan's tax cuts. It ''added $22 billion to the spendable income of Americans, an increase roughly equivalent to the first two rounds of the Reagan tax cuts combined,'' said Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''The cut strengthened what looked to be a fragile recovery,'' he said. And he added that with the economic recovery once again showing signs of petering out, the Reagan Administration would probably like to see OPEC give in this week to a $2-a-barrel price cut. **********INDEED, Data Resources Inc. is already calculating the effect on the American economy if OPEC **********somehow agreed to a $5-a-barrel price cut before the end of this year. The forecasting firm said that the Consumer Price Index would drop by half a percentage point in each of the next three years and so would general interest rates. There would be an equivalent rise in the Gross National Product and auto production would rise by 700,000 vehicles - about 10 percent of current annual production - over the entire three years. **********Airlines, truckers, fast-food merchandisers and land developers also would profit from less expensive energy. Other benefits would be so indirect that analysts would spend months figuring them out. For instance, aluminum makers, although they do not use petroleum in production processes, gain because commercial airline manufacturers - heavy users of the metal - would do brisker business with cheaper oil. **********Even the losers - oil companies, coal producers, some coal-carrying railroads and banks with big loans to drillers or third world countries - would not suffer too much from a moderate price decline, in the opinion of many economists. ''A $1 or $2 cut can be handled,'' Mr. Levy said. And the chief economist of a major oil company says that ''a modest price reduction contributes to a stronger general economic performance.'' **********Ironically, the Federal Government might be hurt the most by a moderate price decline. Washington absorbs up to 80 cents of the first $4 reduction in the price of every barrel of oil, because of its windfall profits tax. Britain and Norway have the same problem, making their recent price reductions bitter medicine. **********It is no wonder then that this week's OPEC meeting assumes something of the character of a sporting event with fans rooting for opposing sides - the start of a moderate price slide vs. the status quo. But that is probably a distorted view of the larger reality. What is going on is a complex betting game, with multifarious players and interests clashing against the changing facts of geology, economics and demography. **********Here is OPEC's problem: Companies and countries do not like tying their purchases to a group that would truly love to be the tight cartel it has never quite succeeded in being. So they buy oil from non- OPEC producers first. As a result, OPEC has seen its share of world oil output plummet to 32 percent in 1983 from 54 percent in 1973. This is the consequence of two things: First, non-OPEC output from the North Sea, Mexico and elsewhere has soared. Second, consumption in the face of high oil prices fell in 1983 to its lowest point in 12 years, with approximately 35 percent of that reduction being attributed to conservation. Partly as a result, nearly one-third of the world's refining capacity is not being used. **********All this is already common knowledge in the new economics of oil. What is just emerging as equally important involves the kinds of oil now being produced and purchased. The oil industry has invested huge amounts of money - $18.2 billion in 1982 alone - to build or renovate refineries to process heavier, viscous petroleum that OPEC and other producers sell more cheaply than their benchmark brand, Arab light crude. The thick stuff has traditionally been used as the fuel burned by utilities and industry, and now it is being used to make gasoline, aviation and other products once produced almost exclusively from higher-quality light oil. **********THE upshot is that producers of **********the once-prized lighter crudes - **********Britain, Norway and Nigeria - are having trouble peddling their wares and are taking the logical step of shaving prices. **********International banks, although clearly nervous, see some blessings in this situation. They have billions in loans outstanding to Mexico and Venezuela, two major non-OPEC oil producers, and they might welcome a reduction in the price of light oil, if it strengthened the price of the heavy crude these financially troubled nations pump. **********But from OPEC's perspective, Nigeria's willingness to act unilaterally, as it did this month, is a troublesome chink in the armor of OPEC strategy. That country's financial woes were enough to topple a government recently and OPEC allows Nigeria to produce just 70 percent of what it is capable of pumping. Meanwhile, Mexico, not an OPEC member but certainly financially strained, pumps merrily along at a 90 percent clip. The wages of OPEC fidelity at a time of shrinking energy demand are crystal clear: Its members saw their export earnings tumble from $267.7 billion in 1980 to $149 billion in 1983, with a further reduction expected this year. **********A waiting game is the result. Currently, decreases in the use of ''stationary'' oil - that is, oil used for heating and power, but not in transportation - is more than offsetting slight gains in the transportation sector. But at some point, all the large- scale substitutions of coal, nuclear power and natural gas for ''stationary'' oil uses will be mostly completed. Then, the upward movement in transportation demand is expected to continue and to become dominant. OPEC's expectation is that this turning point will come within a decade. **********Similarly, OPEC looks forward to the day that Alaskan and North Sea production begins a steep decline, an event that is likely to occur by the end of the decade. They could only rejoice that such promising prospects as Sohio's Mukluk property in the Beaufort Sea and Exxon's Destin Anticline in the Gulf of Mexico turned out to be dry, and that expensive technologies may be reaching their limits in wringing black gold from existing fields. **********MOREOVER, such insurance policies as synthetic fuels have become almost fading memories, while inventory levels have become much, much tighter - not because the oil glut has abated but because companies don't want to finance these inventories at high interest rates and are confident that oil is readily available. It is also the case that OPEC is, in a sense, reluctantly banking its oil, with a production level of only 17.5 million barrels a day - just over half the amount of a decade ago - while the rest of the world produces all out. **********But, to most analysts, that hardly seems enough to make OPEC influential in the current situation. In today's world, the new wisdom is that oil revenue in the bank is worth more than a depreciating asset in the ground, a reversal of the thinking of OPEC's founders. **********What helps to make oil in the ground less valuable is that worldwide reserves have risen in comparison to production, a surprisingly favorable trend. In fact, this year's oil production - about 44 million barrels in the non-Communist world - would be even weaker were it not for the exceptionally cold weather last winter and the long British coal strike. **********But perhaps the most important factor working against OPEC's long- term strategy is that the world seems likely never to need as much oil as most people once thought it would. A major oil company as recently as the mid-1970's was positing that demand for OPEC oil in 1985 would be as much as 50 million barrels daily. Instead, it is slightly over 17.5 million. **********The lack of demand for Saudi Arabia's oil is more dramatic still. The predictions were that the world would be guzzling some 20 million barrels a day of Saudi crude by now, and American policymakers less than a decade ago were making nervous trips to the desert kingdom to urge the royal family to quickly increase its production capability to handle this demand. Instead, the Saudis, although still OPEC's biggest producers, have tightened the faucet to 4.5 million barrels daily, and might go as low as 3 million barrels as a result of tomorrow's meeting. That's roughly 25 percent of capacity. **********A major reason for the decline in demand is the gains that have been made in conservation and energy efficiency. And these gains will not likely be lost, mostly because these gains are largely the result of technology not the behavior of people. For instance, although Americans are using slightly more gasoline this year than last year - partly because it is cheaper - the automobile companies are adopting such technologies as an automatic transmission that is as fuel- efficient as manual shift. Already a big car like the Buick Electra gets 17 miles a gallon in city driving, compared with the 9 or 10 miles that similar models got in the mid-1970's. **********Roger Sant, a former top energy official in the Ford Administration and now head of a company selling energy-efficiency equipment to industry, said this process would continue as long as the price of oil remains above $15 a barrel. **********Moreover, the very structure of the market has become so competitive that a return to OPEC price-setting power might be difficult. Flexibility, not the security of a guaranteed source of supply, is what concerns buyers. Today, contracts are written for a maximum of three months, rather than five years as formerly. As much as half the oil in the world is probably traded on a spot basis, rather than through the traditional contract purchases. That's up from 5 to 10 percent at the beginning of the decade. **********Indicative of the change has been the tremendous growth in the trading of crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange. These contracts, representing a promise to deliver a fixed amount of oil at an agreed-upon price at a fixed date in the future, are even more sensitive to price change than the spot market and therefore have become a major vehicle for oil purchases. Since the new contracts began to be offered in March 1983, daily volumes have grown beyond the amount of crude produced in the United States in a day. **********''When the market speaks, OPEC now listens,'' Mr. Yergin said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/21/business/business-digest-saturday-january-21-1984.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 663, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST SATURDAY, JANUARY 21, 1984", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST SATURDAY, JANUARY 21, 1984", "body_text": " **********The Economy  The economy grew at a 4.5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter and inflation remained subdued, the Commerce Department reported.

It resembles the older 4000S model on the outside, but all four wheels are power-driven, instead of the usual two. **********Audi officials say the car is different from jeeps and other four-wheel- drive vehicles of the past because it is as low to the ground as conventional passenger cars, is always in four- wheel-drive operation and is not intended for off-road use. **********'A Performance Car' Unlike conventional four-wheel- drive vehicles, which get significantly lower gas mileage when in four-wheel drive, the 4000 Quattro's rating is 21 miles a gallon in the city, only one mile a gallon less than Audi's comparable two-wheel-drive car, according to the 1984 gas mileage guide of the Environmental Protection Agency. **********''This is a street car, a performance car,'' said Peter Fischer, vice president for Volkswagen of America's Porsche-Audi division. ''All- wheel-drive gives a consistent handling response under all conditions. The advantage is greatest in ice, snow and rain, but we feel it handles better even on a dry road.'' **********The 4000 Quattro, which is priced at $16,830, is a toned-down version of Audi's $35,000 turbocharged Quattro model, which has dominated international rallies for the past few years. Audi officials say they plan to make four-wheel-drive available in all models in the next few years. **********The success of what is known as the ''big Quattro'' has prompted imitations from Porsche and Mazda for rally competition, and it has other companies trying to decide if four- wheel drive is going to become a basic characteristic of higher-priced sports sedans, or if it will just be an interesting technological exercise with limited appeal, like Mazda's rotary engine. **********Chrysler Project **********Carroll Shelby, a former racing driver who now develops high-performance cars for the Chrysler Corporation, is working on four-wheel- drive derivatives of the company's familiar front-wheel-drive sedans. ''At some point you need four-wheel drive just to get the power to the ground,'' he said. ''Above 200 horsepower, you can't do it with two wheels, even using fat tires.'' **********Mr. Shelby said he estimated that 30,000 sporty four-wheel-drive sedans could be sold a year in the United States, and he expects the market to grow. ''I think we are looking at hundreds of thousands a year worldwide,'' he said. **********At least 18 European, Japanese and American car companies displayed prototype four-wheel-drive models at last year's auto show in Frankfurt. **********''We are interested enough in it that we are studying our own technology,'' said James Hamilton, an engineer with BMW of North America. **********Added Carl Flesher, a BMW marketing specialist: ''There is a technological confrontation occurring, and Audi will use this to say they are the technology leader. The question is: Will it sell cars?'' **********Subaru's Success **********It has for Subaru, although in a much lower price range. The Japanese car maker has four-wheel drive available in all of its subcompact cars and pickup trucks, although the technology involved is more conventional than Audi's. Officials of Subaru of America said about half of its sales of 156,000 last year were four-wheel- drive vehicles. **********Subaru, which advertises its products as ''inexpensive and built to stay that way,'' is edging up into the more profitable sport sedan market, as are other Japanese car makers. Subaru's top-of-the-line car this year is a four- wheel-drive hardtop, with a fuel-injected, turbocharged engine, costing $11,063. **********Most auto industry analysts say the principal appeal of four-wheel drive for on-the-road vehicles will be in the North, where snow-covered and wet roads are more of a problem. **********''Once a driver has spent a winter with four-wheel drive he would not want to be without it,'' said David E. Davis Jr., editor of Car and Driver, an auto magazine based in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''The benefits in this kind of a climate are unarguable.'' He said Audi in particular had ''decided the way of the future is technological difference rather than cosmetics.'' **********The 4000 Quattro model costs about $3,600 more than the two-wheel-drive 4000S model, and about 400 a month have been sold in the United States since its introduction in January."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/03/business/key-rates-056251.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": " **********Previous   Year       In percent   Yesterday   Day   Ago       PRIME RATE   12.00   12.00   11.00       DISCOUNT RATE    *9.00   9.00   8.50       FEDERAL FUNDS   10.25   10.26   9.32       3-MO.

Sometimes, the state tax bite is worse. **********In leafing through 1983 income tax return booklets, executives who work in New York City will learn that the state and city have quietly followed the lead of the Federal Government in taxing some individuals who exercised incentive stock options last year. Even executives who escape Washington's alternative minimum tax on such options may find themselves facing state and city tax obligations. **********The reason is that the state and city ''minimum taxes'' are imposed on top of the taxpayer's regular tax bill and the thresholds for being subject to the taxes are so low that executives who had hoped to reap just a $5,000 gain in exercising their stock options will have to at least go through extra computations to determine if they are liable. **********''It's a sleeper,'' said Richard Stricof, a tax partner in the accounting firm of Seidman & Seidman. ''An individual may be facing an additional and unexpected tax at the end of the year just for the privilege of exercising an incentive stock option. It is another indication that working and residing in New York is very costly when it comes to taxes.'' **********'Preference Items' **********The state and city minimum taxes are imposed on certain so-called preference items, including the gain or ''bargain element'' of an incentive stock option at the time of exercise and the 60 percent untaxed portion of long-term capital gains. The total amount of these preference items can generally be reduced only by a $5,000 specific deduction and the individual's New York State personal income tax. The remainder is then taxed by the state at a rate of 6 percent and by the city at a 2.5 percent rate. A 10 percent income tax surcharge in effect for 1983 in New York City effectively raises the city levy to 2.75 percent. **********Furthermore, with New York State, unlike the Federal Government, still taxing unearned income at higher rates than earned income, the tax preferences will have a detrimental effect on the calculation of New York State's regular income tax. The situation arises because the preference items will reduce the amount of earned income taxable at a lower rate and increase the amount of unearned income taxable at a higher rate. **********Created in 1981 **********Companies have long awarded stock options as an incentive to key employees, giving them the right to purchase a specified number of shares at a set price over a fixed period of time. Congress made the options more attractive in 1981 by creating ''incentive stock options'' as a new tax-favored breed. Employees could exercise their incentive options and buy the shares - which could have greatly appreciated in value - without having to pay tax on the gains until they finally sold their holdings. **********And if the stock was sold after holding it a year and a minimum of two years after the option was granted, profits would be taxed at capital gains rates of no more than 20 percent, rather than at ordinary rates of up to 50 percent. **********This generous tax treatment was similar to that accorded ''qualified'' employee stock options, which were phased out by the Tax Reform Act of 1976. But incentive options were deemed even one step better because they were not included on the list of preference items that might subject an individual to an extra tax liability in the form of Federal, state or city ''minimum taxes.'' Qualified options had been on that list. **********Beginning with 1983 returns, however, executives who exercise their incentive stock options will again face the potential threat of being hit by the Federal, state and city minimum taxes on their gains. **********Minimum Tax Broadened **********In the search for ways to raise revenues and trim the Federal deficit, Congress decided in 1982 to broaden the scope of the alternative minimum tax as a means of reinflating the tax bills of many more upper-income individuals who made heavy use of various tax benefits to reduce or eliminate their regular tax liability. **********Under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, the ''bargain element'' at the time of exercise of incentive options was added to the list of preference items that can trigger the alternative minimum tax. Taxpayers with preference items have to compute their tax liability under both the regular method and the alternative tax method and pay whichever bill is higher. The alternative tax rate is only 20 percent but it is assessed on a much broader base of income, including items that are not taxed under the regular method, such as the bargain element of incentive options and the 60 percent portion of long-term capital gains. **********As is automatically the case under New York statutes, the state and city tax laws were changed to conform with the Federal law, and incentive stock options were added to the list of minimum tax preference items. **********The state taxes are imposed not only on residents but also on those from out of state who work in New York, subject to calculations based on the number of days worked in the state. The city taxes affect only New York City residents. **********Added Risk **********The new taxes create an added risk for option holders should the price of the stock fall after the option is exercised. Because the taxes can be imposed at the time the options are exercised on a gain that may never be realized, an individual could find that more was paid in taxes than was gained from the sale of the stock. ''And you'd never be able to get the tax back,'' said William Katz, a partner in the accounting firm of Ernst & Whinney. **********Mr. Stricof of Seidman & Seidman gave the example of an executive in the top tax bracket filing a joint return who exercised an option to buy 1,000 shares of company stock for $15 each when the stock was trading at $35. The paper profit came to $20,000. **********If the executive had no other big preference items, the alternative minimum tax probably could be avoided, partly with the help of a $40,000 personal exemption. But the state and city taxes might still have to be paid because the bargain element can generally be offset by only the amount of the specific deduction - $5,000 - plus the amount of regular state income taxes paid, which in this executive's example is assumed to be $11,000. **********Thus, $4,000 of his $20,000 gain would be subject to the state minimum tax of 6 percent and the city minimum tax of 2.75 percent. The tax bill would total $240 for the state and $110 for the city. To reduce the pain, these taxes could be claimed next year as an itemized deduction on the executive's Federal return."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/24/business/l-olfactory-note-023351.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Olfactory Note", "print_headline": "Olfactory Note", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********In a ''Prospects'' column observation on Father's Day, a cosmetics industry analyst, Jack Salzman, seemed unable to decide whether wives give Dad fragrance because they can get a ''free or reduced-price umbrella'' at the same time, or because of a feminist plot to get even with those men for giving them perfume, presumably on Mother's Day. **********In Mr. Salzman's world of power and money, it may be impossible to understand the historic appeal and pleasure of fragrance.

It was then that Malcolm Baldrige, who is now Secretary of Commerce, shook it out of its lethargy and redirected it as a diversified manufacturer. **********Today, the company makes Hamilton Beach appliances, Yale locks and Nutone door chimes and security systems.

One analyst, who did not wish to be identified, said the book value of the company was $20 a share. ''That's a 75 percent premium over book, for openers,'' he said. ''Unless there's an oil well under company headquarters, the Belzbergs may be paying through the nose for it.'' **********Of course, as the analyst pointed out, the Belzbergs may have other fish to fry. They might need Scovill's earnings to offset tax losses, or they may hope to profit on their move even if their bid if not successful. **********Analysts Praise Management **********Scovill's management gets fairly high marks from analysts. Its balance sheet, Value Line said, ''is looking better and better,'' with long- term debt now 26 percent of capital, a marked improvement from 44 percent in 1979, and earnings that are expected to increase in 1985. **********''It got that way in part by pruning an awful lot of dead wood over a few managements,'' said John W. Adams, an analyst at Adams, Harkness & Hill Inc. of Boston. **********He credited Mr. Baldrige for getting out of the original brass business - ''a pretty good decision in retrospect,'' he said. Mr. Baldrige sold his stock in Scovill when he became Commerce Secretary, his daughter said yesterday at the Baldrige home in Woodbury, Conn., and Mr. Baldrige now stays out of Scovill affairs. **********William F. Andrews, who took over as chairman when Mr. Baldrige went to Washington in 1981, continued the pruning of smaller and unprofitable operations, Mr. Adams noted. **********Three Divisions Called Strong **********Currently, the company has six divisions, characterized by Mr. Adams, the Boston analyst, as three above-average achievers and three below - results that are better than most diversified companies, he says. **********Mr. Adams said the stronger divisions are Nutone, Hamilton Beach and the apparel fastener unit. **********Nutone, in addition to making door chimes and security systems, also produces radio intercoms, exhaust systems and bath cabinets. The unit has performed well in the past as starts in housing have risen. **********Hamilton Beach products, which include blenders, food processors, knives, drip coffee makers and irons, are generally priced at the lower end of the market and have been helped by extensive advertising. **********Scovill's link to the past, brass buttons, have been largely replaced by plastic. But Scovill is still one of the world's largest makers of apparel fasteners. An upsurge in this business began a year ago and is attributed to more designer use of snaps and zippers for functional and decorative use. **********The other three divisions are security products, including Yale locks; the automation group, including pneumatic equipment, and the automotive group - Schrader tire valves and other accessories. **********Scovill's Yale unit, acquired in 1979, is a leader in electronic locks for the hotel industry. In the modern units, cards have replaced the standard brass key. A code on the card is scanned by the room lock and, if correct, the card will open the door. **********The automation group sells products to manufacturers of machinery and equipment for rubber, fabricated metals, transportation, paper, chemicals and oil and gas. **********Scovill has been having problems with the automotive group, according to the company, because the shift in tire and tube production overseas has created too much domestic capacity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/01/business/stocks-are-mixed-as-the-dow-lises-2.51.html": {"writer_name": "Alexander Hammer", "pub_date": "1984-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 612, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STOCKS ARE MIXED AS THE DOW LISES 2.51", "print_headline": "STOCKS ARE MIXED AS THE DOW LISES 2.51", "body_text": " **********Stock prices ended mixed yesterday in heavier trading following their sharp selloff on Tuesday. **********The Dow Jones industrial average, which is made up of 30 major companies, ended the session down 2.51 points, to 1,154.63, after tumbling almost 23 points the day before. **********However, in the overall market, advancing equities on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered those that fell by a ratio of almost 4 to 3.

But Western experts are divided on whether this represents a temporary dip or a long-expected peaking of production. **********According to official Soviet statistics received in the United States, the declining trend began in October. Through the winter and into January, monthly figures reported in the Moscow economic weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta have shown a performance below that of the corresponding period a year before. **********The trend appears to have continued through February. In the past, output in any given month generally improved on the previous year's production level. **********Although daily output is still reported to be in excess of 12 million barrels a day, compared with 8.7 million barrels in the United States and 6 million in Saudi Arabia, future oil production is a matter of some importance to the Soviet Union. The Russians export one- fourth of their oil output and derive 60 percent of their foreign exchange earnings from oil shipments to the West, mostly to Western Europe. **********The oil earnings are used to buy high technology and grain, and if the recent decline were the beginning of a trend, it might ultimately affect Moscow's ability to pay for these imports. **********''It is too early to call,'' said Jan Vanous, senior economist of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, a Washington-based research organization that specializes in the Soviet economy. **********Mr. Vanous said there had been reports of a mild winter that might have caused transport problems and slowed oil production in the marshy forests of West Siberia. Despite temperatures dropping regularly to 40 degrees below zero, winter is a period of high activity in the region, because the freezing of the normally soggy ground makes possible cross-country hauling of drilling rigs and other heavy equipment. **********The oil industry, like other Soviet economic activity, generally starts the year slowly and works up to a peak in the last quarter, both because of the winter operating conditions and because of the practice of ''storming,'' a last-minute effort to fulfill the annual plan. But in 1983 fourth-quarter output fell below that of the second and third quarters. **********Another American specialist on Soviet energy, Prof. John W. Campbell of Indiana University in Bloomington, said Soviet drillers had been pressing the potential of the West Siberian fields to make up for declines in older fields. **********''The effect of that pressure had to end sometime, and that time may now be at hand,'' he said. He also noted that the Russians had traditionally injected large amounts of water into oilfields to stimulate the oil flow, and that the share of water in the emerging fluid might have risen to the point where less oil was now being extracted. **********The heavy use of water injection was one of the factors cited in the late 1970's, notably by the Central Intelligence Agency, in predictions that Soviet oil production would reach a peak some time between 1978 and 1982. **********The dip in oil output that has been officially reported since October is the first such sustained decline since the Soviet Union, with the aid of the West Siberian discoveries in the 1960's and early 1970's, surged into first place among world oil producers in 1974. **********The growth was aided by the large Siberian reserves concentrated in a single giant field, Samotlor, near the new town of Nizhnevartovsk, which alone yields 3 million barrels a day, or one- half of Siberian production and one- fourth of the Soviet Union's total oil output. But Soviet oil production growth slowed after 1980, when the Russians had to turn to smaller fields, each of which had to be reached across trackless forest. **********Last year West Siberia fell short of its output plan for the first time since its oil development began."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/05/business/option-move-is-delayed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 163, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Option Move Is Delayed", "print_headline": "Option Move Is Delayed", "body_text": " **********A lottery originally scheduled for today to allocate options trading on individual stocks, including the seven new telephone company stocks, has been delayed pending a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission on the application by the New York Stock Exchange to trade listed options.

Chernenko, the party leader. **********Speaking in connection with elections next Sunday to the Supreme Soviet, the nominal Parliament, Mr. Gorbachev focused on economic issues, listing many of the experiments and programs that had been begun under Mr. Andropov in an effort to rouse the Soviet economy. **********The emphasis suggested to Western diplomats that Mr. Gorbachev, who originally joined the Politburo as an expert in agriculture, had been given broader responsibility over the economy, perhaps to pursue the changes initiated by Mr. Andropov. **********Mr. Gorbachev passed only lightly over foreign affairs in his speech, which was published in Izvestia, the Government newspaper. **********He seemed to strike a less strident tone in referring to the United States than either Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko or Defense Minister Dmitri F. Ustinov, and he declared that Moscow was ready ''to use any real chance for fair negotiations, for reaching practical accords.'' There had been earlier signals that Mr. Gorbachev, who is 52 years old, had assumed a strong position in the Politburo after Mr. Chernenko was named the party leader. Mr. Gorbachev had made the closing comments at the Central Committee session that voted Mr. Chernenko into office, and he stood to the right of the new leader after his appointment. **********Western diplomats said the timing of Mr. Gorbachev's election speech seemed to be the strongest evidence so far of his standing. In the weeks just before the elections, in which all candidates are officially designated and unopposed, members of the leadership make speeches in the constituencies to which they have been assigned. **********Mr. Gorbachev spoke in the North Caucasus village of Ipatovo, in his home province of Stavropol, which he headed as the regional party leader from 1970 to 1978 before being summoned to Moscow and rising to national prominence. **********The leaders generally make their election speeches in ascending order of importance, and the last two are reserved for the Prime Minister, Nikolai A.

Mr. Gorbachev also played a role in efforts to bring new blood into regional party machines and in cracking down on corruption. **********In his speech, Mr. Gorbachev spoke of ''further enforcing order, being more exacting, organized and disciplined, and waging an uncompromising struggle with negative phenomena that come into conflict with our morals and with socialist legality.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev's treatment of foreign affairs was too brief to give diplomats much grist for analysis. **********However, the Government press agency Tass drew attention to the stiff stances already assumed by Mr. Gromyko and Marshal Ustinov in their speeches. **********Tass quoted them to the effect that, before relations could improve, the United States had to take ''practical steps,'' which they said had not yet become evident. **********A similar theme was struck today by Yuri Kornilov, a Tass analyst, who said Washington had shown no readiness to start rectifying relations with Moscow."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/05/world/death-toll-in-the-philippines-reaches-438-after-typhoon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Death Toll in the Philippines Reaches 438 After Typhoon", "print_headline": "Death Toll in the Philippines Reaches 438 After Typhoon", "body_text": " **********The death toll reached 438 today as relief workers stepped up efforts to reach remote areas where more people may have died in the fiercest storm to hit the Philippines in nearly 15 years. **********The typhoon, named Ike, swept into the sugar- producing central Cebu Province Sunday and roared across seven major islands in two days, leaving a city of 135,000 people in ruins and driving hundreds of thousands into shelters."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/21/world/around-the-world-peace-corps-volunteer-is-killed-in-philippines.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Peace Corps Volunteer Is Killed in Philippines", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Peace Corps Volunteer Is Killed in Philippines", "body_text": " **********An American Peace Corps volunteer on the central Philippine island of Cebu was shot and killed at his beachfront cottage during an apparent robbery this week, the authorities said today. **********Charles Turner, a 40-year-old former Air Force officer from Omaha, Neb., was found at dawn Wednesday with a bullet wound in the back of his head, the officials said.

Abd al- Rahman Shaibi, discussed the situation at length with officials at the Home Office and the Foreign Office. Colonel Shaibi, who has close ties to Colonel Qaddafi, also talked by telephone with the Libyans who have been besieged in the embassy for nine days.  Julia Miles, wife of the British Ambassador in Libya, Oliver Miles, said in a telephone interview from Tripoli that wives and children of British diplomats hoped to leave on a flight to London on Thursday. **********But she said she was not sure they would be permitted to do so, since 10 Britons are currently confined to the embassy by the Libyan police.   Diplomatic Relations Broken **********British officials here expressed concern that the Britons would be permitted to leave only after the Libyans have departed from Britain. Britain broke diplomatic relations with the Qaddafi Government on Sunday. **********The police announced the arrest of a fourth member of the Libyan ''revolutionary committee'' that took over the embassy in February, Matooq Matooq, but he was not immediately deported, as were two of his colleagues earlier this week. Another member was already in Libya. **********In the Commons, Mr. Brittan described the shooting of Miss Fletcher as ''a barbaric outrage,'' but he conceded that the police had concluded that without the cooperation of the occupants of the building, there was no way they could make a criminal charge stand up.

Support From Laborite **********Gerald Kaufman, the spokesman on home affairs for the opposition Labor Party, supported Mr. Brittan's approach, but served warning that next week he would ask a series of detailed questions about the course of negotiations with the Libyans and other matters.

The cars and pickup **********trucks out on Highway 18 still **********have their lights on in the chilled darkness of the early prairie morning. But inside Ernie Williams's John Deere dealership here, another desperate business day is already under way. And the 78-year-old farm equipment dealer himself is pressing his assembled troops. **********''These sales don't come to you anymore, boys,'' he says in a now familiar pep talk in the conference room. ''We gotta be like coon dogs and go out and find the customers. You can't wait like you used to.'' **********Nowadays Mr. Williams's management and sales team meets at dawn every morning before scattering across the 13-acre dealership and its five-county sales area in north central Iowa, about 400 miles west of Chicago. It is but one sign of the new aggressiveness and organization adopted by some farm equipment dealers in their struggle to survive the chronic depression in the farm equipment industry. The Williams employees exchange notes, suggest contacts and learn of new sales incentives and discounts in an effort to sell everything from an 8-cent cotter pin to a $194,000 combine. **********''During the peak business back in the 1970's,'' said Ed Wilcox, a 45-year- old former farmboy and the dealership's general manager, ''we had a 20 percent markup. Now it's anything above cost. We're just trying to carry ourselves through the tough times until the turnaround.'' **********It may take longer than expected. John Deere, Allis-Chalmers, International Harvester, Massey-Ferguson and J.I. Case, the major farm implement manufacturers in this $9 billion industry, are several years into tough times. High interest rates and operating costs, stagnant or declining crop prices and a strong dollar curbing agricultural export sales have spawned an era of financial uncertainty across the nation's heartland, the worst since the Depression of the 1930's. Farmers are keeping old equipment, or at best, buying used equipment. And analysts and industry insiders alike are wondering whether the farm equipment industry can ever recapture the financial vigor it had as recently as five years ago. **********ERNIE WILLIAMS Ltd., one of **********2,130 Deere dealers across **********North America and 141 in Iowa, is among the largest and most aggressive outlets in the Deere network. Mr. Williams, an energetic Iowa native who talks like the Pontiac dealer he once was and dresses in the yellow and green of the Deere zealot he now is, bought the dealership in 1950, when a new tractor cost $1,200, and a five- man, quarter-acre operation was big enough to sell them. **********Today, the dealership has 25 employees and does around $10 million in business annually. But new tractors cost nearly 10 times as much as they did in the 50's, and those few farmers who are buying new equipment are driving hard bargains. Mr. Williams says he will be very lucky to make $100,000 profit this year. Several nearby dealerships have closed. In fact, the number of farm equipment dealerships nationwide declined to 15,142 last year from 15,682 in 1981. And the purchase of International Harvester's farm equipment by Tenneco's J.I. Case Inc., announced last week, could accentuate the continuing decline in dealerships. **********Still, ''the business is out there,'' said Mr. Williams, motioning toward the flat grainlands that surround this community of 6,000. And so, on a dreary Wednesday recently, the assorted salesmen, managers and other employees embarked on yet another day of fighting for survival in the Darwinian world of American agriculture. **********By 8 A.M. salesman Dwight Rasmussen was enroute with one of Deere's new $9,500 mulch tillers to Edmond Otis's farm 10 miles east of town for a free plowing demonstration. Mr. Otis promised to be a hard sell. His wife, Judy, felt a new washing machine had a higher purchasing priority than new farm equipment, and these days, few farmers have the option of buying both. **********But Mr. Otis had just finished his corn harvest, the rain prohibited much field work, and Mr. Rasmussen was a friend. So the farmer agreed to the demonstration, and even invited his brother and son over to watch. **********Knowing the smaller size of Mr. Otis's current tractor, the salesman just happened to show up in a new 190- horsepower Deere tractor, which provided an opening for a subsidiary sales pitch. For two hours Mr. Rasmussen and one of the Otis men drove back and forth across part of the 80- acre cornfield. The salesman showed how the plow would save one complete pass over the field each year because it chops the old stalks as well as turning the soil for the next spring's planting. The new wider tool also plows four feet more per pass and distributes residue on the ground to combat winter wind erosion. **********The men also talked about the weather, crop yields, football and a possible special price for special customers. The farmer decided to see how the 10 newly plowed acres compared with the other 70, come spring. He figured he might need a new tractor too in a year or so. And this 190- horsepower model with the special transmission, digital readouts and sound insulation, he said, ''is a real Cadillac.'' **********Later, the salesman would add, ''We plant some seeds now and then ourselves.'' **********BACK at the dealership, Dave Ludwig, who runs the Deere lawn and garden shop, was arranging a sales display of toy tractors and combines, which match the real ones down to the letters D-E-E-R-E. ''If they play with John Deere equipment when they're little boys,'' he said with a smile, ''we figure they'll play with John Deere equipment when they're big boys.'' **********Neil Brandenburg, meanwhile, was painting a used combine head the familiar Deere green. It was an increasingly common chore, in that more than 90 percent of all sales now involve trade-ins. The other day the dealer even took a plow and old grain truck in trade toward a used tractor. ''We're making deals now we'd normally never think of doing,'' noted Mr. Wilcox. Often, the idea is just to get a farmer to step up from his aging tractor or combine to one a little less used. It's extra bookkeeping and finance-hunting, but it turns inventory. **********Many of the deals that Ernie Williams offers originate with the manufacturer. Through its dealerships Deere leases some equipment, and rents others. It gives discounts for cash. And it can provide financing, as 75 percent of today's buyers want, up from 50 percent 20 years ago. **********For some new equipment, Deere waives all interest for one year and requires no payments for 18 months. As a result, just as the first interest payment comes due, some farmers trade in the year-old machine for a new one; it's more expensive, but it's interest-free for 12 more months and no payments come due until well after the first harvest. **********On this particular Wednesday Roger Evans, a leading salesman who rarely spends a day in the office, was hunting financing for corn farmer Larry Gray. Mr. Gray wanted to trade his 1965 Deere gas tractor toward a more fuel-efficient 1965 Deere diesel. With $2,500 in cash Mr. Gray needed $6,000 in financing, $1,000 too much according to the tractor's book worth. Mr. Evans could not find the money; neither could Mr. Gray. The deal died stillborn. **********Usually, Mr. Evans spends his days pounding the backroads stopping at farmhouse after farmhouse seeking sales. ''Cold calls are the hardest,'' he says, ''They're on the defensive from the start.'' So Mr. Evans drives in, appearing to seek directions. The casual conversation moves through the weather, football, crops and, oh, by the way, he says, I'm with the Deere dealer in Algona. **********Mr. Evans did this for six months earlier this year without making one sale. Then he sold one tractor to the Krantz family, who mentioned him to many of their neighbors. The result: Mr. Evans sold three tractors in one month, plus 10 plows, cultivators and combines. Mr. Evans gets no commission, just a salary. ''Commissions cause pushing among team members,'' says the owner. **********Indeed, sales have become very much team efforts these days. Jerry Janssen, the service manager, spends several hours a day on the phone advising farmers on repairs. When he hears one farmer is looking for a particular implement, he'll mention it at the next morning's meeting. When the right tool shows up, a salesman makes a call and, hopefully, a sale. **********Each morning Wendell Phelps, the dealership's computer expert, distributes a 32-page computer printout of equipment and spare parts inventory. The big machinery still represents the largest share of sales - 39 percent for new equipment and 42 percent for used - but these days, as strapped farmers fix old machines rather than buy new ones, the 65,000 spare parts that Williams carries are pulling a larger share of the burden than in the past. Parts this year will account for 5.4 percent of total Williams sales, nearly twice the 1981 share. Repairs will bring in 5.1 percent. Non-Deere equipment sales such as augers and Harley-Davidson motorcycles will take up the remaining 8.5 percent. **********''HEY, Ed,'' came the eager voice of Mr. Williams from the parking lot on Mr. Wilcox's pocket radio, ''Harold Frideres is coming in.'' It was hopeful news. **********''Today you gotta know every farmer, his equipment and his tastes in machinery,'' said Mr. Wilcox. Mr. Wilcox knew that Mr. Frideres and his son Howard were shopping for a combine to replace their old International Harvester. **********Mr. Wilcox was stuck with 16 of the 30 combines he ordered this year, anticipating an upswing that never swung. Similarly, the dealer's tractor sales are off, from 48 new tractors in 1982 to 39 last year and only 20 so far this year. **********Part of the problem is financing. The rate with 30 percent down payment is 2.75 percent above prime, adjusted monthly during the contract's five- or six-year life. Another part is price. The same tractor that sold in 1974 for $14,360 now lists for $54,700 while the price Mr. Frideres gets for his soybeans has gone from $10 a bushel in 1974 to under $6. **********''We're desperate to move this inventory,'' said Mr. Wilcox. ''The factory will carry it only so long.'' For the 1985 model year he's ordered only five combines and one tractor. **********Despite Mr. Wilcox's flattery and cajoling, Mr. Frideres was not in a jolly mood. He did want the combine. He knew it was listed for $112,000. But he didn't know it cost the dealer $88,000. **********Mr. Wilcox was asking $93,000 that day minus a $23,000 trade-in on the used combine. Mr. Frideres wanted $10,000 more on the trade. **********The farmer left to consider the deal overnight and, he hinted, to visit another Deere dealership two counties away. He would call the next day. Mr. Wilcox was sorely tempted to lower the price further. ''I'd get him for sure if I came down $5,000 more,'' said Mr. Wilcox, ''but that's cutting it too close on the trade.'' The next morning Mr. Frideres didn't call. No news was not good news. **********MR. CAMP'S NEW COMBINE:A RARE PURCHASE **********''Well, now,'' said Jerry Camp, the farmer, ''you can dicker all you want if you want. But it doesn't usually do you much good.'' Then, he laughed. And Ed Wilcox, the John Deere dealer's general manager in Algona, Iowa, laughed too. **********And they reminisced about a rare thing these days - a farm equipment sale involving a combine that listed for $194,000. It had made the sales month for Ernie Williams, owner of the dealership here. And it made Mr. Camp's harvest a more efficient one. ''I was surprised and pleased with the machine,'' said Mr. Camp, ''And I'm not normally surprised and pleased at the same time.'' **********The deal will end in March 1989. But it began last February when Mr. Camp inquired about a trade-in on his two fairly new International Harvester combines. The awkward-looking combine, a mechanical staple on any grain farm, moves slowly down crop rows, combing the plants into whirling wheels that rip the grain off the stalk, dump it in a bin or accompanying truck and spit the stalks back out to decompose by next spring. **********Mr. Camp got about $154,000 credit on his two machines last winter. They were overhauled and put on sale even before Mr. Camp's new combine arrived last July 31. He didn't take possession, however, until the fall harvest began, giving him fuller use of the one-year warranty. The interest on the remaining $40,000, arranged through a Deere finance subsidiary, didn't begin until September either. And under a Deere sales plan the five annual payments don't start until next March, giving him use of his harvest money until then. **********The combine works 12 rows at once, twice the old machines' rate, which speeds up the harvest and frees one man for other work. It also allows efficient concentration of Mr. Camp's grain trucks. One good day they brought in 22,000 bushels, about 1.54 billion kernels. According to the combine's digital readout, it took Mr. Camp only 38 hours to harvest 2,000 acres. Mr. Camp was very excited for a farmer. ''I'm satisfied,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/15/business/credit-crad-drives-wooing-the-affluent.html": {"writer_name": "Pamela Hollie", "pub_date": "1984-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 630, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CREDIT CRAD DRIVES WOOING THE AFFLUENT", "print_headline": "CREDIT CRAD DRIVES WOOING THE AFFLUENT", "body_text": " **********The swirling Congressional debate over credit card surcharges has focused attention on an industry that, more than ever, is looking for new ways to expand and reach higher-income customers. The three major cards, American Express, Visa and Mastercard, have all, for example, recently begun national advertising campaigns, stressing their versatility and aimed directly at the luxury travel and entertainment market. **********Of the three, American Express, for now, is probably the most aggressive marketer. The simple reason is that American Express is not yet the king of the credit card heap. **********It falls far behind Visa International or Mastercharge International in both card members and total charges. But both Visa and Mastercharge have the advantage of thousands of member banks, which own the credit card system and collect fees and issue cards as independent members. **********'Terrific Advantage' **********American Express is a single entity, with one billing procedure and one clearing house. ''We have a terrific advantage over the bank cards like Mastercard or Visa because they are a loose confederation of banks with accounting done all over the place,'' said Jerry Welsh, senior vice president of marketing services for the Travel Related Services Company of American Express. **********According to analysts, American Express's fast central billing is the reason for its dominance of the highly profitable travel and entertainment segment of the market. In this market American Express is the leader in corporate accounts. **********And American Express has obtained a firm hold on the prestige end of the card market, even though both Visa and Mastercard quickly matched American Express's introduction of its gold card with prestige cards of their own. **********But two weeks ago, American Express announced its platinum charge card. This month, the company will invite 5 percent of its biggest spenders to become platinum charge card holders. For a fee of $250 annually they will receive personalized travel services, and access to large amounts of money while traveling, among other services. **********The other card issuers, primarily the banks, are eager to derail the runaway Amexco express. ''More and more banks realize that their competitor is American Express,'' said Russell E. Hogg, president of Mastercard International Inc., which issues its cards through its member banks. **********A High Interest Rate **********And banks do have an important economic reason to promote their cards. American Express cannot charge interest. ''I suspect that right now bank cards are more profitable to us than American Express cards are to them,'' said Richard S. Braddock, executive vice president of Citibank. **********Bank cards charge consumers nearly 20 percent interest, seven percentage points higher than the average borrowing rate. ''The banks should be doing rather well,'' Mr. Braddock added. Bank cards make money on the interest, the annual fee, and on the merchant discount of about 3 percent. American Express gets an annual fee and a merchant discount. **********Carte Blanche and Diners Club, both owned by Citicorp, are no-interest charge cards like American Express. And they, too, are used primarily for dining, traveling and buying theater tickets. But neither has been much of a challenge to American Express. ''Diners Club is going through a shakeout, '' said Michael Lewis, vice president at E. F. Hutton & Company. ''Carte Blanche is doing very little.'' **********American Express, however has begun to selectively and successfully encroach on its competitors' markets - middle-income and young consumers - as well as its more traditional market of those in their mid-30's and mid-40's with incomes of $35,000 or more. **********Last year, the company reported a 21 percent increase in the number of new green cards as a result of several new card promotions. One encouraged new college graduates to apply. **********Another program sought female applicants, and increased their membership after sponsoring educational seminars for women ranging from careers and investment planning to computers and coping with stress."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/13/world/roll-call-in-house-on-mining.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ROLL CALL IN HOUSE ON MINING", "print_headline": "ROLL CALL IN HOUSE ON MINING", "body_text": " **********Following are the positions of representatives from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut when the House approved a nonbinding resolution opposing the use of Federal funds for the mining of Nicaraguan harbors.

Gone are the emphasis on cut-rate prices and the flurry of dazzling product introductions. Instead, at least the manufacturers hope, there will be profits. **********Bloodied by price wars and heavy losses last year, the industry is now waiting for the next phase of competition, over higher-priced machines. **********Only one significant product was introduced at the first day of the show today - a new line of computers from Commodore International that features built-in software. It did not elicit the excitement of products like Coleco Industries' Adam when it was introduced at last June's show. **********I.B.M. vs. Atari **********Home computer makers seem resolved to concentrate on making products they have already announced - and doing it profitably. **********All agree the battle will move to more expensive and more useful machines. Two of the strongest players are expected to be companies that lead in business computers, ones that are far more expensive than the under- $200 machines that have dominated the home computer market so far. They are International Business Machines, whose PCjr is scheduled to be available this quarter, and Apple Computer, which is preparing to introduce an inexpensive version of the Apple IIe for the home market. **********Last year, home computer sales doubled to about five million units, but oversupply and price cuts led to losses of hundreds of millions of dollars from major companies like Atari and Texas Instruments. Texas Instruments ended up pulling out of the market. Its booth here was a fairly desolate one, populated by calculators and electronic learning aids, but not the home computer. **********Now, things appear to be looking up. Indeed, James J. Morgan, the chairman and chief executive of Atari, said today that he expects the company to be profitable in 1984, although it will lose money in the first six months. Atari lost more than $500 million in the first nine months of 1983. **********Industry leaders agree that it is an opportune time to move to more expensive home computers. Strong Christmas sales, combined with production delays affecting Atari and Coleco, have cleared out inventories and taken the pressure off prices. Even the huge inventory of Texas Instruments home computers, sold at bargain basement prices, is now mostly gone. **********''Christmas was a sellout and everything was in short supply,'' said Tricia Parks, of Future Computing Inc., a Dallas market research firm. She predicted, ''There's going to be some sanity in pricing this year.'' **********Both Atari and Coleco started the year by increasing prices on their home computers, and officials of both companies say the increases appear to have stuck. ''We don't have to go into a downward death spiral on prices to get the public to buy our products,'' said Mr. Morgan of Atari, which is part of Warner Communications. **********Nevertheless, it is somewhat early to judge whether the price rises will hold once supply increases to meet demand. It is also unclear whether retailers will pass on the price increases to consumers. **********New From Commodore **********Commodore introduced two computers, the 264 and the 364, both of which will come with some software built into the machine on chips. Such built-in software has been used in briefcase-size computers, like the Radio Shack Model 100, but not in general-purpose home computers. **********Both computers will have 64,000 characters of internal memory. The 364, in addition, will have a built-in speech synthesizer, allowing the computer to talk when used with software geared to that capability. **********Commodore officials said the computers will be available in April but they did not disclose the price. It is believed that the 264 will sell for $300 to $500, in comparison to $200 for its Commodore 64. **********Company officials did not say what software would be built into the machine. But they said that there may be several versions and that the software would be geared toward business-like applications for the home, including record-keeping and word processing. **********By including software, Commodore is joining a trend toward offering bundle packages rather than bare-bones machines. In home computers, this trend was started with the introduction of Coleco's Adam. **********Some analysts, however, were puzzled by Commodore's moves since the machines do not appear much different from the existing Commodore 64. ''I'm at a loss as to what they're doing really,'' said one analyst. Moreover, analysts said, the software written for the 64 will not work on the new machine without modifications. **********Apple's Resurgence **********The big factor in the home computer market, however, could be Apple. Its IIe had a resurgence at Christmas, with more than 100,000 units sold in December alone, though many at discount. **********Apple is now believed to be close to unveiling a less expensive version of the IIe for the home market. The company also is working on a high- end version of the Apple IIe, using a more powerful version of the micro- processor used in the Apple IIe. This is in addition to the introduction of the McIntosh later this month. That computer, featuring easy-to-use integrated software like in Apple's Lisa but at a lower price, is not expected to be aimed at the home market. **********Coleco, meanwhile, plagued by quality and production problems, is still trying to produce enough Adams. Analysts believe Coleco will report a loss for the fourth quarter and question whether the company achieved its latest goal of shipping 125,000 computers by year-end. **********Arnold Greenberg, Coleco's president, would not comment on financial performance or shipment rates. **********Coleco also announced a disk drive attachment for the Adam, to supplement the tape drive that is included in the machine. It also said there would be a way later in the year to allow the machine to use software written for the I.B.M. personal computer and PCjr. **********Atari does not appear ready for the battle. Only two of four computers it announced in June are in production - the 700 XL and the 800 XL. One of the others, the 1400 XL has been scratched and the other, the 1450 XLD, which was on display here, may never be produced. Atari has also dropped plans for an I.B.M.-compatible home computer. **********The lineup for 1984 suggests that there will be no quick standardization in the home computer market. In the business personal computer market, the industry seemed to be solidifying rapidly around I.B.M.'s design, and most manufacturers now offer some ability to use software written for the I.B.M. machine. But the home computer market is likely to have at least three strong players - I.B.M., Apple and Commodore, whose computers will not be able to use software written by the others."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/15/world/peru-troops-accused-of-killings.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 212, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PERU TROOPS ACCUSED OF KILLINGS", "print_headline": "PERU TROOPS ACCUSED OF KILLINGS", "body_text": " **********Troops searching for leftist guerrillas dragged six men from a church in a mountain village and shot them to death outside while other soldiers forced the rest of the congregation to sing hymns, the pastor said today. **********The deaths bring to 147 the number of people killed in guerrilla-related violence in the last two weeks in the South American country. **********In response to the increasing wave of violence, President Fernando Belaunde Terry today extended for 60 days military control and a state of emergency in 13 provinces in and around Ayacucho. **********The Rev.

But the market for ready-to- use industrial plants is still sagging because of the recent recession, the debts of the third world and the smaller revenues of oil-producing countries. **********Lately, in an effort to re-establish order in its operations, Metallgesellschaft has embarked on a strategy that some analysts describe as a return to its roots. The company is developing one-step trade and financing packages. These combine its extensive trading resources with prowess in exploration, mining and plant construction. **********Broader Trading Activity **********The company is broadening its trading activities beyond ores and metals to include energy products, like coal and oil, and financial instruments, such as foreign exchange and government securities. It is also developing its ability to arrange countertrade deals or barter arrangements with countries that are short of foreign exchange. **********As part of this course, the company has expanded its presence in New York, hiring Siegfried Hodapp, a former Citibank official, to head Meta llgesellschaft Inc., its trading unit, and George S. Horton, a former General Motors executive, to serve as an adviser on countertrade. **********The strategy underlines the problem facing trading companies the world over as debts of the Eastern bloc and third world prevent these nations from purchasing goods abroad. But Metallgesellschaft's troubles take peculiar twists. **********The company, founded more than a century ago by William Merton, who came from an English metal trading clan, was a supplier of raw materials to German companies. Over the years, it grew into a conglomerate involved in mining and smelting, manufacturing and plant construction. **********Company officials acknowledge that the shift accelerated under the Nazi regime - which drove experienced Jewish traders, including the founder's family, from the company - and then continued during West Germany's postwar rebuilding period. **********Today, natural resources, the big division that includes trading in ores, metals and other commodities, accounts for slightly more than half of the company's sales. The rest comes from manufacturing, plant construction, chemicals and shipping. **********Poor Management Decisions **********Metallgesellschaft has had its share of management gaffes - badly timed investments in copper and molybdenum. But the real jolt came when the recession of 1981-82 depressed metal prices, wiping out margins on producing metals such as zinc and lead. At the same time, severe payments problems in Eastern bloc and developing countries dried up orders for ready-for-use plants. **********In 1982, Metallgesellschaft reported a loss equivalent to $7 million, its first since World War II, as sales dropped nearly 7 percent, to $3.59 billion.

Some oil-producing countries that are not members of the organization have also been invited to participate in the talks. **********In a weekend statement released by OPEC at its Vienna headquarters, the organization said its members were ''determined to maintain and strengthen the price and will take every necessary measure in this respect.'' The only way OPEC can do this, oil analysts say, is to slash production immediately. **********Responding to Recent Cuts **********The emergency conference has been called in response to the price cuts announced last week by two non-OPEC members, Norway and Britain, and one OPEC member, Nigeria. But oil analysts say the organization is facing a much more serious crisis than just the possibility of a reduction in its official price. **********OPEC is facing deep fundamental changes in worldwide oil production and use, according to oil analysts, and these changes are threatening the group's ability to control oil prices. **********Since 1979, when OPEC doubled oil prices after the Iranian revolution, there has been a shift by oil-consuming nations away from OPEC as a supplier. Higher prices made it more economic to develop some marginal oil and gas fields and brought into focus both economic and security reasons to develop other energy sources. **********Expansion of Output Noted **********As a result, oil production in the non- Communist world outside of OPEC jumped 25 percent in five years, to 25 million barrels a day from 20 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency. **********At the same time, demand for oil dropped 15 percent because of permanent shifts to natural gas, coal and energy conservation. **********The only way OPEC has been able to keep its prices high has been to continually cut production to keep supplies tight - from 31.6 million barrels a day in 1979 to 23.5 million in 1981 and as little as 16.5 million in the third quarter of this year, according to various oil experts. **********But this has had the effect, the analysts say, of OPEC's tightening a noose around its own neck. In an effort to control prices and hang onto its customers, OPEC is selling far less oil, reaping far less money and prompting internal fights between its members, who must sell less than they are able to produce. **********''OPEC pushed prices too high in 1979, and it set in motion a series of events that are now coming back to haunt them,'' said Paul Mlotok, an oil analyst at Salomon Brothers, the investment house. ''It took a while for other countries to adjust, because the lead times are relatively long. But once they have adjusted, it will go a long way.'' **********The economic effect of those cutbacks on OPEC has been severe. The oil revenues on which its 13 member nations depend dropped 42 percent, or $141.4 billion, in 1983, compared with the peaks of 1978 to 1981, according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly. **********Nigeria has especially suffered. Its economy depends almost entirely on oil, and the country has had trouble paying even the interest on its $20 billion international debt. Nigeria's OPEC-set production quota of 1.3 million barrels a day is about half of its peak output over the past few years. **********During the recent oil oversupply, Nigeria often has been first to offer secret discounts to suppliers and raise production to keep its markets and economy intact. This year its production averaged 1.4 million barrels a day, according to the country's central bank. By violating OPEC's production quota, Nigeria has achieved a balance-of-payments surplus of $325 million, about the same size as its deficit in 1983. **********When Britain followed Norway's lead last week by cutting the price of most of its North Sea oil by $1.35 a barrel, to $28.65, Nigeria was quick to respond with its own $2-a-barrel cut, to $28, prompting OPEC's emergency meeting. It was Nigeria, following Britain, that sparked the OPEC cut in its official price, to $29 a barrel from $34 for the benchmark Saudi Arabian light crude, in March 1983. **********Several Offer Discounts **********Other OPEC nations have also found discounts irresistible. Libya, Abu Dhabi and Iran have cut their prices for key customers. **********Saudi Arabia, OPEC's acknowledged leader, is economically healthier than most of the other members, and reportedly has contingency plans to drop its production to 3 million barrels a day in the next few weeks, far below its recent daily output of 4.5 million to 5.5 million and its capacity of 10 million barrels a day. **********But analysts say the Saudis cannot keep output that low for long without threatening their own internal stability. None of the non-OPEC oil-producing nations have appeared to help OPEC by tightening supplies except for brief periods. **********''Whenever new capacity outside of OPEC is ready, it is produced immediately,'' said John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. ''OPEC has become the swing producer, and it continues to be squeezed.'' **********Production Outside OPEC **********According to the Wall Street firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, oil production since 1979 has been increased by 75 to 100 percent in Norway, Britain, India, Malaysia, Mexico and Egypt. Brazil has more than doubled its output. **********The Soviet bloc, which was expected in 1979 to become a net oil importer by 1985, has instead increased its exports by an estimated 600,000 barrels a day, to 1.7 million. Production in the United States has not dropped, as predicted, but instead has increased slightly. **********Major new oil exploration efforts are occurring in developing countries. Earlier this year the Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced a major oil discovery in Colombia, for example. **********''It will be years before the large overhang of spare capacity - all of which is concentrated in OPEC - is substantially diminished,'' said William L. Randol, an analyst for the First Boston Corporation. **********Even if OPEC does cut production now and succeeds in keeping prices up because cold weather is approaching, it will still face another crisis next spring when seasonal demand begins to slacken, according to oil experts. Few see any solution for OPEC, except to realize that the oil world has changed and to adjust to it. **********''OPEC's existence will be threatened otherwise,'' said Frederick P. Leuffer, an oil analyst for C. J. Lawrence Inc."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/13/business/warning-issued-by-imf-on-the-dollar.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 506, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WARNING ISSUED BY I.M.F.

The joint annual meeting of the fund and the World Bank starts Sept. 24. **********The report also repeated earlier I.M.F. criticism of the large United States budget deficit, but went a step further by warning of some of the perils of the high dollar. **********The 203-page report noted that at around midyear, when the study was being drafted, the dollar had risen to about 15 percent above its average value for the period 1973 to 1982 in relation to the Japanese yen and the British pound. It was up 40 percent over the West German mark and nearly 50 percent over the French franc. **********In recent days the dollar has reached record levels against the pound, the franc and the Italian lira and an 11 1/2-year high against the mark. **********Impact of the Deficit **********The I.M.F. document, whose key passages are negotiated by governments and represent a consensus of the membership, said the United States budget deficit, by intensifying competition for savings, contributes to high interest rates, which in turn increases the value of the dollar. **********The Reagan Administration does not endorse this causal relationship. It argues that the dollar's popularity is spurred by low inflation, high growth of the American economy and profitability of American investments. **********The report cited the dollar's strength as ''an important factor'' contributing to the deterioration in the American trade accounts - to an estimated $130 billion merchandise trade deficit this year. **********The I.M.F. study said the trade deficit ''could have disquieting implications for the international allocation of world private saving,'' by drawing in savings to the United States from the rest of the world to finance the deficit. **********Easing of Debt Crisis **********At the same time, the international agency, which has more than $30 billion of short-term credits outstanding to more than 40 countries, said that the trade deficit had contributed to an easing of the world debt crisis. The huge American appetite for imports has spurred economic activity abroad and has especially helped many third world countries improve their cash position and pay their debts, the I.M.F. report notes. **********The I.M.F. also noted that, largely following patterns set by the United States, the average of short-term interest rates in the major industrial countries rose to 9 3/4 percent in the first half of 1984. The rates had fallen to 9 1/4 percent in the first half of 1983, from a peak of some 15 percent during 1981.  ''The recent rise in interest rates,'' the report said, ''has been strongest and most persistent in the United States, where both short-term and long-term yields in the spring of 1984 reached levels roughly two percentage points higher than in the early months of 1983.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/08/business/briefs-debt-ratings.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 411, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": " Debt Ratings", "print_headline": "BRIEFS;  Debt Ratings", "body_text": " **********Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc.  ratings of A1 on notes, debentures, and industrial revenue bonds are being reviewed for possible upgrading by Moody's Investors Service. ***********  Hospital Corp. of America ratings on senior unsecured debt and industrial revenue bonds have been raised to A1, from A2.

At its height, the four-nation force had 6,000 members. **********On Friday President Reagan announced in Washington that the American role in the multinational force had formally ended, a move that freed American marines on ships offshore for duty elsewhere.

Jean- Paul Amidi, 35 years old, a commando officer who boarded an inflatable speedboat at 5 P.M. and roared off into the Mediterranean to join his comrades on the French ship Ouragan. **********The French, Americans and Italians arrived in August 1982 to oversee the withdrawal of Palestine Liberation Organization troops. They left but returned in September after the mass slayings of civilians at the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps. In early 1983, Britain sent a small number of troops to join the contingent. **********After victories in February by anti- Government militias, the American, British and Italian troops withdrew, and President Amin Gemayel turned to Syria - the key Soviet ally in the region - for help in saving his Government and bringing about a truce. **********There were heavy casualties for the French and the Americans. The French had 89 dead and 110 wounded; the American force had 260 dead and more than 130 wounded. Most of the deaths came on a single day, last Oct. 23, when 241 Americans and 58 French troops died in suicide bomb attacks. From then on domestic pressure built in both counties to pull the troops out of Lebanon.   The French Promise **********Today, however, the French dignitaries insisted that France would continue its commitment to Lebanon. **********''With honor, you have borne testimony of France's role in this troubled region,'' said Mr. Hernu's order of the day, which was read to the assembled troops by the army's chief of staff, Gen. Jannou Lacaze. ''That role and that presense endures.'' **********''France has been here for several centuries,'' Mr. Cheysson said, speaking of France's old imperial role in Lebanon, ''and she hopes to be here several centuries more.'' **********Mr. Hernu added: ''The withdrawal of the contingent is not the departure of France.'' **********Mr. Hernu's order of the day noted that France is leaving behind 40 observers to help oversee the cease-fire here, and he said France would listen favorably to any Lebanese requests for more observers. **********The hazards Mr. Hernu and Mr. Cheysson endured to offer testimony to France's honor were brought home by occasional explosions and the sound of sporadic machine-gun fire at the demarcation line between East and West Beirut, about a half mile away. **********Although the French controled security at the port, they could not supervise the hundreds of artillery batteries around town and in the mountains that are in the hands of the militias. Just Friday several shells landed near the port.   Militias Attend Ceremony **********The ceremony was attended by the Lebanese Defense Minister, Issam Khoury, and representatives of all the warring militias except the Druse Progressive Socialist Party. A French spokesman said the Druse feared for their safety at the dock, which is in Christian territory. However, Druse representatives were expeted at a reception on the Ouragan. **********The militia representatives who were there gave each other small hugs and at one point joined hands. Mr. Hernu said their presense ''material proof of national reconciliation.'' **********After the ceremony, one French infantryman leaning against sandbags called the day's festivities ''a big ceremony for public opinion to show we're leaving with our heads high.'' **********But he said that while there were some differences between the French withdrawal and the other withdrawals, all were basically similar because the multinational force had not fulfilled its mission. **********''I regret leaving,'' he said. ''First, because I love the country and I have many friends here. Second, because we fooled a lot of people. We inflated their hopes and then let them down.'' **********But most of his comrades expressed unqualified joy at shipping out, and a transport-load of soldiers - a mass of organge life preservers - let up a cheer as they pulled away from shore. **********The troops took their mascot with them, a three-month-old dog called Grad, after the popular name here for the Soviet-made artillery rockets used by Lebanon's militias.   Reaction Is Muted **********Reaction to the French departure and to President Reagan's statement was muted. The French departure was announced in advance, and most Lebanese assumed that the American commitment ended when the marines went to their boats. **********''It's like announcing someone's death a month after he died,'' said one Arab, referring to Mr. Reagan's statement. **********Mr. Gemayel was reported today to have sent a letter to President Reagan expressing hope that the United States would continue to provide political, economic and military support. **********Nabih Berri, the Shiite Moslem leader, said today that the American withdrawal ''just removes cover for Israel.'' Mr. Berri said, ''We need a U.S. President who follows his conscience rather than electoral considerations.'' **********Beirut residents, in the meantime, seemed to express their confidence in a three-day-old cease-fire by clogging the sidewalks in the capital's shopping districts and causing traffic jams on many streets that had been emptied by fear only a few days earlier. **********By local standards, the cease-fire appeared to holding well. The higher security committee, which is headed by Mr. Gemayel and includes army and militia representatives, managed to contain a sudden outburst of artillery and mortar fire Friday around the mountain town of Suk al Gharb.

The United States has had no diplomatic relations with Iran since President Carter severed ties during the hostage crisis of 1979-81. **********At one time, Iraq and the United States were sharply antagonistic. Iraq was a leader of those countries opposed to any negotiations between Israel and Arab countries, and it was the Soviet Union's closest ally in the Middle East. But since the Iraq-Iran war started in 1980, Iraq has changed its opposition to Israel's existence, has tried to present a more moderate image to the West and has limited its ties to Moscow. **********The diplomatic interests sections of the two countries were enlarged in Washington and Baghdad, and senior American officials began visiting Iraq.

Murphy, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, who met with Mr. Aziz last week and discussed the visit, State Department officials said. **********Of more importance to Iraq than the improvement in political relations has been United States steps to make it easier for Iraq to import American- made, nonstrategic goods.

Then Walter B. Wriston, chairman of Citicorp and a close adviser of President Reagan, let Brazil know that it, too, would receive favored treatment for its sacrifices. **********At the London economic summit conference earlier this month, the leaders of the seven industrial countries endorsed these overtures to Mexico and Brazil by agreeing that ''in cases where debtor countries are themselves making successful efforts to improve their position,'' the summit countries would encourage ''more extended multiyear rescheduling of commercial debts.'' They also agreed to encourage the substitution of ''more stable long-term finance, both direct and portfolio, for short-term bank lending.'' **********After the London conference, a senior United States official, who insisted on being identified in that way, appeared to repudiate this agreement, asking who would want to acquire this ''lousy debt.'' But Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, pointedly asked how much power the senior official had to reverse United States and international policy for helping to rescue debtor countries willing to work with their creditors. **********Mr. Volcker has stressed that ''we cannot expect borrowing countries to make necessary adjustments to get their houses in order without reasonable prospects that good performance will result in continuing access to the new credit and the debt restructuring they need.'' **********The Cartagena meeting will show whether Mexico and Brazil, and probably Venezuela as well, have been convinced that they have more to gain by continuing to cooperate with their Western creditors and the I.M.F. than by forming a debtors' cartel with Argentina to threaten the lenders. **********The Westerners feel that if they have indeed separated Mexico and Brazil from the other Latin debtors, they have chopped the international debt problem down to manageable size. Those two countries alone owe more than one-half of the total Latin debt and over one-third of the debt of all developing countries. **********Despite divisions among the Latin countries on how to deal with the debt problem and further their own economic development, the presence of the foreign ministers in Cartagena could result in strong political support for Argentina. The Argentines will stress how crucial their neighbors' support is for the survival of the Alfonsin Government, with its commitment to democracy. **********The United States and other Western countries recognize that if too much pressure is put on Argentina its democratic Government could fall, dealing a severe setback to democratic trends in Latin America. There is growing recognition that what is economically required in Argentina may be politically impossible for the Government to deliver. **********The I.M.F. is refusing to be painted into a corner by rejecting the Alfonsin Government's offer of a new letter of intent, circumventing the fund's economic experts. Argentina insists that it is committed to real wage increases of 6 to 8 percent, which the fund's economists regard as likely to worsen the inflation, running at over 500 percent a year. **********The I.M.F. keeps asking for clarification, raising questions about internal consistency in Argentina's program. It is carefully avoiding any possible accusation that it is driving Argentina to the breaking point. But a breaking point could be approaching. For if the Alfonsin Government does not restore order to its economy, the inflation may accelerate and itself cause a breakdown of the society. **********However, without the support of the Peronist unions and other groups, possibly including the military, to put the economy in order, the Alfonsin Government may be driven to default, inflicting heavy losses on some major banks. **********The near-collapse of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company has made foreign depositors in American banks extremely jumpy. Though the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have said they would protect all depositors, the threat of large-scale withdrawals from abroad remains. A serious weakening of the dollar would exacerbate that risk. **********These are hazardous times. Crisis management has worked thus far, most importantly in Mexico and Brazil, and world recovery is moving, although interest rates are climbing, offsetting the favorable effects of rising trade. **********The Cartagena meeting, even though likely to produce some fiery rhetoric, does not seem likely to bring into being an aggressive debtors' cartel, a confrontation between debtors and lenders, and a wide wave of defaults. Even an Argentine default appears unlikely to tear the system apart. But it is not a prospect anyone relishes. **********For the other debtors to hold in place, they could use greater assurance that the current phase of ''muddling through'' is ending, to be replaced by policies for more stable growth, lower interest rates and the flow of new credit to countries prepared to pursue sensible economic policies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/07/business/company-briefs-134271.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 342, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Allied Corp.'s Industrial Fibers Group said it plans to expand its polyester plant in Moncure, N.C.; the move will add about 20 percent capacity. ***********  Cable Advertising Systems Inc., Austin, Tex., said it had acquired Cable Metro Advertising of Birmingham, Ala., and Cable Marketing Systems of Montgomery, Troy and Prattville, Ala.

Ministers continued to meet late in the evening in an attempt to mend their differences and agree on specifics. **********Oil trading today reflected the industry's skepticism. Prices in the so-called spot market, where oil not sold under contract is traded, and in the futures market generally closed lower. **********Comment by Chevron Trader **********''OPEC is doing nothing, and that is precisely what the market is saying,'' said J. Richard Perkins, regional trading manager for Chevron International in New York. **********Some traders accused OPEC of trying to prop up the market with rhetoric. Several of the OPEC ministers declined to grant interviews to respond to the charges. **********Nigeria prompted the emergency meeting by cutting the price of its premium oil by $2 a barrel, to $28, on Oct. 18 after price cuts for competing petroleum had been announced by Norway and Britain, which are not members of OPEC. Canada, also not a member, followed the three others last week. **********Nigeria's move was the first official break in OPEC's pricing structure since the organization set the present levels in March 1983. **********Subroto, Indonesia's oil minister and president of this conference, told reporters in an evening briefing that all the OPEC members would make some production cuts and continue them until prices firmed. **********Afterward, however, Nigerian officials reiterated the position stated Sunday by their country's oil minister, Tam David-West, that Nigeria would not cut production ''by even one barrel'' from its present 1.4 million barrels a day, which is 100,000 above the quota it has been assigned by OPEC. **********Other OPEC sources said today that cuts in output by several of the member nations would be ''token'' and ''symbolic'' and that the bulk of the reduction over all would be borne by Saudi Arabia, the organization's biggest producer. **********Subroto also said that, for the first time, OPEC would formally address problems in the group's basic pricing structure, whereby producers of high- quality light oil are hurt by greater demand for lower-quality, cheaper heavy oil. **********But analysts and other OPEC officials said that this issue would be very difficult to resolve because some producers would have to cut the price of some of their grades of oil. One of those grades, analysts said, could be OPEC's benchmark grade, Saudi Arabian Light crude. The group has pledged to defend its official price of $29 a barrel. **********In an allusion to the perennial problem of cheating, the Indonesian oil minister also declared that OPEC was trying to ''restore and strengthen discipline among member countries so decisions will be followed strictly.'' **********But discipline repeatedly has been hurt by pressures on oil ministers from their governments to continue bringing in oil revenues, on which their national economies depend. After each break in today's meeting, ministers rushed to their rooms to telephone their heads of state for guidance, according to various sources. **********These pressures were underlined when Sheik Mani Said al-Otaiba, oil minister of the United Arab Emirates and head of the market monitoring committee, suggested Sunday that his country would unilaterally cut the price of its light crude to increase flagging demand if OPEC does not solve the basic pricing problem of ''differentials.'' His widely reported comments added to the dissention in today's meeting, according to people who were there. **********There were also accusations by OPEC members that Nigeria was siding with non-OPEC producers and against the organization by cutting its price, sources at the meeting said. Nigerian officials repeated that they had to cut the price to keep their customers while waiting for OPEC to act, but other ministers were not satisfied with that answer, the sources added. **********Although all of OPEC's deliberations are conducted in secret, some details of today's session emerged from delegates and OPEC staff members. **********They said the ministers sat in an oval on sofas set up in a room created by partitioning part of the large ballroom of the Inter-Continental Hotel here. Although they spoke in English, the official OPEC language, each minister had an interpreter sitting behind him to help with difficult phrases. Coffee, tea, mineral water, orange juice and soft drinks were served. **********The meeting began with Subroto welcoming representatives of Egypt and Mexico, not members of OPEC, who are here as observers. He also welcomed new OPEC oil ministers from Ecuador and Libya. **********Sheik Otaiba then reviewed the recommendations of his market monitoring committee to cut production, bolster prices and solve the differential problem. **********Next Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, oil minister of Saudi Arabia, reviewed for about half an hour his trips to Lagos, Nigeria, and Oslo, Norway, to muster support for OPEC's aims. An hour of round-robin discussion followed. **********In the afternoon the ministers conferred privately in small groups and met jointly again about 5:30 P.M. **********Various sources who were at the meeting described its tone as cordial but the differences as often sharp. **********The conference, which is open- ended, is to continue Tuesday and perhaps for additional days to allocate production cuts and try to solve the basic pricing problem. **********Skepticism about OPEC's pledges to cut production has been mounting over the last three days amid a cascade of contradictory figures supplied by oil ministers. On Sunday night Subroto said OPEC was producing its quota of 17.5 million barrels a day. On Monday Sheik Otaiba said OPEC was producing 18 million barrels a day. **********Under today's agreement, the Saudis would be expected to cut about 1 million barrels a day from their current quota of 5 million barrels, according to OPEC sources. But Sheik Yamani said his country was already producing only 4 million barrels a day. Later the Iranian oil minister, Mohammad Gharazi, said Sheik Yamani had told him that Saudi Arabia was producing 3.5 million barrels. **********Moreover, Mr. Gharazi said Iran was producing only half of its quota of 2.4 million barrels a day. Oil traders said other OPEC nations were also producing less than their quotas. **********Mr. Perkins of Chevron said his ''intelligence in the marketplace'' agreed with the 16-million-barrels- a-day production figure. Kuwait, he said, is at least 150,000 barrels a day under its quota, and Iraq is at least 200,000 under, besides the Saudi and Iranian underproduction. **********Another oil specialist, Jay M. Amberg of Oil Buyers Guide International, a trade publication, said talks with traders today corroborated the 16- million figure. **********''They are not making any cuts - they are just trying to create a market for their oil by saying they will tighten supplies,'' said Harry Neustein, an oil trader who has been in the business more than 50 years. **********Even if OPEC does come up with a firm agreement, it is uncertain whether it can be enforced, many oil analysts said. **********''It may be a short-term rescue mission by OPEC, but it doesn't solve their longer-term problems,'' said John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. ''The market is structurally oversupplied.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/14/business/advertising-addenda.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 39, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Addenda", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Addenda", "body_text": " **********American Health magazine increasing by 23 percent its advertising rates and circulation rate base, to 800,000, from 650,000, with the July/ August issue. *********** Video Review magazine increasing its circulation rate base 30.9 percent, to 360,000, from 275,000."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/18/world/a-soviet-deserter-in-afghanistan-living-in-us-will-return.html": {"writer_name": "Phil Gailey", "pub_date": "1984-12-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 727, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A SOVIET DESERTER IN AFGHANISTAN, LIVING IN U.S., WILL RETURN", "print_headline": "A SOVIET DESERTER IN AFGHANISTAN, LIVING IN U.S., WILL RETURN", "body_text": " **********A young Soviet soldier who defected in Afghanistan 18 months ago has decided to return to the Soviet Union from the United States.

Seen as Too Close to C.I.A. **********Mr. Pastora, a former Sandinista hero who heads the insurgent Democratic Revolutionary Alliance, has resisted efforts at unity in the past on the ground that Honduran-based insurgent groups contain too many veterans of the defeated national guard in their ranks and are too closely tied to the Central Intelligence Agency. **********Mr. Pastora asserted that his bases in Costa Rica had been raided by the police, and he said he had directed his family to seek political asylum in Panama. **********A spokesman for the insurgents based here, Edgar Chamorro Coronel, said in an interview today that Honduran military leaders ''want Pastora to come here,'' and ''they feel that he is being pushed out of Costa Rica and needs a place.'' **********Mr. Pastora, however, has insisted that former guardsmen be removed from command posts before he could agree to any merger. The only former guardsman who holds a key position in the Honduran-based Nicaraguan Democratic Force is Enrique Bermudez, a former colonel.

In an interview this afternoon, he noted that he had been out of Nicaragua during the insurrection of 1978-79 and had never led combat forces against Sandinista troops.   'Ready to Make Any Sacrifice' **********''I abandoned my family and came here ready to make any sacrifice to eliminate Marxist-Leninist tyranny in my homeland,'' Mr. Bermudez said. ''I didn't come here looking for fame or publicity. How are they going to push me out?'' **********Asked if the C.I.A. and the Honduran military had sufficient power to demand his removal, Mr. Bermudez replied, ''If there are powerful forces who want to impose their will on us, they will be responsible for what happens to Nicaragua.'' **********In addition to the Democratic Force, the predominantly Indian insurgent group Misura was represented at Thursday's meeting. Its leader, Steadman Fagoth, endorsed the view expressed by the Democratic Force that Mr. Pastora would be welcome here, but only if he came without imposing conditions, according to an officer present at the session."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/23/world/around-the-world-belfast-man-arraigned-in-harrods-bombing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 137, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Belfast Man Arraigned In Harrods Bombing", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Belfast Man Arraigned In Harrods Bombing", "body_text": " **********A Northern Ireland man was arraigned under heavy guard today in the bombing of Harrods department store last Dec. 17.

The court cited a pending decision in Parliament on an amnesty for political prisoners. **********As the four men, Jacek Kuron, Adam Michnik, Zbigniew Romaszewski and Henryk Wujec, were taken back to Mokotow prison, where they have spent the last year of their two-and-a-half- year-long detention, associates emerged from the closed proceedings to tell foreign reporters what had occurred. **********They said Lieut. Col. Jan Przygodzki, the presiding judge, had adjourned the trial in view of an announcement Tuesday that Parliament would consider an amnesty proposed by the Communist-sponsored Coalition for National Unity. Parliament will meet in a special session Saturday. **********Anniversary of Communist State **********The coalition, which includes nonparty people and pro-Government Roman Catholics, asked Parliament to release political prisoners and those convicted of minor criminal offenses in connection with the 40th anniversary Sunday of the formation of the Polish People's Republic.  A statement by Interpress, a Government information agency dealing with the foreign press, later said: ''The reconvening of the trial is not certain because it is not known what the scope of the amnesty may be.'' **********According to associates of the accused, Mr. Kuron was unhappy with the decision. **********''For two and a half years, I have been working on my speech for the 40th anniversary of the People's Republic,'' he was quoted as having said. ''Never mind, it will be published anyway.'' **********Mr. Michnik, who in letters from prison had said that he would oppose an amnesty, was quoted as having said: **********''Whatever the Government does will be wrong, whether they let us go or whether they hold us.'' **********Mr. Romaszewski was said to have added, ''Yes, but it has been that way for the last year.''  Political Prisoners Put at 660 **********Jerzy Urban, the Government spokesman, in announcing plans for an amnesty, said Tuesday that there were 660 political prisoners, of whom 58 had been sentenced. **********The announcement had spurred speculation whether an amnesty would affect the four Solidarity advisers. Several people associated with the Solidarity movement, which is now banned, said that the extent of the amnesty would be signaled by what happened in court today. **********''If they go ahead with the case this morning and let Jacek testify,'' a former Solidarity official said, ''it would indicate that the powers will let the trial run its course. If there is an adjournment, it would suggest that they do not want Kuron and Michnik to use the trial as a forum and that the four could be amnestied.'' **********The trial, which opened Friday and then adjourned until today, was to have resumed with a statement by Mr. Kuron, who was expected to deliver his own indictment of the Government. Many people believe that he forced the Government to convene the trial by staging a brief hunger strike to further his demand for a hearing.   Poland Is Called Stabilized **********The Government has linked the prospective amnesty to its contention that the situation in Poland has stabilized since the social tremors of the Solidarity period of 1980-81 and the martial law that followed. **********Mr. Urban, the spokesman, said the decision to move toward an amnesty was rooted in Polish traditions and had nothing to do with the international situation. This was apparently an allusion to statements in the United States that economic sanctions against Poland might be eased if political prisoners were freed. **********The court session today differed from the earlier one in that several associates of the defendants were admitted in addition to two relatives for each man. The associates included Tadeusz Konwicki, the author of books such as ''The Polish Complex'' that have been translated around the world, and Bronislaw Geremek and Tadeusz Mazowiecki, associates of Lech Walesa, the Solidarity founder."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/10/world/strongman-finds-suriname-isn-t-easily-subdued.html": {"writer_name": "James Lemoyne", "pub_date": "1984-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1192, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STRONGMAN FINDS SURINAME ISN'T EASILY SUBDUED", "print_headline": "STRONGMAN FINDS SURINAME ISN'T EASILY SUBDUED", "body_text": " **********Lieut. Col. Desi Bouterse, a former physical education instructor who seized power here in 1980, promised recently to make the army ''the vanguard of the struggle of our people for national liberation.'' **********The colonel added that he wanted to form a new official party to serve ''the great mass of the people'' of this tiny country, a former Dutch colony of 350,000 people on the northern coast of South America that became independent in 1975. **********But despite Colonel Bouterse's plans, life in the capital has gone on much as before, with most people quietly bypassing calls to political action despite an atmosphere of intimidation created in part by informers, telephone taps and a weekday curfew from midnight to 4 A.M. **********Paramaribo is a town of porticoed Dutch colonial wooden houses punctuated by Hindu temples and mosques, side by side with Protestant Bible societies and one of the oldest synagogues in the Western Hemisphere.   A Shared Sense of Order **********The highly literate population, divided between the descendants of Asian Indians, Javanese, blacks, Chinese and Europeans, hardly seems to be revolutionary tinder. The people observe four major religions and share a Dutch-inherited sense of order and social decorum. As evidence of this, it is noteworthy that Suriname is the only country in the Latin American region where a law requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets is universally obeyed. **********Despite official criticism of the United States, American culture predominates. A late-night international flight is met by a guard of uneasy young soldiers; the baggage handler talking to the army commander wears a cap emblazoned ''I Love New York.'' **********Though the press is censored, book shops carry Time and Newsweek; the shelves offer a selection ranging from Graham Greene to George Orwell. Che Guevara, Marx and Mao are not in evidence. **********One week in December, a Paramaribo marquee promised ''Porno and Strong American Sex.'' The nearby Nas-Kip restaurant offers Kentucky- style fried chicken. The state-run television broadcasts National Basketball Association games as well as ''Sanford and Son'' and ''Dynasty'' for an audience that speaks English as well as Dutch.   Memory of Killings Persists **********A tough sense of humor helps many face the daily worry of new Government repression. A wee-hours trip to a distant nightspot - curfew is lifted Friday and Saturday nights - brought a carload of revelers face to face with a patrolling army armored personnel carrier on a narrow street. ''Traffic control Suriname style,'' the driver of the car quipped, nonchalantly swerving around the squat military vehicle. **********Sometimes the humor doesn't help. The memory of the killing in 1982 of 15 of Colonel Bouterse's political opponents dimmed Christmas celebrations in some homes in this small and close- knit community. The men were killed by Government troops and militia members in an effort to crush growing demands for a return to electoral democracy. **********The first anniversary of the deaths on Dec. 8 was by all accounts quietly observed by many and openly marked by few. The followers of a trade union leader who was shot wore black armbands. A group of friends who tried to visit the graves of the slain men was turned away by a squad drawn from the 3,000-strong army that is Colonel Bouterse's main base of support. Later the mourners were allowed to pay their respects to the dead. **********In December, the colonel was confronted by the first challenge to his rule since the killings a year earlier, a walkout by 4,000 bauxite workers. Their strike stilled the country's aluminum and bauxite works, the backbone of the economy.   New Violence Is Feared **********Though Col. Bouterse sought to negotiate an end to the dispute, people said they were deeply afraid that he might resort to violence again to cow the many opponents to his one-man rule. ''This man says he wants to be friends now,'' an auto mechanic said. ''But how are we going to shake hands with a machine gun?'' **********Over the last year, blossoming relations with Cuba brought a flood of delegations, projects and promises. The Cuban Ambassador, Osvaldo Cardenas, was described as the toast of Paramaribo. In short order, he was involved in virtually every aspect of Government business, according to Government officials and outside observers. **********But the expanding ties with Cuba were swiftly cut after the United States invasion of Grenada. The timing was a coincidence, according to Western and Latin American diplomats. Mr. Bouterse reportedly already feared the Cubans were undermining his personal authority, training a peoples' militia and giving headstrong army men and local leftist politicians too many ideas. **********On Oct. 25, the day United States Marines landed on Grenada, he expelled the Cubans, complaining in a broadcast speech of ''the increasingly unmanageable relations between the two countries.''  Listing the Cubans' Faults **********Now everyone seems to have a complaint against the Cubans. They were pushy, a Government spokesman, Sgt. Maj.  Charlo Doedel, said in an interview. The Government asked five Cubans to come to Suriname to learn Dutch; the Cubans sent 40. Mr. Cardenas, the Ambassador, distributed a calling card identifying himself as ''Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Cuba.'' This was seen by some Surinamese as more than a bit officious in a land where warbling contests between pet songbirds is a national pastime and tennis shoes are worn to church. **********A monthlong trip to Cuba was distressing, Sergeant Major Doedel said. ''I didn't like the food, I didn't like the movies with politics in everything, I didn't like standing in line all the time.'' **********''They wanted me to stay for three more weeks to see the whole island,'' he added. ''I told them no, no. I wouldn't stay for even one more day. We're not Marxists. We're Surinamers.'' **********The big question now facing many Surinamese is whether to stay or to go. Staying means political uncertainty, possible violence, certain economic hardship. But because of currency restrictions, leaving means leaving most things behind. **********Many of the country's doctors, lawyers, teachers and engineers left before the Government tightened travel regulations, and an estimated 180,000 Surinamese now live in the Netherlands. Others say they have found it less easy to drop profession and sentiment in a move abroad. **********''Everything I've worked for is here,'' one businessman said. A professional spoke of being torn between his desire to emigrate and his wish to help his country get back on its feet. **********''If I go into the Government, I have to walk over 15 bodies,'' he said. ''But we need people from outside to join in. Maybe step by step we can do something.'' **********Colonel Bouterse, who is reported to have bought his fifth house, appears determined for now to stay on, though he seldom appears in public, reportedly fearing an attempt on his life. **********''His back is a little bit against the wall,'' a Latin American diplomat here said. ''He is a sergeant who wound up running a country. It is not an easy job.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/11/business/banks-get-mexican-debt-pact.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1984-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 453, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANKS GET MEXICAN DEBT PACT", "print_headline": "BANKS GET MEXICAN DEBT PACT", "body_text": " **********Using special couriers instead of cables, Citibank yesterday began sending the proposed agreement for restructuring Mexico's foreign debt to about 550 banks around the world. **********Final agreement was reached over the weekend between Mexico and 13 leading international banks, the so- called steering committee that negotiates on behalf of all banks that have lent money to Mexico. Now it is necessary for each of the lending banks to ratify the accord. **********Because the documents were so thick, Citibank - which heads the steering group - decided to deliver them by hand. Each bank was to receive four sets of the documents and each set consisted of four documents: a message from Jesus Silva Herzog, Mexico's Finance Minister; a message from Jacques de Larosi ere, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, which will monitor Mexico's economic performance; a message from the steering banks, and a ''draft of the financing principles.'' **********Decisions Within Six Months **********A detail of the agreement attracting attention in the currency and credit markets yesterday would allow non-American banks to switch up to half their dollar-denominated loans into their own currencies. The banks would have to make their decisions within about six months. **********To avoid a serious impact on the foreign exchange markets, however, the banks are encouraged to stretch such currency shifts over several years. Under the agreement, 50 percent can be switched from dollars to other currencies if the bank agrees that the change be done over 42 months. The permissible amount drops to 40 percent if the switching is done over 30 months, and to 30 percent if it is accomplished over 24 months. **********If the switching was all done immediately, it could unsettle the foreign exchange markets, pushing up the value of the dollar. This is because Mexico, in effect, must pay off the dollar loan and substitute for it a loan denominated in the currency of the lending bank. **********New Loan Would Be Made **********This is accomplished by the bank making a new loan in its native currency to Mexico. Mexico then sells the currency to obtain dollars, which it uses to repay its dollar loan from the non-American bank. **********The eligible currencies are Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, West German marks, Dutch guilders, European currency units, Italian lire, Japanese yen, British sterling and Swiss francs. In addition, banks wanting to convert into dollars loans denominated in other currencies would be allowed to do so. **********Bankers said the concept was not new and that this had been done before. However, the move has been formalized under the latest agreement. One effect could be a substantial lowering of interest costs for Mexico, because in some countries, such as West Germany, interest rates are considerably lower than they are in the United States."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/11/business/singapore-work-rules.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Singapore Work Rules", "print_headline": "Singapore Work Rules", "body_text": " **********Singapore will refuse work permits to foreigners who earn less than 1,500 Singapore dollars a month - about $700 - or are not graduates of recognized universities, the Government said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/06/business/business-forum-hart-let-s-focus-on-growth.html": {"writer_name": "Senator Hart", "pub_date": "1984-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 827, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Series", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HART: LET'S FOCUS ON GROWTH", "print_headline": "BUSINESS FORUM; HART: LET'S FOCUS ON GROWTH", "body_text": " **********FOR a decade, the American economy has been struggling with change. The challenge facing our leadership is meeting that change and mastering it, to make this country more competitive and compassionate. **********Signs of change are everywhere. The internationalization of our marketplace, the rise of service industries and the boom in new business are creating new kinds of jobs. The increasing participation of women in the work force is dramatically altering our labor market. **********At the same time, basic industries drift into crisis. Skilled workers swell unemployment lines in an economy that still excludes millions of black, Asian and Hispanic Americans. **********Restoring a 1950's economy is not a viable policy for the 1980's. Yet that is the choice offered by the competing prescriptions of conventional politics. **********The Reagan Administration has relied on massive fiscal stimulation to generate a temporary, uneven recovery and a tight-fisted monetary policy to temper its pace. The seeds of the next recession are already sown; a bumper crop of Federal deficits stretches into the future. Tax breaks for the privileged, primarily encouraging investment in tax shelters, substitute for a coherent strategy to modernize American enterprise and retrain American workers. **********By contrast, the Democratic policies of the past, of Band-Aids and bailouts, offer merely the chance to move America back - to insulate our economy and freeze it in patterns of an earlier time. Not only will this resistance jeopardize our best prospects, it will quickly worsen our present distress. **********On balance, the wholesale revival of old programs without any plan to improve or finance them is either a false promise or an impossible policy. Trade barriers such as domestic content legislation will set off trade wars, destroying many more jobs than could possibly be saved. We cannot advance new industries or rebuild manufacturing assets with a special-interest approach that preserves a few jobs, but dooms our industrial heartland to wither and finally die. **********THE 1984 election should not be reduced to a contest between two visions of our economic past. Politicians of the past fought over how to redistribute a stagnant pie; now we must focus on making the pie grow again, while keeping that growth equitable. This will require six steps. *********** First, we must set new priorities for a fair and leaner Federal budget. We can cut $139 billion from defense over the next five years and actually improve our national security. We can cut $23 billion in energy outlays over the next 20 years, including unnecessary subsidies for nuclear power and synfuels. Reworking our health system stressing health maintenance can yield major savings. **********We should spend less in some areas, and invest more in others: $20 billion a year through 1989 in education, nutrition, job retraining and the nation's basic infrastructure - our bridges, highways and railroads. *********** Second, we must raise revenues through a fair tax system that includes partial deferral of tax indexing adjusted to protect poor and moderate-income taxpayers; a $750 cap on the third year of the Reagan tax cut, and a 5 percent surcharge on joint returns of over $100,000. I favor a 10 percent surtax on corporations, which pay a lower percentage of their earnings in income taxes than many low- income families. We must seek far- reaching reforms, close the loopholes and reward savings and investment. Cumulatively, these changes could increase revenues by $300 billion or more over the five-year period. *********** Third, we should invest selectively and effectively in programs directed at causes rather than symptoms of our economic problems. Federal investment can be a catalyst for private and public research and development. Instead of maintaining people in idleness, underemployment or underachievement, Federal policy should invest in human potential. We can establish the American Defense Education Act to strengthen our schools, and individual training accounts so workers can match their skills to an evolving economy. *********** Fourth, we must shape a strategy to modernize our keystone enterprises - steel, autos, machine tools and others. Rather than bailouts for individual companies, we must bring labor, management and capital into the White House to forge industrial modernization and growth agreements industrywide. *********** Fifth, we should move agriculture into the new economy of the 21st century. A comprehensive farm policy can build overseas markets, stabilize income at home and insure research and soil conservation. By targeting commodity assistance, we can limit agriculture outlays to $6 billion to $8 billion, while restoring prosperity to America's farm belt. *********** Sixth, we must negotiate fair and free trade agreements. The answer is not to close this nation's markets but to open international ones. Trading partners must play by the same rules - and a modernized American economy can compete with any country. **********We dare not resist change; we must harness it to America's hopes. We can't stay mired in the failing policies of Ronald Reagan or the failed policies of the previous Administration. For Democrats to win the next election, we must speak to the issues of this and the next generation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/23/business/management-may-buy-baldwin-s-mgic-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Pamela Hollie", "pub_date": "1984-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 475, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MANAGEMENT MAY BUY BALDWIN'S MGIC UNIT", "print_headline": "MANAGEMENT MAY BUY BALDWIN'S MGIC UNIT", "body_text": " **********The management of the MGIC Investment Corporation is preparing an offer to acquire the unit of the troubled Baldwin-United Corporation, a commission of insurance regulators said yesterday. **********The Special Masters Commission, a group appointed by the courts in Arkansas and Indiana, where Baldwin has six of its insurance operations, said it had requested MGIC management to present a formal proposal. MGIC is the leading mortgage insurer in the United States. **********The commission is an independent body that is trying to maximize the company's insurance opportunities. It said it would welcome other bidders but would make no recommendations as to MGIC's sale. **********Neither the commission nor the management of MGIC would comment on the plans for the acquisition of the Milwaukee-based company. There was no mention of a price. **********Ford Denies Interest **********Under pressure from regulators to generate cash, Baldwin put MGIC up for sale last September. No formal offers have been made, but it has been rumored that Ford Motor Company's credit unit has offered $900 million. But Ford has denied an interest, and John Ochotnicky, a spokesman for MGIC, said that the offer is ''just a rumor.'' The principals in the proposed deal were not identified, but they are presumed to include Max H. Karl, who founded MGIC in 1956 and is its chairman, and John McCormack, who became president of MGIC after Gerald L. Friedman resigned two years ago. Mr. Friedman opposed the merger of MGIC and Baldwin in 1982. **********Analysts say it was the purchase of MGIC for $1.2 billion that complicated Baldwin's problems, which centered on its sales of single-premium deferred annuities. The purchase saddled Baldwin with $542 million in debt. A year later Baldwin began selling assets in order to raise $500 million to pay off debts. On Sept. 26, Baldwin filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. Its total debt was $1.6 billion. **********Under its reorganization, Baldwin's management outlined a plan to sell MGIC and dozens of smaller companies. The plan ultimately envisions paring Baldwin until it consists of only six life insurance subisidaries. Those insurance operations were taken over last summer by insurance regulators in Arkansas and Indiana for ''rehabilitation''. **********The sale of all or parts of MGIC would be closely monitored by the Special Masters Commission, made up of insurance commissioners of several states. The commission's task, it said, is to obtain maximum value for Baldwin companies, maintain their insurance business under existing management and obtain additional capital from outside sources. The commission asked Goldman, Sachs & Company to continue discussions with other parties interested in either MGIC or the American Municipal Bond Assurance Corporation, MGIC's municipal bond guarantee subsidiary.  According to Victor H. Palmieri, who was hired as Baldwin's president a year ago, the sale of MGIC may not be easy. Numerous legal complications could delay the sale, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/08/business/gm-earns-1.3-billion-in-quarter.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1984-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 879, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.M.

G.M., the nation's largest auto maker, reported record earnings of $3.73 billion, compared with $962.7 million for all of 1982. **********In 1980, G.M. lost $763 million, its first deficit since the early 1920's. **********Analysts attributed the rapid improvement in the company's fortunes to restraints on the import of Japanese cars, the ending of rebates, the strong performance of its financing subsidiary and reduced labor and materials costs. **********The strong results are also likely to mean large bonuses for G.M. executives, who have gone without such incentives during the three lean years. Roger B. Smith, the chairman, could receive a bonus of $666,000 - more than his 1982 salary. (Page D4.) **********Mr. Smith reported the earnings during a speech at the National Press Club in Washington. He noted that the improved profits came on a sales unit volume that was just 10 percent greater than 1980. **********'Import Quotas Were Critical' **********''The import quotas were critical,'' said Maryann N. Keller, an auto analyst and investment manager with Vilas-Fischer Associates. ''Without the quotas, there would not be any record earnings, because the Japanese would be pursuing their usual volume-based strategy and holding down prices. Without the quotas, G.M.'s revenue per unit would have been significantly lower.'' Mrs. Keller noted that the company managed to largely withdraw its costly rebate programs last year without harming sales, effectively increasing prices. **********Mr. Smith termed 1983 as ''the turnaround year we have been working for.'' He said 1984 is expected to be another good year for G.M. **********G.M. was the first of the Big Three auto makers to report on what is expected to be a record year for the industry. Analysts have predicted that, for the year, the Ford Motor Company may earn as much as $1.8 billion and the Chrysler Corporation nearly $900 million, when they report later this month. **********G.M.'s quarterly earnings amount to $4.11 a share and compare with $145 million, or 45 cents a share, in the final quarter of 1982. For the year, the company earned $11.84 a share, compared with $3.09 a share for 1982. **********G.M.'s sales in the fourth quarter totaled $20.8 billion, a 49.6 percent increase over the $13.9 billion reported in the comparable quarter a year ago. Sales for the year were $74.58 billion, compared with $60.03 billion in 1982, an increase of 24.2 percent. Unit sales for the year totaled 7.8 million vehicles, compared with 6.2 million, an increase of 25.8 percent. **********Fewer Shares in 1978 The fourth-quarter earnings exceed the previous G.M. record of $1.26 billion set in the first quarter of 1979, and the yearly profit surpassed the old record of $3.5 billion, set in 1978. The sales total surpassed the previous mark of $66.3 billion recorded in 1979. But the per-share figure for the year was below the record $12.24 set in 1978, when fewer shares were outstanding. **********Analysts are estimating that 1984 earnings could exceed $4.5 billion for G.M., $2.2 billion for Ford and $1.5 billion for Chrysler. The American companies will continue to benefit from import restraints on Japanese cars which were extended for a fourth year until March 1985, although the quota was increased slightly to 1.8 million cars from the 1.68 million level of the previous three years. **********In his talk, Mr. Smith devoted a great deal of emphasis to the company's profit-sharing plan with the United Automobile Workers union. The $322 million generated by the plan, he said, will result in a payment of $640 to $700 for each unionized and lower- level white-collar worker. **********The profit sharing plan, he said, should motivate workers to greater effort and end resentments that profits only benefit shareholders. **********''Profit sharing puts entrepreneurship back into the free enterprise system,'' Mr. Smith declared. **********'Sweetening the Formula' **********Donald Ephlin, director of the U.A.W.'s G.M. department, described the record earnings as ''good news for workers'' and added, ''We at the U.A.W. believe it is sensible to divide the economic pie after it has been baked.'' He said the union will advocate ''sweetening the formula'' for profit sharing when talks on a new contract begin this July.  G.M.'s nonconsolidated subsidiaries, principally its General Motors Acceptance Corporation financing unit and the Motors Insurance Company, contributed almost $1 billion to the parent company's profit, earning $982.5 million in 1983, compared with $687 million in 1982 and $348.4 million in 1981. Analysts said the subsidiaries, which provide wholesale and retail financing for car purchases, benefited from the decline in interest rates on large-scale borrowing while consumer loans remained high. **********Although G.M.'s earnings were helped by accounting practices related to overseas operations, the company said its 1983 earnings were reduced by $348.4 million, or $1.35 a share, by adjustment to reflect the effect of foreign currency translations. In addition, the company said actual currency exchange operations produced a loss of $52.3 million in 1983 compared with $348.4 million in 1982."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/14/business/kaiser-steel-to-sell-its-fontana-works.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kaiser Steel to Sell Its Fontana Works", "print_headline": "Kaiser Steel to Sell Its Fontana Works", "body_text": " **********The Kaiser Steel Corporation said it had signed a letter of intent to sell its Fontana steel works to the Pacific Steel Corporation for more than $100 million. **********Kaiser said the companies are negotiating a definitive purchase agreement, which is expected to be completed in about 30 days. **********Kaiser said the purchase price would be paid over a five-year period.

'Definitely a Passenger' **********Edwina Hegna, the wife of an A.I.D. official, told The Associated Press this afternoon that State Department officials had told her they were ''99 percent sure'' that her husband, Charles, had been shot by the hijackers. Mr. Hegna, 50 years old, is based in Pakistan. **********''They came and told me that they were 99 percent sure that the first person thrown off the plane was my husband,'' Mrs. Hegna said. ''He was definitely a passenger.'' **********American intelligence officials said the hijacking appeared to be part of a continuing effort by the Party of God to win the release of 14 of its members who are in jail in Kuwait. The 14 were tried and convicted of the Dec. 12, 1983, bomb attacks on the American Embassy and French Consulate in Kuwait and other targets there. Two of the 14 have been sentenced to death. **********The Party of God has repeatedly demanded their release, and has offered to exchange them for three Americans it has been holding hostage in Lebanon since early this year. **********The three Americans are Jeremy Levin, the Middle East Bureu Chief of Cable News Network; William Buckley, the political officer at the American Embassy in Beirut, and the Rev. Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian minister who has lived in Lebanon for 20 years. All three were kidnapped in separate incidents off the streets of Beirut, and the United States believes they are being held by the Party of God in Lebanon. **********A 'Clear Link'American officials said they were persuaded that the same group was behind the current hijacking both by the similar nature of the demands and by specific intelligence. They declined to reveal the nature of the intelligence, except to say it pointed to a ''clear link,'' as one official put it, between the hijackers and the Party of God network. **********Some of the information reaching the West from the scene was provided by Michael Gurdus, an Israeli radio expert who monitors cockpit-to-ground conversations around the Middle East from his studio in Tel Aviv. **********A Gurdus tape of sounds from the interior of the aircraft was broadcast on Israeli radio today. Listeners heard a man's agonized screams and hysterical weeping as he was apparently beaten by the hijackers. The Israeli radio reported that it was the voice of a Kuwaiti who was apparently killed later. **********American officials said they had received reports of ''terrible brutality'' on board the hijacked airliner. People are being badly beaten,'' one official said. ''It is a gruesome, terrible scene.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/11/world/around-the-world-east-german-defends-talks-with-the-west.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 159, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD ; East German Defends Talks With the West", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD ; East German Defends Talks With the West", "body_text": " **********East Germany published a top-level defense of discussions with the West today, despite Soviet attacks on its efforts to improve relations with Bonn. **********Herbert Haeber, East Germany's senior expert on relations with West Germany, was quoted by the Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland as calling for a return to ''peaceful economic and political relations through dialogue.'' **********''It must be the aim of every sensible policy,'' he said, ''to stop rearmament and oppose confrontation and turn the wheel back towards disarmament and detente.'' **********His comments were published as the Soviet press resumed its attacks on closer links between the two Germanys, in what Western diplomats interpreted as an attempt to increase pressure on the East German leader, Erich Honecker, to cut back on his policies of easing tensions.

FEDER **********LINKOPING, Sweden - It is tempting to describe Saab-Scania A.B. as the ''other'' Swedish vehicle manufacturer. Volvo A.B., Scandinavia's largest industrial concern, makes more cars, trucks and buses than Saab, Sweden's sixth-largest company, and Volvo is better known in most parts of the world. **********But Saab has a long aerospace tradition and is now deep in a project that could go a long way toward wiping out any misconception that it is Volvo's kid brother. On Thursday, Saab and its partner, Fairchild Industries, a major aerospace company based in Germantown, Md., will deliver the first of what they hope will be hundreds of propeller-driven commuter and executive aircraft in the 34-seat to 45-seat range. **********The first Saab-Fairchild 340 will go to Switzerland's Crossair. Late in April, Comair, a commuter airline based in Cincinnati, is scheduled to get the first of 12 planes it has ordered. By the end of the year, Saab and Fairchild plan to deliver 24 planes, costing about $5.3 million each. Philip Morris Inc. and the Mellon Bank have signed on as the first customers for the executive version. **********New Generation of Planes **********The 340 is the first of a new generation of pressurized cabin commuter planes tailored to a market that has mushroomed in the wake of deregulation in the United States, and it is the only one being built with an American partner. **********Saab and Fairchild contend that they have a six-month lead over the 36-seat Dash Eight, being developed by state-owned De Havilland of Canada, and considerably longer over Brazilian, French-Italian and Spanish-Indonesian planes that are also under development. The worldwide market, they estimate, is for more than 2,000 aircraft in the next nine years. **********''The 340 has had the highest priority with top management,'' said Thomas Turner, president and chief executive officer of the Saab-Fairchild venture. ''Saab is very anxious to make a name in commercial aviation.'' **********But Saab is also working hard on the introduction of an antiship missile this year and the development of a multicapability combat aircraft, the Gripen, which is scheduled to go into production in 1992. Saab's concentration on aerospace is coming after a decade of dependence on trucks and cars for the overwhelming proportion of its profits and sales. **********Last year, despite a 5 percent decline in its truck, bus and engine sales, the Scania division accounted for 45 percent of Saab's $2.7 billion in sales and just over half of its $263 million pretax profit. The Saab car division provided an additional 40 percent of the revenue and a like share of pretax profits. **********Handicaps for Swedish Company **********Saab was founded through mergers of several companies in 1937 when the Swedish Government, worried about defense, wanted to create a military aircraft industry. Ever since, Saab's aerospace division has been preoccupied with military aircraft sold to Sweden and a handful of other nonaligned nations. **********Saab's problem is that the military market is a stifling one for a manufacturer in a country that has limited domestic needs, tight controls for deciding which nations are acceptable buyers and little weight to throw around in the world of international arms sales. **********Moreover, while Saab confidently describes its current flagship, the Viggen, as an all-weather combat plane comparable to the McDonnell Douglas F-15, the ony Saab ever tested in combat was a vastly different J-29 ''Fighting Barrel,'' which supported United Nations troops in the Congo in 1959. **********Direction Changed in 1979 **********In 1979, though, the Swedish Government scrapped a Saab proposal for a night attack and trainer jet and dropped hints that it would be happy to see the company enter the civil aviation field. Saab executives found themselves pushed in a direction they had been considering on their own. Almost 30 years in the car business and the 1969 merger with the truck maker Scania gave them a strong base to finance the investment. **********But Saab was wary. The company had developed a slightly smaller passenger aircraft than the 340 in the late 1940's, and it sold poorly. Before improvements could be made, the company was forced out of the civil field by Government demands that it concentrate on a new generation of military craft. **********This time, Saab wanted to enter the civil field to stay and it looked for a partner. ''We wanted risk-sharing and we wanted access to the markets,'' said George Karnsund, Saab's president. It found both in Fairchild, which had already developed the 19- seat Metro and was working on initial designs for a 30-seat plane. **********Partnership Seems Amicable **********By all accounts, the partnership has been a happy one. Fairchild makes the wings, engine housing and tail at its Farmingdale, L.I., factory, and Saab is responsible for the fuselage, the assembly of subsystems and the flight testing. The first 340 flew just three years from the time the project was announced. **********Whether the project will succeed commercially is not so clear. **********Saab executives say that each partner will invest roughly $130 million through the first production and that 200 planes must be sold to break even. The venture has 100 orders and options it considers firm, but that represents an increase of just 10 percent on figures reported in June 1981. **********In addition to its competitors in new pressurized planes, the partners have to worry about Short Brothers, a British state-owned company in Northern Ireland. It has been in the market for well over a year with a nonpressurized, but less expensive, 36-seat plane that is adequate for many of the runs on which commuter airlines and companies might use the 340."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/03/business/finance-new-issues-mobil-offering.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mobil Offering", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Mobil Offering", "body_text": " **********The Mobil Corporation said yesterday that it had filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale of $2.5 billion of debentures due in 2004. **********A portion of the debentures is expected to be offered along with an unspecified amount of cash, for up to 36 million shares, or 28.3 percent, of the Superior Oil Company.

More than 100 acres have been carved into fish-breeding ponds. **********The farm, which is using an irrigation system developed 15 years ago at a kibbutz in Israel, is regarded here as a technological wonder, producing 50 to 75 percent higher yields than Jamaican experts had anticipated. **********It is all the work of as many as 1,600 Jamaican laborers working for daily wages and a group of 32 Israeli agricultural experts. **********Japanese and Americans, Too **********The involvement of the Israelis is part of an effort by Prime Minister Edward P. G. Seaga to attract enough foreign investment and technology to put more than 237,000 acres of idle or under-used land into cultivation. **********Besides the Israelis, Japanese farmers are here growing Jamaica's renowned Blue Mountain coffee, Americans are growing rice and bananas, and Englishmen are tending honeybees. **********Mr. Seaga has said most of the foreign farms, includng the Israeli project, are supposed to serve as ''mother farms'' that will provide technology and marketing assistance to neighboring Jamaican farmers, most of whom are working on plots of 10 acres or less. **********At present, more than 62,000 acres in Jamaica are being worked with varying degrees of foreign involvement and a total of about 25,000 Jamaican laborers. There are 18 projects in which foreigners are directly involved.   Seedlings for Jamaicans **********Eli Tisona, managing director of the project involving the Israelis, says he is planning to give seedlings and lend technicians to 100 Jamaican farmers this winter. He plans to buy their crops at guaranteed prices and ship them through his big packing house. **********One of the main aims of the Prime Minister's farm program is to produce vegetables and other crops for sale in the United States and Europe to earn foreign currency, badly needed in Jamaica. Another is to grow rice and other staples for local consumption so that imports of food, which now run to more than $100 million a year, can be reduced. **********The farm program is part of an overall plan to diversify Jamaica's economy, which for the last 20 years has focused on the bauxite mining industry. **********When Mr. Seaga took office in 1980, he said he found the country was nearly bankrupt. The country was spending much more than it was earning and, to make matters worse, a slump in world demand drastically reduced income from bauxite.   A Neglected Industry **********Agriculture was clearly an area where the country could do better. Production of sugar and bananas, traditionally two of its main crops, had fallen to record lows. While money poured in from bauxite, the fields had been neglected. They had also been battered by storms. In the 1960's Jamaica was selling about 300,000 tons of bananas a year. Last year the country exported 23,000 tons, even though it had a standing offer from Britain to take 150,000 tons. **********Vegetables like tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, which are in demand in New York, London, Paris and other temperate-zone capitals during the winter and can be grown here year- round, had never been produced on a large scale for export. Over the years, rice fields had been abandoned, and imports gradually increased. **********In the spring of 1982, Mr. Tisona recalled, he was in Florida visiting friends. He had made a fortune selling fast-food hamburgers and hamburger- chain franchises in Israel and was looking for a place to invest his money. He was watching television one evening when pictures of President Reagan on a visit to Jamaica came on the screen.   'Never Seen Anything Like That' **********''Everything was so green,'' Mr. Tisona recalled the other day. ''I'd never seen anything like that in Israel. They said Jamaica was looking for foreign investment in agriculture. So I came here to see the Prime Minister.'' **********By October Mr. Tisona had entered into a partnership with the Jamaican Government and was breaking ground as the first foreign investor in Mr. Seaga's new farm program. Mr. Tisona knew nothing about farming, he said, but he hired two experts from the Hazerim kibbutz near the Negev to direct local workers. **********''My business is putting together everything they need to work,'' Mr. Tisona said. ''You have thousands of things to do here besides growing.'' **********October was late to be aiming for the winter market in New York, so Mr. Tisona speeded the growing process by shipping in seedlings from Miami. When word came that a freeze had damaged Florida crops, he planted 50 additional acres, increasing his project to 200 acres. **********In mid-January he was sending peppers and tomatoes to the Hunts Point Market in the Bronx. **********''Because of the bad weather in Florida, we were almost alone in the market,'' Mr. Tisona said. ''They were paying us $29 for a 25-pound box. Normally the price is $12 to $13.''  And Then It Rained **********With such success, he put in several hundred more acres of vegetables and started on the fish ponds. But in the midst of the harvest this year, the farm was hit by the heaviest rains in 25 years. ''It was a disaster,'' Mr. Tisona said. **********Apart from the rain, however, the farm has gone well, and he said he had no intention of turning back. **********With the special irrigation system, a ''drip'' technique developed at the Gavat kibbutz near Haifa, a narrow polyethylene hose studded with little nozzles is stretched the length of the seed beds with a separate nozzle directed at the roots of each plant.  On a schedule controlled by mini-computers, water and fertilizers are fed to the plants from central pumping stations. **********''With the drip system we can push much more fertilizer to the plants, and this allows many more plants per acre,'' Mr. Tisona said. ''Also the surface of the soil stays dry, so it is difficult for insects and disease to develop.''  Israelis Designed Farm **********Israeli engineers laid out the entire farm, taking maximum advantage of topographic features, Mr. Tisona said. To shelter a seedling nursery and fields for carnations and other flowers, they cut into the side of a low ridge, a natural windbreak. They put the fish ponds on high ground so that drainage from them would flow by gravity to the vegetable fields. **********''We don't waste one gallon of water,'' Mr. Tisona said. **********The ponds are aswarm with five varieties of fish and some huge shrimp. **********''We're stocking at seven times the density of most fish farms,'' said Roy Manning of St. Albans, Queens, who has a master's degree from Auburn University and is one of five American aquaculturists working on the farm.   Packing by Computers **********An acre and a half of the farm is occupied by a computerized packing house that Mr. Tisona says is the largest in the Caribbean and one of the most advanced in the world.  At the flick of a switch, fruit and vegetables are sorted according to color and size, washed, dried, waxed and packaged. The packing house was designed and built at the Eilow kibbutz in the western Galilee at a cost of $2 million, shipped to Jamaica and assembled in one month by a dozen Israelis and 25 Jamaicans. **********Mr. Tisona has been working this month with an Israeli produce-marketing cooperative based in London, trying to line up enough cargo jets to handle the coming crop. Most of the fruit and vegetables, Mr. Tisona said, will be sold in Europe, with some going to Baltimore and possibly Atlanta. He said he hoped to avoid New York. **********''The brokers in New York are very tough to deal with,'' he said. ''They try to find excuses to reduce your price. Last year I sent two containers of melons on the same day to New York and Baltimore. In New York they paid us $5 a box. In Baltimore we got $11. In New York they had thousands of excuses, not one broker but all the way through. So we decided not to touch this market.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/13/business/advertising-wells-rich-expands-its-executive-ranks.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-11-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wells, Rich Expands Its Executive Ranks", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Wells, Rich Expands Its Executive Ranks", "body_text": " **********Wells, Rich, Greene/East, because of what it describes as explosive growth, has named four executive vice presidents and plans to add another to the list before the year ends. **********Three will be in the creative department as the result of a decision by Charles Moss, vice chairman and corporate creative director, to step back from the daily running of that department. **********Already named are William M.

And there are steps individuals can take to bail out of an annuity contract with minimum financial loss if the policy appears endangered by a company's deteriorating financial condition. **********The Charter reorganization filing mainly involves its oil refinery operations. The bankruptcy action does not include Charter's insurance subsidiaries, which sold $4.6 billion in deferred annuity policies to about 175,000 people. **********Charter's insurance business had been suffering from a surge of policy redemptions in the wake of the company's overall difficulties and the experience of Baldwin-United policyholders, who still do not know exactly how much their policies will pay out. But Charter officials and state insurance regulators say the insurance units are financially sound and their assets secure and untouchable by the bankruptcy proceedings. **********'We Could Pay Off Everybody' **********''The strongest statement we can make about our financial condition is our ability to pay each and every policyholder in full if necessary,'' Thomas E. Gibbs, chief operating officer of Charter's insurance subsidiary, Charter Security Life, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''If they all walked in the door tomorrow, we could pay off everybody and still have substantial funds left and we would realize significant additional profits at their expense'' due to withdrawal penalties. **********Terence Lennon, chief of the Life Insurance & Companies Bureau of the New York State Insurance Department, said Charter Security Life's New York subsidiary has a ''good portfolio and will be able to meet their obligations.'' **********He stressed that the Charter situation was not comparable with Baldwin, which had 20 percent of its insurance portfolio invested in Baldwin-related companies. **********Mr. Gibbs said that only one-half of 1 percent of Charter Security's portfolio consists of unsecured obligations of the parent company. **********An Insurance Best Seller **********Offering investors the opportunity to earn high interest rates on a lump- sum payment and have taxes on the earnings deferred until the money is withdrawn, usually at retirement, the single-premium deferred annuity became one of the best-selling insurance products in years. **********Despite the recently tarnished image of the product, many financial advisers believe deferred annuities can be profitable investments. But as policyholders have learned while watching state regulators ''rehabilitate'' the Baldwin-United insurance funds, the investment is only as sound as the company that issues the policy. **********Determining how sound a given policy is can be a difficult task, as evidenced by the failure of many state insurance regulators and investment brokers to see trouble looming early enough at Baldwin-United. Independent research is recommended nonetheless. **********Joseph M. Belth, an insurance professor at Indiana University, recommends not buying from a company unless it has an Ax rating from the A. M. Best Company, which publishes ''Best's Insurance Reports - Life/ Health,'' an independent rating guide available in most public libraries. Further, he suggests, the company should have been awarded the top rating for 10 consecutive years. **********Mr. Belth counted 112 companies that fit the criteria. Neither Baldwin nor Charter was on his list. Charter of New York has a Bx rating; the New Jersey subsidiary has an Ax rating. **********State protection of policyholders varies widely. A number of states, including New York, administer industry-funded guaranty pools to reimburse holders if other remedies fail. **********Withdrawal Penalties **********James A. Barry Jr., chief executive officer of the Barry Financial Group, a Boca Raton, Fla., financial planning firm, said he would sacrifice withdrawal penalties imposed by the company, which can run up to 7 percent, and immediately pull his annuity money as soon as he saw financial problems developing at an issuing company. **********Normally, an individual withdrawing annuity funds also would be subject to tax on the accumulated interest, plus a 5 percent tax penalty if under age 59 1/2 and the policy is less than 10 years old. But Mr. Barry said an individual could avoid any tax consequences by immediately transferring the money to a similar annuity policy with another company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/19/world/a-tale-of-londonderry-a-city-with-two-names.html": {"writer_name": "Jo Thomas", "pub_date": "1984-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A TALE OF LONDONDERRY, A CITY WITH TWO NAMES", "print_headline": "A TALE OF LONDONDERRY, A CITY WITH TWO NAMES", "body_text": " **********This is a city so divided that it is not even possible to mention its name without choosing sides. **********Protestant loyalists call it Londonderry, and so it is called on maps.

Outsiders find themselves awkwardly saying both names, calling the place Londonderry-Derry, or vice versa. **********On a hillside on the east bank of the River Foyle, in an area known as the Waterside, there are two housing projects, one Catholic and one Protestant, divided by a small patch of green and years of conflict. Houses on the dividing line have wire mesh over their windows to keep the bricks and firebombs out.

But the bitterness, the divisiveness and the potential for extreme violence remain.   2 Premiers Meeting **********It is with great hopes of eventually ending that conflict that Garret FitzGerald, the Irish Prime Minister, and Margaret Thatcher, the British Prime Minister, are meeting Sunday and Monday for a conference on Northern Ireland. Last summer, after a firebombing incident in the Waterside district, some residents urged local politicians to promote the building of a wall between the Catholic homes in Gobnascale and the Protestant homes in the Irish Street area down the hill. Such walls have been built in Belfast and elsewhere to reduce the violence between opposing factions. **********But when word got out that a wall had been suggested, the residents of both the Irish Street and Gobnascale areas met and decided it would just make things worse. **********''I was approached by some of the Protestants about would we be interested in getting people together,'' said Bob Concannon, a Catholic who lived in a house facing the Protestant neighborhood until a hooded gunman was surprised by Mr. Concannon's daughter and fired six shots at her after she dived for cover under her car. The house is now bricked up, and the letters U.V.F., for the Protestant paramiliary Ulter Volunteer Force, painted on the side have been crudely and somewhat ironically repainted L.O.V.E.   The 'Flashpoint' Area **********''When we had our first meeting, everybody wanted a wall,'' Mr. Concannon said. ''We could have built nine walls. Then we had another meeting and said: 'We are divided. Would it not be a good idea to forget our differences?' And everyone started talking about peace.'' **********He added: ''We intend to have further meetings. But since the meetings we have had no violence at all.'' **********Albert and Edna McKechnie are Protestants. They live in what is called the ''flashpoint area.'' Their house is closest to the Protestant section of the city and is shuttered with reinforced wire mesh. **********There are times when the family is awake with anxiety until 5 o'clock in the morning, when they call the police and they don't arrive until the fighting is under way, when she thinks, ''Maybe the wall would be good,'' Mrs. McKechnie said. **********''The community's divided enough,'' said Raymond Philson, 44, who has lived in a row house on the Catholic side all his life. ''By putting up a wall you'll be dividing it more.''  'There's Nothing You Can Do' **********He put reinforced wire mesh on the rear of the house 16 years ago, and it is still there. ''The Irish Street people get the front, we get the back,'' he said. ''My kids have been born and reared with the troubles - petrol bombs, stone-throwing.'' **********''There are good people and bad people down there and up here. You live with it. There's nothing you can do. The politicians are not doing nothing. The kids know nothing but Catholic and Protestant. They hear their brothers and sisters.'' **********''This business of Protestant and Catholic is nonsense,'' said Mrs. McKechnie. ''There's no work. They're sleeping all day, and they're up all night. They're bored. It's more or less an amusement.'' **********''It's worrying,'' she added. ''If my two sons grow up, I'll push them in the army.'' **********''There is a struggle going on,'' Mr. Concannon said, ''and it is for the youth. What we need here are jobs.'' Mr. Concannon, who is unemployed, often tries to help families whose children are in trouble with the law. **********''If you talk to the youth,'' he added, ''the majority have an anger.   Relations at a Low Point **********''You see the poor wee fellows here,'' Mrs. Concannon agreed. ''They have no life. They can't talk on the corner at night. The police are on them.'' **********Although the level of violence is the lowest in years, Gobnascale is still regarded by the police as ''an extremely dangerous area,'' according to Chief Inspector Roy McCune. Patrolmen who go into the neighborhood do so under army guard. **********Relations between the police and residents of Catholic neighborhoods in this city with two names have deteriorated to the point that The Derry Journal said in editorial today that ''The city is no longer policed but garrisoned.'' **********Nonentheless, it was through police- community relations meetings that Mr. McKechnie and Mr. Concannon first met. **********''I don't talk about wall-building, I talk about bridge-building,'' said Inspector McCune, who also opposed building a wall but conceded that ''if the police are promoting something, it can fail.'' **********''Politics,'' said a young Catholic mother whose children have watched the world through wire mesh since they were born.

Such legislation is not sent to the President for his signature and is not binding. **********President Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz have said that the Administration would not move the embassy from Tel Aviv, and they have strongly suggested that Mr. Reagan would veto the current bill if it is adopted by Congress. **********Supporters of the bill said their plan now was not to alter the wording, but rather to leave the legislation as it stands pending hearings starting next week by two subcommittees of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and at the end of the month by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. **********''There's no hurry,'' a House co-sponsor of the legislation said. ''Let's give everyone a chance to be heard on the issue, and then we can speak to the Administration and see what kind of language would be most suitable.''  Originated by Moynihan **********Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who originated the legislation, so far has 38 co-sponsors in the Senate. He said last week that, with the prospect of a Presidential veto, there would have to be consideration of the sense-of-the-Congress approach. **********Several others who back the bill, such as Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, have said they wanted to avoid a fight with the Administration and saw no point in bringing the current bill to a vote now. **********The issue is a difficult one for the Israel lobby in Congress, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Some members of the group have been privately critical of Mr. Moynihan for introducing the bill without consulting them, then later asking for their support. Mr. Moynihan, in turn, has been upset because Administration officials discussed the Jerusalem bill with the lobbying group and not with him directly. **********The Israel lobby is usually more interested in such issues as obtaining as much foreign aid for Israel as possible and in blocking arms sales to Arab countries not at peace with Israel. In both these areas, the group has recorded major successes in recent weeks. Both the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committees have substantially raised the amount of economic aid for Israel in the 1985 fiscal year. **********The Administration had originally sought $850 million in economic grants for Israel, in addition to $1.4 billion in military grants. The House committee raised the economic figure to $1.1 billion and the Senate group increased it to $1.2 billion. **********In the current 1984 fiscal year, Israel is receiving $910 million in economic grants and $1.7 billion in military aid. But while the $1.4 billion in military aid for 1985 is all grants that do not have to be repaid, the 1984 figure of $1.7 billion includes $850 million in loans that must be paid back. **********Under pressure from Israeli supporters, the Administration dropped plans to sell Jordan and Saudi Arabia advanced Stinger antiaircraft missiles. Remarks by King Hussein of Jordan, critical of the United States, contributed to the Administration's decision not to press the issue with Congress. **********There are 215 co-sponsors of the Jerusalem bill in the House. The legislation, as currently drafted, ''requires'' the embassy building and the ambassador's residence to be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem ''hereafter.'' **********Since the bill does not set a specific date and does not include any penalty if the embassy is not moved, such as a cut in funds for the embassy in Tel Aviv, some backers of the current bill have said that it was already ''nonbinding'' on the Administration and could be approved and signed by the President. **********But the Administration wants to head off a vote because of concern that such a move, even if the President vetoed it or refused to move the embassy, would be misinterpreted abroad and could touch off anti-American actions throughout the Moslem world.   Arab Group to Increase Efforts **********David J. Sadd, executive director of the National Association of Arab Americans, said at a news conference this afternoon that his group's lobbying against moving the embassy to Jerusalem had resulted in a shift of Congressional sentiment toward the nonbinding resolution. **********''We will now accelerate our efforts to block even a nonbinding Congressional resolution,'' he said. ''It would undermine America's interests for the Congress to lend its moral authority to illegal Israeli claims on Jerusalem.'' Israel contends that Jerusalem, including the eastern part captured from Jordan, is its undivided capital. **********The issue has been dramatized by statements by two Democratic Presidential contenders, Walter F. Mondale and Gary Hart, that if elected they would move the embassy to Jerusalem. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the other Democratic contender for the nomination, has opposed such a move, as has Mr. Reagan. **********Many members of Congress have said they hoped the bill did not come to a vote or was not adopted. But they said that publicly they would support the legislation. **********The Senate Majority Leader, Howard H. Baker Jr., has been urging Republicans not to support the Moynihan bill. Some senators have said they would support the bill if it is a sense-of- the-Congress resolution, because they do not think Congress has the right to compel the President to establish an embassy in a particular place.   The President's Prerogative **********The Administration has asserted that it is the President's prerogative to decide when to recognize a country and where to place the embassy. But, in practice, Congress controls the funds necessary to run an embassy. **********The main argument given by those favoring the shift to Jerusalem is that Jerusalem is Israel's capital and Israel is the only country with diplomatic relations with the United States in which the embassy is in a place other than the host government desires. Moreover, they have said that not to move the embassy would demonstrate lack of support for Israel and only encourage Israel's enemies to think they could drive a wedge between Israel and the United States. **********All Presidents since 1949 have refused to put the embassy in Jerusalem. They have held that the status of the city should be decided by negotiations between Israel and Arab countries and that to move the embassy would seem to prejudge the negotiations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/05/business/the-economy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 645, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Economy", "print_headline": "The Economy", "body_text": " **********President Reagan completed his decisions on spending cuts in domestic programs for his 1986 budget, leaving him to decide whether to cut the military budget.

Similar protests arose over previous plans to offer electronic Yellow Pages, and the Bell operating companies are prohibited from offering electronic information services by the consent decree that split them from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. **********Among the potential new directory assistance services, one would be the reverse of traditional directory assistance.

The biggest users are law enforcement agencies and credit-checking bureaus, although consumers use it for such things as getting addresses for Christmas card lists, according to phone industry officials. **********Under a a variation on this service, the caller would give the operator the address and receive back the name and number of the person there. Printed directories containing such information are available in many cities, but this service would put such information within reach of the general public. Southwestern Bell has done a survey to see if there is a market for such a service in Texas and has already stirred up a protest. **********''This has too much potential for abuse,'' said James C. Harrington, legal director of the Texas American Civil Liberties Union. Southwestern Bell, which serves Texas, has done a survey to see whether there would be a market for such a service. He said, for instance, that a burglar staking out a house could obtain the telephone number and call to see if anyone were home. **********Another service would allow customers to connect their own computers to the phone company computers to obtain listings without having to ask the operator. In theory, this would allow those with home computers to look up numbers by connecting to the phone company computer. At first, however, such a service is likely to be offered to large organizations like the Internal Revenue Service and law enforcement agencies. **********Telephone companies with surplus computer capacity might also allow customers to keep their internal phone lists on the phone company computer. The University of Nebraska keeps its listings on Lincoln Telephone Company computers. **********Other such services might include these: **********- Dial-up Yellow Pages: Pacific Northwest Bell recently started a service in which callers can get Yellow Pages-type information for $1.55 a call. A caller, for instance, might request the names of hotels in a particular town that are on the beach and that accept a particular credit card. **********- Other data bases: Phone company operators could offer other information in addition to listings. Pacific Northwest Bell, for instance, offers ZIP codes over the phone. And some newspaper publishers may be considering joint ventures with the local telephone companies to offer such things as classified ad information over the phone. **********- Specialized lists: Phone companies may sell lists of names to businesses that want to do solicitations. The phone companies could, for instance, provide lists of newcomers to a city. **********- Advertising: Computers that now give out the numbers in electronic voices could be programmed to deliver advertising messages as well. A caller requesting the number for Joe's Deli, for instance, might also hear a message such as, ''We have a special on pickles today.'' **********- Rent-an-operator: In addition to exploiting their data bases, the phone companies are considering making extra money from their operators. Some think operators could be used to dial wake-up calls, to place periodic calls to check up on elderly people, or to conduct opinion polls. Various Bell operating companies have talked to the MCI Communications Corporation about providing operators for MCI, which might want to offer operator services to better compete with A.T.&T. in the long-distance business. **********Also likely is a general rise in directory assistance charges. A.T.&T. last year proposed to charge 75 cents for interstate directory assistance calls, which are now free. The proposed charge has been reduced to 50 cents but has been delayed, along with telephone access charges."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/03/world/around-the-world-sudanese-rebels-seize-chevron-oil-installation.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sudanese Rebels Seize Chevron Oil Installation", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Sudanese Rebels Seize Chevron Oil Installation", "body_text": " **********Secessionist guerrillas overran the American-operated Chevron Oil Company complex at Bentiu in the southern Sudan today, killing three foreign workers and wounding at least seven others, Western diplomats said. **********One American was slightly wounded in the attack.
