The General Housewares Corporation, a 15-year-old producer of cookware and table-top giftware, has done just that. By catering to the new interest in home entertaining, General Housewares has achieved one of the best earnings performances in the nonelectric segment of the housewares industry. **********''Consumers are spending more dollars in the home,'' observed John H. Muller Jr., chairman and president of General Housewares, which has its headquarters in Stamford, Conn. Company's Outlook for 1982 **********Since 1978 General Housewares has been exceeding its goal of a 20 percent annual rise in earnings and a 15 percent rise in sales. Last year, despite the nation's weak economy, the company had a 29 percent jump in net income, to $3.35 million, or $1.55 a share, from 1980's $2.58 million, or $1.20 a share. Its sales in 1981 rose 18 percent, to $73 million, from $62 million. **********Although the trend slowed in this year's first quarter, General Housewares still had a 14 percent profit gain on a 9 percent sales rise. In an interview, Mr. Muller said he believes that, despite a difficult second quarter, the company can do well enough in the last half to again reach its performance goal for the whole year. **********Jerome H. Kaplan, senior analyst for the Value Line Investment Survey, said that when big-ticket consumer items slow down, General Housewares' lines tend to perk up. ''During tough economic times,'' he said, ''people do more home entertaining, using lines like General Housewares' instead of spending for nights on the town. We expect the company to have another good performance in 1982.'' Pattern of Growth Is Seen **********''The company promises consistent growth in certain segments of the housewares industry,'' commented Henry L. Jicha Jr., vice president, research, for Bache Halsey Stuart Shields in New York. ''I see the possibility of a 10 percent decline in General Housewares' earnings in the second quarter because they are up against high increases last year, although I expect them to make it up in the third quarter.'' **********General Housewares was founded in 1967 when Mr. Muller, who had experience in both retailing and manufacturing, put $50,000 of his own money into a $1.5 million public stock offering. The new enterprise started out by buying a small Minnesota producer of ladders and ironing boards. **********After changing the name to General Housewares, the company eventually acquired nine other companies making complementary products, and it still owns five of them. The retained companies have been consolidated into General Housewares' two primary groups - cookware and tabletop giftware - operating a total of seven plants in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Ohio and Indiana. The cookware group is based in Terre Haute, Ind., and the table-top and giftware group is based in Hyannis, Mass. Some of Acquired Concerns **********The companies that were acquired included the Wagner Manufacturing Company, a cookware producer in Sidney, Ohio, and the Holt Howard Company, an importer of kitchen ceramics in Stamford. **********Three furniture companies, acquired along the way, were sold in 1980 so General Housewares could focus on its two major businesses.  The furniture concerns were Plantation Patterns, Birmingham; the Vogue Rattan Company, Lexington, Ky., and the Durham Manufacturing Company, Muncie, Ind. **********The aim of General Housewares, as Mr. Muller put it, has been to ''take fairly small businesses and, by providing professional management and the leverage of larger scale, make them more profitable.'' **********Upon each acquisition, the products and markets of the new business were closely studied to see if a new approach was necessary.  When the Colonial Candle Company was bought a decade ago, Mr.  Muller said, it was making a ''quality product sold primarily to candle and gift stores,'' and it was almost bankrupt. Product Changes Introduced **********''We exploded the color range and changed the colors every year, about one-third of the candle line annually,'' Mr. Muller said.  ''Bright shades have been replaced by muted or sherbet colors. We also shifted to a molded candle, which involves pouring wax into a mold rather than the usual way of hand-dipping.'' **********Colonial was in financial difficulties, Mr. Muller said, mainly because it had priced its products too low and aimed them at too narrow a market. The line has been widened, and department stores and retail chains are now major outlets. Candle sales, which were $6.5 million 10 years ago, have grown to more than $20 million, ''and Colonial is making money,'' Mr. Muller said. **********At the Columbian Enameling and Stamping Company, a Terre Haute concern acquired in 1968, heavier and smoother metals providing a more porcelain-like finish were introduced to replace the company's traditional enamel pots. New colors and a bulged shape were also added. **********Although his company has done well, Mr. Muller insists that acquisitions alone cannot assure success. ''You have to play all the keys,'' he said. ''Things are tougher today.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/19/business/omark-industries-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OMARK INDUSTRIES reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "OMARK INDUSTRIES reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/17/business/2-thrift-units-are-acquired.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 Thrift Units Are Acquired", "print_headline": "2 Thrift Units Are Acquired", "body_text": " **********Empire of America, a federally chartered savings and loan association, has acquired two Long Island-based savings and loans, it was announced today. **********Empire, formerly the Erie Savings Bank, said it had obtained Island Federal Savings and Loan of Hempstead and South Shore Federal Savings and Loan of Massapequa. **********Island Federal Savings and Loan has seven offices and $276 million in assets and South Shore Federal Savings and Loan has eight offices and assets totaling $358 million. **********The acquisitions will give Empire assets of $5.4 billion and 93 offices in four states."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/23/business/stecher-traung-schmidt-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STECHER-TRAUNG-SCHMIDT CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "STECHER-TRAUNG-SCHMIDT CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/22/business/union-metal-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNION METAL CO reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "UNION METAL CO reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/23/business/seagate-technology-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/29/business/oglebay-norton-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OGLEBAY NORTON CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "OGLEBAY NORTON CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/02/business/executive-changes-161970.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 463, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** American Broadcasting Companies has appointed Richard L.

Asked for his views on the future, he replied: ''We will have to wait. We hope the Israelis won't do the same as the other armies who came to give us hope for peace. Our hopes were disappointed.'' His retainers nodded assent while clicking their worry beads. **********The Prince commands the loyalty of about half the Lebanese members of the Druse religion, an offshoot of Islam. He said that after the Israelis had driven the last of the Palestinians and Syrians from all of Lebanon, power should be given to a strong Lebanese military under the command of a strong president. **********''If all the foreigners are out of Lebanon, in less than a day, in two hours, the Lebanese will manage themselves,'' Prince Feisal said. ''Outsiders are Lebanon's disease.'' **********Israeli officers who took part in the leisurely discussion involving members of various rightist Lebanese factions kept smiling. But the Prince and his advisers said they did not know how long Israeli troops should stay to assure stability. ''That depends,'' he said. **********Asked why Lebanese who wanted the ouster of Palestinians and Syrians from their country were relying on the Israeli Army to do the work, the Prince shrugged. 'You Can't Imagine Our Shame' **********But the Rev. Joseph Touames, a prominent member of the Maronite Church, Lebanon's largest Christian group, responded vehemently, ''Because the Palestinians have robbed our army of its dignity.'' **********The bearded priest, who teaches anthropology at the Maronite University at Kaslik, added, ''You can't imagine our shame to have this Arab cancer imposed on us.'' **********Many Christian intellectuals differentiate between the Lebanese, Moslems as well as Christians, and the Arabs. None do so with more fervor than a group led by two widely published and resepected poets, Said Akl and May Murr, who consider the people of Lebanon descendants of the ancient Phoenicians. 4,000 Christian Fighters **********Their movement has an armed faction known as the Guards of the Cedars. Mr. Akl, the leader of the force, said he had 4,000 fighters under his command. **********The Guards have recently discovered a sense of kinship with Israel. Mrs. Murr was interviewed this morning just before she left for Israel. **********On her first visit to Israel last week, she met with Prime Minister Menachem Begin for 45 minutes. An informed Israeli source said the Begin Government would sponsor a tour of Europe by Mrs. Murr during which she will expound her views. **********''Israel and Lebanon are two twins of civilization, to which the world owes almost the entirety of its civilization,'' said the 52-year-old poet, who teaches history at Lebanese University and the Lebanese Military Academy. A 'Salvation Operation' **********She said she had told her cadet students that the coming of the Israeli Army was not an invasion but a ''salvation operation.'' The future officers aplauded, she said. **********Mr. Akl, a poet about whom almost as many books have been written as the large number that he has published himself, said, ''We are happy that the Israeli Army has come to do this heroic labor.'' He said the invaders were ''cleaning Lebanon of the Palestinian dirt.'' **********''There is a place for the Palestinians, not on our soil but under our soil,'' the 70-year-old poet declared. ''I kill him because I have to live.'' He said he had killed Palestinians as chief of the Guards of the Cedars ''and I will kill others until none are left.'' **********An Israeli colonel, who took part in the discussion with a submachine gun cradled in his lap, said later that he had felt so sick he had wanted to leave."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/24/business/jones-vining-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-march-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JONES & VINING INC reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "print_headline": "JONES & VINING INC reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/10/world/us-now-backing-guatemala-loans.html": {"writer_name": "Raymond Bonner", "pub_date": "1982-10-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 832, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. NOW BACKING GUATEMALA LOANS", "print_headline": "U.S. NOW BACKING GUATEMALA LOANS", "body_text": " **********The State Department says that because of what it sees as improvements in the human rights situation in Guatemala, it has recommended that the United States no longer block development bank loans to that country, according to Administration officials. **********On the basis of the State Department's recommendation, the Treasury Secretary, who directs the activities of the United States in the development banks, plans to support an $18 million loan request from Guatemala to the Inter-American Development Bank, according to a Treasury Department official. The loan is for a $30 million rural telephone project. **********Without opposition from the United States, which provides about $1.1 billion, or roughly 42 percent, of the Development Bank's current capital funds, the loan is expected to be approved this month. **********The Administration's action is part of a broader policy effort to aid Guatemala, which is locked in battle with leftist-led guerrillas. It has already received Congressional authorization for $10 million under the Carribean aid program. For next year, the Administration is asking for $15 million in economic and development assistance, $3.4 million for helicopters and spare parts and $250,000 for military training. Effects of Policy Change **********The Administration's proposed policy change will affect six loans, totaling some $170 million, requested by Guatemala from the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank, according to James Morrell of the Center for International Policy, a nonprofit research group concerned with American foreign policy and human rights. **********The proposed change in American policy brought strong protests from some Congressional Democrats. Representatives Tom Harkin of Iowa and Jerry M. Patterson of California said they were considering legislation or a lawsuit to block the loan. Mr. Patterson is chairman of the House subcommittee on Development Institutions and Finance, which oversees the activities of the United States in the development banks. Mr. Harkin was the sponsor of legislation enacted in 1977 that prohibits the United States from supporting development bank loans to governments that ''engage in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.'' **********Under that law, the United States has withheld approval of 128 loans to 16 countries, according to Mr. Morrell.  Mr. Morrell said that most of the vetoes occurred during the Carter Administration, and that ''the main impact of the Reagan Administration has been to change the voting policy.'' Last year, the Administration reversed previous American opposition to loans to Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, the Philippines and South Korea, according to Jan Shinpock, staff director of the subcommittee on International Development Institutions. 'Human Rights Considerations' **********In the past, the Administration has opposed development bank loans to Guatemala ''on the basis of human rights considerations,'' the Treasury Department said recently in a letter to the subcommittee.  But the department is considering a change in its voting policy because of ''indications of improvements in the human rights situation in Guatemala,'' according to the letter, which was signed by W. Dennis Thomas, assistant Treasury Secretary for Legislative Affairs. **********Congressional aides and Administration officials who asked not to be identified said it was tantamount to a final change in policy, given the State Department's position. **********At hearings on the $18 million rural telecommunications loan, Stephen W. Bosworth, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, testified before the Development Institutions subcommittee that there had been a general improvment in human rights conditions in Guatemala since Gen. Efrain Rios Montt became President after a coup on March 23, 1982. **********While the record of the new Government is ''not perfect,'' Mr.  Bosworth said it had demonstrated ''a commitment to positive change and new opportunity in Guatemala.'' Repression in Rural Areas **********Representatives from church and human rights organizations testified, however, that since the coup there had been greater repression in rural areas and especially of the country's Indians, who make up about 60 percent of the population. **********''I am convinced that since the March 23, 1982, coup, the Guatemalan Government and Army continue to engage in widespread and systematic violations of basic human rights, in particular, the right to life,'' Angela Berryman, a representative for the American Friends Service Committee, told the subcommittee. She said her conclusions were based on discusssions in July with Guatemalans who had fled to Mexico. **********This week, Amnesty International said that Guatemalan forces had ''massacred more than 2,600 Indians and peasants'' since General Rios Montt came to power. **********Representative Patterson said last week that he was strongly opposed to the Administration's intention to support the loan to Guatemala because it was counter to ''documented Government atrocities against the Indian population of the very areas where this project will go.'' He added that he saw ''improving communications in areas where the Government is committing atrocities as a form of indirect military aid.'' **********Because of the country's human rights record, the United States has not provided military aid to Guatemala since 1977."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/25/business/hmw-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-july-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HMW INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "print_headline": "HMW INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/10/business/huntington-health-services-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-aug-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HUNTINGTON HEALTH SERVICES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Aug 31", "print_headline": "HUNTINGTON HEALTH SERVICES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Aug 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/06/world/south-africans-say-they-downed-a-mig-in-angola.html": {"writer_name": "Joseph Lelyveld", "pub_date": "1982-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 623, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOUTH AFRICANS SAY THEY DOWNED A MIG IN ANGOLA", "print_headline": "SOUTH AFRICANS SAY THEY DOWNED A MIG IN ANGOLA", "body_text": " **********The South African Air Force shot down an Angolan MIG after an encounter over southern Angola today, according to a brief announcement made in Pretoria. **********The clash was only the second known example in the last year of South African planes being challenged in the air on their regular incursions from bases in the northern reaches of South-West Africa, the disputed territory that is also known as Namibia. Last November a South African Mirage shot down a MIG-21 that had apparently sought to intercept it when it flew near an Angolan missile and radar site. It was said at the time that radio transmissions had indicated the MIG's pilot was a Cuban. **********This evening's announcement by Gen. Constand Viljoen, the chief of the Defense Force, did not say where in southern Angola the clash had occurred. In a virtually uninterrupted series of operations against insurgent organizations over the last 15 months, South African forces are believed to have cleared a swath at least 120 miles deep in which neither the insurgents nor Angolan forces are able to maintain any regular position. **********South African strikes in late July and early August are thought to have reached points at least 160 miles north of the border, farther than South African forces had been in four years. The Cuban forces, whose presence in Angola is now said by Western and South African diplomats to be the major factor holding up a Namibian cease-fire and settlement, have avoided contact with the South Africans and are reported to have withdrawn their southernmost units to defensive positions about 185 miles from the Namibian frontier. **********According to General Viljoen, the clash today occurred as a South African reconnaissance plane, accompanied by two fighters, was surveying what were described as missile ''concentrations.'' Four MIG's intercepted the South African aircraft, the announcement said, and one was then shot down. **********The announcement justified the reconnaissance mission by saying that the Soviet Union has been rearming the South-West Africa People's Organization after its recent losses; it contended that 600 tons of military equipment have been delivered to the Angolan port of Mocamedes in the last 10 days. Elections Termed Impossible **********Despite the extensive buffer zone that South African forces have created between the Cubans and Namibia, the Government of Prime Minister P.W. Botha maintains that ''free and fair elections'' under a United Nations plan nominally accepted more than four years ago would be impossible unless Cuban forces were pushed out of Angola. An American envoy, Frank G. Wisner, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, was in the Angolan capital of Luanda last week for the second time in a month for discussions on the issue. **********Mr. Wisner said on his departure from Angola that he hoped to return soon for further talks, but on Monday at the United Nations, Foreign Minister Paulo Jorge of Angola again complained sharply about American efforts to link the question of Cuban troops in Angola to a Namibian settlement. **********Mr. Norge told the General Assembly that ''continued aggression'' by South Africa had delayed a gradual Cuban withdrawal. ''The United States has tried to accuse Angola of holding up the negotiations,'' he said, ''but in reality the United States representatives are responsible for the holdup.'' **********South Africa has agreed to withdraw all but 1,500 troops from Namibia after the territory is formally placed under United Nations supervision. In the view of some analysts, a Cuban withdrawal at the same time could imperil the Government in Luanda by bringing about a showdown with the Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known as Unita, the insurgent movement led by Jonas Savimbi."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/16/business/fafco-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 48, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FAFCO reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "FAFCO reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/16/business/renault-sale-in-algeria.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 42, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Renault Sale in Algeria", "print_headline": "Renault Sale in Algeria", "body_text": " **********Algeria has ordered 4,700 Renault trucks, the auto maker's president, Francois Zanotti, said today.

Q: I'm looking for a job in the film industry, and wonder if n ewspapers and magazines specificially tailored to my chosen p rofession are deductible. Do I need receipts? And what about other e xpenses like telephone answering service? **********A: First, in order to be deductible, the expenses must be incurred while looking for a job in a field you're already in. If you are trying to enter an entirely new line of business, you must bear all the expenses. **********If you already have a job in the film industry, however, you can deduct the cost of specialized industry publications as a business expense, says Leon M. Nad, national tax partner with the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse. But the Internal Revenue Service might argue that the cost of general interest publications, such as a daily newspaper, were personal in nature and hence nondeductible.  Receipts are not required, but they help to substantiate a deduction if you are audited. The answering service would be deductible. **********Q: I'm a rancher, and I operate on a fiscal year that starts Nov.  1. I've been told that while the latest round of tax reductions took effect Jan. 1 for most individuals, they do not take effect for people on fiscal years until 12 months after the start of their 1981-82 fiscal years. Can I prorate the reduction? Otherwise, I won't profit at all this year from the tax cut since my fiscal year started so late in the calendar year. **********A: Normally, you, like any other self-employed individual, would have been able to prorate the cut, but Congress was very clear about not permitting individuals to prorate this time, says Mr. Nad. One possible solution: You could incorporate, since the tax bill provides for a modest tax reduction on the first $50,000 of taxable income of small corporations for 1982 and 1983. **********Q: I've been collecting Social Security since I retired as a bank officer last October and am now doing consulting work. I've been told that a contract can be drawn in such a way that my earnings would not be considered wages and that I would still be eligible for Social Security benefits even if the payments exceed the earnings test. Is this correct? **********A: Maybe, but you're in a very grey area. Generally, in order to be eligible for Social Security benefits, you cannot have a substantial amount of self-employment income - in 1982, for example you can generally earn only $6,000 before benefits begin to drop. **********The Social Security Administration uses the same definition of self-employment income as the Internal Revenue Code, which says it is income that was earned in connection with a person's trade or business. **********The crucial question is whether a person's self-employment activities constitute a trade or business. In three recent legal decisions, payments received by certain retired taxpayers were found to be exempt from self-employment tax because the individuals were not engaged in a trade or business, since they were not making themselves available to the general public. In two cases, the taxpayers served as consultants to the companies they formerly worked for, and agreed not work for any competitors. In the third case, a retired banker served as trustee for a particular trust. **********If your consulting earnings are not subject to self-employment tax, the argument goes, they also shouldn't count for purposes of the $6,000 Social Security $6,000 earnings test. The problem is that most of these cases have not dealt with the Social Security aspect. **********Furthermore, as reported by the Research Institute of America, a tax research organization, at least one court decision in New York last year denied Social Security benefits to a consultant in a similar position to yours. The Federal appeals court in New York said an earlier court decision, which exempted a consutant's income from self-employment tax, was ''unpalatable,'' and that the taxpayer was not entitled to Social Security benefits. Although that particular decision only affects taxpayers in the second circuit, comprising New York, Vermont and Connecticutt, it certainly dims the chances of such arrangements in other locals. **********Q: But wasn't there some recent change that liberalized the benefit eligibility rules for the self-employed? **********A: Yes, but it won't help you. In 1980, Congress said that some retirement payments resulting from self-employment activities before the person involved became entitled to Social Security benefits would no longer be treated as income for purposes of the Social Security earnings test. Previously, such payments were counted as income and the recipients - for example, retired partners of accounting or law firms - lost out on benefits. The change in the law was retroactive to Jan. 1, 1978, but you must have been self-employed - and earned the payments - before retirement in order to take advantage of this change. **********Q: Is it true that I must pay Social Security charges on sick pay? **********A: Yes, in most cases. Previously sick pay was exempt from the Social Security levy, although it has always been subject to income tax. But Congress has decreed that for 1982 and thereafter, the 13.4 percent F.I.C.A. (or Federal Insurance Contribution Act) tax should apply to sick pay received in the first six months of of an illness - if it is employer-financed sick pay. Payments received under employee-financed plans or workmen's compensation, on the other hand, are not taxable, nor are those received after the sixth month of one continuous illness. **********Q: We retired recently, and bought a home in Florida for the winter months. We also own the house in New Jersey where we have lived for 21 years, but plan to rent it several months a year to pay the bills. If we later sell our New Jersey home, will we still qualify for the $125,000 exclusion from capital gains tax? **********A: It depends which dwelling is considered your principal residence. Sidney Kess, director of tax policy for the accounting firm of Main Hurdman, notes that ''the mere fact that you have rented it doesn't automatically preclude'' you from claiming the house as your principal residence. But it could be a close call if you rent it out for more than six months a year, he adds. **********Q: My husband and I work for a hospital and and live across the street in an apartment building owned by the hospital. It is now restricting the building, allowing only doctors and nurses as tenants, and we must move out. I know that moving expenses are deductible if a move is made to be closer to work, but what happens when people are forced to move further from work by the employer? **********A: As far as the I.R.S. is concerned, you foot the bill. The tax code only allows people to deduct moving expenses if they change jobs, or their company moves them to a new location, and the new job is at least 35 miles farther from your former home than your old job. Since you are not moving because of a job change, but because you are, in effect, being evicted, the expense is all personal in nature and hence nondeductible."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/28/business/auto-gains-predicted.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Auto Gains Predicted", "print_headline": "Auto Gains Predicted", "body_text": " **********The president of the Ford Motor Company, Donald E.

Perhaps the market is convinced this operator of Burger King restaurants is making a successful transition into other restaurant formats. **********What Chart House is attempting to do is reduce its dependence on Burger King and its Cork 'N Cleaver Steak House chain. If Chart House is successful, this consistently profitable concern may well experience its fastest growth since it became a major company. **********At least, that is Michael Culp's opinion. He follows the restaurant industry for E.F. Hutton & Company. ''Chart House,'' he said, ''is redeploying its capital into faster-growing, higher-margined and less-saturated segments of the restaurant industry.'' **********He said that, under the company's regional franchises with Burger King, Chart House's expansion potential was ''severely limited.'' But the 275 existing Burger King outlets throw off $25 million to $30 million a year, which can be used for expansion of the company's other chains. **********Mr. Culp noted that Chart House acquired the promising Luther's Bar-B-Que last September and he reported little chainwide competition for the barbeque concept. ''The typical Luther's can do $1.2 million in sales in the first year,'' Mr. Culp said. ''It only costs $800,000 to build a unit. By comparison, a typical Chart House Burger King does only $700,000 to $800,000 in sales and costs about $700,000 to put in service.'' **********Thus, the sales-to-capital ratio is 1.5 for Luther's and 1.1 for Burger King. Church's Fried Chicken and Chi-Chi's, the Mexican restaurant franchiser, can equal Luther's sales-to-capital ratio, but there are only a handful of companies in the industry with such high returns. **********Equally important, Mr. Culp said, is that Luther's turns Chart House into a franchiser for the first time. As the Value Line Investment Survey points out, franchising involves very little investment by the franchiser - ''a plus because finances are highly leveraged, with long-term debt and capitalized leases accounting for over half of total capital.'' Assuming a company uses debt prudently, it is able to earn a higher return on its equity with borrowed money. **********Mr. Culp used McDonald's as a proxy in explaining how lucrative a franchising operation can be. He said that McDonald's could typically flow 80 percent to 85 percent of its franchise income down to pretax profit. There is no guarantee, of course, that Chart House will do as well. **********While Chart House presses development of its Luther's chain, it is cutting back its unsuccessful Cork 'N Cleaver operations. The company had 60 of these units but has converted 15 of them into Cisco's Mexican restaurants it owns outright. **********This strategy, Mr. Culp said, has ''saved'' failing Cork 'N Cleaver stores, but he added that the ''jury is still out'' as to Cisco's long-term promise. **********Many of the Cork 'N Cleaver units are in the depressed Middle West. More than a third of the company's Burger King outlets are in Illinois, where results are reflecting the recession to some degree.  But the company's Burger King units in Texas, Louisiana and Virginia are offsetting the weakness in the Middle West. **********The Chart House Steak House division, he said, is the only successful high-priced steak chain in the United States. Chart House is pushing expansion to 15 percent to 20 percent annual rate from 10 percent and is depending heavily on Burger King's cash flow to finance it. The company has 48 Chart House Steak Houses and eight more under construction. These restaurants are found primarily along the West Coast and in Florida. **********Mr. Culp is recommending the shares as among the most promising in the restaurant industry. The industry, incidentally, has been depressed in part because of recession influences and last year's severe winter. He is estimating that Chart House will earn $2.30 a share in 1982, up from $2.03 in 1981. He expects $2.80 a share in 1983. The stock was quoted at 20 bid in over-the-counter trading yesterday, its highest close this year. **********William Trainer of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith said that his firm was neutral for the intermediate term on Chart House, adding that the shares were ''O.K. to buy.'' Mr. Trainer termed the Cork 'N Cleaver conversions ''modestly successful,'' adding that he was impressed with the company's ability to operate restaurants. **********To Mr. Trainer, Luther's is an ''interesting concept,'' but he said that ''they are not alone in developing the barbecue concept,'' with Tony Roma well along with an ''upscale barbecue restaurant'' and ''others entering the field.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/31/business/new-home-sales-off-4.9-in-july.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 490, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW-HOME SALES OFF 4.9% IN JULY", "print_headline": "NEW-HOME SALES OFF 4.9% IN JULY", "body_text": " **********Sales of new single-family houses fell 4.9 percent in July to the third-lowest rate in at least two decades, the Government reported today.

It closed yesterday at 33 3/4, up 3/8. **********In a presentation made to securities analysts in April, management said that 1982 could be a ''tough year,'' particularly for Cigna's property-casualty operations as well as its group health-and-life and individual life coverage. In addition, according to Standard & Poor's, the company said it would incur ''substantial'' administrative costs related to the merger, including $12 million to $13 million in fees to investment bankers. **********On May 12, Cigna reported that, on a pro forma basis, profits in the 1982 opening quarter dropped sharply. The stock market's response that day was a decline of 2 3/8 points, to 45 3/4. The next day, as selling pressure intensified, the issue dropped 4 5/8 points, to 41 1/8. **********''The first-quarter earnings for Cigna were extremely disappointing,'' said Gerald E. Lewinsohn of Merrill Lynch in a comment to clients dated May 20. ''The company reported 79 cents a share versus a pro-forma of $1.57.'' **********''This was significantly below our revised estimate of $1.25 and far below our initial estimate of $1.60,'' he said. ''The release of earnings marked the completion of several weeks of uncertainty following a meeting for analysts on April 22 at which the company indicated that analysts' estimates were too high.'' **********In releasing its first quarterly earnings report as a merged company, Cigna cited the ''continuing down cycle'' in property and casualty underwriting, in addition to ''substantial catastrophe losses related to severe winter weather.'' **********Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts had gotten the message and were cutting their earnings estimates for Cigna. At Merrill Lynch, for example, the 1982 earnings projection was lowered last month to $7 a share, from $8.65. That followed an earlier reduction from $9.25 a share. Meanwhile, the brokerage firm estimates next year's profits at $8 a share. On a comparable basis, Cigna's 1981 profit is figured at $8.51 a share. **********Currently, Merrill Lynch rates Cigna's stock as ''neutral'' on an intermediate time frame of up to one year. The firm's long-term opinion on the stock is a ''buy.'' **********At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., analysts are projecting 1982 earnings of $6.50 a share for the insurance company. ''This estimate assumes no improvement in the current economic environment in individual life, group health and property-liability areas,'' the analyst team said. ''At this point, we remain neutral on Cigna's equity.'' **********In the second week in May, Standard & Poor's was projecting Cigna's earnings at $8.25 a share for this year. Subsequently, the investment advisory service reduced its estimate to $6.75 a share. **********Cigna was not the only company in its industry to feel the chill of lower profits. John E. O'Neil of A.G. Becker Inc. noted earlier this month that earnings for the property-casualty group, ''reflecting several major catastrophes,'' plunged 46 percent in the first quarter of 1982. **********Commenting on the group in general, he said: ''We are looking for continuing erratic quarterly earnings and, in our opinion, there is no urgency to buy the stocks.'' **********Although Aetna Life and Casualty posted higher earnings in the year's opening quarter, this stock has also come under steady pressure. One reason, according to Herbert E. Goodfriend of Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc., is ''negative investor perceptions'' regarding Aetna's proposed acquisition of Geosource Inc., which supplies products and services to the energy industry. **********Drexel Burnham Lambert rates Aetna as a buy and has advised purchase of the stock on weakness."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/12/world/israel-s-statement-on-the-cease-fire.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 399, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAEL'S STATEMENT ON THE CEASE-FIRE", "print_headline": "ISRAEL'S STATEMENT ON THE CEASE-FIRE", "body_text": " **********Following is the text of the Israeli Government statement today announcing a cease-fire in Lebanon, as translated from the Hebrew by United Press International: **********JERUSALEM, June 11 (UPI) - Following is the text of the Israeli Government statement today announcing a cease-fire in Lebanon, as translated from the Hebrew by United Press International: **********On Saturday, June 5, 1982, the Government decided to assign the Israel Defense Forces a mission to take all the Galilee settlements out of the firing range of the terrorists who are concentrated in their bases and headquarters in Lebanon. **********In the five days of fighting the I.D.F. carried out the mission assigned it in its entirety, with heroism, with sacrifice and with great resourcefulness. **********Happy is the nation whose warrior sons these are, the commanders of its army, its soldiers.

If so, what is the truth about the current economic situation?  Now that the election is out of the way - and before the next election campaign gets rolling - this may be a good time to try to define that reality. **********The other day at the White House, the latest Nobel laureate in economics, Prof. George Stigler of the University of Chicago, told a news conference that the United States was in a depression. When the reporters gasped, Mr. Stigler said he could call it a recession if they preferred, but the press corps, eager for a story, shouted, ''No, no,'' and Mr. Stigler let ''depression'' stand, to the discomfiture of the White House, which had thought Mr. Stigler was on its side. **********He was, but he saw no reason to sugarcoat a bitter truth. **********Under similar circumstances, Prof. Alfred Kahn of Cornell University, when he was President Carter's chief inflation fighter, suggested calling a recession a ''banana.'' **********''What's in a name?'' asked Shakespeare, and Professor Adler agrees. You can label reality whatever you like - ''aaarghhh,'' he suggested -and it will not be affected in the slightest. **********So what is today's underlying economic reality? Economists and statisticians trot out these so-called facts: **********- The rate of increase in the hourly earnings of nonfarm production workers has slowed to 6 percent. **********- Rotary rigs operating in oilfields in the contiguous 48 states declined from almost 4,500 in mid-1981 to 2,466 in September. **********- Capacity utilization in manufacturing has fallen to 69.1 percent.  And so on and on. But what do all the signs mean? As another philosopher, Susanne Langer, said, all signs may be misunderstood.  Wet streets are not a reliable sign of recent rainfall if the sprinkler wagon has just passed by. A gunshot may mean the start of a race, the rise of the sun or the sighting of danger. ''Where we find the simplest form of error,'' Miss Langer said, ''we may expect to find also, as its correlate, the simplest form of knowledge.'' It is the kind of knowledge, she said, that we share with animals. **********The difference between economists and other animals, however, is that economists commonly have preconceptions about what things mean that grow out of the economic theories they learned as students.  They also have political ideologies, conscious or unconscious, that derive from their social values or the political or economic interests they choose to serve. **********Does this affect the underlying reality that economists are trying to observe and diagnose? It should not.  Economists seek to differentiate between ''positive economics'' (the description of reality, like it or not) and ''normative economics'' (the prescription of economic policies to achieve the values that particular economists or their masters favor). Positive economics says what is, presumably for everyone; normative economics says what ought to be, according to a particular viewpoint. **********But the analytically sharp line between positive and normative appears to vanish in the real world of political economy. Why can empirical evidence - the test of reality - not act as a checkrein on economists and politicians? **********One reason is that there are so many facts and so many opportunities for interrelating them in different ways that reality never assumes a firm and consistently clear shape. **********And what is often in dispute is not present or past reality but the future - and the future is not ''real.'' It does not yet exist. It cannot be described because it is still to be created by a multitude of decisions, big and small, and by accidents or discoveries that cannot be known in advance. **********Human beings cannot bear all that uncertainty. They feel they must know the future, or something about it, as a basis for rational actions - that is, actions designed to serve their self-interests. **********Does all this mean there is no economic reality? Not at all. It is an extremely complex reality, difficult to work out. But truth is there to be deciphered as a basis for intelligent action - whether in the interests of the individual, the business, the nation or the world. **********That is the creed of the economist as social scientist. Or, to be normative, it ought to be his creed - before, during and after election campaigns."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/19/business/veta-grande-companies-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 42, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VETA GRANDE COMPANIES reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "VETA GRANDE COMPANIES reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/20/business/real-estate-the-gm-building-a-rare-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Diane Henry", "pub_date": "1982-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 908, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Real Estate; The G.M.  Building: A Rare Deal", "print_headline": "Real Estate; The G.M.  Building: A Rare Deal", "body_text": " **********NINE months ago, some of the finest minds in business, law and realestate starte d working on a plan to sell the General Motors Building,a 50-story ma rble tower next to the Plaza and Pierre hotels on Fifth Avenue. What evolved is a rare and unconventional $500 million deal that has intr igued real estate experts, stirred endless questions about tax imp lications and prompted Mayor Koch to announce that the city would ta ke General Motors to court. **********In need of capital, General Motors announced last April that the building was for sale. Corporate Property Investors, a private real estate investment trust made up largely of pension funds, wanted to buy. Major real estate transactions are never simple, but this bargain does not even have a name that everyone agrees on. **********General Motors got what it needed, $500 million. Instead of selling the build outright, however, it borrowed the money from Corporate Property Investors at 10 percent interest and, in return, gave C.P.I. an option to buy the building in 1991. **********For the next decade, G.M. owns the building, earns rental income, takes the tax depreciation benefits and pays Corporate Property Investors $55 million in annual interest compounded quarterly. **********C.P.I. will manage the building through a newly created affiliate, Corporate Realty Consultants Inc., which will be paid a fee by G.M.  based on rentals in the building. At the end of 10 years, G.M. will hand C.P.I. a check for $500 million to repay the principal on the loan. C.P.I. can then give the $500 million back, and become owner of the building after paying the remaining unpaid principal on the building's existing mortgage. **********Why not just sell the building? Why would anyone lend money at just 10 percent interest? Would the building have sold for $500 million in a conventional deal today or is the building's value actually less, considering the low interest rate on the loan to G.M.? Is the purpose to postpone paying taxes? **********By the crudest calculations, Federal, state and local taxes on the sale of a $500 million building that cost about $100 million to build might work out to as much as $150 million or $200 million. The estimate includes a rough $40 million calculation for the city's new 10 percent capital gains tax. **********A conventional sale could have been a windfall for the city since the new tax, which took effect last October, was intended to raise a total of $30 million annually from all sales of million-dollar buildings in New York City. **********The questions abou nd. Those who know the an swers will talk about anything but taxes, primarily because Mayor K och said he will ask thecourt to decide if this deal is a sale requir ing the payment of city taxes now. **********G.M argues that there has been no sale yet, so no taxes are owed.  Robert O'Connell, G.M.'s treasurer, explained that the company's primary goal was to raise a large sum of money, but that this arrangement has added advantages. ''We could well remain as owner if C.P.I. does not exercise its option,'' he said. ''What we've given up is a 100 percent guarantee as to the benefits of depreciation and the increased value of the building over time.'' **********Asked for any possible scenarios in which C.P.I. might not want to exercise its option, Mr. O'Connell suggested that if rental incomes in Manhattan fell, the building might not be worth $500 million in 10 years. **********John White, chairman of Landauer Associates and one of the foremost strategists and matchmakers in the country for large real estate transactions, calls this a ''wonderful deal.'' Mr. White, who represented General Motors in the deal, also worked on the last major building sale in New York City, the $400 million Pan American Building transaction. **********In a deal similar to G.M.'s, Mr. White said, he helped arrange a mortgage six years ago from a British pension fund to the developer of a large complex, including a hotel and office buildings, in Washington. The pension fund also had an option to buy 50 percent of shares in the development company, which it exercised. **********''But this is different - here the G.M. notes are unsecured,'' Mr.  White said, referring to the loan. C.P.I. would have no claim in the event that G.M. defaulted, he said, adding, ''The option is a separate agreement.'' **********He explained that the 10 percent interest being received by C.P.I.  is not the discount it might seem. The initial return on the investment, at 10 percent, he said, is higher than C.P.I. would have received if it had simply bought the building this month. **********Comparing it with that in the Pan Am Building sale, Mr. White said that the ''initial equity rate of return - the cash on cash - after debt service on a $50 million mortgage was only 2.4 percent.'' **********In the Pan Am Building deal, he explained, many of the leases were due for renewal after three years, at which time the returns would behigher when r ents were raised. He estimated that the initial return on investment in the G.M. Building, if it had been purchased, might be 3.5 percen t, but most of the leases are locked in for eight more years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/02/world/spain-says-it-has-captured-prominent-french-gangster.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Spain Says It Has Captured Prominent French Gangster", "print_headline": "Spain Says It Has Captured Prominent French Gangster", "body_text": " **********Spanish authorities said today they had detained Francois Besse, a French gangster regarded by the French police as their most wanted criminal. **********Mr. Besse, 37 years old, was captured 10 days ago in this eastern port during an investigation into forged banknotes.

Proxies for New Shares **********Global's annual meeting, conducted at a hotel on Jersey, began Monday, but the company said it was unable to complete its tally of proxies until yesterday because 12 million shares were represented, more than double the number voted in previous annual meetings. **********Members of the dissident group who were unsuccessful in gaining seats on the Global board included Marvin L. Warner, a prominent promotor of professional sports teams and a former United States Ambassador to Switzerland, and Jack W. Bertoglio, a major shareholder in Ennex Inc., an Oklahoma oil exploration company. **********The dissident group, in a formal statement yesterday, asserted that none of the incumbent board members would have been re-elected without the support of proxies representing 3.1 million new shares that Global issued earlier this month. The shares were issued when Global acquired the McFarlane Oil Company, a small oil and gas concern based in Houston. **********The dissidents have challenged the McFarlane acquisition in several court petitions, most recently in a Texas state court in Dallas. In its statement yesterday, the group said it would ''press on for an early trial attacking the McFarlane acquisition.'' Hope for End of Discord **********But in an interview, Mr. Greenberg said the position of the dissident group is no longer ''necessarily my own.'' He added that his ''first and only concern'' as a member of the Global board ''is the interests of all shareholders.'' **********Frank G. Beatty, Global's president and one of the incumbent board members, said the company ''deeply regrets the divisiveness'' caused by the proxy fight and the dissident group's promise of continued litigation. He added that Global hopes ''the election of Mr.  Greenberg will signal an end to the controversy and permit the company to get on with its business.'' **********Global, an 11-year-old concern with valuable oil leases in the Canadian Arctic, was formed as a consolidation of the Fund of Funds and Overseas Investors Services Ltd., two controversial international mutual funds that had been liquidated. The dissident group had been given the upper hand in the proxy battle because Global, which previously had not had more than 16 percent of its shares represented in proxy votes, cannot directly solicit proxies from most of its shareholders. The company's shares are issued in an unusual form known as ''bearer warrants,'' which allow their owners to remain anonymous."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/13/business/masonite-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-feb-28.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 78, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MASONITE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 28", "print_headline": "MASONITE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 28", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/21/business/seafirst-chief-will-retire.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seafirst Chief Will Retire", "print_headline": "Seafirst Chief Will Retire", "body_text": " **********William M.

Many conservatives as well as liberals share the belief that it is. Kevin Phillips, author of ''The New Conservative Majority,'' declares in an article in the current issue of The New York Review of Books: ''The question for the political analyst is no longer whether Ronald Reagan will succeed or fail. He is failing, and attention must now focus upon the ramifications and dimensions of that failure.'' **********''For the White House to assume that there exists a popular desire to embrace the conservative economics of Adam Smith, Andrew Mellon, Milton Friedman, Arthur Laffer and the Business Roundtable,'' Mr.  Phillips writes, ''says very little for the Reaganites' understanding of American electoral politics and of its own mandate.'' **********Mr. Phillips believes that the true mandate was populist - dedicated to anti-establishment cultural and social values and bent on getting more jobs and income for the working people, even if that involved a radical change in American economics and politics. And if Mr. Reagan fails, Mr. Phillips foresees a further swing to the right. **********The liberals also think the Reagan mixture of monetarism and supply-side economics is doomed to failure. A new Brookings study, ''Setting National Priorities: The 1983 Budget,'' concludes that fiscal and monetary policy will stay on a collision course during the years immediately ahead. The budget implies large and increasing deficits while the monetary authorities, who have the support of the Administration, are determined to slow inflation further by maintaining a policy of restraint. **********The clash between fiscal and monetary policy brought on the current recession, and, writes Joseph A. Pechman, the Brookings director of economic studies, ''the experience is likely to be repeated in the coming years unless the mix of fiscal and monetary policies is significantly altered.'' **********That now looks highly unlikely. Mr. Reagan remains the strongest defender of the mixture as before. He was reluctant to compromise over the budget and now seems unperturbed by the breakdown of the negotiations with the Democrats. Mr. Reagan clearly thinks he can handle the problem politically. He is determined to fix blame for the deficits - which Republican and Democratic negotiators agreed would total $182 billion in the fiscal year 1983, $216 billion in 1984 and $233 billion in 1985 - on the Democrats. **********Taking his campaign to the World's Fair in Knoxville, Tenn., and to the airwaves, the President has declared that the Democrats just want to ''spend and spend and spend.'' And he has announced his support for a constitutional amendment requiring balanced budgets. **********But for the time being, and presumably for a few years to come, the nation appears to be facing the biggest deficits in history.  Why is this development not producing greater shock in the financial markets? In fact, the markets have taken the breakdown of budget negotiations with remarkable calm. **********This could be a mistake; markets have missed the coming of disaster before, as they did in the period leading up to October 1929. Yet the markets have had plenty of bad news to adjust to in recent years, and they have done so. In inflation-adjusted terms, the markets have suffered a long, slow crash since the end of the 1960's. **********Today the markets remain wary but unpanicked. They brood about the huge deficits but are glad to know the facts to which they must adjust. Amid the gloom, there are some reasons for belief in stability rather than disaster. The steep recession at home and abroad has hit the prices of oil, food, steel and other goods, and brought down the rate of inflation. Rising unemployment has brought down wages, and may hold them in check for a few years. The slump has taken a heavy toll in bankruptcies and lost profits and income.  Whether this agony was the only way to stop the inflation or not is the issue, both politically and economically. **********Slow growth appears to lie ahead. But that growth should also be consistent with a lower level of interest rates. As Lawrence R.  Klein, a Nobel laureate in economics, observed this week at City University's Graduate Center, real interest rates (nominal rates adjusted for inflation) tend to be equal to the real rate of growth of the economy - a principle first enunciated by the late John von Neuman, the mathematician. **********Real rates today are much too high in relation both to economic growth and to the actual and potential rate of inflation.  The markets may be scenting the imminent decline of interest rates. Progress on the budgetary front would make that decline far more likely. But the markets seem prepared to keep a stiff upper lip even in the face of rising deficits, falling profits, and banking strains stemming from troubles in places as distant as Poland and the Falklands. **********The illusions that the Reagan revolution would work economic and political wonders are gone. But disillusion has not yet led to upheaval, either in politics or in economics. A failed recovery could change that and bring on the black mood and radical change of which Mr. Phillips warns."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/12/business/bankruptcies-finding-toys-r-us.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Hammonds", "pub_date": "1982-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 547, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANKRUPTCIES: FINDING TOYS 'R' US", "print_headline": "BANKRUPTCIES: FINDING TOYS 'R' US", "body_text": " **********WHEN THE INTERSTATE Stores Corporation emerged from bankruptcy proceedings in 1978 as T oys 'R' Us, the toy supermarket chain, Wall Street paid little a ttention.

Foremost, of course, is that of the company's going out of business - though some investors also may gamble on asset-backed securities in hopes that liquidation does occur. But traditional fears are giving way to visions of spectacular gains. And with the recession spurring corporate bankruptcies in this country to record levels - Chapter 11 filings have shot up 50 percent from last year, according to Dun & Bradstreet - there are more opportunities than ever to turn a profit on others' misfortune. **********''When a company files for Chapter 11, the immediate reaction of the average investor is to get out, without looking at the investment opportunities,'' said Arthur Zeikel, president of Merrill Lynch Asset Management. ''But the list of casualties has cut into companies that heretofore were regarded as high-quality investments.'' **********Mr. Zeikel directs Merrill's Phoenix Fund, the newest of at least four mutual funds concentrating assets in the securities of financially strained companies, including those in reorganization proceedings, that show potential for recovery. **********Such funds seek out companies that have been hurt less through their own fault than by the business environment governing their operations. Those with solid management, operating leverage and firmly entrenched product lines are likely to rebound when interest rates and other economic conditions improve. ''What you have,'' Mr.  Zeikel said, ''is the likelihood that those companies which have suffered most in the past five years should benefit from the new economic prospects.'' **********Recommended only for investors with at least $35,000, Merrill's fund and the others' offer the potential for high capital gains at considerably less risk. For those seeking aggressive capital growth, Mr. Zeikel calls an investment of 5 to 10 percent of a portfolio in undervalued securities a ''proper diversification.'' **********The Phoenix Fund currently invests about 75 percent of its holdings in stocks and the rest in bonds of strained companies. Others, like the four-year-old First Investors Bond Appreciation Fund, concentrate investments in deep-discount debt securities. The underlying profit motives are the same, but the risks different: in the event of liquidation, preferred and common stockholders are the last to get their money back. **********For the typical investor, such a fund may be the safest way to play the game. Indeed, most experts say choosing securities among hundreds of bankrupt companies is for experts only. **********''It requires an awful lot of expertise and time, and I think most small investors don't have any of that,'' said David Solomon, who manages the First Investors Fund.

There has been considerable concern expressed in Israel that once Egypt gets back its land, it will lose interest in keeping the treaty alive and will instead try to win favor among other Arabs. Pledges to Continue Talks **********Mr. Mubarak, in his speech as well as in private meetings with leading American Jews and members of Congress, has sought to ease any apprehension. He pledged today to continue negotiations for an agreement on Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip beyond April 25. **********But he warned that any accord on Palestinian autonomy must win the approval of ''moderate Palestinians.'' He said that ''a bad agreementis much worse than no agreement.'' **********In another development, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., in a news conference summarizing the visit of Mr. Mubarak, expressed concern about intelligence reports that Soviet artillery and rockets were being shipped through Lebanon to Palestinian forces in southern Lebanon. 'An Aggravation' **********He said this had ''the potential'' for upsetting the cease-fire between the Palestinians and the Israelis that the United States helped bring about last July. ''We view the provision of such armaments to Palestinian elements in southern Lebanon as an aggravation to the efforts we have been engaged in to prevent the outbreak of conflict,'' Mr. Haig said. ''It's true there have been reports of levels of artillery, rocketry, moving through Lebanon to the Palestinian forces.'' The Israelis have complained for some time about the reinforcement of the Palestinian forces, but this is the first time that a ranking American official has seemed to share their concern. At the urging of Washington, the Israelis have agreed not to launch a new attack against Palestinian positions in Lebanon unless fired on first. **********Mr. Haig said Mr. Mubarak's talks with President Reagan on Wednesday and Thursday had ''deepened and broadened relations between the United States and Egypt'' begun under Anwar el-Sadat. **********In his speech, Mr. Mubarak repeatedly stressed the importance of finding an autonomy agreement that would not be rejected by the Palestinians. The goal of the accord is to set the rules for election of a Palestinian self-governing authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to govern the region's pending negotiations on the final status of the lands. **********''In order to give this formula a chance of being implemented,'' he said, ''it must be acceptable to the Palestinians. They are the ones who will elect the self-governing authority.'' **********As he did earlier in the week, the Egyptian leader said that ''the core of the Middle East problem is the Palestinian question.'' After meeting privately with Mr. Mubarak, some leading American Jews said they were reassured by his commitment to the Camp David accords, which have provided the basis for the treaty with Israel and the autonomy talks. 'His Only Commitment' **********''He remains committed to Camp David, and it is his only commitment,'' said Howard M. Squadron, chairman of the Council of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Before the meeting, some Jewish organizations expressed concern about his statements calling for Palestinian ''self-determination'' and for a Palestinian ''national entity.'' **********During his visit, there was considerable discussion about Egypt's requests for additional economic and military assistance. American officials said Egypt would continue to receive about $1 billion in economic assistance, divided among food sold at concessional rates, development projects and other types of aid. Military aid to Egypt this fiscal year will amount to $900 milliion, of which $200 million does not have to be repaid. Tentative plans are for Egypt to get an extra $400 million in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The terms are not known.

Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader whom Mr. Sadat repeatedly called ''a lunatic,'' Mr. Mubarak maintained his stance of not attacking anyone. ''He's your friend,'' Mr. Mubarak said.

The organization monitors the economic performance of 24 major industrial member countries. **********The organization's secretariat couched its report in diplomatic terms, acknowledging that ''the goals of the new policy do not appear out of reach.'' But the overall tone was cautious and skeptical, stressing the constraints placed on the Socialists' expansive economic strategy by the weakness of world demand, France's high inflation rate and its big balance-of-payments deficit. **********After warning that the Socialists' plan to revitalize the French economy by increasing demand and restructuring industry ''will take a few years to produce results,'' the organization said that ''there might thus be a great temptation to turn toward more or less disguised protectionist measures.''

Such an inflationary spurt would have ''negative effects on external competitiveness and give rise to a further increase in unemployment,'' the organization said. **********The group's concerns about a surge in French protectionism coincide with those expressed privately by France's major trading partners, particularly since the Government introduced its plan to ''reconquer the domestic market'' by offering aid to industries that try to increase their share of the home demand at the expense of foreign suppliers in critical areas. **********The organization said it t hought higher pub lic spending and the strengthening in private demand resulting fro m last year's wage and pension increases would produce a moderate ac celeration in French economic growth this year to about 3 percent and ''stabilize'' unemployment, though at a higher level than i n 1981. Outlook on Inflation **********It said inflation may slow marginally from about 14 percent last year to 13 percent in the first half of 1982, partly because of new price controls and the linking of quarterly wage rises to the anticipated rate of inflation in the next three months. France's balance-of-payments deficit on current account is likely to remain ''substantial'' but stable at about $6.75 billion. **********But the organization warned that any deterioration in the world economy will undermine these limited achievements, breeding political frustration and intensifying the pressure for a ''siege economy.'' Moreover, the group's report emphasized that many of the economic and social reforms the Socialists are carrying out risk defeating their overriding aim of reviving industry and promoting employment unless carefully handled. **********Uncertainty about the Government's plans for a far-reaching reform of the tax laws is deterring new investment and hirings, the organization said"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/08/business/harvester-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Harvester Talks", "print_headline": "Harvester Talks", "body_text": " **********The International Harvester Company resumed preliminary talks several days ago with the Cummins Engine Company about the sale of its Spanish diesel engine manufacturing line, sources from both companies said.

Brezhnev, China is making clear that it expects his successors to come up with the concessions that will open the way to more normal relations. **********Mr. Brezhnev's death left Peking, like Washington, confronting the uncertainties of a new Soviet leadership. But the Chinese have the advantage of ongoing consultations with Moscow that could offer a logical channel for any moves toward reconciliation. **********In his final months, in speeches at Tashkent and Baku, Mr. Brezhnev made two public overtures to Peking. On Monday, Yuri V. Andropov extended yet another. The new Soviet party chief said in Moscow that the Kremlin wanted to ''improve relations with all Socialist nations,'' extending even to ''spheres where for various reasons we lack the necessary trust and understanding.'' Mr. Andropov made clear that ''this is also true of our great neighbor, the People's Republic of China.'' **********Today, the Chinese Foreign Ministry replied through its information department, saying: ''We have noted the statement by Yuri Andropov on Sino-Soviet relations. We hope to see the new Soviet leadership make a new effort in eliminating the obstacles hindering the normalization of relations between the two countries.'' **********This seemed only slightly more upbeat than Peking's earlier statements about attaching importance to Moscow's deeds and not its words. 'We Pay Great Attention' **********Mr. Andropov's overture was published inside the People's Daily newspaper. According to its New China News Agency dispatch from Moscow, Mr. Andropov mentioned ideas proposed by Mr. Brezhnev in Tashkent and Baku and said that ''we pay great attention to every positive response from the Chinese side.'' **********So far, the Chinese press has avoided commenting on the new Soviet leadership, though there has been an easing of anti-Soviet language, and even Chinese officials sound more cautious than usual. Some Western diplomats here believe the Chinese are waiting to see what happens at the next round of consultations in Moscow this winter. **********Before Mr. Brezhnev's death, China had agreed to consultations with the Soviet Union on their relationship, which has been chilled for more than two decades. The initial round of meetings took place in Peking last month, and the Chinese agreed to continue to Moscow for the second round. The Soviet 'Threat' **********But China's official position was summed up by Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang on Nov. 19 in a meeting with the Thai Prime Minister, Gen.  Prem Tinsulanonda. Mr. Zhao asserted that any improvement in Chinese-Soviet relations depended upon whether Moscow would act to remove its ''threat'' against China. **********Mr. Zhao defined this as the buildup of Soviet forces along China's border with the Soviet Union and Mongolia, Moscow's military intervention in Afghanistan and its support of Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia. The three issues all constitute a threat against China, Mr. Zhao said. **********The same complaints were raised before by other Chinese officials, including Deputy Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who represents China in the new consultations. The message to Moscow is that Peking is not softening its conditions for better ties. **********A more conciliatory note was sounded by Foreign Minister Huang Hua before he led a Chinese delegation to Mr. Brezhnev's funeral. ''The Chinese people sincerely wish there will be a genuine improvement in the relations between the two countries,'' he said, ''and that these relations will return to normal step by step.'' Lavish Praise of Brezhnev **********Mr. Huang's allusion to a step-by-step approach, which would have been cleared with the leadership beforehand, indicated that Peking did not expect to get all the problems solved at once. But he also said he hoped that ''General Secretary Yuri Andropov and the Soviet party and Government make new efforts to promote the improvement of Sino-Soviet relations.'' **********His praise of Mr. Brezhnev as ''an outstanding statesman'' was the most lavish from Peking in years and was in sharp contrast to the vilification that once filled the Chinese press. **********The cordial welcome given Mr. Huang as the first senior Chinese official to visit Moscow in 18 years made clear that the new Soviet leadership was using the opportunity to press its case for reconciliation. Mr. Huang chatted nearly four minutes with Mr.  Andropov in a Kremlin reception line and later met for an hour and a half with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko. **********On his return last Thursday, Mr. Huang told reporters that he was ''optimistic'' about the next round of consultations.  When Mr. Huang was retired the next day, some Eastern European diplomats here saw it as a rebuke of his upbeat comments, though his retirement had long been expected because of ill health. But Chinese officials insisted that Mr. Huang's retirement had in fact been postponed to allow him to make his trip to Moscow. Mr. Huang remains active as a state councillor, and he would have logically briefed his successor, Wu Xueqian, and others in the leadership about his Moscow trip."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/04/business/company-news-braniff-set-back.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Braniff Set Back", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Braniff Set Back", "body_text": " **********The attempt to get part of Braniff Airways flying again was set back, as its pilots refused to give further concessions to form a joint venture with PSA Inc.

The bulk of that sum is going to the First National Bank of Chicago, the Bank of America, Marine Midland and the Girard Bank of Philadelphia. **********The Northern Trust Company of Chicago has now come to the Ex-Im Bank, which guarantees and insures credits for nonfarm exports, with a claim for $4,090,206. The claim relates to an overdue payment owed Northern Trust by the Rumanian Bank for Foreign Trade. The credit, which was insured by Ex-Im, financed a Rumanian purchase of sulfur from the International Commodities Export Corporation of New York.  The payment was due April 5, and the Chicago bank filed for reimbursement April 14. **********Ex-Im officials said it would take 30 to 90 days to process the claim, but they indicated that they expected to come up with the money, and then would attempt to recover the funds from Rumania.  ''This is the kind of claim that we would probably pay off on,'' one official said. **********Although Northern Trust has called for payment of its loan to Rumania, most analysts agreed that this should not lead all other banks and governments to write off their loans to Rumania. Northern Trust declined to comment. **********''There is so much at stake for the other commercial banks and governments involved,'' said Daniel L. Bond, director of the Centrally Planned Economies Project at Wharton Econometrics Forecasting. ''And with rescheduling, the prospects of Rumania's paying off its debts are good.'' **********Rumania's net hard-currency debt was placed at $10 billion at the end of 1981. Of that sum, Mr. Bond estimated that $304 million was owed to American banks. **********Rumania, which has a series of short-term debts due around this time, is trying to stretch out payments and to convince Western banks to enter into negotiations to reschedule the payments. It also is hoping that the International Monetary Fund will unfreeze the remaining portions of the $1.5 billion line of credit originally extended in spring 1981. **********The I.M.F. had cut off further borrowing by Rumania - and a host of other countries, including Zaire, Morocco, Bangladesh, Zambia, Costa Rica, Tanzania, Guyana, Madagascar, Senegal, Togo, Uganda, Honduras, the Solomon Islands and Grenada - because of their failure to meet economic performance targets. **********Rumania's debt situation is said to be far more manageable than that of Poland. Marc E. Leland, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Monetary Affairs, said that Poland needed more than $3 billion just to service its hard-currency debt this year. But he told Senator Robert W. Kasten Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, at a hearing last week that the Administration continued to oppose calling Poland in default because it believed such action would remove pressure on Poland to repay its debts to the United States. The Continental Divide **********Continental Air Lines has broken with other carriers, and the aircraft builders, on the issue of safe-harbor leasing, and has just told House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Daniel Rostenkowski, Democrat of Chicago, that the controversial provision of last year's Economic Recovery Act should be repealed. **********It's not that Continental hasn't made money from it. In fact, Continental has received more than $23 million through the sale of tax benefits, and expects to continue to participate in the plan if it remains on the books, according to George A. Warde, the airline's president. **********Mr. Warde said in a letter to Mr. Rostenkowski that his objection was that the leasing provision put at a ''serious competitive disadvantage'' those carriers that had decided not to place large equipment orders. **********''Safe-harbor leasing provides a Federal subsidy for those carriers that have ordered billions of dollars of equipment,'' Mr. Warde wrote. ''These orders were placed before safe-harbor leasing became law and therefore safe-harbor leasing simply provides windfall payments, not incentives, for previous captial investment decisions.'' Overseas Insurance Expansion **********Reagan Administration efforts, now supported in principle by the European Economic Community, to liberalize international trade in services such as banking and insurance, have prompted the American life insurance industry to gear up for foreign expansion. **********The American Council of Life Insurance, the industry's Washingtonbased trade association, says that more than 120 American life insurance companies either are operating overseas or are interested in doing so. Early in this century, the Guardian, the Equitable Society of the United States, New York Life and Mutual Life of New York all had extensive life insurance sales in Europe. For a variety of reasons they were forced out. The trade organization will hold a seminar on May 20 to discuss strategy for getting back in. High-Tech Trade Talks **********Clyde V. Prestowitz, deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce and new co-chairman of the United States contingent of a joint working group in high-technology trade with Japan, went off with Vice President Bush to Tokyo yesterday to press the Japanese for greater trade liberalization. A new set of measures is expected to be announced by the Japanese at international economic meetings in Paris next month.

Pearson had a retail furniture business with an extensive inventory. As interest rates rose, however, his profit margin fell. Last summer, amid an expanding recession, he cleaned house and started a new business, Susan James Associates. **********''We're a consulting firm now,'' said Mr. Pearson, the firm's president. ''We place bids, then buy only what we need for each job.  Somebody else has to keep the inventory.'' **********Michael R. Bloomberg was a partner at Salomon Brothers, the securities firm, until last September. His new company, Innovative Market Systems, which opened for business in February, is developing computer software systems for financial analysts. ''When we sold the company to Phibro last fall,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, ''I left to start a new business.'' **********Both companies were started during a recession, and both have endured a period of business failures unequaled since the 1940's. And while they may not be representative of all new businesses formed during the recession, they may share many of their characteristics.  Tight money and technological change, business people say, are key factors in the current wave of new companies. 'Interesting Time' **********''This is an interesting time,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''You can't go out and start a steel mill, but the position of the business cycle and the rate of technological change are such that people can go and start small companies when they have a few people with good ideas.'' **********Not surprisingly, the number of business starts during the first quarter of 1982 declined from the same period last year. According to preliminary figures supplied by the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, 9,094 new businesses were formed during the first three months of 1982, down 2.9 percent from the 9,366 last year. The biggest declines in business start rates were recorded in the region composed of Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, down 16.9 percent. **********Dun & Bradstreet said the rate of new incorporation declined in every region of the country except the Middle Atlantic area - New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania - which had an increase of 10.3 percent. **********The Small Business Administration, which also monitors new business, cautions that 1982 figures, though they may be down, are being compared with a record number of business starts last year. In 1981, 581,661 new businesses were incorporated, up more than 9 percent from 1980. Thomas A. Gray, chief economist for the agency, attributed last year's increase at least partially to the unemployment caused by the recession. **********''New business formation just seems to occur more frequently during a recession,'' Mr. Gray said. ''If you're suddenly unemployed and walking around in the street, you're more likely to say to yourself, 'Now is the time to try.' '' **********''The other question you have to ask is, 'What businesses are failing?' '' Mr. Bloomberg added. ''I think businesses that are already in existence -small, medium or large - tend to have greater problems during a recession, as people stop spending or change their buying habits. I'm not sure that has anything to do with new businesses.'' Borrowing Costs Key Factor **********Though other sources echoed Mr. Bloomberg's comments, most still say that starting up a business these days is no picnic. Undoubtedly, the primary problem is the cost of borrowing money. For a smallbusiness owner, who is generally forced to borrow at rates far above the prime interest rates charged to a bank's best customers, high capital costs may narrow his choices of business. **********''Without a doubt, it's the biggest problem a small-business man will face,'' said Gordon Bizar, president of the International Business Network, a political and economic organization for small businesses. ''On the other hand, if you can get the money, now is the time to be buying a business.'' **********Most people do it the other way around, Mr. Bizar said. ''They get in when the market is good and pay premium prices,'' he said. ''Those are the businesses that are failing today.'' **********Of course, not all new businesses are surviving, either. A small company founded in Chicago last year with the goal of buying X-ray negatives from hospitals and selling them for their silver content died when silver prices fell. Other businesses struggle on, hoping to last until consumer spending picks up. Some find their niche right away. 'Nothing to Get Excited About' **********Scott Sanders, an actor who co-founded Survival Techniques in his New York loft last December, said sales of his custom-painted decorated pillows, at $22.50 each, had been ''O.K., but nothing to get excited about.'' **********Mr. Sanders said the recession had definitely hurt his sales, but, because his costs are so low (he and several friends do all the work), the tiny company will probably stay in business. **********According to Malcolm N. Smith, senior lecturer in the School of Economic Policy at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business, high interest rates have done more to new business formation than simply restricting the choices involved. Mr. Smith said the recession had made certains kinds of businesses - specifically, consulting and service companies - more attractive aside from their low start-up costs. **********''In times like this, most companies would rather contract out than increase their employment,'' he said. ''If they need a computer programmer, they'll turn to an outside consultant before they'll actually hire anyone.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/03/business/universal-sues-sony.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Universal Sues Sony", "print_headline": "Universal Sues Sony", "body_text": " **********Universal City Studios Inc., a subsidiary of MCA Inc., has filed a second suit against the Sony Corporation of America, its advertising agents and four retailers, charging contributory copyright infringement in the manufacture and sale of television video recorders.

The Administration plans especially to turn the United States relationship with Japan into an active military partnership. **********Counter Vietnamese Policies **********The Administration is looking to Southeast Asian nations to counter what is seen as Vietnamese expansion and to support United States efforts to project military power into the Indian Ocean and the oilproducing regions around the Persian Gulf. **********The Administration plans to strengthen military ties with China.  But Taiwan is not included in the Administration's plans, leading Congressional conservatives to express fears that the Administration may abandon United States commitments there. **********The officials say that the Administration is trying to weave a loose coalition of Asian nations by dealing with each directly instead of trying to mold them into a formal group. **********The evolving strategy, the officials say, culminated in Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger's trip to Japan, Korea and the Philippines in March where he tried to persuade those nations to support it. Mr. Weinberger took a low posture in public, but officials say he was forceful in private. Worries Over Soviet Navy **********About the same time, Mr. Weinberger approved the Defense Department's classified strategic guidance for the next five years, in which the policy is outlined more explicitly than it is in those portions made public. It places East Asia behind Western Europe and Southwest Asia in priority for American military resources. **********''Our foremost objective in East Asia and the Pacific is, in conjunction with our regional friends and allies, to prevent the Soviet Union and Vietnam from expanding their influence in the region,'' the defense guidance says. **********Officials said the biggest danger in Asia is the Soviet naval threat to American sea and air lines of communication that run from the West Coast through Hawaii, Guam and the Philippines to Diego Garcia and the American fleet in the Indian Ocean. Vietnam adds to that threat, they said, by providing naval, air and communications bases to the Soviet Union. **********To permit American forces to shift their attention southward, the defense guidance says the United States must ''transform our relationship with Japan into an active defense partnership in which Japan significantly increases its defense capabilities.'' U.S. Commitment to Japan **********The present relationship is based on a security treaty under which the United States is committed to defend Japan while Japan has no obligations to the United States other than providing bases. Until now, Administration officials have only suggested that Japan acquire forces capable of defending Japan and the sea lanes out to 1,000 miles. The defense guidance makes that an explicit objective. **********The defense guidance continues the longstanding policy of assisting South Korea in the event of hostilities and calls for improvements in intelligence, command, firepower and antitank weapons for American forces there. **********In Southeast Asia, the guidance says the United States must ''foster the strength and cohesion of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to counter Vietnamese expansionism while developing further the capacity of member countries to support the projection of United States power from the Western Pacific to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf.'' Members of that association are the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. **********The strategic guidance says the United States must ''maintain the strategic value of our relationship with the People's Republic of China by supporting measured increases in its military capability.'' **********The plan says that ''encouragement and, if possible, logistic support will be provided to China's military initiatives that would fix Soviet ground, air, and naval forces in the U.S.S.R.'s Far Eastern territories.'' Lines of Communication **********In a war against the Soviet Union with conventional arms, the guidance says, deployments of American forces from East Asia ''will not be automatic and will be decided on a case-by-case basis.'' **********In the Pacific, the document says, ''first priority will be to defend Alaska, Hawaii, and connecting lines of communications with the continental United States.'' **********Next, the guidance directs, ''naval and air forces will control lines of communications to the Persian Gulf and control the East and South China Seas to interdict Soviet resupply or reinforcement of naval forces deployed in the area.'' **********Forces remaining in Japan and Korea, including the American infantry division in South Korea, would assist those nations, ''giving particular emphasis to protection of United States bases in the region.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/07/world/brazilian-asks-navy-buildup.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 40, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brazilian Asks Navy Buildup", "print_headline": "Brazilian Asks Navy Buildup", "body_text": " **********The Navy Minister, Adm.

Much of the defense is concentrated near the Tib River and near Basra, on the southern front, and around Mandali, northeast of Baghdad. **********The Iraqi advantage in modern weapons is offset to some extent, these sources said, by the problems inherent in covering a frontier that is 600 miles long. The diplomats say the Iraqis realize that their forces cannot be strong everywhere, but they have accepted a calculated risk that the Iranians cannot mount more than three offensives at any one time. **********Hussein Seems to Recognize Risk **********President Saddam Hussein appeared to recognize this risk in a speech to his Cabinet on Tuesday when he noted that ''our cities and villages lie within striking distance of troops crossing the frontier.'' He added that ''the longer the war drags on, the more impossible it would be to defend all the territories on the border.'' **********At the moment both foreign diplomats and Iraqi officials share the conviction that another major Iranian offensive is unlikely. The rationale for this is the high casualty figures of the last two years of war. **********One diplomat put Iranian dead at 150,000, which by rule of thumb would mean a total of 450,000 killed, missing wounded and prisoners of war. Other estimates put the dead at 60,000. Diplomatic estimates of Iraqi dead run from 36,000 to 44,000. **********The latest Iranian attack was launched in the area of the Tib River near Musian by a relatively small Iranian force. The sector is about 170 miles southeast of Baghdad and Iranian progress there would present no serious threat to the capital, diplomats say. Key Highway May Be Target **********However, Iranian forces might be able to cut the Tigris River highway, one of two roads linking Baghdad and Basra, by driving some 30 miles west from their present positions. **********The Iranian attack, which began Wednesday night against a single Iraqi brigade, appears to have been initially successful, according to diplomats. Iraqi fighter planes and French-built Gazelle helicopters armed with guided missiles and artillery finally checked the advance. **********Iraqi sources said the invaders had nowhere penetrated more than three miles, while the Iranians put their advance at twice that much.  The attack, which occurred in the Iraqis' IV Corps sector, ended by sundown on Thursday, the sources said.  The Mandali sector is reported relatively quiet after an initial Iranian penetration of two or three miles. According to an Iraqi communique, Iranian artillery has shelled Mandali intermittently since ground attacks ended. **********The third active front, east of Basra, is also quiet. There has been desultory shelling by Iranian artillery from positions about a mile and a half inside Iraqi territory. The Iraqis have replied with planes and helicopter gunships. **********Diplomats noted two significant aspects of the current fighting.  One is that the Iranians have discarded their mass tactics and assaulted with modest forces, no more than 20,000 around Mandali and fewer than that on the Tib River. The second is that the Iranians have not used the revolutionary guards, who customarily attack in waves of shouting infantry. Two Border Areas Are Disputed **********Iraq holds some disputed territory just over the frontier. One piece of land is around Qasr-i-Shirin and the other is farther south near Zaid Algawaz. Diplomats said Iraq considers that it gained these two areas under the Algiers Treaty of July 1975, which set the frontier between the two countries. The sources noted that markers had never been placed along the new frontier and therefore Iran had not recognized the demarcation. **********Casualties have had an impact on the Iraqi civilian population. One diplomat said there was hardly a family that had remained untouched.  As a result, the war's early popularity has waned."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/13/business/colonial-bancorp-inc-waterbury-conn-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COLONIAL BANCORP INC (WATERBURY, CONN) reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "COLONIAL BANCORP INC (WATERBURY, CONN) reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/03/business/company-news-olympia-sets-board-meeting.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 209, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Olympia Sets Board Meeting", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Olympia Sets Board Meeting", "body_text": " **********The Olympia Brewing Company said yesterday that no statement would be issued regarding the takeover proposal made Tuesday by the Pabst Brewing Company until Olympia's board of directors meets to discuss the offer ''within the next few days.'' **********Robley W.

South Africa Is Assailed **********''Our policy of neutrality does not, however, condemn us to silence or passivity,'' he said.  Mr. Bodstrom also accused South Africa of trying ''to delay the United Nations plan for Namibia.'' ''This plan is the only course for achieving a peaceful and democratic solution,'' Mr. Bodstrom said.  Several speakers spoke against attempts to link the independence of South-West Africa, or Namibia, to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. **********Patrick O. Bolokor, Foreign Minister of Nigeria, Thursday called the attempt to predicate Namibian independence on the withdrawal of Cuban troops as an ''unwarranted and arrogant demand.'' He suggested that if foreign troops had not been invited in, apartheid would have recolonized Angola. **********Last year, Mr. Bolokor said, the impression was given that a solution to the Namibia issue was near. He added, ''It is now crystal clear to all that a peaceful solution of the Namibian question is as far away as ever.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/14/world/cotton-fire-in-le-havre.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 48, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cotton Fire in Le Havre", "print_headline": "Cotton Fire in Le Havre", "body_text": " **********A warehouse fire here destroyed about $35 million worth of cotton, a police spokesman said today. **********The entire fire department was called out to fight the blaze yesterday.

After three and a half yearsi t is possible to draw up a balance sheet and judge promise against p erformance. The experiment has not worked. **********In 1979, Mrs. Thatcher promised a radical break with the postwar British consensus on economic management. Rejecting all direct responsibility for influencing output or employment, she undertook to control inflation by monetary policy alone and to ''galvanize the entrepreneur'' by cutting taxes and government spending so that the magic of the marketplace could insure that the private sector led the way to higher growth. **********After more than doubling the rate of inflation in her first year, she has held it for three months to just less than the level she inherited - but the recent fall in the pound points to rising inflation in the second half of next year. The price in output and employment has, however, been much higher than she reckoned. **********The national income has fallen 5 percent, despite a contribution of 2 percent from North Sea oil. Manufacturing output is at its lowest in 15 years, manufacturing investment has fallen 21 percent and, for the first time in recorded history, Britain is running a deficit on its trade in manufactured goods. **********Almost the whole burden of the experiment has fallen on the private sector. Retained profits have fallen from 9 percent of gross domestic product in 1977 to 6 percent in 1981. Meanwhile, taxation as a proportion of earnings has risen 10 percent and public spending is higher in real terms and higher still as a proportion of gross domestic product. **********Moreover, the Government has failed to achieve its monetary targets. Sterling M-3, its chosen measure, rose in its first two and a half years as much as in the whole five years when I was Chancellor of the Exchequer. This year, the Government may meet its monetary target, but only because it has raised the target to the average level set by Labor. **********Like President Reagan in the United States, Mrs. Thatcher has now abandoned the more bizarre features of her monetarist doctrine. But she still faces insoluble problems in reconciling what is left of her theories with a policy for recovery which will preserve the gains she has made on inflation. To understand her dilemma, it is necessary to explain why inflation has fallen recently in Britain, although monetarist theory would dictate a rise in inflation following the high monetary growth from 1979 to the end of 1981 - and why the fall in output has been so much higher than predicted. **********The immediate cause of the collapse in output and employment is that the Government set its monetary targets too low in relation to the expected growth of G.D.P., and that the high interest rates through which it hoped to achieve those targets cut output far more than they cut the supply of money. A firm - or a country - facing bankruptcy will pay any price for the money it needs to keep going.  So corporate borrowing has been reduced less, and more slowly than the theorists imagine. **********But the high interest rates have increased the cost of investment and inventories to an intolerable level. Moreover, interest rate differentials have been the most important influence on exchange rates for the last three years. The financial markets have been rewarding monetary vice rather than virtue. Countries which use high interest rates to fight high inflation have seen their currencies appreciate and their industries become less competitive.THE Government itself expects its balance of payments surplus to d isappear next year, although it can count on a net benefit of 8 b illion from North Sea oil. If the price of oil falls and the G overnment makes pre-election tax cuts in its spring budget, Britain w ill have a large deficit and the pound will be held firm only by bigi ncreases in interest rates. Yet the Government sees its hope of e conomic recovery depending exclusively on a continuing fall in i nterest rates. **********Although a further fall in interest rates is necessary to keep industry alive - real interest rates are still exceptionally high, as in the United States - there is little reason to believe that this alone will generate recovery. With exceptional margins of spare capacity, British firms will not invest in growth unless they see the prospect of higher demand. Any increase in demand through Government action will damage Mrs. Thatcher's financial objectives. But an increasing number of bankers as well as businessmen wold accept this as a small price for recovery. **********The real problem is to increase demand in ways which will generate more jobs and output rather than more imports, higher wage costs or higher savings. There is a growing consensus that the best way to start would be to increase public spending on the economic infrastructure -roads, railways and sewage, for example - since this would generate the fastest increase in jobs at the lowest price in imports. Any tax cuts should aim at increasing investment rather than consumption for the same reason. A lower pound is also a central element in most plans for recovery. **********But the recent experience of France, following that of Britain in 1974-75, illustrates the difficulty of unilateral reflation in a deflationary world. Though Britain, like other countries, will need some selective import controls and some depreciation to protect its balance of payments, the point may easily be reached at which this could start a chain reaction of beggar-my-neighbor policies in other countries. **********That is why there is growing interest in developing collective international action for recovery within a framework of more stable exchange rates than the world has recently enjoyed. Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan's recent speeches suggest that the United States might be less hostile to such ideas than in the past. For without such action, whatever first aid the International Monetary Fund and World Bank may offer, the risk of a collapse in the international banking system will remain acute."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/24/business/compo-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-april-3.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPO INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to April 3", "print_headline": "COMPO INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to April 3", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/19/business/infotron-systems-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INFOTRON SYSTEMS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "INFOTRON SYSTEMS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/20/business/allies-said-to-urge-us-to-lift-taxes.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1982-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 759, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Allies Said to Urge U.S. to Lift Taxes", "print_headline": "Allies Said to Urge U.S. to Lift Taxes", "body_text": " **********The major allies of the United States urged the Reagan Administration at an unpublicized meeting to raise taxes as a means of reducing the United States budget deficit and thus the pressure on interest rates, authoritative sources said today. **********The finance ministers of France, West Germany, Britain and Japan argued their case at a meeting with Treasury Secretary Donald T.  Regan at the Palace of Versailles outside Paris on Sunday, these sources added. **********The meeting was one of the informal gatherings the finance ministers hold periodically to coordinate their viewpoints on major international economic questions. **********France's Finance Minister, Jacques Delors, who was the chairman of the Versailles meeting, said today that the present international monetary climate was not in ''the strategic, political or economic interests'' of the Reagan Administration or of its allies. **********However, he told a press luncheon that the Versailles meeting might lead to new steps that would be taken at the economic summit meeting in Paris next June to promote ''a better organization of the world economy.'' **********At Sunday's gathering, the sources said, the European and Japanese finance ministers told Mr. Regan that they feared interest rates would remain high in the United States and throughout the rest of the world during the remainder of this year, depressing growth and increasing unemployment, unless Washington cut the budget deficit by raising taxes. **********Recent Reagan Administration estimates have put the deficit at near $100 billion for the present fiscal year and at well over $100 billion in the 1983 and 1984 fiscal years. **********Implicit in the European and Japanese arguments, these sources said, was a growing skepticism about the merits of President Reagan's economic policies, which stress lower taxes for individuals and businesses to stimulate economic growth and spending cuts as the principal means of reducing the budget deficits. **********The allies believe that the Administration will be unable to reduce the deficit significantly and ease the upward pressure on interest rates simply by cutting Federal spending or stimulating economic growth. **********In addition, the finance ministers were reported to have urged that the Federal Reserve promote greater monetary stability by helping other countries support the value of their own currencies against the dollar, which has risen steadily in value in recent months. **********Another suggestion, the sources said, was for the Administration to publish a weekly ''commentary'' on the American money supply figures that explained any unusual movements. The aim would be to stop interest rates, currency trading and financial markets in general from ''overreacting'' to occasional ''blips'' in the money supply figures. Others Under Pressure This happen ed last Friday when a big increase in the United States money supply for the latest reporting week pushed the dollar up sharply in va lue because currency dealers thought the Federal Reservewould be forc ed to raise interest rates to restrain money supply growth. Highe r interest rates make dollar-denominated investments attractive an d other countries are under pressure to increase interest rate s to defend the value of their currencies. **********At today's press luncheon, Mr. Delors said that the weekly money supply figures were now becoming a serious source of monetary instability because the Federal Reserve just drops them onto the markets each Friday ''like Jupiter from heaven,'' without any attempt to explain their significance. **********During the Versailles meeting, the sources said, Mr. Regan refused to make any commitment on reducing the deficit or intervening more actively in foreign-exchange markets. 'Considering' New Steps **********The Treasury Secretary was quoted as saying only that the Administration was ''considering'' new steps to increase Federal revenues and that it remained committed to intervene in foreignexchange markets in ''a crisis.'' But as a senior European official said today: ''What is a crisis? It all depends on the definition.'' **********Mr. Delors was reported to have argued at Versailles that the Unite d States was straining the alliance and encouraging neutralism in Europe with its economic policies. In rece nt months, this has beena favorite French argument against President Reagan's economic policies and the high interest rates they hav e helped bring to the rest of the world. **********The tight monetary policy of the United States has been an acute embarrassment to France's new Socialist leaders because it forces them to keep domestic interest rates up to defend the franc at a time when they are trying to reduce unemployment by stimulating faster economic growth."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/12/business/berkline-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-2.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BERKLINE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 2", "print_headline": "BERKLINE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 2", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/21/business/laker-air-aid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Laker Air Aid", "print_headline": "Laker Air Aid", "body_text": " **********The General Electric Company said ithad agreed to participate with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and European financial institutions in the financ ial restructuring of Laker Airways.

THATCHER ABOUT THE FALKLAND; CRISIS", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from interviews with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher tonight by correspondents of the BBC and Britain's commercial television service: **********Q. Prime Minister, we appear to be poised for the decisivebattle for Port Stanley. Can you see any way out of that, any way of avoiding that battle? **********A. Not unless Argentina decides to withdraw her troops. That would be marvelous if she did. After all, it's what Resolution 502 said.  But she hasn't done it in seven weeks, and I don't know whether she would be considering it now. I would only be too delighted if she did, it would save so many young lives. **********Q. Would you be prepared, even at this 11th hour, to let the Argentines off the hook if President Galtieri said, ''Right, we do want to pull out,'' or do you mean that they've got to surrender?  Would you give them an honorable way out, in other words? **********A. If they say ''Look, we're going to withdraw and we are going to withdraw within the next 10 to 14 days,'' then there would be no need for a battle. It's a possibility totally linked to a timed withdrawal. After the Fighting **********Q. I'm sure you've not contemplated anything but a victory if it does come to an all-out battle for Port Stanley, but what happens after that victory, what's the next step? **********A. It isn't that we talk so much in terms of victory or defeat, we talk in terms of repossessing the Falklands, which were invaded by the Argentine aggressor. So what we are really talking about is all the Argentine forces going back to the mainland so that we repossess the Falkland Islands, and then we have to start reconstruction and rehabilitation, and then we talk about a future. There are immense possibilities for development. Also, we'll have to talk to some other nations about having security for those islands. This mustn't happen again. We have to consider what kind of future the islanders want. It will take them some time to decide, and in part it will depend upon what we are prepared to do by way of development, what other countries are prepared to do to help us by way of security. But we are a democracy, they were born free and they must have a right to self-determination, so it will take quite a time to talk it through. **********Q. Do you see a role in the foreseeable future on the Falkland Islands for the Argentines?  A. I cannot, myself, see a role in anything relating to sovereignty for the Argentines on the Falkland Islands. You saw what happened in Goose Green and Darwin, how our people have been treated. They'd never wanted to go to Argentina before. They'll be even less likely to do so now. I think we are going to be there for some time, if not alone for a number of years, because I hope we can arrange some other people to help, to have a multinational force with us. You know, when the Americans asked us to join them in a multinational force in Sinai, I said yes, because it helped peace in that area. And I'm sure we'd have just exactly the same response from them. The Role of Diplomacy **********Q. Do you think diplomacy has got a part to play now?  A. I think a decision to withdraw troops on the part of the Argentines may have a part to play. They haven't withdrawn them for the last seven weeks. I always thought it would be difficult for a dictator to withdraw but it is always just possible that at the very last minute he might think that they have their backs to the sea and that he would quite like to avoid what could be a prolonged and difficult battle for all our people. Britain's Peace Terms **********Q. Is there anything you can do to encourage him?  A. I don't think there's anything more I can do. As you know, we made up our own terms and published them - they were quite clear - about how far we were prepared to go to avoid a conflict and avoid loss of life. Everything, but everything has been turned down. There is just a possibility, not but I don't rate it very highly. **********Q. You've been told to be magnanimous in any victory. Whatdoes ''magnanimous'' mean to you?  A. It is not a word I use in connection with the Falklands, in connection with a battle on the Falklands. Sometimes I think people are using it to say, all right, hand something to the Argentines.  Under these circumstances, to an invader and an aggressor and a military dictator, that would not be magnanimity. It would be treachery or betrayal of our own people. We couldn't betray our own people. **********Q. There is a view that one should not humiliate one's opponent, that merely makes life difficult for everyone.  A. I'm not trying to humiliate anyone, I'm just trying to repossess islands which are British sovereign territory for people who are British, to have British administration, to live their own way of life under a government of their own choice. That's not humiliation, that is liberty, justice and democracy. The Position of the U.S. **********Q. What to you think of the United States part in this crisis so far? Has America really been a good ally?  A. The United States is as staunch in the principles of liberty, justice and democracy as the United Kingdom, and in her heart of hearts she knew and always knew that there could never be any neutrality between the military junta and democracy. What she had hoped to do was to try to secure a peaceful settlement including the withdrawal of Argentine forces without a battle. We're very grateful to her for making that effort. It was not her fault that it did not succeed, it was the fault of the Argentines. She made the effort, and we tried too. The Secretary General of the United Nations made the effort but he could not succeed in getting the Argentines to withdraw in accordance with that resolution. The fault lies not with the United States, nor with the Secretary General. Their efforts were splendid. It lies with an invader who's determined to try to keep the fruits of invasion as a condition of withdrawal. That was and remains totally unacceptable to us."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/22/business/briefs-032370.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 522, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** American Metals Service Co., a Miami concern, said it had closed its Connecticut warehouse and transferred its customer service and inventories to its Ohio warehouse. *********** Belmoral Mines Ltd. said it and Continental Illinois Bank (Canada) had agreed to adjourn Belmoral's application for an injunction which would enjoin Continental and others from dealing with Belmoral's assets. *********** Bethlehem Steel Corp. of Bethlehem, Pa., announced it had sold its San Francisco ship repair yard to Todd Shipyards Corp. for $14 million. *********** Dome Petroleum Ltd.'s offer to purchase 10 million shares of its Dome Resources Ltd. unit's preferred shares was accepted by the Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges. *********** FMC Corp., a Chicago company, said its FMC Acquisition Corp.  subsidiary had begun a tender offer for 4.1 million shares of R.P.

''I think we have created a monster here, and I'm a little concerned about it.'' **********Mr. Fox and Mr. Borden were among the speakers at seminars before the show, where licensees, along with manufacturers interested in becoming licensees, gathered in hopes of learning how to make the monster their own. **********''You got to think packaging, you got to think product and you got to think promotion,'' Mr. Borden advised.  ''You've got to specify the territory: Where do you want to market your product?'' Mr. Fox said. ''You want exclusivity on a category - not just five-inch dolls, but all dolls. With a nonexclusive license, you're cutting your own throat.'' **********There was recognition that licensing is a mine field. According to Mr. Fox, 75 percent of all licenses fail. ''There aren't that many 'Star Wars' out there,'' he said, referring to the movie that spawned an empire of successful licensed products. **********The timing has to be right. ''I had the Smurfs four years ago,'' Mr. Borden recalled. ''I couldn't give it away.'' Subsequently, after a design change and a Saturday morning television program, the Smurfs became hugely popular. ''I will go down in history as the man who couldn't give the Smurfs away,'' Mr. Borden said. **********''We were late with Mork,'' one licensee ruefully volunteered, referring to the ''Mork and Mindy'' television series, canceled this season. 'Cuteness' Important **********The product has to be right. The attributes of a successful adult property are ''pathos, comedy, drama,'' Mr. Borden said. ''But also cuteness. Snoopy is a perfect example of a character that goes both ways.'' **********There were bad-luck licensing stories. The movie ''Blade Runner,'' after selling a number of licenses, was rated R - a rating that will keep its products off the shelves of K Mart, a major retailer. **********There were ''can-you-top-this?'' licensing stories. Among the 50-odd products licensed for ''Annie'' is a vitamin-packed dog drink. ''Arf 'n' Arf'' is scheduled to be introduced next month. Concern About 'Schlock' **********And there were warnings that licensing could get out of hand through ill-conceived products, and the unlicensed use, or counterfeiting, of trademarks and characters. ''You need an aggressive licensing agent to control it, so schlock doesn't get out there,'' Mr. Fox said. **********At the trade show downstairs, there was licensed schlock aplenty.  There was an overfriendly raccoon, whose antics were largely ignored by the crowd, and an unobtrusive bear in a pink T-shirt. There was an exhibitor who darted into the aisles to stick embroidered appliques onto everybody's name tag. ''Give your products a little character,'' one booth bannered. Another urged, ''Character-ize your merchandise.'' **********Paramount Pictures ran taped excerpts of its new movie - and licensing opportunity - ''Star Trek II.'' Bally Midway Manufacturing, owners of Pac-Man, showed video games. **********Aardvark, a poster publishing company in Bensenville, Ill., tested the licensing market for its prints. ''That would make a nice shower curtain,'' said Gerald McGlothin, the company's owner, of a print of kittens in a teardrop. **********Jared Lee, an Ohio-based artist, urged would-be licensees to consider his humorous drawings of horses. ''The horse craze has been overlooked by most manufacturers,'' Mr. Lee observed in a brochure of his designs, which noted that there are approximately three million horse owners in the United States. **********Although some manufacturers had fretted earlier that the licensing bubble might burst - ''Retailers say, 'I'm being Smurfed to death,' '' one man reported - no one at the show seemed worried by that prospect. **********''We are getting into printed shoelaces, which are getting very big,'' said one licensee.  ''Printed shoelaces?'' his listener said incredulously. ''Is there room to print characters on shoelaces?'' ''A lot of room,'' said the man. ''A lot of room.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/27/business/cone-mills-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONE MILLS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "CONE MILLS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/29/business/hei-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-nov-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 47, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HEI INC reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "print_headline": "HEI INC reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/17/business/varco-international-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 42, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VARCO INTERNATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "VARCO INTERNATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/20/business/finance-briefs-249370.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Houston Industries' subsidiary, the Houston Lighting and Power Company, said it had filed an amendment with the Securities and Exchange Commission lowering from 30 years to 10 years the maturity date of a proposed public offering of $125 million in first mortgage bonds, to be sold through a Dean Witter Reynolds group. *********** Ogle Resources Inc. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer 1 million shares of common stock, probably at between $16 and $18 a share, to be sold through a Dillon, Read & Company group. *********** Standard Motor Products Inc. said it planned, subject to market conditions, to offer publicly 600,000 of its class A capital shares, to be sold through an as-yet-unnamed underwriting syndicate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/14/business/advertising-pepsico-s-taco-bell-unit-drops-grey-advertising.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pepsico's Taco Bell Unit Drops Grey Advertising", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Pepsico's Taco Bell Unit Drops Grey Advertising", "body_text": " **********Taco Bell, which operates 1,500 fast-food restaurants from its Irvine, Calif., headquarters, has split with Grey Advertising in Los Angeles after an eight-year relationship.

There will be a gradual normalization of relations between Egypt and the other Arab nations, the officials say, but there will also be misunderstandings, pressures and friction even with moderate Arab regimes. **********The Kuwait meeting, of a 21-member commission preparing for a full conference of nonaligned nations in September, was the first that a high-level Egyptian delegation has attended in an Arab capital in more than three years. Dr. Ahmed Esmat Abdel Meguid, the leader of the delegation, is a member of the Cabinet of President Hosni Mubarak and Egypt's chief delegate to the United Nations. He played an active part in all phases of the Kuwait meeting. **********It was on his insistence, according to news reports from Kuwait, that a blanket condemnation of the Camp David peace accords between Egypt and Israel was stricken from the final statement and replaced by a phrase expressing ''grave concern'' only over those provisions of the accords ''that purport to determine the future of the Palestinian people.'' Autonomy Talks Attacked **********The conference thereby condemned the Egyptian-Israeli-American talks on autonomy for Palestinians of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip but refrained from attacking Egypt's peace treaty and diplomatic relations with Israel. **********This reflected a joint position that has recently emerged among the Governments of the Persian Gulf countries. Officials there now say it was Egypt's right to recover its territory, Sinai, by making peace with Israel. But they add, referring to Mr. Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar el-Sadat, that they expect that ''Mubarak unlike Sadat will not attempt to speak for the Palestinians.'' **********But Egypt, officials here keep repeating, is determined not only to respect the treaty with Israel but also to continue the talks on Palestinian autonomy no matter how difficult and frustrating they have proved to be. **********Thus a basic conflict remains between Egypt and other moderate Arab capitals on a crucial point.  Cairo officials argue that the autonomy talks are an essential part of the peace process and must be continued, if only to keep the process from grinding to a halt. Egypt reasons that as long as there are talks, Israel is less likely to annex the West Bank or attack Lebanon. While most other Arab capitals take it for granted that Israel will annex the West Bank, Cairo still hopes it will not. **********The Egyptians see continuation of the autonomy talks as a way of proving to the other Arabs that they did not intend simply to make a separate peace with Israel and that they are determined to push for an overall settlement in spite of all the obstacles. Talks Considered Dead **********This has been said publicly by Egyptian leaders and was repeated by Dr. Meguid in Kuwait. Nevertheless, most Arab regimes regard the autonomy talks as dead and expect them to be stopped. If the Egyptians renew them, criticism of Cairo may once again rise. **********In Kuwait, Dr. Meguid obtained a second change in the final statement. The first draft attacked the multinational police force in Sinai as an attempt by NATO ''to impose Camp David on the Middle East.'' The final version deplored the ''deployment of foreign forces on or near the territory of nonaligned countries in the Middle East.'' **********The final phrasing is interpreted here as a slap at the American Rapid Deployment Force and as a warning against any American attempt to extend this force into the Persian Gulf. **********Overall, the outcome of the Kuwait meeting is seen here as a first indication that the contacts between the Egyptians and the other Arabs will grow but that the reconciliation will be slow and difficult."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/08/business/heinz-h-j-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-july-28.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HEINZ, H J, CO reports earnings for Qtr to July 28", "print_headline": "HEINZ, H J, CO reports earnings for Qtr to July 28", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/21/business/american-airlines-falls-50.7.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Pace", "pub_date": "1982-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 375, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERICAN AIRLINES FALLS 50.7%", "print_headline": "AMERICAN AIRLINES FALLS 50.7%", "body_text": " **********American Airlines reported yesterday that it had net income of $17.8 million, or 45 cents a share, in the third quarter, down 50.7 percent from $36.1 million, or $1.13 a share, in the third quarter last year, when there was an extraordinary credit of $21.7 million. **********The company said that its third-quarter revenues were $1.13 billion, up 1.8 percent from $1.11 billion.

The settlement announced Friday would amend that decree, thus permitting the giant corporation to enter such unregulated and rapidly growing fields as data processing, computer-to-computer communication, distribution of information to homes, and the sale of a variety of terminal equipment. **********The ruling by Judge Greene surprised more than 100 Justice Department and phone company lawyers who had gathered in his courtroom. Nevertheless, there were no indications in today's proceedings that Judge Greene would reject the settlement after he has completed his review. **********Judge Greene said that by filing the proposed settlement in Newark as only an amendment to the 1956 consent decree, the two sides - intentionally or not - may have circumvented a Federal law that requires a 60-day period for public comment. ''I think that law applies,'' he said. He argued that the settlement should have been filed in his District Court as well as the Newark court. Public Hearing Possible **********In his ruling, Judge Greene instructed the lawyers to have the settlement transferred to him by next Monday so that he could study it and possibly allow the public to comment on it before deciding whether the settlement is in the public interest. **********The lead attorneys - George Saunders for A.T.& T. and Gerald Connell of the Justice Department's antitrust division - told Judge Greene that their plan was to have Judge Biun no approve the transfer of jurisdiction over the proposed settlement to Judge Greene's court so that he would be able to administer its te rms. **********Upon approval, the agreement gives A.T.& T. six months to develop a divestiture plan. The agreement gives the company 18 months - including the six months of planning - to carry out the divestiture. **********The ruling today, however, raised questions about when the 18 months would begin - from the day Judge Greene dismisses the case, or from Judge Biunno's approval yesterday of the settlement as an amendment to the 1956 consent decree. Provision for Hearing **********Judge Greene said he was convinced that the parties, contrary to their protestations that Judge Biunno's action surprised them, had framed the settlement as a technical amendment to the 1956 consent decree so it could be handled in Newark and remain free of the Tunney Act's provisions. **********The Tunney Act calls for hearings on such a settlement so that third parties can offer suggestions or objections and then allows a judge to acce pt or reject it in the public interest. **********In today's court session, the lawyers for both sides asserted that the judge's assignment was a simple one - just to drop the case, as agreed by the Government and Bell last Friday. Then Judge Greene called a recess ''for about 35 minutes so that I may prepare some thoughts.'' **********He returned in 40 minutes and read from a hand-written statement.  It seemed to be a valedictory, congratulating Mr. Saunders of A.T.& T. for his ''astounding'' performance, praising Mr. Connell of the Justice Department for ''fighting hard'' though outmanned by Bell, recounting statistics about the trial (such as its 350 witnesses and 25,000 pages of transcript) and calling the proposal ''a good settlement.'' The agreement ''solves the core of the complaint,'' Judge Greene added. Then his tone changed as he said he would not dismiss the case. Case 'Too Important' **********The judge said that to do so would be to circumvent the intention of Congress in passing the Tunney Act. He declared, ''This case is too important to the public interest to have it dropped in so haphazard a fashion.'' **********After the proceedings ended, Mr. Saunders said he was unsure what the next step should be. He said he would have to study Judge Greene's order closely and decide what was possible. ''How can we go to Judge Biunno and tell him to undecide the case that he handled just yesterday?'' Mr. Saunders said. ''We did in fact ask his opinion of the settlement.'' **********Repeatedly Judge Greene brought out the fact that Judge Biunno had not seen the huge volume of evidence about Bell and the Government's complaint that was presented before the Washington court during the trial. ''After all, what have we been doing here for the past 11 months?'' he asked the lawyers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/27/business/west-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WEST CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "WEST CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/04/business/cradle-to-grave-with-prentice-hall-englewood-cliffs-nj.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Pace", "pub_date": "1982-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2070, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J.", "print_headline": "CRADLE TO GRAVE WITH PRENTICE-HALL; ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J.", "body_text": " **********ALMOST from the cradle to the grave, Prentice-Hall Inc., the mammothp ublishing combine, pursues the literate, and even sometimes the a lmost-literate, consumer. **********It is not just that the 17 million tomes in the company's huge warehouse in West Nyack, N.Y., range from Frank Asch's ''Happy Birthday, Moon,'' a young-children's book, to J. Brooke Aker and Robert Schimer's unsentimental opus, ''Profitable Wills and Estates Practice Under the All-New Tax-Law Setup.'' **********For in-between markets, the company turns out books and other materials for the consumer as elementary school pupil, high schooler, college student and businessman or professional. It brightens his retirement with special-interest books on subjects like travel in Spain. It nourishes his spiritual life, along the way, with the works of Norman Vincent Peale. **********And it does all this on a scale that verges on the titanic, when compared to the will-'o-the wisp operations of, say, a regional poetry-publishing house. With revenues of $390.6 million last year, it boasts that it is the country's largest college textbook publisher and second-largest producer of loose-leaf information services dealing with taxation and regulation, one of the three largest publishers of professional books, and one of the dozen largest publishers of textbooks for elementary and secondary schools. THIS diversity makes good sense, in the view of the cautious m anagers who rule the company's destinies from its baronial h eadquarters campus here at Englewood Cliffs. They are aware of the s hifts in the country's population structure as the offspring of the p ostwar baby boom have grown older - and they're aware, too, of the u ncertain outlook for future college enrollments. **********''With diversification,'' says Prentice-Hall's dapper chairman, Frank J. Dunnigan, ''we tend to level out to some extent the ups and downs we would otherwise experience.'' **********Yet Prentice-Hall's brand of diversity has not been working as well as the company would like. Its compounded earnings growth has been 9 percent annually since 1977 - only a modest tally compared to the 18 percent logged by its rival McGraw-Hill, which has diversified more extensively into electronic information-purveying. **********As Rollins Maxwell of E. F. Hutton says: ''Prentice-Hall remains basically a publishing company; it hasn't participated in the sharp earnings growth that some other companies have had in recent years, resulting from applications of new technology to information.'' **********For his part, J. Kendrick Noble Jr., first vice president at Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins, says Prentice-Hall is ''a company with a lot of potential, but for a long time it hasn't shown a great deal of success in putting it all together. Its core business - college textbooks - may not be a growth business, and it has to develop new ways of achieving growth.'' **********To be sure, Prentice-Hall has also made moves into nonprint modes of communication. It operates two small, specialized data banks, for instance, and late in 1979, for $35 million, it acquired Deltak Inc., a leading producer of multimedia training courses in data processing and other fields. **********But, considering the diversity of the company's existing operations, Mr. Noble says: ''I would expect to see somewhat more synergism and a somewhat more forward-looking strategy than I have seen so far.'' **********Prentice-Hall's president, Donald A. Schaefer, takes a rather different view. He cites the company's improved 1981 performance and contends: ''We had to get our ducks in a row, and the sort of thing we did last year was indicative of kind of getting our shop in order, I guess, to move from there.'' **********Last year's profits gained 10 percent to $33.8 million from $30.8 million in 1980. Revenues advanced to $390.6 million from $353.4 million in 1980. **********Diversity helped fatten Prentice-Hall's 1981 revenues, its executives say, with the company benefiting mainly from strong performances by its biggest operations: college textooks, loose-leaf materials and Deltak. Meanwhile, for an undisclosed total, top management was selling off three small book subsidiaries and restructuring some loose-leaf and business-books operations. These units, says Mr. Dunnigan, ''either weren't growing satisfactorily or weren't producing a satisfactory return on our investment.'' **********In comforting contrast, Prentice-Hall's college textbooks brought in revenues of $135 million, the company says, up about 10 percent from 1980. Mr. Schaefer says gratefully: ''We hate to use the term, but it's our cash cow.'' **********One reason the college books did well, he says, was that the company had a good 1981 crop of new titles and of revised editions of old ones. Revenues were buoyed by long-standing big sellers, such as ''Government by the People,'' an introductory Government textbook, which the company says is the country's most widely used work of its kind. About two million copies have been sold since the book first came out in 1952 through the good offices of a diplomatic Prentice-Hall editor, the late William Pullin. MR. PULLIN had learned that two scholars, James MacGregor Burns and J ack W. Peltason, were writing similar introductory Government t extbooks, and he persuaded them to pool their efforts. The r esulting product - with another co-author, Thomas E. Cronin - has p roven so durable that its 11th revised edition came out last year. **********''The beauty of revisions,'' Mr. Schaefer says, ''is that you know the books have already received acceptance in the marketplace.'' By contrast, he says, ''every new book is a gamble; you never know how it's going to be accepted.'' (And Prentice-Hall offerings have yet to surpass the durable fame of Paul A. Samuelson's introductory college economics textbook - published by McGraw-Hill.) **********Sometimes Prentice-Hall makes substantial revisions even before the first edition appears: Mr. Dunnigan says that if an author writes badly, the company is ready ''in effect to write the book for him, if the market is good enough.'' **********Another reason for Prentice-Hall's swelling college book sales, its executives say, is specialization among its sales people. They say that, as far as they know, theirs is the only textbook publishing company with a field staff calling exclusively on community colleges. The colleges which constitute a promising market, especially in recessionary times, when many people turn to vocational training after failing to land jobs. **********Still another reason, says the company's courtly, 69-year-old vice chairman, Howard M. Warrington, is the fact that ''enrollments have held up much better than most of the predictions.'' **********As for Prentice-Hall's sales of what it calls ''business and professional subscription products'' - a heading that includes its loose-leaf materials and Deltak - they rose to $143.3 million last year, up from $121.8 million in 1980. **********Increased loose-leaf sales, Mr. Dunnigan says, were in part a payoff on past efforts ''in the form of new product and improving our marketing efforts,'' as well as the demand for information to explain last year's new tax legislation. And he adds cheerfully: ''Loose-leaf services is a good cash generator, too; it doesn't even have inventory. You get the subscriptions in advance.'' **********Prentice-Hall put out new loose-leaf materials last August about the tax program, as did the Commerce Clearing House, the No. 1 company in that field. Mr. Schaefer says: ''We feel the quality of what we did - the editorial content - was more nearly complete.'' But Commerce Clearing House's view is that their offering was more to the point and that Prentice-Hall's was wordy. **********Deltak also fared well, Prentice-Hall executives report, accounting for 15 percent of total sales in 1981, up from about 13 percent in 1980. It is growing fast, they say, largely because its management has been capitalizing on the growing demand for the kinds of instruction it provides. **********For Prentice-Hall as for other textbook publishers, the year's first quarter is usually slow because campus bookstores have already bought the bulk of their textbooks for the academic year. But the company is predicting record sales and a record net for 1982, despite the lingering recession. **********Yet doubt hangs over the future of domestic college textbook sales, although Prentice-Hall executives say that foreign sales are a promising avenue for growth in that and other areas. SPEAKING of domestic sales, Paine Webber's Mr. Noble says: ''The college textbook market they're in now is a pretty good m arket in the short term, but there are questions about it over the l ife of the decade,'' with student bodies and curricula changing f ast. **********Drexel Burnham Lambert's John S. Reidy emphasizes that if Reagan Administration policies limit or reduce college enrollment, that could curb the growth of college textbook sales. And Mr. Schaefer concedes: ''We don't know what Congress will do as as far as student loan programs are concerned.'' **********The uncertainty about college text sales adds importance to Prentice-Hall's prospects for achieving growth in other fields or through skillful and lucrative interweaving of its existing operations. Synergism is the name of that game, and views differ as to whether Prentice-Hall is playing hard enough. **********Mr. Noble says: ''For example, Deltak uses computers and video cassettes for training purposes. I would think that some of that technology might be applicable to the college market. I would also expect to see Deltak being used, on a greater scale than has been done so far, for marketing materials produced by other Prentice hall units.'' **********For his part, Mr. Schaefer points out that authors of Prentice-Hall books have already been developing Deltak courses - and Deltak authors have written books for Prentice-Hall. He says the company is in fact investigating the possible use of Deltak courses, notably those in computer programming and data processing, in colleges, and particularly at community colleges. It is also looking into adapting and applying computerized instruction methods to professional training - outside the campus - in accounting, law and other areas. **********And it is pondering further acquisitions to accelerate growth. But Mr. Schaefer says: ''We have to get on with it now.''  THE POWER OFPEALE **********For three decades now, Prentice-Hall has been profiting from the power of the Rev. Dr. Norman Vincent Peale.  The company has sold 2.2 million hard-cover copies of the Manhattan Protestant clergyman's biggest best-seller, the inspirational self-help book ''The Power of Positive Thinking.'' It first came out in 1952 and it continues to sell more than 10,000 hardcover copies a year. **********Pondering the durability of ''Power,'' as it is sometimes known at company headquarters, Robert M. Shaw, a veteran Prentice-Hall executive, muses: ''People are trying to cope with change, that's why books of this type are popular - and who's to say it won't swing back'' into a new surge of popularity. **********The book emphasizes the importance of faith in oneself, and it has been followed by numerous works in similar veins by other authors.  All told, more than 18 million copies of it have been sold around the world, not counting sales of the two dozen other Peale works. **********''My books,'' Dr. Peale has noted cheerfully, ''have been published in 33 languages; on some copies the only thing I can recognize is my name.'' **********A perennial message in Dr. Peale's writing is that prayer, faith, and a hopeful attitude can resolve personal problems, and he was something of a trail-blazer in combining religion with psychiatric principles. **********The pull of his prose is such that Prentice-Hall also keeps three of his other inspirational works in print, including ''A Guide to Confident Living,'' another best-seller, which it first brought out in 1948. **********In an effort to capitalize further on the Peale appeal, the company is currently test-marketing editions of some Peale books in what the industry calls ''trade paperback'' format, which is larger than the usual paperback-book size, known as ''mass-market'' format. **********Meanwhile, a mass-market paperback edition of ''Power'' has been being put out by Fawcett Books, which was recently acquired by another paperback firm, Ballantine Books. **********Dr. Peale, now a spry 83 years old, continues as senior minister at Manhattan's Marble Collegiate Church, where he has preached for half a century -and where, in 1971, he spoke at the funeral of an admiring reader, Richard Prentice Ettinger, co-founder and long-time president of Prentice Hall."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/11/business/market-place-factory-built-homes-trend.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Metz", "pub_date": "1982-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 735, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Factory-Built Homes' Trend", "print_headline": "Market Place; Factory-Built Homes' Trend", "body_text": " **********BACK in 1972, Wall Street analysts hailed factory-built homes as one of the premier growth industries of the decade. Before 1973 ended, however, their market had collapsed. **********Now, after eight years of depressed conditions in the industry, things appear to be looking up. Though few persons on Wall Street have noticed, sales of factory-built homes are rising again -spurred by the high cost of site-built homes. **********Not only do site-built homes cost twice as much at the outset but also 16 to 18 percent mortgage money makes them unaffordable for many. **********The factory-built home could become a feasible alternative for many families. These units are no longer made of aluminum and put on wheels. They are built in factories using conventional housing materials such as wood framing. Boxlike in structure, they are relatively small. **********But they are comfortable and durable. More important, they cost about $20 a square foot plus $3 a square foot for foundation and setup - half as much as site-built homes' $40 to $45 a square foot. **********Richard Lilly, research director for Raymond James & Associates of St. Petersburg, Fla., said the average conventional home has three bedrooms and two baths and contains 1,600 square feet. At $40 a square foot, that is $64,000 plus about $10,000 for a quarter-acre lot, totaling $74,000. **********Factory-built homes, which must be trucked to the site, are smaller than conventional homes, partly from necessity. The typical multisection factory-built home would contain 1,100 square feet, including three small bedrooms and two small baths. To the $22,000 cost, add $3,000 for foundation and setting up as well as $8,000 more for a fifth of an acre. Total: $33,000. Mr. Lilly favors the Zimmer Corporation, a Florida company that builds such units. **********Noting that conventional housing starts have slumped to 1 million units from 1.5 million to 2.5 million in the 1970's, he said many families could no longer afford conventional housing. **********Factory-built housing peaked at 576,000 units in 1972, falling thereafter by more than half. Last year 240,000 units were sold, and this year's pace is similar. But Mr. Lilly, who is looking for a break in mortgage rates, expects demand to improve dramatically before the end of the year. **********He thinks 13 to 14 percent mortgage money is a ''strong probability'' for the second half, and those rates would bring heavy demand for factory-built units, he suggests. **********In New York, mortgage rates have dropped as much as one and a half percentage points over the last month. Starting today, Citibank is offering 15 1/2 percent money on six-month adjustable-rate mortgages. It had been getting 16 1/2 percent. **********Mr. Lilly noted that factory-home mortgage rates typically bear a 100 basis point premium, reflecting their origin as mobile homes.  Even so, he believes factory-built homes will experience their best years in the mid- to late 1980's. Zimmer, based in Pompano Beach with factories all over the nation, has more than doubled its homebuilding capacity in the last two years and has good distribution, he said. **********Mr. Lilly expects Zimmer to earn $1.15 a share this year and $1.80 a share in 1983. Ziller earned $1.11 a share in 1981.  He called Zimmer ''a capacity play.'' As Zimmer begins to utilize its production capacity, the company could earn $4 to $9 a share by the mid- to late 1980's, he said. At the current price, the shares are selling at 9 times his estimated 1982 earnings. In yesterday's trading on the American Stock Exchange, Zimmer closed at 10 3/8, down 1/8. **********The Value Line Investment Survey, which favors Zimmer, warns that the shares are volatile and notes that they are well above the year's low of 6 3/4 set in February. **********Mr. Lilly is not as impressed with other well-positioned companies that build factory homes. They include Fleetwood Enterprises, Liberty Homes, Champion Homebuilders, Oakwood Homes, Tidwell Industries and Ocilla Industries. **********David V. Jackson of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards said that Fleetwood Enterprises was a pioneer in ''manufactured housing.'' He is neutral on Fleetwood and other companies in the industry but is inclined to take a more positive stance once interest rates show signs of dropping to 13 percent or less. This is necessary, in his view, to stimulate consumer demand."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/28/business/japan-s-supercomputer-push.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1982-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1469, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAPAN'S SUPERCOMPUTER PUSH", "print_headline": "JAPAN'S SUPERCOMPUTER PUSH", "body_text": " **********Japanese computer manufacturers, with the aid of their Government, are moving ahead in an ambitious effort to surpass American companies in building high-speed computers vital to national security, according to officials, industry and university scientists in the United States. **********The rapid Japanese advance has raised the possibility that the United States could become dependent on a foreign supplier for socalled supercomputers, which are used in weapons development as well as many nonmilitary research applications. The situation is likely to spark renewed debate within the United States about the proper American response to Japanese industrial efforts. **********A panel of American computer scientists, in a report that will soon be made public, is urging that the Government undertake a national program to spur development of such supercomputers, which are the fastest calculating machines on earth. Such a program, if adopted, would be one of the first in which the Government, industry and universities collaborate to counter Japanese moves, which are seen as having been so successful in part because of close cooperation between business and Government there. **********Parallel to Semiconductors **********''The argument is that in absence of a coordinated Government effort, the Japanese will repeat in computer systems what they did in semiconductors,'' said Kent K. Curtis, head of the computer science section in the National Science Foundation's divison of mathematical sciences and computer sciences, in one of a dozen interviews in which officials discussed Japanese advances in making and marketing supercomputers. **********Mr. Curtis was referring to the success Japanese electronics companies have had in selling an important computer memory chip, the 64K random access memory. The Japanese have won more than half of that market, which is expected to grow to $1 billion in annual sales in a few years. **********Supercomputers are extremely expensive, selling for $5 million to $15 million each, and are designed for large scientific problems involving numerous calculations. They can perform, in some cases, more than 100 million arithmetic operations a second, making them 3 to 100 times faster than the largest general-purpose business computers made by companies such as the International Business Machines Corporation. **********There were 50 such supercomputers in use as of last June, largely in national laboratories and other Government facilities. They are used for nuclear weapons design, fusion energy research, weather forecasting and, it is believed, for intelligence and code-breaking by the National Security Agency. They are also employed increasingly in industry for tasks such as designing aircraft wings and simulating oil reservoirs. Many of the problems are so complex, involving billions of calculations, that they keep even a supercomputer busy for hours. Japanese Entry Into Market **********Virtually all supercomputers have been made by two American companies, Cray Research Inc. and the Control Data Corporation, both of Minneapolis. Recently, however, two Japanese companies, Hitachi Ltd. and Fujitsu Ltd., have introduced supercomputers that are roughly comparable in performance to the American models. **********Moreover, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry this year began a project to develop by the end of the decade a machine capable of performing 10 billion operations a second, 100 times faster than the Cray machine, according to American scientists who have visited Japan. **********The program, in which Japan's six largest computer companies are cooperating, involves financing of $100 million to $200 million a year for eight years, the scientists say. The Japanese also have a separate project to develop a so-called fifth-generation computer, which in addition to being fast would be capable of tasks such as understanding speech, making the machines extremely easy to use. **********The still unpublished report on the supercomputer situation has been prepared for the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense by a group of 15 scientists and engineeers from universities and national laboratories headed by Peter D. Lax, a professor of mathematics at New York University's Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences. **********The panel was established in part to explore how university researchers could get access to supercomputers, which are becoming vital for basic research.  The panel, which includes Kenneth G.  Wilson of Cornell University, who last week won the Nobel Prize in Physics, recommends that a program to provide such access be established. Keeping Pace With Japan **********But the panel also became concerned about development of future faster computers and questioned whether American manufacturers could keep pace with the Japanese. **********The report does not make specific recommendations other than calling for a national program involving Government agencies, the national laboratories, industry and universities, according to several members of the committee. However, an appendix suggests that five separate projects be set up to work on advanced computers, that each project involve a consortium of universities and computer companies and that each receive financing of $5 million a year for five years, Professor Lax said. **********Concern over Japanese inroads in supercomputers was spurred last spring when teams of scientists from Los Alamos, N.M., and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories visited Japanese computer centers.  The reports of the scientists suggested the Japanese could surpass the American companies and the labs, which design nuclear weapons, would have to buy from the Japanese. **********''That jolted a lot of people,'' said Jacob T. Schwartz, a professor at the Courant Institute and member of the Lax committee.  ''Historically Los Alamos has always gone for the biggest and fastest computers available,'' said Bill L. Buzbee, assistant director of the Los Alamos computer division. ''We would prefer to buy American, but if the biggest and fastest computers were foreign, we would certainly have to consider them.'' Worries About Competition **********Mr. Buzbee said the laboratory was concerned that if foreign companies assume leadership in supercomputers, they might not sell the newest computers to American customers for several years, for political or competitive reasons or because they had to satisfy their home market first. **********There is at least one precedent: In the late 1960's, the United States Government barred I.B.M. and Control Data from selling France large computers for nuclear weapons development. **********The call for a Government-sponsored effort rests on the assumption that industry will not be able to or will not care to take the risks involved to develop radical new approaches that some scientists say would be needed to achieve thousand-fold increases in computer speed. **********That recommendation is not likely to find favor in the Reagan Administration, which is emphasizing private enterprise and is trying to cut the Federal budget. **********''I have not seen any basis for justifying a massive Federal effort,'' said N. Douglas Pewitt, assistant director for general science in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, who said he is familiar with the Lax committee work but has not seen its final report. Mixed Feelings of Makers **********''The reaction that we have to counter the Japanese plan by becoming Japanese ourselves is not going to wash. That's not going to find much support in this Administration,'' Dr. Pewitt said. **********The supercomputer manufacturers, which have reviewed the Lax committee work, have mixed feelings, applauding the interest shown by the Government but questioning the specific approach. **********''It's about the first time the Government is beginning to focus on the supercomputer area,'' said Lloyd M. Thorndyke, senior vice president for technology at Control Data. ''Before that it's been almost benign neglect.'' He said the company thinks a Government effort is ''in the national good. Just how is the question.'' **********Mr. Thorndyke and Peter A. Gregory, vice president of planning and corporate development for Cray, said the Government should establish a market for supercomputers, either by promising to buy computers of certain specifications or by helping universities purchase supercomputers, and let the companies satisfy the market need. **********Both Mr. Thorndyke and Mr. Gregory said the Government should concentrate on sponsoring development of high speed micro-electronic circuits that would be the building blocks of future high-speed computers, while leaving the computer companies to design and build the computers. **********''I'm less anxious to have 10 universities working on design of computers. I don't think that will be that valuable,'' Mr. Gregory said. The computer makers also take issue with the technological approach to faster computing advocated by the Lax panel. **********The recommendations come at a time when American electronics companies themselves are banding together to share basic research and better compete with the Japanese. In the past year, two organizations have been formed by the companies to share research expenses, in part by funneling research money to the universities. But while cooperating among themselves, the companies have so far spurned direct Government involvement in their activities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/02/world/12-die-in-philippine-floods.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "12 Die in Philippine Floods", "print_headline": "12 Die in Philippine Floods", "body_text": " **********Twelve people were killed in floods in the southern Philippines, including six who drowned in a bus when the driver tried to cross a creek, the state press agency reported today.

ASSEMBLY AGAIN BIDS SOVIET QUIT AFGHANISTAN", "body_text": " **********The General Assembly, by a vote of 114 to 21, renewed its demand today that Soviet troops withdraw from Afghanistan. **********Despite the large majority, the outcome was a mild disappointment to Pakistan and other prime movers of the resolution because the number of nations in favor fell two below the total recorded last year. The Pakistanis had sought to increase the number to heighten the ''moral pressure'' for ''an early political settlement,'' in the words of Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, Pakistan's Foreign Minister. **********Even so, the Soviet Union could take little comfort from the result. The number of countries voting with Moscow also fell by two, perhaps reflecting the long holiday weekend and the absence of some small delegations. Most painful of all from Moscow's standpoint, 63 nations from those grouped as nonaligned voted with the majority and only 12 with the Soviet Union. Twelve others were among the 13 that abstained. **********This was the fourth time in three years that the Assembly had called for ''immediate withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan'' and insisted on the right of Afghans ''to determine their own form of government.'' During this time, the Soviet Union has increased its troops to a total now estimated at 105,000 in a so far fruitless effort to subdue Afghan insurgents. Vote Dismissed by Soviet **********Oleg A. Troyanovsky, the Soviet delegate, dismissed the Assembly effort as an ''artificial hue and cry'' and a diversion from ''really burning issues.'' But despite the seemingly futile exercise here, United Nations officials and Asian diplomats believe they see signs that Moscow wants to find a graceful way out that would leave its interests in Afghanistan intact. **********At the Assembly's urging, an Under Secretary General, Diego Cordovez, has been mediating between Pakistan and the Soviet-backed Government in Afghanistan, seeking a political formula to end the conflict and enable the Soviet forces to leave. Mr. Troyanovsky had approving words for these talks. **********''We are pleased to note the preliminary outcome has, on the whole, been commended by the parties directly concerned,'' he said. ''It is important that the opportunity of making further progress and achieving mutually acceptable agreements is not missed.'' Pakistani Sees Progress **********For Pakistan, Foreign Minister Yaqub Khan echoed this theme. ''The indirect talks,'' he said, ''were of a constructive nature'' and ''represented some tentative progress, particularly in regard to the elements which should form the basis of a comprehensive settlement.'' **********The Pakistani minister said that the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan ''has damaged the process of detente and heightened global tension.'' Neither he nor the Assembly resolution mentioned the Soviet Union by name. **********Mr. Yaqub Khan asserted that the struggle against the Russians was being conducted by Afghans, not, as the Soviet Union charges, by American-supplied ''terrorists'' operating from bases in Pakistan.  ''Neither the coercive force of sophisticated weapons nor the might of a superpower has been able to extinguish the spirit of the Afghan people to assert their freedom,'' he said. **********Ending the debate, Tommy T.B. Koh of Singapore described the Soviet intervention as a ''litmus test of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union.'' Mr. Koh said it demonstrated Moscow's willingness to breach the United Nations Charter because ''force is being used to subjugate the people of Afghanistan.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/17/business/finance-briefs-256480.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 378, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Bank of Nova Scotia said Petralgas Chemicals N.Z.

The ministry announcement said that Lieut. Col. Herbert Jones, 42 years old, died in action around Goose Green. **********The large number of prisoners reported taken by the British Friday appeared to be a result of a twin-pronged offensive against Darwin and Goose Green that surprised and encircled the Argentine positions, in part with the assistance of landing craft, according to background accounts provided by British officials. The two settlements lie two miles apart along a narrow isthmus about 20 miles south of the British beachhead around San Carlos Bay. **********Radio Contact Reported Lost **********In a communique issued late tonight, the Argentine military command said that 800 Argentine troops resisted the attack ''in spite of being fully inferior in number'' and that at midday, ''radio contact with them was lost and has not been re-established.'' (Page 16.) **********According to reports in London tonight, Colonel Jones died when he led a small group of his men in an attack on an Argentine machine-gun nest. Also during the assault, according to the reports, some members of the Argentine garrison at Goose Green raised the white flag of surrender and then opened fire on paratroopers. **********Earlier, Darwin had been retaken with ''little trouble,'' according to the officials. All told, Friday's fighting -involving marines and the Second Battalion of the Parachute Regiment -lasted ''many hours'' and included bombardment by 105-millimeter howitzers of the Royal Artillery, military officials said. **********The reported British victory over the second largest concentration of Argentine troops in the Falklands appeared to have positioned British forces for a final assault on Stanley. **********As Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher remained at her country residence, Chequers, for the weekend, troops of the Royal Engineers were reported to be restoring the small grass airstrip at Goose Green, which will give Britain an important central operating base for its Harrier jumpjets. **********Royal Marines, moving across the marshy ground along a northern route toward Stanley, have reportedly attacked two other small communities, Douglas and Teal Inlet. There were unconfirmed reports that both had been captured. Teal Inlet is about halfway to Stanley. **********Publicly, the Ministry of Defense has released few details of Friday's battle and no casualty figures have been disclosed.''We do not have information yet about the extent of British or Argentine casualties,'' Ian McDonald, the Defense Ministry spokesman, said tonight. ''A detailed statement will be made about our own casualties when next of kin have been informed.'' **********A variety of tributes to Colonel Jones were offered tonight. Mrs.  Thatcher said she deeply regretted the loss of ''this truly valiant and courageous officer who was loved by his men.'' And a fellow parachute leader said, ''He was the sort of officer who believed in leading from the front.'' **********A spokesman said this morning that one Argentine Pucara airplane was shot down Friday near Goose Green. The downing of the plane brought Argentina's aircraft losses to 67, according to the British count. Britain has acknowledged losing 15 planes and helicopters and listed 115 men killed or missing before the latest ground action. British Warships Bombarded **********The Defense Ministry spokesman also said today that British warships bombarding Argentine military installations around Stanley Friday came under attack but were not hit. **********Today was also marked by a modest flurry of activity on the diplomatic front. Officials here said that a response had been sent to inquiries by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the United Nations about terms for a cease-fire. The officials said that proposals for ''an honorable cease-fire'' would be considered but that the British insistance on unconditional Argentine withdrawal from the islands must come first. **********The official silence on the military action that began Thursday reflects a British strategy of trying to keep the Argentine forces off balance as to where and when the major British attack will occur. In addition, the British appear to be trying to lure at least some of the Argentine troops out of Stanley for a battle under circumstances more favorable to the British. **********The Darwin-Goose Green area is about 50 miles from Stanley across low-lying and open country. Most of the route, which would be the easiest way for the British forces to cover the distance to the capital, is just a track, but the last 13 miles are over an improved road with drainage ditches. British forces would have to contend with possible Argentine positions in the hills as they approached Stanley. **********Meanwhile, 3,000 soldiers who traveled to the South Atlantic aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 have reportedly been transferred to military vessels - including the assult ships Intrepid and Fearless - in preparation for an amphibious landing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/23/world/us-asks-more-aides-to-leave-buenos-aires.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 94, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Asks More Aides To Leave Buenos Aires", "print_headline": "U.S. Asks More Aides To Leave Buenos Aires", "body_text": " **********The United States is sharply reducing the number of officials and dependents at the American Embassy in Buenos Aires because of tensions with Argentina over the Falkland Islands conflict, a State Department spokesman said today. **********The temporary removal of certain ''nonessential'' personnel began several weeks ago and more will leave in the next few days, said Rush Taylor, a department press officer. **********''All dependents have been asked to leave temporarily,'' Mr. Taylor said.As of May 4, there were 79 American staff members at the embassy and about 100 employees."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/26/business/real-estate-preservation-of-ambiance-in-manhattan.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Oser", "pub_date": "1982-11-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 905, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Real Estate; PRESERVATION OF AMBIANCE IN MANHATTAN", "print_headline": "Real Estate; PRESERVATION OF AMBIANCE IN MANHATTAN", "body_text": " **********THE man who built the new condominium called the Viscaya on East 71st Street thinks there will never be another building like it on the Upper East Side, and it is hard to argue with him. **********Under the rules of the Upper East Side Historic District, no new building can be taller than six stories. The Viscaya is 21 stories tall. No doubt the project would not have been attempted at all if it had started after the historic district legislation went into effect in May 1981. **********But Harold Lynn bought the town house at 110 East 71st Street well before that, intending to plunge into his first new construction venture in Manhattan. With two investment partners and the Architects Design Group handling the design, he has produced one of the city's most unusual new condominiums, now on the market at prices ranging mostly between $587,000 and $675,000. **********Mr. Lynn, who is 45 years old, was an importer of women's clothing until five years ago. Then he sold his business and retired. For two years he traveled. Later he bought an apartment for himself in a building undergoing a renovation, and he found that the process fascinated him. **********So the idea of developing his own building was strongly in his mind when he bought the five-story building on 71st Street, just east of the cooperative at 733 Park Avenue, from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. As an admirer of the gracious character of the turn-of-the-century houses on the street, he also wanted to preserve that ambiance. He found a way. **********''One night I was having dinner and pondering how to get 17 stories to mesh with the old building,'' he said. ''I drew a picture on a napkin of a tower rising out of pillars, leaving a gap at the roof of the existing building for a roof garden.'' **********That is essentially what came about. The facade of the town house was left intact for the 30-foot frontage on the street back to a depth of 20 feet. The rest was sheared off to create the site for the new tower. Then the lower floors were built to meet the floors in the town houses, creating the floors for five apartments of 1,350 to 2,250 square feet. One duplex apartment has a private rear garden of 900 square feet. **********The town house was raised one floor, and on the reinforced roof the builder has produced an elaborately landscaped garden for the use of all the condominium owners. At this level as well, the Viscaya has a lobby for the tower portion of the building. The tower floors begin 30 feet above the roof level of the town house, set back 30 feet from the street, giving the impression from below that the two elements are barely connected. The tower seems almost to be floating on air. **********The tower floors total 1,500 gross square feet, and there is both a tenants' elevator and a service elevator. The two-bedroom, twobath apartments have about 1,200 square feet of living space.  There is one apartment per floor, with a continuous band of window around them. The selling prices average about $450 a square foot. **********''On a purely economic basis, nobody would build this building,'' said Mr. Lynn. ''It would be cheaper to knock down the old building and build new.'' **********Knocking down the town house would have cost less than $100,000.  Instead, Macar Contracting's workmen did the partial demolition by hand, using jackhammers and chisels to chip away walls two feet thick at the rear of the town house. **********The Buildings Department would not allow the use of a crane on the narrow residential midblock. So hoists had to be used by the men who poured the concrete floors. **********Mr. Lynn is a man with a taste for Renaissance painting as well as cooking and old automobiles. He once kept a collection of 19 antique cars at a home in Kings Point, L.I. His past experience in construction has been in homes for family use - a 200-year-old barn in Kings Point that was converted into a contemporary house and, earlier, a contemporary house in Roslyn, L.I. **********''Get your plans 100 percent set before you build,'' he said.  ''Don't make changes as you go along.'' **********This advice comes only after his experience at the Viscaya, however. He said he changed the layout of apartments in the tower significantly after construction started. When he saw how the apartment looked, for example, he didn't like the location of a bathroom. He changed it to provide direct access from the master bedroom. The room had basically been installed on all floors when he made the decision. As a result, plumbing lines and electrical fixtures had to be changed. He also decided belatedly to install washers and dryers. **********The building was given a 20 percent floor-area bonus - three floors - in exchange for a donation of $70,000 to a special parks improvement district, a device by which the city offered zoning bonuses to builders who contributed toward various public improvements. **********Mr. Lynn is already negotiating to buy another property. He wants to build again, but nothing run-of-the-mill.

Last week he was transferred from his prison cell in Chongju, 70 miles south of Seoul, to a heavily guarded room in the National University Hospital in the capital. **********The South Korean Government made no immediate announcement about Mr. Kim's departure, which was said to have taken place at 7:30 P.M.  Seoul time (5:30 A.M., New York time). Reporters were barred from the airport area just before Mr. Kim's flight left. **********(Mr. Kim arrived at National Airport in Washington Thursday night and demanded that ''all democratic patriots in prison'' in South Korea be released. It was not clear whether he was aware that during his flight to Washington the Seoul Government announced that more than 1,200 prisoners, including seven people convicted with Mr. Kim in 1980, had been freed under a Christmas amnesty. Page A4.) **********The decision to free Mr. Kim, which came as a surprise when reports of it first circulated last week, came after many months of quiet effort by the Reagan Administration to persuade President Chun Doo Hwan to act. Talks on the subject were conducted by the American Ambassador to South Korea, Richard L. Walker. Mr. Kim's wife, Lee Hee Ho, who is 60 years old, said in an interview last week that South Korean authorities were forcing her husband into political exile against his will. She said that arrangements for their departure had been made between the United States andSeoul and that the Kim family had not been told until the last moment. **********Officials and friends of the Kim family say that Mr. Chun has in effect banished Mr. Kim from South Korea, since the opposition figure has apparently received no guarantee that he can return to Seoul as long as Mr. Chun is President. Mr. Chun's first term is not up until 1988.Calmer Political Atmosphere **********United States officials had long favored Mr. Kim's release, believing him not guilty of the sedition charges, which grew out of a civil uprising that Mr. Kim was accused of ''masterminding'' in the southwest city of Kwangju in May 1980. He was sentenced to death in 1980, but that sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in January 1981, just before President Chun paid an official visit to the United States. Last March the sentence was reduced to 20 years. **********American officials here and in Seoul made it clear that President Chun's decision to free Mr. Kim could make for a calmer political atmosphere in South Korea, where about 40,000 United States troops are based. The Communist Government in North Korea found the Kim case of great propaganda value. **********By suddenly moving to free Mr. Kim - Mr. Chun is said to detest Mr. Kim personally - diplomats believe that the President has seized the initiative in South Korean politics and to have made a positive impression abroad. **********In return for freeing Mr. Kim, the Seoul authorities required that he go to the United States for medical treatment with his wife and two of their three sons. Otherwise, it was implied to the family, Mr. Kim would remain in detention, either in a hospital ward or in prison, serving out his 20-year sentence.To the Airport by Ambulance **********People close to the Kims say that the implicit threat may have been a bluff but that the Kims have been worn down by years of pressure.  Mr. Kim at first refused the offer, according to South Korean church officials close to him, because he preferred to stay in South Korea for an operation for arthritis, which is said to affect his legs. But under what people close to the family say was intense pressure, with Mr. Kim isolated in a hospital ward, he finallyagreed to the terms of his release. **********Kim Hong Il, Mr. Kim's oldest son, was quoted today as saying that his father and other family members went to the airport in an ambulance. He said he had been told he would be able to see his father at the airport but that he was unable to say farewell to him there. **********Mr. Chun, diplomats say, seems to have arrived at his decision by a gradual process of learning his way in office as leader of a nation of 38 million people. Mr. Chun moved brusquely and sometimes brutally when he seized power in May 1980, still then in uniform as a three-star general of military intelligence at the head of an army junta. **********He was surrounded by army officers, ruled South Korea under martial law and at once arrested his main rival, Mr. Kim. Before long Mr. Kim faced a death sentence for sedition, although the ground for conviction seemed slender to many South Koreans, and the court never published the record. The Chun Government has still not clarified in public the ground on which army courts sentenced Mr. Kim to death. **********United States pressure on Mr. Chun to commute the sentence and to consider releasing Mr. Kim began in the last months of the Carter Administration. Yet officials close to the case say that Mr. Chun reached his decision by taking advice not only from Americans but from his personal staff. **********Mr. Kim is likely to have to struggle in the United States. He has little money, few supporters and no grass-roots organization. He might languish in exile, like the Philippine opposition leader Benigno S. Aquino Jr., who, once removed to the United States, proved an ineffective rival to President Ferdinand E. Marcos.----1,200 Others Freed **********SEOUL, South Korea, Friday, Dec. 24 (Reuters) - The South Korean Government today released more than 1,200 prisoners today in a Christmas amnesty, the Ministry of Information announced. **********The move followed the suspension of a 20-year sedition sentence on Kim Dae Jung, who was allowed to fly to the United States on Thursday. **********Information Minister Lee Jin Hie said the amnesty included seven people convicted with Mr. Kim in 1980.

Aneiro, president of the development corporation, said it had lessened the yard's serious financial problems - it lost $1.2 million in the fiscal year 1981 - brought on by haphazard recordkeeping, a large indebtedness to Con Edison, and an unwillingness to do basic maintenance work. The facility will show a loss for the current fiscal year of less than half that amount, he said. The city receives 10 percent of the facility's rental income, which last year amounted to $4 million, but is also accountable for any losses. **********Mr. Lenefsky said that the yard was becoming financially healthy.  He added that it finally had the foundation to lure businesses by attending to ''years of neglect.'' **********The board has removed nearly 12 million pounds of garbage strewn about the yard, some of which apparently had been there since the Navy left in 1966. It has also repaired potholes, a pipe leak that allowed water to flow into the East River at the rate of 1.4 million gallons a year, and a dilapidated steam-distribution system. In addition, it has substantially renovated two of the site's four major buildings. **********Mr. Lenefsky said the cleanup had emphasized what he described as the yard's attractiveness for businesses: the steam generation system that will enable businesses to buy energy at reasonable rates, a completely fenced installation patrolled by a 24-hour private security force, and a location near major roads, public transit, and, of course, the water. **********Since November 1981, when the development corporation took over, the yard's tenancy has increased by 20 percent, to 45 businesses, and the work force has grown to 2,200 from 1,700. **********Tenants include a printing company, a maker of hand-made pewter, a vermouth bottler, and a forging company. The yard's largest employer is the Coastal Dry Dock and Repair Corporation, a ship repair company with 1,200 employees. **********About 4.1 million of the 4.3 million square feet of indoor space is now rented, and nearly half of the remaining space may be taken soon, Mr. Aneiro said. Rents at the yard are about $2.65 a square foot. **********That figure does not include utility costs. For those tenants who leased space during 1982, before the new steam plant went into operation, the development corporation set a flat fee of 65 cents a square foot for utility costs, which Mr. Lenefsky said was below that of other parks. Tenants who had been in the park were billed at rates 5 percent below the comparable Con Edison charge. New tenants will be metered. **********Not all of the board's plans for the yard have gone smoothly, however. Opposition from neighborhood groups and the Board of Estimate in October forced Mayor Koch to withdraw plans to build a steam plant that would burn 3,000 tons of garbage daily. **********And, although officials hope the yard will attract more businesses fleeing the high commercial rents in lower and midtown Manhattan, its lack of further rentable space - especially if plans for new construction collapse - could seriously hamper recovery plans. **********Mr. Lenefsky said, however, that with tenancy at more than 95 percent: ''We feel the potential of the yard is very strong. It can become the focus for economic and job development in Brooklyn, as it once was.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/26/business/tin-prices-fall-sharply.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 184, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tin Prices Fall Sharply", "print_headline": "Tin Prices Fall Sharply", "body_text": " **********Tin prices plunged today to $14,100 a metric ton, the lowest level since last July, leaving dealers on the London Metal Exchange baffled about the cause of the collapse. **********Surprised tin traders said they were anxiously awaiting the next move by an unknown tin buyer who has kept the market guessing for months. **********Widely believed to be acting on behalf of tin producing countries, the buyer had sent prices soaring to a record high of $16,470 a ton only last week. **********Dealers believe the unknown buyer, who began his purchases last summer, now controls more than 50,000 tons of tin.

''That has been shaken in recent days. **********Address to Jewish Officials **********It was the first time Mr. Haig is known to have criticized the Administration in which he served until June.

Here, too, the former Secretary of State voiced arguments that have also been advanced by Mr. Sharon. **********Mr. Haig saved his heaviest criticism for Mr. Reagan's plan. He said he had explored the record of Camp David carefully and ''Israel never committed itself to terminate permanent settlements on the West Bank.'' **********The West Bank of the Jordan was taken by Israel in the 1967 war; Mr. Reagan has called for a halt to Israeli settlements there, where 25,000 Israelis now live.

Hongkong and Shanghai, one of the most powerful banks in Asia, operates more than 400 offices in 40 countries and is especially strong in the Far East, the Middle East and India. **********Because Federal law prohibits interstate banking, Marine's purchases cannot be consummated until the law changes, but the bank is confident that the change will come in the not-too-distant future.

Marine's return was 47 cents, compared with an average of 53 cents. **********Marine's 1981 results represented a strong turnaround from 1976, for example, when its return on each $100 of assets was 8 cents, but still far from its goal of a 60-cent return by 1984. **********''You've got the momentum from the turnaround, but now they've got to get into the trenches and try to make it work - I don't know if it will fly for them,'' said James J. McDermott, vice president and analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a securities firm that specializes in bank stocks. **********Although it began to recuperate in 1977, Marine's process was agonizingly slow because the bank was caught in the vicious circle of needing capital to produce profits and needing profits to produce capital. ''We were coming back,'' Mr. Duffy said, ''but at a slow pace.'' **********For that reason it turned to Hongkong and Shanghai, which in return for a $236 million injection of capital, obtained control of Marine in 1980 but allowed Mr. Duffy and all senior officers and directors to keep their posts. **********Some analysts, however, are asking whether Marine is merely a tool being used by Hongkong and Shanghai to create a nationwide network in the United States, or whether Marine, indeed, is working on its own. **********Although Marine's management insists that it operates independently -Hongkong and Shanghai ''is aware of our general strategy,'' Mr. Petty said - Lawrence W. Cohn, vice president and bank-stock analyst of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said he recently was told by the Asian bank's chairman that Marine will be Hongkong and Shanghai's vehicle for expansion in the United States. **********But Mr. Duffy said Marine's current approach to forming an interstate unit is the product of the bank's past troubles. ''When, in the 70's, other banks were buying sales finance and mortgage banking companies across the country, we couldn't do that,'' Mr.  Duffy said. **********But, even then, Marine continued to have good relations with its correspondent banks in the United States, which has made the current program possible, he said. In fact, Marine calls its arrangements ''enriched correspondent relationships.'' Pennsylvania and Ohio Banks **********Marine's experience with Hongkong and Shanghai appears to have set the stage for the New York bank's investments in the Industrial Valley National Bank of Pennsylvania and in the Centran Corporation of Ohio. **********Industrial Valley is the 12th-largest banking company in Pennsylvania, with 48 offices throughout the southeastern part of the state. Centran, which has $3 billion in assets, owns the Central National Bank of Cleveland and five other Ohio banks. **********Like the Marine of the 1970's, both Industrial Valley and Centran were badly in need of additional capital and were anxious to avoid having to be merged into another organization, which could have jeopardized the jobs of their top managers and directors. **********In return for options to buy their stocks, if and when Federal law permits, the Philadelphia and Cleveland banks got badly needed capital and promises that their managements would be retained. **********Hongkong and Shanghai seems to be continuing to supply Marine with an abundant amount of long-term capital to finance additional acquisitions. Only last month, for example, the Asian bank lent Marine another $50 million for 10 years, even though the bank has not made full use of the previous injection of capital. ''It could be said that Marine is overcapitalized,'' said Mr. Cohn of Dean Witter. **********In addition to the similarity between the Hongkong-Marine deal and the agreements Marine has been striking with out-of-state banks, some analysts also see an uncanny similarity between the nationwide banking federation Marine is seeking to form and its own development from a group of commonly owned banks in New York State that merged into a single bank in 1976. Different Personalities **********Another similarity is the persistence of two distinct personality types among its senior management - the country-style banker, represented at the holding company level, and the more urbane executive found at Marine's New York City unit. Marine executives agree that big differences in style still exist among its top officers, but claim that they work smoothly as a team. **********Mr. Duffy, who is 55 years old, is basically a country boy who rose from the ranks of one of Marine's relatively small affiliates, in Watertown, N.Y. He lacks the image of a big-time banker, but officers say there is no doubt he is strongly in command, that he has been chiefly responsible for the comeback and that he is Marine's link with Hongkong and Shanghai. **********In contrast, Mr. Petty, 52, who joined Marine in 1976, had been a partner in Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb and before that had spent six years in the Treasury Department under Presidents Johnson and Nixon.  Between 1968 and 1972 he was Assistant Secretary for International Affairs. **********Another senior executive vice president, the 41-year-old W. James Tozer Jr., spent most of his careet at Citicorp, and has developed a highly sophisticated strategy for the bank, including its thrust beyond New York. **********Eugene T. Mann, 51, another senior executive vice president, falls among Marine's more earthy types and, in fact, has moved to Buffalo, to which he has developed a strong loyalty. He boasts of having ''repossessed cars in Flushing'' and of having ''opened a hot dog bar in the Rockaways,'' before he joined Marine. **********''We have had our dreamers who thought they could do exotic things,'' Mr. Mann said of Marine's former senior officers.  ''Today,'' he continued, ''we don't have dreamers, we have professional managers who want to get ahead.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/09/business/prospects.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1982-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 742, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROSPECTS", "print_headline": "PROSPECTS", "body_text": " **********An Interest Rate Window **********If the foreign-exchange and bond markets are to be believed, the prime interest rate - which for six months has remained remarkably steady - may be about to drop. The banks' cost of funds has edged down, and analysts say that in the short term, the current optimism over rates may be justified. **********Expectations of further declines in the money supply, a budget compromise, more good news on inflation and bad news on the economy have sent the dollar lower and bond prices higher in recent days.  And, with Treasury Department borrowings likely to remain relatively light this month and next, the prime rate could fall by as much as 1 1/2 percentage points, says William N. Griggs, a senior vice president at Schroder Bank. Given current conditions, one might expect even bigger declines, but short-term business borrowings remain very high. **********The interest rate dip is not likely to persist, Mr. Griggs predicts. Financing the July tax cuts and increases in Social Security payments should send Treasury borrowings up into the $100 billion range during the second half. In conjunction with a tepid recovery, those financings should move rates back up in the 16 to 18 percent range by year-end, he says. Producer Prices to Rise **********It's nice while it lasts. After two straight months of declines, analysts say, April's Producer Price Index, due to be released Friday, is likely to remain unchanged. The reason is that energy prices are inserted into the **********P.P.I. with a one-month lag, so the 4 percent energy price drop in March will show up in April to help offset a rise in food prices, according to Jason Benderly, an economist at the Washington Analysis Corporation, a Bache subsidiary. Again because of energy, Mr.Benderly says the May figures are likely to be flat. Starting in June, however, the picture is likely to change, as food, energy and manufacturing prices all begin to post increases of 6 to 8 percent.  For the third quarter, producer prices could show an increase of 7 percent on average, before easing in the fourth. An increase that large would be welcome for businesses, whose cash flow has been hurt by steady declines in producer prices. Labor Stays Weak **********In spite of an occasional double-digit settlement in industries like oil, the wage givebacks and salary freezes in autos, rubber and trucking have dominated the news, and experts say contracts are likely to remain modest for the rest of the year. Indeed, even at a healthy company like General Electric, which must reach a new pact with its 73,000 organized workers by July, the economy is likely to make the unions back off their goals of healthy salary increases. **********The recession and the shake-out in the electronics business should make workers at G.E. and Westinghouse (which follows G.E. in negotiating) more concerned about job security than wage hikes, says Russell Leavitt, an analyst at Smith Barney. **********To raise productivity, both companies are engaged in automating their plants, jeopardizing jobs. And, while G.E.'s first quarter earnings rose 5 percent, the recession has hurt demand for consumer, industrial and utility products. With that demand likely to remain limited, both companies are looking elsewhere for new profits centers. Any wage gains labor wins during these talks, Mr. Leavitt says, are likely to be modest. Export Credit War? **********With the Versailles summit talks a month or so away, a revolt of sorts against the United States' tough monetary policies is likely to occur this week, when members of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development gather in Paris. **********The recession and much lower rates of inflation have failed to bring down interest rates in this country; as a result, international interest rate differentials remain wide. That could greatly complicate renewing an agreement on minimum interest rates governments may charge for export credit programs, says Harald B.  Malmgren, an independent trade consultant. **********Reflecting the high cost of money here, American officials are likely to urge that the floor on export credit rates be raised. With interest rates much lower elsewhere, the Europeans and Japanese may reject such a suggestion and keep rates low, Mr. Malmgren says. That might lead the Commerce Department to view government-backed export projects in the U.S. as subsidies, a violation of international trade regulations. **********Kenneth N.

The merger became effective at 11:59 last night. **********All of Western's deposits and mortgages automatically were assumed by Buffalo Savings at the time of the merger.  Western had 220,000 depositors and held 18,576 mortgages, accordi ng to the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks. Western' s total assets amounted to $1 billion, and its deposits, $875 million . **********To help effect the merger, the F.D.I.C. injected $30 million into the capital structure of Buffalo Savings. The agency said that if instead it had allowed the bank to fail and then paid off its depositors, the total cost to the F.D.I.C. would have been about $210 million. **********As a result of the merger, Buffalo Savings now holds 32 percent of all deposits in the Buffalo metropolitan area. Five other banks, including two commercial banks, reportedly submitted bids to acquire Western. One of the commercial banks was identified as the Bank of New York. It appears that Buffalo Savings made the highest bid and thus required a smaller contribution from the F.D.I.C.

''In Buffalo, you've got Marine Midland, Chase and Citibank, and Manufacturers Hanover, among others.'' **********This was the fourth merger assisted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the past two months. The F.D.I.C. is the Government agency that insures deposits in savings and commercial banks. **********Only a month earlier, Buffalo Savings acquired the Union Dime Savings Bank of New York, another institution that had been in danger of failing. Union Dime had assets of $1.4 billion. In other recent F.D.I.C.-assisted mergers of failing New York savings banks, the Metropolitan Savings Bank acquired the Greenwich, and the Harlem Savings Bank acquired the Central. **********Compared with the three other savings bank mergers, which together cost the F.D.I.C. almost $1 billion, the Western merger was relatively inexpensive. It was also simpler - the agency merely paid $30 million and walked away. In the other mergers, the F.D.I.C.  assumed long-term obligations in which it guaranteed the acquiring banks against any losses stemming from the acquisitions. **********Western, however, appears to have been in better shape. Some sources said that it was basically sound, but that for technical reasons it was about to default on $10.5 million in notes held in unit investment trusts operated by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. One clause of the notes stipulated that they would be in default if Western's capital fell below $30 million. It dropped below that level in the fourth quarter, and therefore, the bank automatically defaulted. **********As part of the agreement, Merrill Lynch agreed to reduce the interest rate on the notes to about 4 1/2 percent. The original rates, according to a Merrill Lynch spokesman, ranged between 9 and 10 percent. Shares in the trusts were sold in increments of $1,000.  The Merrill Lynch spokesman said that the reduced yield on the Western New York notes would not significantly reduce the yield on the trusts. **********''Either you accept the lower rate or you lose everything,'' the F.D.I.C. negotiators told Merrill Lynch, according to the Merrill Lynch spokesman."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/21/business/advertising-235241.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 67, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ADVERTISING", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING", "body_text": " *********** Oliver Kiss, executive vice president and chief operating officer of McDonald & Little, Atlanta, resigned. *********** William L.

It contended that the MX missiles and the Trident II missiles as well as new strategic bombers and long-range cruise missiles would expand the American military arsenal to 20,000 strategic charges by 1990. **********Previous Accords Invoked **********''Starting the implementation of the MX program,'' Pravda further asserted, ''Washington cannot but know that this runs counter to one of the central provisions of the SALT I and SALT II accords: an obligation not to create additional silos for intercontinental missiles. Just as Washington cannot but be aware that this step will not promote progress at negotiations in Geneva.'' **********The Carter and Reagan Administrations have both argued that the strategic arms accords ban new fixed launchers for intercontinental ballistic missiles and that this does not apply to the MX because the new rocket comes in a cannister complete with its own launching equipment. **********The first strategic arms accord expired in 1977 and the second was never ratified by the United States, but both sides have said they would abide by the accords if the other side did. **********Pravda did not develop the argument that the MX violates the strategic arms accords further. It focused, rather, on the fundamental disagreement between Moscow and Washington on whether there is a ''rough parity'' in strategic arms, as claimed by the Kremlin, or a Soviet superiority, as claimed by Washington. **********The Soviet article said the Soviet Union had no intention ''to chase the U.S.A. in the creation of each new system of weapons or to imitate the U.S.A.'' But the newspaper added, ''This does not mean at all that the Soviet Union will not find an effective reply to Washington if the U.S.A. starts realizing its plans.'' **********American analysts found the phrasing ambiguous and took it to mean that Moscow's repeated pledges to maintain an ample defense did not necessarily mean that it would produce weapons systems to match every new generation of American arms. **********The authoritative level of the Pravda article was underscored by the fact that the official Soviet press agency Tass transmitted it twice in English. Some analysts found the tone of the article less strident and aggressive than similar statements made under Leonid I.  Brezhnev, although specific arguments and claims were largely the same. On Building Confidence **********Pravda termed the confidence-building measures proposed by Mr.  Reagan in his speech as ''undoubtedly positive,'' but it went on to complain that the President had never responded to measures proposed by the Soviet Union. **********''There is no denying that not a single opportunity to come to terms on any steps of positive nature should be left without attention,'' Pravda said. ''Exchanging more information on the practice launchings of missiles, which the U.S. President suggests in particular, is useful. The main thing, however, is to prevent an operational launching of missiles. If 10 telephones directly linking Moscow and Washington, red or blue, are attached to a hundred MX missiles, will those missiles become less dangerous?'' **********One of Mr. Reagan's proposals was to improve the telex line linking Moscow and Washington.  Pravda contrasted Mr. Reagan's speech to one made on the same day by Yuri V. Andropov, the new Soviet party leader, in which he argued against making weapons a yardstick of the strength of the opposed social system and said the Soviet Union would refuse to make any ''preliminary consessions'' to bring normalization of relations. **********Mr. Reagan, Pravda said, also spoke of a ''desire for peace,'' but the article asserted that by this he signified a ''longing for the former comparative invulnerability of the United States, which encouraged it to various gambles.'' Arms Race Called American **********The paper reasserted the Soviet argument that the arms race ''has its roots in American soil,'' starting with development of new Minuteman, Polaris and Poseidon missiles, the cruise missiles and medium-range missiles with strategic potential."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/07/business/lazare-kaplan-intenrational-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-nov-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 44, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LAZARE KAPLAN INTENRATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "print_headline": "LAZARE KAPLAN INTENRATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/10/business/micro-mask-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-3.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MICRO MASK INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 3", "print_headline": "MICRO MASK INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 3", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/19/business/dow-advances-4.60-to-1032.10.html": {"writer_name": "Alexander Hammer", "pub_date": "1982-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 547, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Advances 4.60, to 1,032.10", "print_headline": "Dow Advances 4.60, to 1,032.10", "body_text": " **********Stock prices rose moderately yesterday in slower trading following Wednesday's sharp rally.

They discussed Canada's belated but mounting efforts at cultural and economic nation-building, its preoccupation with the United States and its impatience with Washington's episodic interest in relations with Canada. 'Taking Friends for Granted' **********''The United States,'' Mr. Brewster said, ''got into the very bad habit of taking its friends for granted. I sensed it in Britain and I sense it here. But we tend to be more important to any one country than any one country is to us.'' **********''Canada is looming larger and larger in the American consciousness,'' said Allan E. Gotlieb, Canada's Ambassador in Washington, adding that this had yet to be translated into a generally well-informed public opinion. He saw ''the seeds of continued long-term friction between us because we are seeking greater economic control and that means less foreign control.'' **********''The United States is so massive an influence in Canada,'' said Abraham Rotstein, an economist at the University of Toronto, ''that anything we do domestically touches American interests immediately somehow.'' One major irritant, the discussions showed, is Canada's Foreign Investment Review Agency, which screens all foreign investments for ''significant'' benefit to Canada. **********Participants said that they generally accepted the agency's goals but that its operations were secretive, arbitrary and might better be aimed at specific key areas instead of every sector. The agency and Canada's National Energy Program, which discriminates against foreign oil companies to promote Canadian ownership, create an uncertainty and investment chill that threaten the kind of long-term foreign investments historically so vital to Canada's economy, participants said. Canadian Regionalism Is Strong **********''In the long run,'' said Lloyd N. Cutler, former White House counsel, ''freer trade and investment will benefit Canada's market of 25 million much more than its controlled approach. Canada will pay, and is paying, a horrible price for its policy that curbs competition. Almost any commodity you name costs more in Canada.'' **********Many of the Americans, who also included Elliot L. Richardson and Orville L. Freeman, former Cabinet members, said they learned some essential differences with Canada such as the strong pull of its disparate regions and the historically heavy economic intervention of Canada's federal government. **********''Canada seems so much like us,'' said Sol M. Linowitz, former United States delegate to the Organization of American States, ''that we expect Canada to be like us and do like us. And when Canada does differently by recognizing China or Cuba or struggling against us to maintain its independence, we are surprised and can overr@eact.'' **********There was a consensus that both sides, especially the Americans, should pay greater attention to the other, especially before adopting policies that could affect the other even inadvertently. William W.  Scranton, former Governor of Pennsylvania, urged support for upgrading the State Department's Canadian operations, now under European affairs. **********Mr. Scranton also suggested an annual Canadian-United States summit meeting as a regular culmination of each year's negotiations between the two countries to focus the attention of the American public and the Washington bureaucracy on the United States' often overlooked northern neighbor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/25/business/struggle-in-welsh-steel-town.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1982-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1214, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STRUGGLE IN WELSH STEEL TOWN", "print_headline": "STRUGGLE IN WELSH STEEL TOWN", "body_text": " **********First came the rumors. Then, on Monday, the British Government confirmed that it would preserve Ravenscraig, the British Steel Corporation's only integrated steel mill in Scotland. **********The decision was contrary to the recommendation of Ian MacGregor, British Steel's hard-boiled chairman, and a challenge to Christmas spirit here in the south Wales city of 135,000 that is the home of the huge Llanwern works. No one here wants to see Scottish steelworkers lose their jobs, but fear is widespread that the successful defense of Ravenscraig means more job cuts at Llanwern next year and may in the long run undermine Llanwern's own struggle to survive. **********That struggle has produced dramatic productivity gains at the price of cutting the work force from a 1973 peak of 9,800 to 4,137, including a recently announced reduction of 350. 'People Are Frightened' **********''People are a lot quieter now, and frightened of what's coming in the future,'' said Reginald Russell, a seven-year Llanwern veteran who lost his job in 1980. **********''We're worried,'' agreed Alan Brittan, a 23-year-old employee in Llanwern's central engineering shop, as he sat in front of the Christmas tree in the card-bedecked, present-laden living room of his fiancee's parents. ''Sharon and I are getting married in March, we just bought a house, and I can't be sure that I won't be made redundant.'' **********It's not just the well-publicized woes of British Steel, which is losing between $12.8 million and $14.4 million a week. In pubs and in breaks from last-minute shopping, the Welsh quickly acknowledge that other Western steelmakers, and indeed many basic manufacturing sectors, are also being driven to the wall by worldwide economic recession and growing competition from abroad. **********''Llanwern has been cowed,'' said the Rev. Ray Taylor, an industrial chaplain who has been a familiar sight around the plant since it was built in the early 1960's. **********From all appearances, Newport and the towns in the county of Gwent for which it is the hub have taken advantage of Christmas to put aside such thoughts. Llanwern and smaller steel works in the area have shut down for the holidays in what Mr. Taylor called ''the bittersweet bonus'' that poor business pays to family life. Stores have been crowded with shoppers. Generous Payments **********Nevertheless, like the snowier Welsh town lovingly evoked in Dylan Thomas's ''A Child's Christmas in Wales,'' Newport could be described as ''bandaged.'' In Newport's case, the wounds have been salved with severance payments for Llanwern workers that are extremely generous by American standards - many receive 90 percent of a year's salary, and 80 percent for the next six months, and workers over 55 years old immediately receive pension money that would otherwise have been theirs at the age of 65. **********Many Newport merchants experienced a boom in business when 4,300 workers were laid off in 1980. Thanks to the generous severance payments, union leaders were able to fill most of the redundancy slots with workers willing to leave. For some, it was the once-in-alifetime opportunity to go into business for themselves. **********But there are signs the severance payment cushion is not quite as protective as generally healthy retail sales this month might indicate. **********''You won't see it much at Christmas - that's the very last thing the Welsh are going to pull back on - but it has had an impact,'' said Mr. Brittan, the steelworker. ''Not many people go on holidays now and you never find anybody in the clubs during the week.'' Unemployment at 15% **********Real estate brokers also report generally flat or depressed prices in many areas, particularly in new developments constructed in nearby towns to house the influx of workers attracted by Llanwern in happier times. **********A door-to-door study last year disclosed that unemployment had affected 45 percent of the households in some sections of Newport in the previous two years and concluded that numerous health problems could be attributed to the layoffs. **********''To say that all but a handful of the redundancies have been voluntary is not to say that there aren't a lot of people who are now sorry that they went,'' Mr. Taylor said. Unemployment in Newport is officially hovering around 15 percent and the level in some of the surrounding towns is much higher. **********''People don't say hello today,'' Charles Smith, a fitter at a smaller British Steel specialty steel plant here, said at the Royal Oak pub Wednesday night. ''They say, 'Are you still working?' '' **********None of this is lost on union leaders at Llanwern. Peter McKim, chairman of the trade union committee at the plant, described workers as ''punch drunk'' and expressed discouragement at the number of people who have ''come to accept unemployment as a way of life.'' Closure Politically Unwise **********Hope had risen last spring that the worst was over as British Steel cut its weekly losses to 500,000, regained domestic share and operated at more than 90 percent of its 14.4 million-ton basic steel capacity. But the bottom fell out of domestic and export markets this summer and imports rose, sending Mr. MacGregor to the Government with the advice to close another major facility. **********The possibility that it might be Llanwern appeared remote at first. Ravenscraig, near Glasgow, seemed the logical candidate because it was less efficient than either Llanwern or Port Talbot, another integrated Welsh plant that also makes strip steel. In addition, the closing of several large Scottish steel users had eroded local demand for Ravenscraig's output. **********But the three-month campaign by Scottish politicians, businessmen and clergy arguing that Ravenscraig was crucial to Scotland's industrial future convinced the Conservative Government that abandoning the plant was out of the question politically. Indeed, facing up to the likelihood of an election next fall, Patrick Jenkin, the Industry Secretary, announced that none of British Steel's integrated plants would be closed. Drive for Capital Investment **********The statement came in the form of a pledge for more Government financial support for British Steel. It extended British Steel's deadline to break even financially until March 1985. **********However, no one is assuming that the implicit promise to maintain all five plants for three years will be honored much past the election, unless business conditions improve. Llanwern union leaders, who joined in the campaign to keep Ravenscraig, are now lobbying more intensively than ever for a $100 million capital investment in a continuous caster for their plant. **********The energy-saving casters eliminate the need to make steel ingots prior to casting slabs. Energy now accounts for about 30 percent of Llanwern's costs, almost double the labor component, according to the unions. Port Talbot and Ravenscraig have continuous casters already, an advantage that looks ominous to Llanwern workers who want to hang on to their hard-won position as British Steel's most productive and lowest cost per-ton producers. **********''All I want for Christmas is the caster,'' said A.D.G. Williams, a union leader for process workers. ''We've made tremendous strides in manning levels, labor relations and practices. We haven't done all this to see it go down the drain.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/30/business/bandag-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANDAG INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "BANDAG INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/20/business/starts-in-housing-up-14.4.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 615, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STARTS IN HOUSING UP 14.4%", "print_headline": "STARTS IN HOUSING UP 14.4%", "body_text": " **********With interest rates falling, the nation's builders started work on more new single-family houses in September than they did in any month for more than a year, the Commerce Department reported today. **********Overall housing starts jumped 14.4 percent, to an annual rate of 1.146 million. A flood of 30,000 federally subsidized housing units was responsible for most of the increase, reflected in the 73 percent increase in multifamily apartment construction. **********But starts for single-family houses alone rose 6.6 percent, to a rate of 663,000, the highest since July 1981.  President Reagan timed his signing of a National Housing Week proclamation to coincide with the housing report. ''These are the days of new hope for housing, hope for millions of families that dream of owning homes and hope for millions who make their livelihoods from building them,'' the President told those attending the White House ceremony. Aid to Builders and Buyers **********When bank lending rates drop, it makes it cheaper for builders to finance new construction. And when home loan rates decline, prospective buyers find it easier and cheaper to get mortgage loans. **********Government and housing industry economists said even better times seem to lie ahead for builders. ''Our feeling is that housing will continue to improve with interest rates declining,'' said Michael Sumichrast, chief economist with the National Association of Home Builders. **********Commerce Under Secretary Robert Dederick agreed, saying that, as a result of falling rates, ''growth in home-building appears likely to assume its customary leading role in the economic recovery'' of the nation. **********According to the Commerce Department report, in September overall housing starts rose to just below July's rate of 1.19 million and well above the level of under a million that has dominated the recession. **********The department also reported that starts for single-family houses hit the highest level since the 696,000 of July 1981; new multifamily units were started at an annual rate of 483,000, up 27.1 percent from August, and building permits for future construction rose 16.9 percent, to an annual rate of 1.038 million units, also only slightly below the July level. **********Mr. Sumichrast and Thomas Harter, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, stressed that the big gain in multifamily building construction was mainly a result of an increase in Government-sponsored work. And Mr. Harter said there should be more of that subsidized housing started in the next few months. Highest Level Since April 1981 **********Mr. Harter added that, with interest rates continuing down this month, ''I wouldn't be surprised to see starts between 1.2 million and 1.25 million in October and then staying there in November or maybe even going higher.'' That would put starts at the highest level since the 1.3 million annual rate of April 1981. **********Mr. Sumichrast cautioned that housing starts tend to jump or fall quickly from month to month, and he said there may still be some declines ahead. ''But there's certainly a different kind of attitude among builders,'' he added. ''Some are starting model houses for next year,'' while this time a year ago many were going out of business. **********After declining to an annual rate of 931,000 units in April, housing starts have bounced up and down each month since. They rose 20.9 percent in May, dropped 14.8 percent in June, rebounded 31.4 percent in July to the year's high mark, then declined 16 percent in August before the new gain. **********Before adjustment for seasonal variations, the report said, about 107,600 new housing units were started in September, up from 93,200 in August."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/15/business/midland-bancorp-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 45, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MIDLAND BANCORP INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "MIDLAND BANCORP INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/04/world/the-un-today-june-4-1982-general-assembly.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 25, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

People who knew this tireless executive were almost convinced he would make it. But after playing golf one June day in 1978, Mr. Meadows was killed in an automobile accident. **********The takeover rumors that had swirled around General American Oil for many years became even more persistent.  Those rumors were stoked again last week after T. Boone Pickens Jr., chairman of the Mesa Petroleum Company, said he was looking for an acquisition candidate to replace the Cities Service Company, which Mr. Pickens lost to the Gulf Oil Corporation. During Mesa's acquisition campaign, it was unclear for a time whether Mesa would take over Cities Service or vice versa. Cities Service abruptly ended the struggle when it chose a merger with Gulf. **********Since Mesa already owns 7.4 percent of General American, traders hopped aboard what appeared to be the next oil-powered takeover bandwagon. **********But Geoffrey Hertel of Rotan Mosle Inc. says the possibility of a takeover of General American by Mesa is ''less likely than it once was.'' Rotan is a Houston-based brokerage firm that specializes in oil stocks. **********Mr. Hertel comments that Mr. Pickens had obviously considered the idea of acquiring General American. But things are different today, even though he bought his General American shares at a relatively low price: $17.75 adjusted for splits, a bit over half of the present price. **********A major difference now, Mr. Hertel notes, is the ''questionable value'' to General American of its Canadian reserves. Mesa purchased its General American shares before the Canadian Goverment began its campaign to force American companies to sell their properties in Canada to Canadians. **********Roughly a third of General American's estimated 77.6 million barrels of oil reserves are under Canadian soil, and close to half the company's 561.2 billion cubic feet of gas are in Canada. **********Meanwhile, Mr. Hertel said, Mesa has been trying to sell its own Canadian reserves, suggesting that Mesa is not enthralled over General American's dependence on Canadian reserves. **********Regardless of Mesa's interest, there is a compelling reason to regard General American as a buyout candidate.

It is now eagerly a waiting a go-ahead from the Securities and Exchange Commission for i ts latest innovation, trading in foreign currency options, which c ould go on stream as early as September. **********The move into currency options follows great success the exchange had in being the first regional exchange to trade in stock options, which it began in 1975. By last year, it had outgrown its building and had moved to a new, ultramodern, glass-paneled structure some four blocks away on March Street in downtown Philadelphia. **********The step into stock options was a $1 million risk, for an exchange whose trading in equities of small regional companies is about onefifth the size of the New York Stock Exchange's in terms to total transactions. But it proved worthwhile. Options currently account for more than 50 percent of the Philadelphia exchange's business.  Last year the Philadelphia just happened to be the sole trader in the options of Conoco, the target of a high-stakes takeover fight.  And currently it has Cities Service, another target of a takeover bid. **********Last year alone, the exchange sold 10 million options contracts, a number that reflects heavy trading in Conoco options during Du Pont's, Seagram's and Mobil's takeover battle for it. The exchange was trading up to 83,000 contracts daily in its 64 listed options, with Conoco accounting for most. Currently, it is handling a more realistic 45,000 daily contracts, including Cities Service stock options, which traded as many as 34,000 contracts last Wednesday.  Mesa Petroleum is in the midst of a takeover struggle with Cities Service. **********Though the Philadelphia exchange is the second smallest of the options traders - only the Pacific is smaller, and the two larger are the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the American Stock Exchange - it is gaining ground. Total volume for all four exchanges fell 3 percent in April from what it was a year ago, but at Philadelphia, volume rose more than 16 percent. **********If the move to new quarters and the frantic trading in Conoco options highlighted last summer's action, the beginning of trading in foreign currency options is expect to create a surge this year. **********As an indicator of how big the potential market in currency options might be, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported in June 1980 that gross foreign currency transactions by 90 banks totaled $23.4 billion for each business day in March of that year. Although Nicholas A. Giordano, the exchange's president and chief executive, says he has no way of knowing the size of the market, he speculates it could be hundreds of billions of dollars a year. **********''It's a question of how successful our marketing program is going to be in reaching the multinational corporations, import-exporters and speculators,'' Mr. Giordano said. But he predicts that the exchange could be trading 30,000 contracts a day within 18 months, which, at an average value of $30,000 a contract, would mean $230 billion a year in foreign currency options. **********For years, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, formerly the Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington Stock Exchange, had the image of a stodgy institution in a sleepy city. Mr. Giordano has pushed to project a spunkier image through new products. ''We've taken some risks that others didn't,'' he said. **********In addition to its options business and trading of multilisted stocks, the Philadelphia exchange has about 100 primary listings - stocks that do not appear on other exchanges - and about 30 regional stocks, those listed on other regional exchanges but not the New York Stock Exchange or American Stock Exchange. Among its 500 members, 104 deal exclusively with the Philadelphia exchange.TO be listed on the Philadelphia exchange, a company need have only $ 1 million in net assets, compared with $16 million on the Big Board.A s such, companies listed exclusively in Philadelphia are relatively s mall, and many of them are local, such as Morlan International Inc.,a Philadelphia-based maker of burial vaults, or the Horn & Hardart B aking Company, a local restaurant concern. Those primary stocks a ccount for only 10 percent of the exchange's equity business, h owever, while the bulk of the business come from such major, m ultilisted stocks as General Motors and Exxon. **********So far, the Philadelphia exchange has sold more than 300 seats to those hoping to trade in foreign currency options. Prices are $5,000 for members, $10,000 for nonmembers, and $8,000 for members who only trade in stocks on the exchange. **********To begin with, currency contracts will be offered in the five currencies most heavily traded against the dollar - the West German mark, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. **********An investor buying foreign currency options pays a fee, or premium, for the option to buy or sell a prescribed amount of that currency at a contracted ''strike'' price. Arnold F. Staloff, who will be responsible for the currency options, said the premiums would run between $300 and $1,500, depending on the length of the contract and the price. Regardless of how the currency moves, the option buyer can never lose more than the premium. **********Foreign currencies are generally traded in the form of futures contracts. As with any futures contract, buyers are locked into a predetermined price and they must pay up front a certain amount of money, called margin. If the value of the foreign currency declines in relation to the contracted price, the investor is required to put up more and more margin in order to cover the loss on his contract and hold onto it. **********With options, on the other hand, the investor can hold onto his option as long as he wants, no matter how steeply the currency moves in the wrong direction from the contracted price. And he does not ever have to exercise the option. He is not required to put up any more money and thus stands to lose only the initial amount, at worst. **********The Philadelphia exchange expects its proposed product to be greeted warmly by multinationals. Mr. Staloff cited the hypothetical case of a company planning to build a factory in West Germany. ''The company has a proposal out for 60 days,'' he said. ''The bid is for 10 million marks, or $4.2 million if they get the contract.'' **********He added, ''Today, they can finance the building by buying a futures contract for 10 million marks for delivery in two months. If the mark increases in value, they make money. But let's say the mark drops from 42 cents to 39 cents. That's a 3-cent loss per mark, or $300,000 whether they get the contract or not. If the company bought options for 10 million marks at 42 cents, their maximum loss would be the $48,000 premium it would cost them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/29/world/us-expresses-regret-over-beirut-s-casualties.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 584, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. EXPRESSES 'REGRET' OVER BEIRUT'S CASUALTIES", "print_headline": "U.S. EXPRESSES 'REGRET' OVER BEIRUT'S CASUALTIES", "body_text": " **********The White House and State Department voiced strong regret today over the recent heavy civilian casualties in west Beirut, appealing for a new cease-fire. Israel, which had been bombing the city heavily for a week, said later that it had agreed to hold its fire against the Palestinians effective at 10:30 P.M. (4:30 P.M., Eastern daylight time). **********The developments came as the tempo of negotiations over the fate of 6,000 Palestinian guerrillas trapped in west Beirut appeared to be accelerating. State Department officials said the task of the special American envoy, Philip C. Habib, in negotiating the withdrawal of the Palestinians, would be eased if a cease-fire were restored. **********The White House deputy press secretary, Larry Speakes, said, ''It is the President's greatest desire that the killings stop.'' Mr.  Speakes said the United States was ''concerned over continuing violence in the Middle East and we urge all parties to observe the cease-fire.'' Observance of Truce Is Urged **********At the State Department, Dean Fischer, the spokesman, said Tuesday's bombing of west Beirut by Israeli planes was ''the source of the greatest possible regret to us.'' He said ''many innocent people have been killed and wounded as a result of the breakdown of the cease-fire,'' though he did not criticize Israel directly. **********Beirut police officials have said that 120 people were killed and 232 wounded on Tuesday.  ''Ambassador Habib is currently heavily engaged in trying to restore a cease-fire, which not only would spare lives and property damage but would also permit headway in political negotiations,'' Mr. Fischer said. **********'' We call on all combatants involved to reinstate the cease-fire in place. The bloodshed must stop.'' Asked what the Administration would do if it did not, Mr. Fischer replied, ''I don't know, quite frankly.'' State Department officials said later that Mr. Habib's mission to arrange a Palestinian withdrawal from west Beirut was hampered by the breakdown of the cease-fire. At a basic level, the officials said, the bombings made it ''physically difficult'' for Mr. Habib to negotiate with Lebanese officials seeking to work out an agreement. **********There was some initial confusion over Prime Minister Menachem Begin's comment in Jerusalem, after a meeting Mr. Habib, that the American ''will find out in the next two days'' whether the Palestine Liberation Organization will quit west Beirut. Mr. Begin said Mr.  Habib hoped to get what the Israeli leader termed an ''unequivocal commitment.'' **********A State Department official said Mr. Habib had apparently told Mr.  Begin that he hoped to get a commitment from the Palestinians. P.L.O. to Give an Answer **********''It was certainly not an ultimatum on the Israeli's part or a deadline,'' said the official. ''Phil said he needed to get an answer from the P.L.O. side.'' **********Meanwhile, Nicholas Veliotes, Assistant Secretary of State for Middle East Affairs, told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee that the suspension of cluster bomb shipments to Israel was ''long-term, if not permanent.'' **********On Tuesday, the State Department announced an indefinite extension of the suspension of cluster bomb deliveries to Israel that President Reagan had ordered last week. The suspension was in part a response to Congressional criticism that the Administration had not taken a tough stand against Israel's use of the weapon, which sprays bomblets over an area several hundred feet in diameter. There were allegations on Capitol Hill that Israel had used the weapon against civilians."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/13/world/peru-citing-guerrilla-raids-imposes-curbs-in-3-provinces.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 89, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Peru, Citing Guerrilla Raids, Imposes Curbs in 3 Provinces", "print_headline": "Peru, Citing Guerrilla Raids, Imposes Curbs in 3 Provinces", "body_text": " **********The Government declared a state of emergency and suspended civil rights in three Andean provinces today after guerrilla attacks killed five police officers in less than a week. **********The 30-day state of emergency, including the suspension of civil rights, applies to about 20,000 people in the provinces of Andahuaylas, Cangallo and Lamar. **********''The only way to control this is to put that area under a state of emergency and control everybody until the problem is finished,'' a Government spokesman said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/16/business/braniff-funds-face-inquiry.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Braniff Funds Face Inquiry", "print_headline": "Braniff Funds Face Inquiry", "body_text": " **********Four pension funds of grounded Braniff Airways Inc. are $57 million short and Federal officials said today that they planned to investigate the deficit from a ''civil and criminal perspective.'' **********The inquiry into the pension funds was prompted by the deficit, but no wrongdoing by Braniff officials has been indicated, Scott Bush, a Federal bankruptcy official, said. **********M.

The buying caught many money managers off guard, particularly those who had sold Treasury issues short on Monday to square accounts for the holidays. Their efforts to cover their short positions helped to fuel the advance. **********At the close, gains of more than 2 points, or $20 for each $1,000 of face value, were common among the longer Government maturities, while intermediate issues rose half that much. But rates on shortterm Treasury bills were narrowly mixed. **********Initial Buying Burst **********Yesterday's initial burst of buying was led by ''retail,'' or institutional, money managers. It came at the market opening and reflected a drop in the Federal funds rate to 8.125 percent from 8.5 percent. That is the rate charged for overnight loans that banks make to each other. As William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at the Bank of New York, noted: **********''The drop in the funds rate on a Tuesday was considered very bullish, a mood that was sustained by a strong Treasury bond futures market, which moved upward all day. As the cash and futures markets rose, the shorts were increasingly forced to buy out of their positions, thus causing prices in both markets to advance.'' **********In addition, he said, news that the Consumer Price Index for November was up only one-tenth of 1 percent, compared with the rise of eight-tenths of 1 percent in October, and the Government's ''flash'' report on fourth-quarter gross national product, which projected a 2.2 percent decline for the period, kept the rally going despite some scattered profit taking late in the day. Federal Funds Rate **********Most important, Mr. Sullivan noted, was the surprising drop in the Federal funds rate, because it occurred a day before the end of the bank statement week, when banks often scramble for overnight reserves to balance their accounts. **********Dealers had no explanation for the surprising drop in the Federal funds rate beyond noting the obvious: that banks seemed to be well suited with funds. **********A leading beneficiary of the buying was the Treasury, which auctioned $4.5 billion of seven-year notes, because it prompted bidders to revise their bids upward shortly before the 1:30 P.M.  auction deadline. At that time, the notes were being traded on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 10.60 percent, off 10 basis points on the bid side. Auction Results **********After the close, the Treasury announced that the auction produced an average price of 99.594, equivalent to a yield of 10.58 percent, down from the average yield of 11.94 percent for seven-year notes sold last September. The notes will carry a 10.5 percent coupon, down an eighth of a point from what had been expected before the sale. **********Today, the Treasury will auction $3 billion of 20-year and onemonth bonds, which traded yesterday on a when-issued yield basis of 10.65 percent bid, down 30 basis points. Tomorrow, the Treasury will complete its auctions this week with the sale of $7 billion of oneyear bills. **********In the secondary market for Treasury debt issues, 90-day bill rates rose to 7.92 percent from 7.85. But the rate on six-month bills slipped to 8 percent from 8.08, dealers said. Among the intermediate maturities, prices of the 9 3/8 percent notes of 1984 rose to 99.28 from 99.17; the 10.5's of 1992, to par from 98.28, and the bellwether long bond, the 10 3/8's of 2012, jumped slightly more than 2 points, to 98.28. Dealers' Financing Costs **********The drop in the Federal funds rate caused a similar decline in financing costs of Government securities dealers, some of whom had been somewhat concerned about the growth in their inventories. **********What also fed the price advance was that the Federal Reserve's only market move was to buy $700 million of Treasury paper for a foreign customer, which only slightly and indirectly increased banking reserves. **********Another bullish factor was the conviction of many buyers that the disarray among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries portends weaker energy costs. Still another was the fact that few big corporate debt issues have been scheduled for sale until after Jan. 1. A major concern in the credit market is that the soaring Federal budget deficit will force the Government to borrow more, choking off funds needed to revive the economy. **********Edward E. Yardeni, senior vice president and chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., noted that the initial buying came from some retail buyers of this week's Treasury offerings on a whenissued basis. ''These buyers, and dealers, don't have to pay for these issues until Jan. 4, so even the more nervous money managers won't have to show their new purchases on the books for the fourth quarter and full year,'' he said. **********Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of $4.5 billion of seven-year notes: P.U.

Water and Electricity Go On **********The pace of the negotiations has clearly picked up, despite the Israeli blockade of west Beirut for the fifth straight day, which has prevented any food, fuel or medical supplies from entering the predominantly Moslem half of the capital still occupied by some 6,000 P.L.O. guerrillas and 500,000 Lebanese and Palestinian civilians.  Water and electricity, which were cut off Sunday, were turned back on by the Israelis today. **********The director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, David Kimche, met this afternoon with Philip C. Habib, the special American envoy, at the American Ambassador's residence in the hills overlooking Israeli-occupied Christian east Beirut, apparently to discuss an American offer to send troops and Sixth Fleet vessels to protect the P.L.O. as it withdraws from west Beirut and to assess the short-term prospects for such an evacuation. **********This afternoon Mr. Habib telephoned Prime Minister Shafik al-Wazzan to brief him on the latest Israeli and American proposals, Government sources said. Mr. Wazzan has refused to drive through the Israeli checkpoints to meet Mr. Habib or President Elias Sarkis at the presidential palace in Baabda until the Israeli blockade is lifted. Meeting With Arafat **********Immediately after his telephone discussions with Mr. Habib, Mr.  Wazzan met with Yasir Arafat, head of the P.L.O., and former Prime Minister Saeb Salam to assess the P.L.O.'s reaction. After their onehour meeting at Mr. Salam's house, the Prime Minister told reporters: ''Each day there is progress, but each day there are new obstacles. We are still hoping to reach an honorable and favorable solution.'' **********Mr. Wazzan said his Government were still studying Mr. Reagan's offer of troops and naval vessels and hoped to have an answer in a day or two. Mr. Arafat has ruled out the idea of the P.L.O. leaving under American protection, although he is understood not to be opposed to American involvement in a multinational force to separate the Israeli and Palestinian armies around Beirut as the first step to a negotiated settlement. **********An official involved in this afternoon's talks between Mr. Arafat, Mr. Wazzan and Mr. Salam said, ''Many things are happening, but many things are not happening.'' **********What is not happening is that the basic differences between the Israeli and Palestinian proposals are not being bridged despite three weeks of negotiations. The P.L.O.'s Position **********Senior P.L.O. sources said today that the guerrilla group was still standing by a proposal it made to the Lebanese Government on June 24. That plan called for an Israeli withdrawal of 5 to 10 kilometers from Beirut and a P.L.O. withdrawal into its west Beirut refugee camps. A multinational force would then be deployed between the two armies and in west Beirut alongside the Lebanese Army. **********After this separation of forces, the P.L.O. would begin withdrawing from Lebanon with the understanding that its leaders would move the headquarters to another Arab capital - still to be selected - and some P.L.O. fighters would leave. **********The P.L.O. is still insisting, however, that some of its fighters be organized into two brigades as the Palestine Liberation Army and be permitted to stay in northern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley under the command of the Lebanese Army. It is also demanding that a P.L.O.  diplomatic mission and information office be maintained in Beirut. U.S. and Israeli Stands **********The American position is understood to be that the P.L.O. leaders and all of its fighters should leave Lebanon, leaving only an information office in Beirut. **********The Israeli position, reaffirmed after a Cabinet meeting today, is very clear: the military, political and organizational presence of the P.L.O. should be removed from Lebanon in its entirety. **********Mr. Arafat apparently believes that the Israelis are unwilling to take on his forces in the streets of west Beirut and that if they do, the P.L.O. will be able to hold them off long enough for Arab and international pressure to force the Israelis to desist. Hence, his readiness to hold to his basic negotiating position despite the Israeli blockade and bombardments. **********Beginning late Tuesday afternoon and continuing through the night, Israeli artillery and warships blasted Palestinian neighborhoods on the southern outskirts of west Beirut, setting fires that blackened the dawn sky and causing ''many casualties,'' according to the state-run Beirut radio. Many Israeli shells fell in non-Palestinian residential areas of west Beirut as well. After a brief respite, Palestinian and Israeli gunners again began dueling today around sunset, with Israeli forces in Shuweifat and Khalde, overlooking west Beirut, trading artillery and rocket fire with the guerrillas dug into the Lailake and Hayy al Sollom neighborhoods. During each one of these artillery exchanges the Israelis have tried to move a few yards closer to the guerrilla outposts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/02/business/credit-markets-treasury-yields-fall-sharply.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1982-11-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 753, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TREASURY YIELDS FALL SHARPLY", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; TREASURY YIELDS FALL SHARPLY", "body_text": " **********Amid widespread anticipation of lower interest rates in coming weeks, yields fell sharply yesterday for outstanding Treasury notes and bonds and for those scheduled to be sold this week and next. **********''The bullish outlook is so widespread that there are no sellers except for the Treasury,'' said Morgan Stark, senior vice president at the Chemical Bank. ''There has been persistent buying of long-term issues,'' he added, ''leaving prices nowhere to go but up.'' **********In advance of approaching Treasury note and bond sales totaling $13 billion, dealers in Government securities said presale orders from investors had not been heavy. But they predicted that the prospect of lower interest rates soon would be enough of an inducement to cause many firms to buy the new issues even though investors have not made definite commitments to buy. **********Demand for new corporate issues has been strong, but in the Treasury market the strongest presale activity has been for 30-year bonds scheduled for sale Nov. 9.

He added that ''the next problem is going to be pronounced weakness and actual declines in the money supply'' that would encourage the Fed to make long-awaited moves toward lowering short-term interest rates and cutting the discount rate, which the Fed charges for loans to financial institutions. **********Weakness in money supply growth, which often accompanies declines in short-term credit demand, was masked during October, said Mr.  Gross, because proceeds from maturing ''All Savers'' certificates were put into checking accounts. Outcome of Treasury Sale **********Dealers said the downward pressure on short-term interest rates yesterday was not so great as for longer-term issues because shortterm rates are lower than long-term rates and because the potential profits from a drop in interest rates are greater for long-term issues. **********At the regular Monday auction of new Treasury bills, rates fell slightly, with the three-month issue selling at an average rate of 7.813 percent, down from 8.031 percent last week, while the six-month issue averaged 8.231 percent, down from 8.472 percent. **********Based on the auction results, the maximum rate for new 91-day savings certificates is 7.813 percent for banks and thrift institutions alike, while the maximum rate for six-month certificates is 8.731 percent at thrift units and 8.481 percent at banks. **********In the market for tax-exempt issues, securities dealers said they were swamped with new issues, which has kept kept tax-exempt yields from declining as much as yields in the Treasury market. Corporations Enter Market **********In the corporate market, several high-quality industrial companies that borrow infrequently decided the time was ripe for new issues.  Dresser Industries' 25-year debentures, rated Aa2, were offered with an 11.8 percent yield, and the Mobil Corporation's Aa2-rated 10-year notes were offered to yield 10.9 percent, while Westavco's A1-rated 30-year debentures were offered to yield 12.125 percent. **********Other new corporate issues announced yesterday included the Ford Motor Credit Company's Baa2-rated five-year notes yielding 12.375 percent, Associated Dry Goods' A2-rated five year notes yielding 11.25 percent, Gerber Products' A2-rated 12-year notes yielding 11.75 percent and American Express Credit's Aa2-rated 30-year debentures yielding 11.99 percent. **********Following are results of yesterday's three- and six-month Treasury bill auctions: (000 omitted in dollar figures) 3-Mo.

He said an accord acceptable to the United States had ''a one-in-five chance.'' **********Finance Ministers Confer **********While the leaders met to discuss broad economic and trade issues, their finance and foreign ministers conferred separately on a communique that would carefully bridge their differences, in some cases by employing highly generalized language. In addition, the finance ministers agreed that they would try to align their national economic policies more closely. (Page 16.) **********The conference participants were described as close to agreeing that all developed nations, including the Soviet Union, be permitted to receive export financing of no less than 12.5 percent for shortterm loans, and that there be no ceilings placed on the volume of such loans or credit in general to the Eastern bloc. **********The United States had originally sought a requirement that the Soviet Union pay market rates, or more than 16 percent, for their financing, and that there be a limit on the total volume of financing from the West. American officials said that if Mr. Reagan could not obtain all that he sought, then the United States would go along with ''the maximum we could get'' on the export credit issue while reserving the right to push for a more acceptable agreement later. **********Mr. Reagan, various officials said, contended today that stiff credit restrictions were needed to hamper the Soviet economy and make it more difficult for the Soviet Union to build its military strength. But these officials reported that his view was vigorously disputed by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany and Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau of Canada. **********Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Trudeau were said to have argued that Soviet behavior would not be influenced by a cutback on exports, and they countered Mr. Reagan's statements by pointing out that his Administration continues to be willing to sell grain to Russia. **********The Reagan Administration has placed great importance on the credit issue. It indicated before the conference that the United States would be willing to make concessions on other economic matters if the leaders would agree to end low-interest credits to the Soviet Union.  For Europeans, however, the credits are deemed necessary to stimulate exports and produce jobs. **********In other developments, the conference participants reached a measure of agreement on new procedures to stabilize worldwide currency exchange rates. Reagan Administration officials maintained, however, that the United States would not drop its opposition to European requests that it intervene in the marketplace by buying and selling currencies to stablize exchange rates and prop up their sagging European currencies. **********As the leaders completed a day and a half of deliberations here, with one more day to go, much of their side discussions continued to be dominated by the situation in the Falkland Islands. Complaints About Interest Rates **********In addition, Mr. Reagan heard sharp complaints today about high American interest rates and large budget deficits from other conference participants. According to Treasury Secretary Donald T.  Regan, Chancellor Schmidt of West Germany turned to the President at one point and asked when he thought American budget deficits would be reduced. **********Mr. Regan said the President replied that he hoped the House of Representatives would succeed in approving a budget next week, and that soon thereafter there could be an agreement between the House and the Senate to reduce deficits in the next three years. European leaders have blamed huge projected deficits in the United States for high American interest rates. **********As expected, the participants were reportedly tough in their criticism of each other's trade practices.  Secretary Regan said the Europeans complained specifically about American efforts to block European steel imports. Both European and American officials also reportedly objected to each other's farm subsidies. Criticism of Japanese Cited **********Both the United States and its European allies were said to be critical of Japanese barriers to imports. Japanese officials said Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki said Japanese trade practices were no more restrictive than those of their nations. But the participants reportedly disagreed, although President Francois Mitterrand of France said this evening that Japan seemed ''to be settling more problems with the United States and North America'' than with Europe. **********Officials from West Germany, France and Britain said the most likely accord to be adopted at the conference would be a set of new limits on export credits for all countries - not simply the Soviet Union. Moscow would not be able to receive any credits greater than those given to countries in the West. **********This formula was worked out a few weeks ago by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is the Western economic alliance group. Secretary Regan said ''there are still some holdouts'' on accepting even this accord, and identified them as France and Britain. Other officials said the two countries were objecting to putting the formula into place too rapidly. **********Another American official said ''we want the O.E.C.D. agreement - plus,'' but that this looked increasingly unlikely. Specifically, he said the request for future limits on the volume of export credits and loans would be difficult to achieve. French Raise Subsidy Rate **********As recently as this spring, the French subsidized the financing of exports for the Soviet Union at 7.5 percent. Recently, they raised the level to 11.5 percent. The O.E.C.D. accord, if adopted, would raise the limit to the 12.5 percent level for short-term credits. **********An American official said it was incorrect that Mr. Reagan had taken one position on the issue and everybody else had taken another, as the French had said. He said Chancellor Schmidt had been supportive, and that Prime Minister Suzuki had also backed such an arrangement, provided everyone could agree on them together. **********It was unclear tonight whether the conference's potential failure to agree to Mr. Reagan's terms on credits meant that the United States would renew its efforts to impede European countries from helping the Soviet Union to build a natural gas pipeline from Siberia to Western Europe. **********Europeans want Mr. Reagan to let the pipeline proceed now, but the Administration says that Mr. Reagan wants to wait until after the credit issue is settled before making a final decision."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/29/business/lyon-metal-products-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LYON METAL PRODUCTS INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "LYON METAL PRODUCTS INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/23/business/murray-ohio-manufacturing-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MURRAY OHIO MANUFACTURING CO reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "MURRAY OHIO MANUFACTURING CO reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/02/business/armstrong-rubber-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARMSTRONG RUBBER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "ARMSTRONG RUBBER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/07/business/guatemala-mexico-deal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Guatemala-Mexico Deal", "print_headline": "Guatemala-Mexico Deal", "body_text": " **********A senior Guatemalan official said today that Guatemala and Mexico could begin a barter trade system between the two countries but that the decision was in ''Mexico's hands.''

But the Europeans are also concerned that the current Administration still rejects the principle of self-determination for the Palestinians. **********''The Americans do need to look again at their whole Middle East policy and in particular, at the way in which we can solve the Palestinian question, because until that is solved there will be further outbreaks of this kind and Israel will not have security,'' Mr. Hurd said. French Government Silent **********A silence was maintained today in France, as part of the effort by the Government of President Francois Mitterrand to ease tensions after the attack Monday on a Jewish restaurant in Paris in which 6 people were killed and 22 wounded by unidentified gunmen. Prime Minister Menachem Begin subsequently suggested that Mr. Mitterrand had, through a critical statement last month about the Israeli invasion, helped create the atmosphere that encouarged attacks on Jews. **********But French officials have made it clear that they are upset about both the continued Israeli offensive and the charges by Mr. Begin, who also said France was a land of rampant anti-Semitism and was acting like an enemy of Israel. **********''Begin is irresponsible,'' said Pierre Mendes-France, a former French Prime Minister, in a newspaper interview. ''I think that what he is doing is tragic for all the world, for his people and for the country.'' A More Difficult Step **********For West Germany, still sensitive because of the Nazi campaign of genocide against the Jews in World War II, taking such a firm stand against Israel was a far more difficult step. And Mr. Mitterrand made the first state visit to Israel by a French President as part of his effort to improve relations between the two countries. **********In 1980 the European Economic Community urged that the Palestine Liberation Organization be involved in any future talks on a settlement. The statement effectively eliminated any influence the Common Market might have had on Israel. Instead, the European nations now appear to be trying to influence Washington's position. **********The reaction today to the continuation of the Israeli offensive went beyond major European capitals. In Nicosia, President Spyros Kyprianou of Cyprus strongly condemned the Israeli attacks as ''a horrible crime of genocide against the Palestinians and the people of Lebanon, which is a stain on our civilization.'' 'Universal Indignation' **********He said in a statement that the continuing siege and the fierce Israeli bombardment was causing ''universal indignation and abhorrence.'' **********Strong words were also used in Vienna to describe the Israeli attack. Austria's Foreign Minister, Willibald Pahr, praised the United States for intervening to halt Thursday's assault on Beirut. **********''Only under hard pressure from the United States, for which we must be grateful, was this bombardment ended,'' he said at a news conference. **********The International Federation of Resistance Fighters also joined in the protests. A statement issued in Vienna by the group said that ''those who fought against Nazi barbarism and for the independence of their countries, relentlessly condemn indiscriminate use of violence by the Israeli Government, its disregard for human rights and democratic world opinion.'' **********And the Dutch Government appealed to Israel to lift its blockade of west Beirut, in keeping with a United Nations Security Council resolution adopted Thursday night. ---- Peres Defends Mitterrand **********Shimon Peres, chairman of Israel's opposition Labor Party, defended Mr. Mitterrand in New York on Friday, saying he was convinced the Frenc Prime Minister was a friend of Israel. He also urged that Israel encourage France's friendship, despite differences of opinion. **********''Among the French presidents,'' said Mr. Peres, ''and I happen to know quite a few of them, I believe that Mitterrand is the most knowledgeable on Jewish history. The cause of Israel is in his heart and mind more than anybody else that I can think of.'' **********''When the latest events took place in France,'' Mr. Peres said, alluding to the restaurant attack, Mr. Mitterrand ''was the first to come and see.'' Mr. Peres was speaking to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations at 515 Park Avenue. ''I do not believe that he is indifferent to Jewish destiny or Jewish fate and I believe we must cultivate and respect France and its friendship.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/30/business/finance-briefs-244462.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 315, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** California Life Corp. said it had again extended its offer to purchase $16 million of its 11 percent sinking fund debentures at $45 for each $100 principal amount. *********** Champion International Corp.'s industrial revenue bonds were downgraded to BBB-plus from A-minus by Standard and Poor's Corp. *********** Conquest Exploration Co. said it had negotiated a three-year, $250 million revolving credit agreement at the prime rate with a group of banks led by First City National bank of Houston. *********** Digital Switch Corp. said its registration statement had been declared effective.

She was sunk by the nuclear-powered submarine Conquerer. **********''Scores of destroyers, frigates and patrol boats scuttled into port once the vulnerability of the big ships was proven by her loss,'' he said, and ''we saw the Skyraiders and the Daggers,'' Argentine fighter planes, ''leave to attack the task force.''

The journalists were given additional information by the local police chief, who was also a naval captain and ''would come fresh from the war room to tell us things.'' **********On one occasion, according to Mr. Winchester, the official said that a British frigate, spotted near Cape Horn, ''had been ordered sunk by an Exocet,'' an air-to-surface missile that was to prove effective for Argentina, but ''last-minute orders from Buenos Aires called the attack plane home'' to Rio Gallegos, a nearby port, ''and the frigate was saved for later.'' **********Mr. Winchester wrote that he had been accused of using binoculars while waiting for a commercial flight at Rio Grande, also nearby, ''to observe Daggers, Aeromacchis and a solitary Neptune antisubmarine plane'' take off. ''I took notes,'' he acknowledged, and ''ventured to ask a waiting pilot to identify the passing hardware.'' **********He also said that after he had admitted meeting on three occasions with British military attaches an Argentine judge declared that the conversations ''were as among equals'' and that Mr. Winchester's notes were ''of a type and a caliber not usually available to an ordinary correspondent.'' First Days the Worst **********Mr. Mather, writing in The Observer, said the first days after their arrest April 13 had been the worst.

New history texts for primary schools are just off the presses and a hotly competitive race is on among several publishing houses, each with its own team of historians, to see who can be first with historical surveys for high school and university students. **********The new texts all seek to meet a deeply felt need: to show that the black people who live in the modern @Zimbabwe have been shapers of history and not just bystanders. **********Voyages of Discovery **********''I knew most intimately the history of Egypt,'' said Ngwabi Bhebe, a historian at the University of Zimbabwe, wryly recalling his own school days. ''We studied the Greeks and the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Then we went over to the voyages of discovery. The voyages of discovery brought it near to us. **********''I was trained to believe that the history of the European in Africa was the only history,'' he said, ''that prior to that it was all darkness.'' **********Only when he started work on his doctorate at the University of London, where he first encountered the works of contemporary historians from West Africa, did Dr. Bhebe seriously start to question this approach. **********He has just finished writing one textbook and is about to start another, but he knows that the rewriting of history is only the start of a shift in historical perspective. All the teachers who have to work with the new texts, blacks as well as whites, were raised on the old ones, he points out, and will thus have to absorb what they now are expected to teach. Turning History on Its Head **********It is a history that dwells on the African kingdoms that rose and fell in the precolonial period in what is now Zimbabwe; particularly the one that flourished in the 14th century at Great Zimbabwe, an impressive set of ruins built of granite blocks, which the white settlers attributed to Phoenicians or Arabs on the racial assumption that the work was too sophisticated to have been done by local blacks. **********In fact, until independence, no textbooks were ever approved for use in schools in this country that mentioned, even as a possibility, the accepted archeological conclusion that the Shonaspeaking groups that are dominant in the present Zimbabwe are the direct descendants of Great Zimbabwe's builders. **********But it is in their interpretation of the colonial period and movements of resistance to white rule that the new texts turn the old history on its head. **********David Livingstone has just a minor walk-on part, and Cecil Rhodes, the empire-builder after whom Rhodesia was named, has become the personification of imperialism rather than the father of his country. The advent of white settlers is no longer presented as part of a tide of benevolence carrying technology, literacy and Christianity. Now issues such as labor exploitation, racial discrimination and the unequal division of the land are stressed. Comparing the Old and the New **********The difference is vividly illustrated by contrasting the treatment of an 1896 Shona uprising against the whites in an old text and the new ones. **********''The Africans were naturally disillusioned at the failure of the rebellion, which they thought had been at the bidding of the ancestral spirits,'' says a book that is now being withdrawn from the schools. So, this old text goes on, the blacks started to turn to Christianity. **********The new texts make heroes of two spirit mediums who inspired what is now called the ''first Chimurenga,'' or rising, and then were executed. ''The spirit of Kaguvi and Nehanda did not die,'' one of them declares. ''It continued to inspire freedom fighters, particularly during the second Chimurenga,'' meaning the independence struggle. **********The competing publishing houses are local subsidiaries of two British companies, Longman and Macmillan, and the recently established Zimbabwe publishing house run by two expatriate journalists, David Martin and Phyllis Johnson, who are co-authors of a study of the independence struggle. **********Mr. Martin and Miss Johnson, who are British and Canadian respectively, have produced with an American co-author the history text for primary students that does the most emphatic job of reinterpreting history in the light of current political values. **********But Zimbabwe does not lack for professional historians. In the Rhodesia of a generation ago, a black man with a history degree could aspire to become a headmaster of a school, which was about as high as a black man could hope to rise. As a result, Dr. Bhebe estimates, there are at least 20 black Zimbabweans with Ph.D. degrees in history, some of them now in high Government posts. **********That helps to explain, perhaps, the scholarly word of caution that can be found in the Ministry of Education's directive on the new history syllabus. ''A rejection of the old approach should not imply a narrowly nationalistic study of history,'' it says, ''as this would be a disservice to scholarship, Zimbabwe and Africa.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/09/business/at-t-in-pact-on-cellular-units.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 349, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.T.&T.

Today's announcement means they will withdraw those applications, however, providing clear sailing for their joint ventures with A.T.& T. and what is expected to be rapid F.C.C. approval. **********A.T.& T. declined to provide any details of its joint venture agreements, including the cities where it would control the system, and where the other independents would hold an interest."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/26/business/comair-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMAIR INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "COMAIR INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/11/business/lionel-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LIONEL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "LIONEL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/19/business/exxon-usa-sets-82-capital-budget.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Exxon U.S.A Sets '82 Capital Budget", "print_headline": "Exxon U.S.A Sets '82 Capital Budget", "body_text": " **********The Exxon Company U.S.A. announced that its 1982 capital and exploration spending is expected to rise 25 percent to a record total of $6 billion.

Again, pension funds and other institutions were major buyers. **********''Earlier, there had been some concern about the success of today's auction of four-year notes by the Treasury,'' said Margo N.  Alexander, research director of Paine, Webber, Mitchell Hutchins Inc. ''But today's success in this note sale and the resulting strong rally in the bond market served as a signal for stock prices to move ahead.''

It finished at 118 1/8, to yield 11.73 percent, the first time since January 1981 that the bond yielded below 12 percent. **********The Treasury auctioned four-year notes at an average yield of 12.3 percent. Demand for Treasury securities was so strong that by the end of the day this note was offered at a yield of 12.02 percent. Declining Money Fund Rates **********The bond market rally reflects a number of factors, including flight to what investors consider safe, quality issues and declining yields in money market mutual funds. The dropping yields have encouraged many investors to lock in higher rates in Treasury notes and bonds. **********When a price rally in the bond market produces lower yields on fixed-income securities, investors often decide to switch their funds to stocks. **********As the bond rally progressed, the Dow industrial average rose steadily during the afternoon from a level of 4.51 at 1:30 P.M.

Wherever Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher goes, the war in the Falkland Islands follows her. ''Just as it is her daily - indeed hourly - concern in Downing Street, so it must be here,'' an aide explained. **********It is also a central concern of the people with whom she is meeting, even though they ostensibly came here to discuss economic affairs. Last night at the opening dinner, for example, Mrs.  Thatcher, President Reagan and the others talked of little else but the Falklands. As a spokesman for another delegation explained: **********''When you sit down to dinner in a group that includes someone who is waging a war, it's a bit hard to ignore it.'' Mrs. Thatcher is not actually conducting the war, of course. In fact, the British say that all the political decisions have been made for the moment, and that - barring a sudden Argentine agreement to withdraw - the decision on when to move troops into Stanley, the capital, is in the hands of the military commanders on the scene. **********But still, Mrs. Thatcher must keep in touch. Just hours before leaving London on Friday, she conducted a meeting of her inner war Cabinet for a final review of the military situation in the South Atlantic. Clearly there was an understanding in the minds of everybody at that meeting that by the time she returns to London, the final, bloodiest battle of the war might very well be under way. **********The telephone in Mrs. Thatcher's suite in the ornate Grand Trianon Palace here in Versailles is said to be secure, so that she can keep in touch with Defense Secretary John Nott and other senior officials in London. But the British conceded that for a really important conversation, Mrs. Thatcher might well feel more comfortable using the secure line at the British Embassy in Paris. **********The Grand Trianon, where Prime Minister Thatcher, President Reagan and the other heads of government each have a suite, was built 300 years ago to be the private estate of Louis XIV, the legendary Sun King. **********Louis named the palace after the hamlet of Trianon, which was on this spot in the Middle Ages. He bought the land to enlarge his estate in 1670 and first built onto it a white and blue earthernware pavilion named ''Trianon de Porcelaine,'' which he surrounded with pleasant gardens. That pavilion, though lovely and delicate, was too fragile, and it was replaced later in the 17th century with the current sumptuous marble palace. **********To insure the privacy of the king and his family, courtiers were not permitted to enter the Grand Trianon. It is an appropriate heritage for the building that this weekend must be one of the most closely guarded overnight hostelries in Western Europe, with even antiaircraft guns installed on the grounds to protect President Francois Mitterrand's high-powered guests. **********Like the other leaders, who arrived in an elaborate procession of helicopters Friday afternoon, President Reagan has been staying in the Grand Trianon since Friday night. But his wife, Nancy, stayed an extra night in the American Ambassador's residence in Paris, moving into the Trianon only tonight. **********The youngest of the Reagans' neighbors this weekend in the Grand Trianon is Michel Trudeau, the 6-year-old son of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau of Canada. **********Prime Minister Trudeau and his wife, Margaret, are separated, although she lives only a few blocks from the Prime Minister's residence in Ottawa. Michel and their two other children, who are 8 and 10, live with the Prime Minister. **********The three boys take turns accompanying their father on his various official trips around the world. Although no one in Versailles has solicited Michel's views on macroeconomics, he has been much in evidence at the ceremonial occasions of this conference, shaking hands gravely on Friday with President Mitterrand, and reacting to the soldiers and the helicopters and the bands with the awe that you might expect of a 6-year-old. **********But his eldest brother, Sacha, has become rather more worldly over the years. Accompanying his father on a Middle Eastern trip not long ago, Sacha wandered into the press section of the airplane, climbed up into the chair that the Prime Minister usually occupies, and asked the traveling Canadian correspondents: **********''Why don't you guys like my dad?'' **********Although the discussions at the Versailles conference have a good deal of substance - important issues such as East-West trade and what to do about foreign exchange rates - much of it is show, staged for still photographs and television. And the French have planned it carefully. **********''19:15 - the heads of delegations stroll through the park,'' the official schedule declares, and stroll they did. ''9:05 - arrival of President Mitterrand at the marble staircase.'' And so forth. **********But sometimes the unscheduled does happen. Today, for example, as the leaders gathered for lunch, an American press pool reporter who was ostensibly there just to observe the colorful occasion began asking questions, as reporters will do. **********President Reagan answered three questions about the vote on the Falklands Friday night in the United Nations Security Council, and then the reporter turned to Prime Minister Thatcher, who was seated on the President's right. Were the British angry, she was asked, about what appeared to be a weakening of the American support for Britain.

At 9 A.M., the Atlantic Richfield Company held simultaneous meetings in Los Angeles, Washington and Helena, the state capital of Montana, to announce the permanent closing of the 75-year-old Anaconda copper smelter. The smelter's 1,000 employees, who were at home awaiting the end of a nationwide copper strike, heard the news over the radio. **********The next day, nearly 25 percent of the town's work force was out of a job, and Anaconda had lost the employer who for decades had maintained its parks, built its medical centers, treated its sewage and hauled in fertile black dirt so that residents could grow grass in yards that had been ruined by the smelter's fumes. **********''They cut off our primary reason for existence,'' said William N.  Callaghan, an optometrist in Anaconda, whose patients are now approaching him with great embarrassment about stretching out payments for their medical bills. ''We have been biting the bullet ever since.'' **********The closing of the smelter has, indeed, been a terrible blow for Anaconda and its residents, but they are by no means alone. The company town that loses its company has become an increasingly common experience - in many ways a reflection of the country's eroding industrial base - and is forcing executives to face a difficult question: What does a corporation owe a community that it created or the people who depended on that town for a livelihood? **********The issue of corporate responsibility has become critical now because, unlike the 1960's, when the economy was growing, employees who lose their jobs are less likely to find work in the plant next door. **********''The number of long-term layoffs and permanent plant closings increased dramatically during the 1970's, and it is catastrophic right now because it is much harder for the laid-off blue-collar worker to find other employment,'' said Bennett Harrison, a political economy professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. **********THOUGH corporate America seems more conscious of the need to assist those thrown out of work by plant closings, most employees - from the smelter workers in Anaconda to the steel workers in Youngstown, Ohio, where United States Steel closed three plants, some after as many as 75 years of operation - have been dissatisfied with the response of their employers. **********''In most cases, the treatment by management is very poor by comparison with companies in Europe, where there is usually a requirement to give six months' notice and a severance pay agreement,'' said Barry Bluestone, an economics professor at Boston College, who, along with Mr. Harrison, wrote a book entitled ''The Deindustrialization of America.'' ''In this country, there are no limitations on notifications and no requirements for severance pay except when a union has negotiated it.'' **********But Arco, which took over the smelter when it acquired the Anaconda Copper Company in 1977, insists that it has treated its workers justly, giving them far more help than required by union contracts.  ''In our view we put people in pretty good shape with almost a year of not having to work at all,'' said Ralph Cox, an executive vice president at Arco. **********But many government officials and social scientists would not agree that Arco, one of the nation's largest oil companies, did all it could for its workers. In fact, the manner in which many American companies have closed plants has so angered local officials that they have decided that, without legislated standards, corporations will do only what is required by union contracts or nothing at all. **********''No one helps voluntarily,'' said James Tierney, the Attorney General of Maine, one of the few states that has so-called plant closure legislation. The Maine law, passed in 1977 after several bad experiences with companies that left without helping their employees, requires employers of 100 or more workers to pay a week of severance pay for each year that an employee has worked. More than 15 states are considering some form of plant closure legislation, and in Montana a bill is expected to reach the state legislature this year. **********But if a plant closing is traumatic for workers and their towns, it can also be wrenching for the companies, which often react to crises in confusing and inconsistent ways and frequently take steps that are harmful to corporation and individual alike. **********''Under conditions of great personal stress, you don't imagine that a person will maintain his usual composure and in a crisis, a company will also do strange things,'' said Harvey Brenner, a professor of operations research and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University. **********The residents of Anaconda cannot complain that they were left high and dry - Arco gave some financial help to both employees and the city - but they can question the effectiveness of the financial help and whether it was suited to the problems the community faced or just an effort to cover over an unfortunate occurrence. **********ARCO untangled itself from Anaconda in what might be called typical business fashion. The Anaconda smelter, which stands at the town's entrance like a concrete sentry, processed copper that Anaconda produced from the Berkeley open pit copper mine, about 27 miles from Anaconda in Butte. Facing a difficult copper market, Arco decided to close the smelter after finding that it would cost more than $400 million to bring it up to national and state clean air standards.  Arco believed that Anaconda's copper concentrates could be processed more cheaply in Japan, where there is less concern over environmental issues and refining operations are more efficient. **********Essentially, Arco's solution was to buy a year's time for each of its employees. Together with the $3,500 severance checks, weekly supplemental unemployment that ranged from $100 to $140 for a year, medical coverage for a year and state unemployment benefits, employees took home about what they had been earning. The town of Anaconda received $3 million - at that time equal to three-quarters of its annual tax receipts -for a fund for redevelopment and 57 acres for an industrial park. A team of personnel specialists also helped find jobs for some employees within the company or in other mining companies, according to Arco. Few workers, however, successfully founds jobs through this service. **********By most accounts from state and local officials, the help did not make much difference. Nearly two years later, the development fund has created about 30 jobs. A plastics company that got a $900,000 development loan fund has filed for bankruptcy and 14 other businesses have failed. The unemployment rate is 13.7 percent and the City Manager, Daniel Worsdell, claims that it is nearer 18 percent. The population has shrunk from 12,500 to 10,500, and by the end of the year the town's tax receipts will have decreased by one-third, to $3 million. **********''There certainly could have been a better transition,'' said Mr.  Worsdell. ''I think Arco believes that the $3 million would pacify us, but we knew from the beginning that it would not be enough.'' **********''I would say that Arco was very arrogant in their dealings with not only the state but the local people,'' said Timothy Gallegher, an aide to Governor Ted Schwinden. ''We didn't have any bargaining power. They could do as they pleased. They were sympathetic, but they were unable to strike that nerve that runs from the brain to the pocketbook.'' **********In fact, Arco felt it was giving more than adequate help. Under the union contract, the company was only required to give supplementary unemployment that ranged from $50 to $90 a week for a year and free medical coverage for one month. **********When asked what sort of methodology the company used, Arco's Mr.  Cox explained the company strategy. ''We have closed down a large number of operations and we look at each case individually. Where there is a lot of additional mining in the area, then I think the need for some additional help is a lot less or even minimal compared to the other end of the spectrum,'' such as Anaconda, ''where the local community is solely dependent on the local operation.'' **********MANY at Anaconda believe that what went wrong started with the timing of the closure announcement. In hindsight, local officials believe that retraining and job relocation would have been more helpful than a lump sum of money that employees spent as if they were still working. **********Arco's Mr. Cox says that as early as 1977 company officials started to warn the union that environmental laws had put the smelter's future in jeopardy. He acknowledged, however, that the company sent some mixed signals. As late as the fall of 1980, for example, Arco told the union that the closing of the smelter was one of several options that included building an entirely new smelter. **********''One mistake that we made,'' Mr. Cox added, ''is that during that time, we paved the parking lot and built a new medical center. I have since learned that these developments sent the signal to the community that we would be staying open.'' **********It is clear, however, that no warning would have been sufficient to prepare the community for the smelter's closing. ''The people here absolutely did not accept the fact that the plant was closed,'' said Eudora Fald, the county welfare director. ''Even after a year, people would believe that the plant was going to reopen and the actual impact of the plant closure has really come in January when all the benefits ran out.'' **********Social economists who have studied the cycles that follow a plant closing say that this is not uncommon. One of the most important things that an employer can do is to help its employees begin looking for new jobs, they say. Such aid helps convince the employees that they will not be needed in their present jobs and forces them to look ahead. **********''The research we have developed over the last 25 years indicates that in regard to a worker's mental and physical health, intervention has to come before he really loses his job,'' said Louis Ferman, a professor in the School of Social Work at the University of Michigan. ''Most companies only become engaged after the plant is shut down and for the most part, the community effort lasts only six weeks.'' **********Some companies - Warner Lambert, for example - have become involved before a plant closing and have found that such an approach actually saves the company money because it does away with the need for supplementary unemployment and medical benefits. **********As for Arco, Mr. Cox said that copper market pressures did not give the company time to give advance notice. The company feared that other smelters would soon be closed, and that if Arco slowly phased out its Anaconda operations it might not be able to contract refining capacity when the plant was fully shut. ''We didn't feel that we had the luxury to take two years,'' Mr. Cox said. '' **********In Anaconda, there is the feeling that the help Arco gave the city was in no way commensurate with the years of service that the city had given to the company. In addition to the recession, prospective investors were faced with a city that would have to spend heavily to maintain services that Anaconda had provided in the past. **********''I thought we would have a hell of a lot more money from Arco,'' said Kevin McNelis, director of the Anaconda Task Force. The city has only $100,000 left from the $3 million redevelopment fund, and still has to pay for a new sewage plant that will cost $3.3 million. The town hopes to get $2.5 million from a Federal grant but will still be short $800,000. **********What will eventually happen to Anaconda is unclear. Other old mining towns have been able to survive as tourist attractions. If it is a portent, the best-looking office in Anaconda is the one that offers a trolley tour of the town's mining operations. **********Arco has not closed the door on additional help, but the company has made it clear that it will not simply offer money at any request. ''Our continued response has been that anyone who has a specific need should outline that in detail and discuss it with local employees,'' said Mr. Cox. ''So far nothing has come along that we felt was significant enough.'' BUTTE'S BLACK HOLE **********She's battered, and she's beaten, She's ugly and she's torn, She's battle-scarred and gutted, From the copper she has borne. **********Still she is majestic, As she sits upon her throne, A mile high and beautiful, To those who call her home.  George T. Grose, 1957 **********BUTTE, Mont.  Dog-eared and scruffy, the city of Butte, once a bustling mining town that supplied Anaconda's smelter with copper ore, has not had much luck lately. Since January 1980, more than 1,000 copper miners have been laid off, and, in April, the Atlantic Richfield Company temporarily closed its operations at the main Berkeley pit, a hole 2,200 feet deep and a mile and a half wide that looks more like the eighth wonder of the world than a depleted copper mine. **********The miners in Butte are not quibbling about the amount of benefits that Arco gave them when the Berkeley pit was shut - they received none because Arco considers it a temporary shutdown. There are about 800 miners still working in the East Berkeley pit, which is about a half-mile away from the main mine. **********''We got nothing,'' said John Connors, president of the local Steel Workers Union, which represents the miners. Mr. Connors and others question Arco's definition of a temporary closing. They believe that since Arco has taken steps that will ultimately allow the Berkeley pit to fill with water, the cost of pumping the water out will make it a long time before the mine is reopened. **********Arco acknowledges that the cost would be steep, but said that it has done it before in other underground operations. ''We don't feel that we have closed it, just shifted our people to the other end,'' said Ralph Cox, an executive vice president of Arco. ''We look at this as an efficiency move, not a closure. I am well aware that the people in Butte feel that we need to do something for them.'' **********Residents of Butte are fairly resigned to the idea that Arco and Anaconda will someday leave town altogether. In the company's heyday at the turn of the century, 12,000 miners worked for Anaconda and the town's population swelled to more than 80,000. Since then it has slowly declined to 35,000. Robert Stodden, who grew up in Butte and returned recently on vacation, said that when he entered the city, ''It was like seeing someone I had known all my life die in front of my eyes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/10/business/advertising-anheuser-s-interest-in-cable.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 723, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Anheuser's Interest In Cable", "print_headline": "Advertising; Anheuser's Interest In Cable", "body_text": " **********Anheuser-Busch, the country's largest brewery, has given up hope of a settlement of the football strike, according to Thomas Sharbaugh, group marketing manager and a panelist today at the Association of National Advertisers meeting here at the Breakers Hotel. **********He made his remark as a session on commercials for cable TV broke up. He was asked if the maker of Budweiser and other brews is transferring some of the big bundle of dollars committed to National Football League telecasts to cable, where the company has been an early and active participant. **********But he would only say that there ''is clearly a possibility'' that cable will get some of the money. Very little of the money from football so far has gone into cable. **********But from what Mr. Sharbaugh was saying about cable and the cable commercials he showed, it would seem more probable than possible.  Few advertisers, and certainly no other brewer, know more about the cable medium than Anheuser-Busch. **********In its quest of the 18- to 49-year-old male, especially the drinker of two six-packs a week and more, the Bud boys have long been on the ESPN and USA cable networks and the superstations.

But his spots were not for the larger audiences available on cable networks, but rather for Thompson's own experimental system in Massachusetts, the Cable Shop, or for the Westminster Kennel Club show that marked the first electronic advertising for Ken-L-Ration Biskits. **********Robert Alter, president of the Cable Advertising Bureau, indicated that the bureau has a library of commercials made for cable and is happy to make them available to advertisers and agencies. **********The cable panel was one of four concurrent sessions that kept people out of the newly arrived hot sun. Another was on the provocative subject of greater advertising productivity. The six-man panel was composed of two teams, each made up of a consultant, an agency man and a client. Dart & Kraft and Richardson-Vicks were the clients. **********Vicks and its agency, Benton & Bowles, using a system devised by Thomas K. Myers, a consultant, studied the productivity of the people working on the Clearasil account. Here, according to Roy J. Bostock, executive vice president of the agency, are the four main problem areas, which probably can be found throughout adland: **********- Too much time was spent collecting competitive data - 20 percent of the product manager's time and 40 percent of the account executive's -mainly because of ''organizational inertia.'' **********- Too many media plan revisions were required ''in an overzealous drive'' by the agency ''for perfection every time a budget number changed.'' **********- ''An arduous, almost tortuous legal aproval process at Richardson-Vicks for copy.'' This ''bottom-up'' study also found that too few key decision makers attended the meetings they needed to attend.

Brezhnev, who died suddenly on Wednesday at the age of 75, will be buried in Red Square, the Soviet leadership announced today. A four-day mourning period was declared, indicating that the funeral would be Monday. **********Although the exact cause of Mr. Brezhnev's death was not announced, it Message to Soviet people, page A12. was revealed for the first time that he had suffered from chronic heart and circulatory ailments. **********Official bulletins made public at intervals throughout the day suggested that the Kremlin was preparing for the largest funeral Moscow has seen since Stalin's death in 1953. No Word Yet on a Successor **********There was no announcement of any decision on a successor to Mr.  Brezhnev, who had held the post of general secretary of the Communist Party's Central Committee for 18 years, a term exceeded only by Stalin. His death also opens up the less important post of President of the Soviet Union, a position he had held since 1977. **********In an announcement, the leadership warned of a ''crushing retaliatory strike'' against any attempts by ''aggressors'' who might wish to take advantage of the loss. The statement said the Soviet Union would continue to try to eliminate the threat of nuclear war and insure detente and disarmament. **********Speculation on a new party leader focused on two of the 11 remaining full members of the Politburo, the Central Committee's inner cabinet. Andropov Heads Funeral Group **********One, Yuri V. Andropov, 68 years old, is a party bureaucrat and former head of the K.G.B, the internal security and intelligence agency, a post he vacated only six months ago to return to the party hierarchy. The other potential candidate, Konstantin U. Chernenko, 71, is also a career party official who was Mr. Brezhnev's chief of staff for more than two decades. **********Some Western diplomats believed that the leadership had given a hint of its choice with the announcement that Mr. Andropov would be the chairman of the funeral commission, a 25-member body that will oversee arrangements. The diplomats recalled that the chairman of the commission for Stalin's funeral in 1953 was Nikita S. Khrushchev, who later emerged as the party leader. **********Mr. Chernenko was made one of the members of the funeral commission, in a listing that placed the eight Politburo members who live in Moscow in alphabetical order after Mr. Andropov. Also on the commission is Viktor V. Grishin, 68, the Moscow city party leader, considered a possible compromise choice if neither Mr. Andropov nor Mr. Chernenko can gain a majority in the Politburo. The Politburo has the effective power to make the selection, which must be ratified by the Central Committee, a body of some 300 members. **********Other Politburo members on the commission who might have an outside chance at the top job are Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a 51-year-old agricultural expert; Andrei A. Gromyko, 73, the Foreign Minister; Arvid Y. Pelshe, 83; Nikolai A. Tikhonov, 77, the Prime Minister, and Marshal Dmitri F. Ustinov, 74, the Defense Minister. **********News of Mr. Brezhnev's death came at 11 A.M. in a two-paragraph announcement read on radio and television. The announcement followed 14 hours of uncertainty prompted by a sudden change of broadcast programming on Wednesday evening. The national television channel canceled a Police Day program for an early Bolshevik film, and radio stations dropped popular programs for broadcasts of serious music. Flags Not Immediately Lowered **********Although the announcement said that Mr. Brezhnev had died a ''sudden death'' at 8:30 A.M. on Wednesday, there was little in the 24 hours before the announcement to indicate that it was he who had died. Flags atop the Kremlin were not immediately lowered to halfstaff, and no unusual activity was visible in the Kremlin or at party headquarters. **********But several hours before the announcement, the official press agency, Tass, distributed the text of a message of greetings to Angola on its national day. The message, signed in previous years by Mr. Brezhnev, was sent in the name of the Central Committee. **********There had been speculation that the unusual goings-on heralded the death of Andrei P. Kirilenko, 76, who has been in ill health and whose resignation from the Politburo has been reported informally by Soviet officials, but the message to Angola suggested that it was Mr. Brezhnev himself who was dead. **********Eight hours after the announcement of Mr. Brezhnev's death, Tass made public a summary of the findings of the medical team.  It said that Mr. Brezhnev had ''suffered from arteriosclerosis of the aorta with the development of an aneurysm in its abdominal portion, constricting arteriosclerosis of coronary arteries, ischemic heart disease with heart rhythm trouble, cicatricial changes of the myocardium after infarctions.'' **********One Soviet source with high-level contacts said Mr. Brezhnev had collapsed at his dacha outside Moscow. The source said the delay in announcing the death arose from efforts to revive him after he had been taken to the Kremlin clinic on Granovsky Street. **********Within hours of the announcement, red flags with black ribbons went up on buildings and lampposts. Workers began repainting the green exterior of the neo-classical House of Unions, where Mr. Brezhnev will lie in state. **********All sporting events have been canceled through Monday, when the mourning period ends. Schools will be closed on the day of the funeral and artillery salvoes are to be fired here and in other major cities. **********Work is also to be halted for five minutes during the burial, except in industries, such as electric power plants and steel furnaces, where continuous operation is required. Salutes are to be given for three minutes by the whistles of factories, trains and ships. Burial Site Is Unspecified **********The bulletin announcing the formation of the funeral commission did not say where in Red Square Mr. Brezhnev was to be buried. Most prominent personalities who have been honored with a Red Square burial have their ashes immured in niches in the Kremlin wall. A few leaders, including Stalin, lie in a row of graves behind the Lenin Mausoleum. This will probably also be Mr. Brezhnev's burial place. **********A Russian with Central Committee contacts said the choice of successor as the party leader would almost certainly be made by the Politburo, but that, if a deadlock developed, the issue could be thrown to the Central Committee. As it happened, the Central Committee was expected to meet on Monday for a previously scheduled session, and it was thought that it could be used to decide on a new leader or ratify a choice already made. **********As for the other job vacated by Mr. Brezhnev's death, that of the nation's President, it is normally filled by the Supreme Soviet, the nominal Parliament, which, as it happens, was also scheduled to convene next week, on Tuesday, to ratify the budget and economic plan for next year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/25/world/around-the-world-us-envoy-not-worried-about-immigration-bill.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Envoy Not Worried About Immigration Bill", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; U.S. Envoy Not Worried About Immigration Bill", "body_text": " **********The United States Ambassador to Mexico, John Gavin, said today that he did not share the ''dire expectations'' of some Mexicans about the repercussions in Mexico of adoption of a comprehensive immigration bill ending in Congress. **********In letters to the sponsors of the bill, Senator Alan K.

VIEWED BY EX-CHIEF", "body_text": " **********From the moment that the Justice Department filed its antitrust suit against the American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation in 1974 until he retired in 1979 at the age of 63 as chairman and chief executive officer, John D. deButts was vehemently opposed to any settlement. He said that A.T.& T. would fight the suit ''to the end,'' and he declared that ''we are going to come out of this action in one piece.'' **********So how does he feel about A.T.& T.'s decision to divest itself of its 22 operating companies in a settlement that would allow the company a free hand to do business in previously prohibited areas, but leave it without its traditional local telephone service? Would Mr. deButts have done the same thing had he still been the A.T.& T.  boss? **********''It's hard for me to say, but probably yes,'' he replied, when interviewed by telephone at his 87-acre farm in Upperville, Va. ''The future of A.T.& T will be better than it was under the uncertain conditions that we were faced with.'' **********Mr. deButts went on to tell why he had battled so hard against divestiture during his chairmanship. ''We charged more for services, if you will, that are not essential, like color telephones and Princess phones, and more for long distance than the cost,'' he said.  ''The extra money was used to defray the cost of local service and everybody tho ught this was a good idea,'' Mr. deButts said. ''What the people wh o were talking about divestiture were doing was transferring the cost of paying for service from the optional to the basic custome r. That's the reason I was opposed to it.'' **********By ''optional,'' Mr. deButts referred to users of long-distance service, rather than local, or ''basic,'' service.  Mr. deButts observed that he now supports the settlement because ''of all the things that Charlie Brown said in his statement'' when the antitrust agreement was announced on Jan. 8. He referred to remarks by his successor, Charles L. Brown. With the possibility of long-term uncertainty, court suits and Congressional and Federal Communications Commission actions, Mr. deButts said: ''I'm sure what he did was right. I'm sure you'll find that Charlie Brown didn't want to break up the Bell System either.'' **********But what about the higher rates for local telephone service that many people say will result from the divestiture?  ''I don't know,'' Mr. deButts said, ''but my hunch is that local rates are going to go up.'' Mr. deButts is a tall, husky Southerner who started his Bell career in 1936 as a traffic trainee. During his career, he worked for a number of operating companies as well as the parent, and once headed the Illinois Bell Telephone Company, a post that has been a stepping stone to the top position at A.T.& T for more than one chief executive. Before becoming chief executive in 1972, he spent five years as A.T.& T.'s vice chairman. During most of his career, the telephone business dominated A.T.& T. thinking, but in the early 1970's Mr. deButts did launch some of the activities that got the Bell System started in new areas of telecommunications that it will now be allowed to exploit. **********And what does Mr. deButts - who resigned as a director of A.T.& T.  last year - think about being on the outside as his company enters the uncharted waters of unregulated businesses. ''I'm very happy and proud of the guys I left in charge of the business,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/28/business/beverly-hills-savings.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Beverly Hills Savings", "print_headline": "Beverly Hills Savings", "body_text": " **********The Beverly Hills Savings and Loan Association announced yesterday the re-election of its five-member board of directors at its annual shareholders meeting.

It was the lowest rate for one-year bills since July 1980. **********Based on results of the bill sale, the new rate for one-year taxexempt savings deposits known as ''All Savers'' certificates will be set at 6.26 percent beginning Sunday, down from 6.49 percent currently. **********Although investor demand for Treasury issues was modest yesterday, analysts said the firm tone of the market was a sign that many market participants are willing to buy securities now in anticipation of stronger investor demand early next year. **********All of the new Treasury note and bond issues sold in the last two weeks were offered late yesterday at prices equal to or higher than the average at the auction. The 9 3/8 percent notes due in two years were offered at 99 27/32 to yield 9.47 percent compared with slightly less than 99 27/32 at auction, and the 10 percent notes due in four years were offered at 99 30/32 to yield 10.02 percent compared with less than 99 22/32 at auction.

The 10 3/4 percent bonds due in 20 years were offered at 100 1/2 to yield about 10.68 percent, compared with 99 30/32 at Thursday's auction. **********Besides a revival of demand in January from investors who have been absent in the last few weeks, some analysts said that the general level of interest rates would decline as the Federal Reserve continued to make credit more available to the banking system. **********The latest banking data published by the Fed showed that in the week ended Wednesday banks borrowed an average of $320 million from the discount window at Federal Reserve banks, down from $490 million a week earlier. While some banks resorted to borrowing from the Fed, others held an average of $274 million of excess reserves, down from $593 million a week earlier. Bank Reserve Position **********Subtracting the borrowings from the excess reserves shows that the banking system was in a net borrowed reserve position of $46 million, in the week ended Wednesday compared with a net free reserve position of $103 million in the previous week. Because the Federal Reserve does not precisely control changes in bank reserves, analysts said the latest data showed that the Fed was continuing to supply about as much reserves as banks are required to hold, a policy it has been following since July. **********Some analysts said the improvement in prices yesterday was related to the Senate's approval of the 5-cent increase in the Federal tax on gasoline. While the tax increase will reduce the budget deficit only slightly, it was said to be significant because it showed a willingness to increase taxes that might be more broad when Congress reconvenes next year. **********Although the Government will be borrowing record amounts of cash in coming quarters, there will be a hiatus in January, when the only auctions will be for one-year bills, two-year notes, and the regular weekly sales of three- and six-month bills. **********Following are results of yesterday's auction of new one-year Treasury bills:"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/11/business/business-people-ford-appoints-leader-for-international-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1982-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 386, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford Appoints Leader For International Unit", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Ford Appoints Leader For International Unit", "body_text": " **********While the Ford Motor Company may be suffering with the rest of the automobile industry at home, it is profitable overseas.

Cohen, Acting Superintendent of New York State Banks, told Congress yesterday. **********The Bowery, with total assets of $5.1 billion, is the fourthlargest state-chartered savings bank in the state, and Emigrant, with assets of $3.1 billion, is the fifth-largest. There are 94 state-chartered savings banks in New York State. **********In addition to the Bowery and Emigrant, the department projects that the United Mutual Savings Bank of New York and the Mechanics Savings Bank of Elmira are in danger of running out of net worth by January. **********Branching Bill Approved **********In another banking development, the New York State Assembly passed a bill yesterday that would allow out-of-state banks to establish or acquire banks in New York, provided their respective states let New York State banks to do likewise. (Page D12.) **********Mr. Cohen, pleading before the Senate Banking Committee for Government assistance for the thrift industry, cited a survey conducted by the banking department of the 20 most troubled savings banks in New York State. Without Federal assistance, these banks would run out of net worth by July 1984, he said. **********Officials stressed that, even if this were to happen, it would pose no problem for depositors, whose accounts are insured up to $100,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, an agency of the Government. Acquirer's Obligation **********Generally, the F.D.I.C. merges a failing bank into a stronger institution, with most depositors hardly realizing any change has taken place. Under such an approach, even those with deposits of more than $100,000 do not lose any money because the obligation to pay is accepted by the acquiring institution. **********The debate in Congress is not over how to protect depositors, but over whether individual savings institutions should be supported by the Government and over the form such suport should take. The bills before Congress, for example, would allow the Government to provide failing savings institutions with capital notes, a form of Federal guarantees, that would allow them to survive as independent institutions. **********Without such notes, they would have to be merged into other institutions, the policy followed now by regulatory authorities.  The New York State Banking Department has been one of the most ardent proponents of Congressional or Federal action to bail out the thrift institutions. Muriel Siebert, who resigned as Superintendent of Banking last month to run for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate, had lobbied heavily in Washington for aid for the thrift units. **********Miss Siebert, in her efforts to get legislative results, often startled bankers by her public warnings that many savings institutions were on the brink of failure. In the past, bank regulators did all they could to reassure the public that the banking system was sound. **********Mr. Cohen, now the Acting Superintendent, took Miss Siebert's policy a step further yesterday by actually giving a list of troubled banks and projecting when they might fail. **********While the New York banking department is trying to keep the thrift industry intact, other regulators say there is no future for savings banks and contend that the troubled ones might as well be merged into commercial banks or other financial institutions now rather than later. Fear of Power Loss Cited **********Some bank analysts contend that the New York banking department, as well as others elsewhere in the country, fear that their own power would be reduced as a result of the demise of savings banks. State banking departments, they say, generally obtain their revenue from examinations of state-chartered banks, and most savings banks are state-chartered. **********But Mr. Cohen, in his testimony, contended that the states were better equipped to deal with failing thrift institutions than were Federal authorities. ''Without wishing to appear immodest,'' he said, ''we believe we know more about the chances for survival of New York state-chartered institutions than anyone at the Federal level.'' **********And, like Miss Siebert, Mr. Cohen argued that savings institutions ''must continue to be, as they have been in the past, the principal source of home financing for the American family.'' Others, however, contend that such institutions as commercial banks and pension funds can supply the nation's mortgage needs. **********Mr. Cohen's projections about thrift failures assume that interest rates will remain at or near current levels, or rise higher. If interest rates declined, the losses of thrift institutions would be reduced, and the life expectancy of the savings banks would be extended. If interest rates dropped precipitously, many savings banks would begin making profits. Rapid Interest Rate Rise **********The savings banks' losses are the result of the rapid increase in interest rates in recent years, which has forced the banks to offer relatively high rates to attract and maintain deposits. But since the yields on the savings banks' assets, mainly long-term mortgages, have not risen so quickly, almost all savings banks are paying more for their deposits than they are earning on their loans. **********Several years ago, when the general level of interest rates was lower, all savings banks were earning profits and these profits were kept in the banks' retained earnings or surplus accounts. These accounts represent the banks' net worth. **********Savings banks have been dipping into these net worth accounts to cover their recent losses. The net worth accounts act as a cushion between the losses and depositors' money."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/02/world/around-the-world-schmidt-in-skirmish-with-economy-minister.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Schmidt in Skirmish With Economy Minister", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Schmidt in Skirmish With Economy Minister", "body_text": " **********Chancellor Helmut Schmidt sharply criticized Minister for Economic Affairs Otto Lambsdorff today for remarks Mr. Lambsdorff made in a newspaper interview. **********The Government spokesman, Klaus Bolling, told a news conference that Chancellor Schmidt expressed his ''astonishment and irritation'' over the remarks during a Cabinet meeting today. **********On Tuesday the mass circulation Bild newspaper quoted the Economics Minister as saying voters at local elections in Hesse state this month could show whether they wanted his Free Democrats to quit the coalition. **********Mr. Bolling said the Chancellor felt the remarks could reduce the Government's room for maneuver and its standing abroad."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/25/business/advertising-hearst-fills-redbook-posts.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-10-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hearst Fills Redbook Posts", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Hearst Fills Redbook Posts", "body_text": " **********Hearst Magazines has just made some changes that really put its stamp of ownership on Redbook magazine, acquired last August from the Charter Company. **********It has put in its own publisher and ad director. **********Alan M.

But how do you spot those that will? Professional money managers make a business of identifying such turnaround stocks, so managers from four firms were selected at random and asked how they make their picks. **********Mr. Metz and Mr. Weinger, stock analysts for Oppenheimer & Company, say they often spot turnaround candidates among companies that announce major debt restructurings. ''The first type of restructuring that we love is a bankruptcy,'' Mr. Weinger says. ''We think a stock should go up when a bankruptcy is announced; and in many cases these companies have become some of the best investments.  In those that have worked out, people have made huge amounts of money. When they don't work out, you either lose half your money or you break about even,'' Mr. Weinger adds. **********Among those companies that recently filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws and may now be potentially good investments, McLouth Steel, a big supplier to Detroit, is a standout, according to the Oppenheimer team. ''If Detroit ever comes out of this 'We-hate-domestic-automobiles' phase, McLouth may be a very valuable property,'' Mr. Metz added. **********Another important indicator of a turnaround is an announcement that a company plans to sell some of its assets because of a liquidity squeeze. A recent example is the Culbro Corporation. After the company sold off its Ex-Lax division, the stock soared from about $3 a share to more than $20. **********Mr. Addison is publisher of the Addison Report, an investment advisory service in North Quincy, Mass. One thing he looks for in making investment decisions is whether an industry or company has recently made major changes in its operations. An example he cites is Esmark, which has sold off major portions of its Swift meat-packing subsidiary, and a number of other units. ''With the cash that they garnered, they eventually bought shares of their own stock in the market, reducing shares outstanding and increasing earnings,'' Mr.  Addison says. **********Beatrice Foods is another example, Mr. Addison says. The food processing company is divesting itself of certain units and undergoing major internal changes. ''Despite these changes, Beatrice has still managed to produce about a decades' worth of earnings growth,'' he says. **********Other companies that meet Mr. Addison's turnaround criteria are Norton Simon and Ideal Toy.  Trends in the bond and commodities markets are also helpful indications of turnaround situations, Mr. Addison says. Currently, he argues, falling prices in grains and sugars bode well for cereal and bakery companies and food processors such as Interstate Bakers, Warner-Lambert and Fisher Foods. ''With the demand for products from these industries remaining at least constant, their profit margins stand to widen tremendously in the foreseeable future - which will work its way down to increased earnings,'' Mr. Addison says. **********Mr. Dreman, of Dreman, Grey & King Inc., an investment counseling firm in New York, says that ''in a very complex economy, with all sorts of random political, economic and industry events, we don't think forecasting is a very good thing to emphasize.'' He argues that selecting stocks from those industries that have the lowest priceearnings ratios is the most disciplined approach to sound investment in any market. **********''Basically, we're looking for cheap stocks, those with low P-E ratios, because every study that we've seen has shown that these stocks have always done better in the market as a group,'' Mr. Dreman says. But he adds that he takes the process a step further. ''We don't only want low P-E's,'' he says. ''We want to make sure the company's going to last. We don't want to buy a Ford at three times earnings, if earnings are going to go straight down. We want good dividends and the likelihood that dividends will increase.'' **********Mr. Dreman finds good buys right now in the relatively depressed property and casualty insurance industry. Current favorities include Travelers Insurance and Crum & Foster. Another ''out of favor'' bargain is Aetna Life and Casualty, according to Mr. Dreman. **********Banks are another currently depressed group and are potentially good investments over the long run, he says, and recommends Wells Fargo, a ''high-yielding, low P-E stock that we think is very cheap,'' along with Citicorp and Chase Manhattan. **********Mr. LeFevre, a vice president of Purcell, Graham & Company, looks for potential turnaround situations primaril y by plotting a stock's price movement. ''One of my favorites is a sa ucer formation,'' he says. ''This is where a stock has been in a d ecline, and starts to move side-wise in a bottoming process. Then i t starts to edge up in asaucering formation. Usually that means you'r e at the end of something. That is a good time to establish a position.'' **********Volume flow is another good indicator, according to Mr. LeFevre.  The rule is that rising volume on declining prices is bearish, while rising volume on advancing prices is bullish. Mr. LeFevre adds that if a stock reaches new highs but the volume is contracting, it is not necessarily healthy. **********''Usually at the end of a long sustained declined, there's a tremendous amount of volume,'' he says. ''This is where the little guy is being sold out on a margin call.'' But this is often when such stocks start to rally. He cites I.B.M., the Manville Corporation (formerly Johns Manville) and Bethlehem Steel as stocks currently in that situation. **********Still, Mr. Lefevre stresses that a sound investment strategy requires attention to company fundamentals - earnings and dividend records, management changes, etc. - as well as good technical analysis. ''You can get great chart formations,'' he says, ''but if your fundamentals tell you this thing's headed for Chapter 11, then you just forget the chart.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/30/business/advertising-partnership-is-formed-for-software-magazine.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-09-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Partnership Is Formed For Software Magazine", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Partnership Is Formed For Software Magazine", "body_text": " **********A former Time Inc. chap and a Boston advertising woman have combined their talents with some cash from E.F.

But many believe it is too early to call it a lasting recovery and are afraid that any benefits could evaporate in another outbreak of fare wars this fall. **********Such discounts, in fact, are a major reason behind the increase in pleasure travel, as opposed to the business travel that is the industry's backbone. **********Ellen Friedel, for example, a legal secretary for Price Waterhouse & Company, was picking up tickets for a pleasure trip to Boston last week at an Eastern Airlines office near Rockefeller Center - $42, round trip, from Newark. ''If it was $150 or something,'' she said, ''we would just drive down to the beach in New Jersey.'' **********Another customer, a lawyer, was making a trip to Florida over the weekend just to get away from her job. Because of the state of the economy there are few chances for raises and advancement at her firm. ''I just need to get away,'' she said. **********That sort of business is improving the airlines' outlook, at least for the short term.  ''We're beginning to see a slow, gradual recovery in the industry which will strenghten in the third quarter,'' Julius Maldutis, airline analyst for Solomon Brothers Inc., predicted. **********But according to Neil M. Effman, senior vice president of airline planning for Trans World Airlines, ''it's far too early to tell'' whether the improvement will last. In fact, he added, ''I don't see any basic, fundamental increase in traffic that looks like a recovery for this industry.'' **********He also noted that while some of the discounting of fares had moderated, many fares remain at levels where the airlines are not making money. **********Traffic, as measured in revenue passenger miles - or the number of paying passengers multiplied by the number of miles flown - began its rise in February, with a 5.4 percent increase from figures a year earlier. In March, traffic was up 11.2 percent, and in April, 6.7 percent. **********In May, there was a drop of 3.4 percent, but analysts and executives alike noted that a year earlier traffic was extremely strong because of a special $149 fare offered by most major airlines that enabled a traveler to go anywhere in the country. **********Mr. Maldutis said that preliminary figures for June show that traffic has been running about 7 percent to 8 percent higher on domestic schedules of the 11 major trunk airlines. **********He predicted that the upturn would continue into July, when traffic would increase by 8 percent to 9 percent, and that it would be up about 14 percent in August. The big jump in August, he said, would at least partly reflect the sharp traffic declines of a year earlier, when the controllers' strike began. **********The outlook for the fourth quarter, however, is less certain.  ''We don't feel very strong on the fourth quarter,'' said Wesley G. Kaldahl, senior vice president for planning at American Airlines.  He said much depends on the economy then. **********For the year, he expects traffic to be up 6 percent to 7 percent, compared with a 7.4 percent decline last year and a 6 percent decline in 1980. **********What happens to profits this year, airline executives warn, depends on a number of factors besides traffic. If the airlines begin extensive fare cutting like last fall and if they throw new capacity into their routes in attempts to wrest customers from competitors, then yields will suffer. **********Yields, which measure the revenue derived from carrying one passenger one mile, dropped 9 percent in the first quarter, to 12.01 cents, compared with 13.23 cents in the first quarter last year. And the major airlines lost $590 million in the three-month period. **********Working in favor of airline profitability are labor costs, which in many instances have decreased as a result of wage cuts and concessions on work rules by unions, and a decline in fuel costs. **********Still, the fare question haunts airline executives.  One executive of a major airline noted that in the past when there was an upturn in traffic and planes filled up, most airlines began to eliminate the deep-discount fares, and that the same pattern can be seen in the current upturn. **********In time, however, many carriers could not resist the temptation of adding capacity to capture more traffic, often setting off major price wars. **********This time around, he said, the carriers are constrained by the aftereffects of the air controllers' strike, which put severe limits on adding flights at major airports, and by the memory of Braniff's bankruptcy filing. Such constraints could act as a check on fare wars. **********But as Mr. Kaldahl said, ''I'm fearful that once the summer season is over, there will be a going back to pricing actions.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/18/world/major-espionage-scandal-reported-in-britain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 274, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MAJOR ESPIONAGE SCANDAL REPORTED IN BRITAIN", "print_headline": "MAJOR ESPIONAGE SCANDAL REPORTED IN BRITAIN", "body_text": " **********British officials are investigating a major espionage case involving poor security at a top secret communications station, British news organizations said today. **********The Times of London said the case involved the Government Communications Headquarters at Cheltenham, 90 miles northwest of London. **********The headquarters controls a worldwide network of communications and surveillance stations monitoring millions of international messages that code and language specialists analyze.

For one thing, Mexico's depressed stock market seems incapable of absorbing a flood of shares. For another, the country's private sector is pressing for the return of the shares to their original owners while leftist groups argue that the state should control them. **********''If the Government keeps these shares,'' said one distraught Mexican businessman who asked not to be identified, ''then we're definitely moving toward a socialist economy.'' Some Large Blocks Involved **********The bank nationalization has already changed the face of Mexican business, temporarily at least. By taking over Banca Serfin and Banpais, for example, the Government automatically inherited 37.37 percent of the shares - making it the largest single stockholder - of Cydsa, a Monterrey-based chemical company. **********Similarly, by expropriating Bancomer, until two weeks ago Mexico's second-largest private bank, the Government became the owner of a controlling 68.7 percent of Minera Frisco, a major mining company.  The Government has even found that it holds 48.5 percent of the shares of El Puerto de Liverpool, a major retail chain, as well as shares in other department stores. **********While businessmen are complaining loudly about the Government's increased role in the economy, leftist economists take a different view. They argue that the bank nationalization exposed enormous power exercised by the country's leading financial groups. **********There was a concentration of resources, with the two largest banks -Bancomer and Banamex - controlling 47 percent of total assets and the top six banks (including two already owned by the Government) controlling 79.5 percent of all assets. Further, although 59 banks were nationalized on Sept. 1, only a handful of the banks were important shareholders in private companies. Stock Accumulation Policy **********Mexico's banks insist they did nothing wrong. The banks not only were authorized to operate nationwide but also were encouraged to invest bank deposits in shares as a way of promoting development. **********The nonfinancial investments of Bancomer were channeled into such diverse areas as chemicals, paper, tires and retailing. At the prevailing exchange rate six weeks ago, these shares were worth $224 million, or 56 percent of the bank's net worth. **********Banamex, which had recently become Mexico's largest bank through its diversification strategy, had widely varied interests, including a 40 percent share of Bufete Industrial, one of the country's largest construction concerns. Banamex also held shares in hotel chains, food processors, telecommunications companies and retail stores. Stocks held by the bank were valued on July 31 at $324 million, or 80 percent of its net worth. **********Some banks were closely linked to major economic groups. Banca Serfin, for example, had been transformed from the traditional Bank of London and Montreal into the country's third-largest bank after it was taken over by the aggressive Visa conglomerate, based in Monterrey. Similarly, Banpais was effectively part of the Vitro glass group, also with headquarters in Monterrey. Timber and Other Holdings **********Multibanco Comermex, the fourth-largest private bank, also had its roots in the provinces in the so-called Chihuahua Group. Its main business is timber, but the bank also had interests in steel, and it owned 21 percent of Transportacion Maritima Mexicana, the country's largest shipping line. **********In some cases, Mexican banks had formed joint ventures with foreign investors (including the Ralston Purina Company, Deere & Company, the Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Anderson, Clayton & Company) because a ''Mexicanization'' program limited foreign ownership to 49 percent of an enterprise. Some subsidiaries of American corporations now find themselves in partnership with the Government. **********Even before the bank nationalization, the public sector already accounted for about 50 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product through control of the oil, electricity and railroad sectors plus major stakes in petrochemicals, fertilizers, mining, steel and aviation. **********Further, the Government had also accumulated hundreds of manufacturing and service companies as a result of its tradition of taking over bankrupt companies and banks to salvage jobs and deposits. Suspension of Stock Trading **********Having nationalized the banks, President Jose Lopez Portillo's administration shows reluctance to alienate the private sector further by holding onto the banks' industrial shares. Yet the Government seems uncertain how to dispose of them. **********The trading of common shares has been suspended on the Mexican stock exchange since the nationalization two weeks ago because of the uncertain status of the shares inherited by the Government. **********Investment analysts argue that, with most stocks already at a low ebb, the Government could not sell its new shares without badly damaging the market. An alternative, they suggest, would be to negotiate a realistic price for the shares and hand them back to the private banks' former owners as partial compensation. **********''The problem with that is political,'' one analyst said. ''The Government is boasting that it has broken the economic grip of the financial groups, but returning the shares would effectively rebuild them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/10/world/wanted-more-arms-military-analysis.html": {"writer_name": "Drew Middleton", "pub_date": "1982-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1067, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Military Analysis", "print_headline": "WANTED: MORE ARMS; Military Analysis", "body_text": " **********Argentina's most urgent military problem is the acquisition of more advanced weapons from the Western European powers that have sold arms to the country's military establishment for 15 years but that have now imposed an embargo on such sales to Argentina. **********Only an influx of additional advanced weapons, including air-tosurface and surface-to-surface missiles, analysts said, will enable Argentina to match a steadily expanding British task force in the South Atlantic. **********According to NATO sources, Argentina has begun an almost frantic search for more weapons. Buyers have appeared in European capitals and in the Middle East, which is a flourishing center for sales of light surface-to-air missiles and land mines, most of them of Soviet origin. Simultaneously Argentina has pleaded with arm sellers abroad to hurry deliveries of weapons already ordered and paid for.  But such deliveries from members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Common Market - West Germany and France, for instance - are now suspended because of the clash with Britain over the Falkland Islands.  The Common Market embargo against Argentina expires May 17, but it may be extended. **********Would Have to Run Blockade **********Arms deliveries from other countries, military specialists here said, would have to run the British blockade. Although the Royal Navy is not known to have interfered so far with commercial vessels headed for Argentine ports, such interference is considered likely if British intelligence detects merchant ships carrying arms to Argentine ports. **********Political intelligence here does not accept suggestions that Argentina, in desperation, would turn to the Soviet Union for arms.  The reason is practical rather than ideological. The Argentine forces have no training in Soviet weapon systems, and even if the anti-Communist military Government purchased such weapons, it would take months before the Argentines could deploy and use them. **********Argentina's own arms industry is being expanded under the direction of the Armed Forces Scientific and Technical Research Center. The expansion, analysts said, will mean a greater flow of light weapons to the army. But they do not expect Argentine industry to provide advanced weapons or the spare parts for aircraft and ships purchased abroad. **********After Brazil, Argentina has been the second largest arms buyer in Latin America. Brazil has the largest military establishment in South America and a strong arms industry. Brazil Might Send Arms **********Although political sources here emphasized that relations between Argentina and Brazil are usually strained, they acknowledge that there is a possibility that Brazil, to show third world solidarity, might provide some arms to Buenos Aires if deliveries from Europe fail to materialize. **********Over the last five years, according to the International Peace Research Institute in Stockholm, West Germany has supplied 33 percent of Argentina's arms purchases. Scheduled for delivery from West Germany before the beginning of the Falkland crisis were 4 destroyers, 4 submarines and 2 missile-armed naval vessels. Under West German license, Argentina is building 4 submarines, 6 frigates and 220 light tanks. **********Until the late 1970's Argentina bought a wide variety of arms from the United States. The shift to European purchases, experts said, was a result of the Carter Administration's ban on arms sales, imposed because of the junta's reported violations of human rights. **********Since the end of World War II the United States had delivered to Argentina 2 cruisers, 6 destroyers, 2 submarines, 101 combat aircraft, nearly 100 transport planes and about 25 attack and transport helicopters. One Crusier Scrapped, One Sunk **********Only the General Belgrano, one of the cruisers, has figured significantly in the fighting with Britain. She was torpedoed by a British submarine in the first major encounter of the conflict. The other cruiser was scrapped in 1979. **********French-made weapons have done the most damage to the British. A Super-Etendard fighter-bomber, one of the 14 scheduled to replace American A-4's on the aircraft carrier Vienticinco de Mayo, fired the French-made Exocet missile that reduced the British destroyer Sheffield to a smouldering hulk. **********The price of the Exocet, which gives a fighter-bomber the hitting power of a battleship, has risen ''astronomically'' since the attack on the Sheffield, a source in the British arms industry said.  Argentina is believed to have five more Exocet air-to-surface missiles. **********Before the West European boycott, Argentina had been awaiting the delivery of 9 more Super-Etendard aircraft, the source added, as well as 10 Roland surface-to-air missiles and 9 Puma helicopters.  Also on order from France are 3 frigates, additional Mirage fighters, 25 more helicopters, 96 armored cars and an unknown number of surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles. Some British Deliveries **********Purchases from Britian, made before the crisis, included three types of missiles, naval radio transmitters and electronic countermeasure devices and control systems. In addition Britain had sold Argentina two frigates. **********Israel has sold 26 Dagger fighters to Argentina. There are reports, vigorously denied by Israeli sources, that 14 more have been purchased. Israel said last week that it would make no future arms deals with Argentina but would deliver those arms already paid for by Buenos Aires. **********British military sources believe that Argentina lacks military depth to maintain a protracted conflict. A continuation of the fighting, they said, would force Argentina to cancel its existing arms exports. Argentina is the seventh largest exporter of arms to third world countries, with most of the weapons going to smaller South American countries such as Uruguay. Stocks May Run Out **********The crunch will come, these sources predicted, when spare parts for advanced aircraft run out and the stock of missiles is exhausted. These, it was said, cannot be replaced under present political and military circumstances. **********The Argentine armed services' ability to maintain weapons varies, the sources added. The air force's ability is rated very high, as many of the ground crews have been trained in the United States and Western Europe. The navy is only slightly behind. **********The army is the questionable service in this regard. A NATO analyst said that the army has been provided with a profusion of advanced weapons but that the use of many is beyond the ability of the conscripts who make up nearly 70 percent of the army."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/13/business/careers-corporate-real-estate-managers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 838, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Careers; Corporate Real Estate Managers", "print_headline": "Careers; Corporate Real Estate Managers", "body_text": " **********THE General Motors Corporation, worrying about the recession and the slump in car sales, made an innovative real estate deal some months ago when it received about $500 million for its New York office building on Fifth Avenue. G.M. is using the money for working capital. **********The transaction not only showed the new interest that many companies are taking in their real estate but also indicated potential job opportunities. **********This process has been going on for some time, according to Alan M.  Higgins, president of the General Tire Realty Company and manager of its real estate. ''The turning point in our industry came in the last four or five years,'' he said in an interview. **********Lee Van Leeuwen, who specializes in recruiting real estate managers, describes the trend as ''a slow realization'' by big companies of the latent value of their real estate assets. Mr. Van Leeuwen is managing partner of the real estate specialty division of Korn/Ferry International, a management recruiting firm. **********''In the past two years we have placed more real estate managers with corporations than in the previous 12 years,'' he said. ''The quality of the managers is improving, but many still are not at the top, possibly because the job of real estate manager has never been a route to the top.'' Formerly many real estate managers were recruited from within the company, coming from the law or financial departments. **********''Real estate managers need to know how to negotiate and communicate,'' Mr. Van Leeuwen said, When companies need expert help with their real estate, traditionally they have asked outside consultants to advise them, and often they seek joint-venture partners. But this will change, Mr. Van Leeuwen suggested. Real estate managers, he said, have been ''stepchildren'' for too long. **********He observed that the heads of corporate real estate departments often were not familiar with the objectives of top management. Real estate managers have not had easy access to their company's top officers, who have been too busy with other things to worry about real estate. As a result, many companies have underestimated their real estate holdings on balance sheets, he said. **********Andrew H. Madsen, director of corporate real estate at the Atlantic Richfield Company for the last two years, says there is a ''tremendous need'' for experienced real estate managers. Before joining Arco, he spent 25 years in the Ford Motor Company's real estate department. ''Everything is much more complex now,'' he said.  ''Some companies do not even know how much real estate they own or lease. There is increased pressure to use the real estate efficiently.'' **********Retailing is one field where companies have long recognized the importance of real estate - ranging from huge department store chains to fast-food franchisers. Much of a store's success depends on the choice of a site, so retailers have built up efficient real estate departments and pay among the best salaries, Mr. Van Leeuwen said. **********The new interest in real estate as an important balance sheet item comes at a time when many companies have been badly hurt by the recession and high interest rates. Some have closed outmoded plants and sold them, while some think in terms of selling prospering plants and leasing them back to raise working capital. Others realize that once the recession ends there may be a new boom in real estate, and they want to be able to turn real estate holdings into cash or advantageous rental deals. **********Mr. Higgins of General Tire, who is also chairman of the 2,200-member National Association of Corporate Real Estate Executives, recently calculated that, in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 largest companies, the stock value of a group of middle-size companies approximated only 57.9 percent of the their fixed assets, not including cash, inventories, notes receivable and equipment. The reason, he said, is that many companies have undervalued their real estate assets through conservative accounting. **********As for job opportunities, he said, corporations are looking for seasoned real estate managers with an entreprenurial flair, and they will pay well. **********''Unfortunately, that creates a three-tier system,'' Mr. Higgins said. ''There are beginners with bachelor or master's degrees in real estate, who can command $15,000 to $22,000 a year, those with four to six years' experience who might earn about $40,000 and those with 10 years' or more experience who can command salaries of $70,000 to $90,000 and more. **********''The salaries at the top end are high because there are so few who qualify. Real estate managers cannot afford to make mistakes that might have been acceptable 10 years ago.'' **********Experienced managers are moving around more often as companies build up their real estate departments, he said. The prestige of these corporate real estate experts is growing. **********''The real estate manager holds a highly visible job nowadays,'' Mr. Higgins said, ''and in many companies he communicates weekly with the chairman.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/14/business/advertising-addenda.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 18, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Addenda", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Addenda", "body_text": " *********** Hodges & Sokolosky International Inc., a new public relations company, at 116 East 78th Street."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/20/business/japan-s-fujitec-a-move-to-us.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1982-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAPAN'S FUJITEC: A MOVE TO U.S.", "print_headline": "JAPAN'S FUJITEC: A MOVE TO U.S.", "body_text": " **********As Shotaro Uchiyma sees it, a truly global company ought to be run from New York City - the financial and information capital of the world, he says. **********So the 66-year-old president of the Fujitec Company, the fourthlargest elevator maker in Japan, is moving his company's worldwide headquarters to 450 Park Avenue. **********Mr. Uchiyama is also fond of Ohio. Next month, construction will begin on a $50 million elevator plant in Lebanon, Ohio. When completed at the end of 1984, it will be the largest elevator factory in the world, Mr. Uchiyama said during an interview at the corporate offices in this city outside Osaka. **********At the 140-acre Ohio site, Fujitec plans to make 3,000 elevators and 600 escalators a year; it also plans a 1,000-foot tower for elevator research and development. Although other Japanese companies have sizable manufacturing sites in the United States, Fujitec is believed to be the first to put its headquarters in America. 'Interesting and Unusual Move' **********''As far as I know, no other medium-sized or large Japanese company has ever moved its worldwide headquarters to the United States,'' said Ikusaburo Kashima, deputy director of the Americas-Oceania division of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. ''It is a most interesting and unusual move.'' **********''In Japan,'' Mr. Uchiyama said, ''people think what we are doing is very strange. But from our viewpoint, it is very natural.'' Indeed, since its founding in 1948, Fujitec has stood apart from the Japanese business establishment. Mr. Uchiyama is one of Japan's breed of free-wheeling entrepreneurs of the postwar era - a group whose best-known members include Soichiro Honda of the Honda Motor Comany, Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita of the Sony Corporation, and Isao Nakauchi of Daiei Inc., a supermarket chain. **********All of them have been unusually aggressive, willing to flout traditional Japanese business practices. They are also more globalminded than their corporate peers. **********In the Japanese elevator industry, Fujitec is an outsider in an insider's game. The three largest producers -Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi and Toshiba - are old-line companies that are part of powerful industrial groups. Holds 10% of Market **********In these circumstances, analysts say that Fujitec has done well to garner about 10 percent of the $500 million-a-year market for elevators and escalators in Japan, compared with 35 percent for Mitsubishi, 30 percent for Hitachi and 12 percent for Toshiba. **********But Fujitec has found the biggest share of its growth abroad, partly because of the domestic competition. In addition, Fujitec has specialized in more sophisticated and costlier elevators - priced from $50,000 to $200,000 apiece - that are installed in high-rise buildings. Such buildings are comparatively scarce in Japan because of earthquake concerns. **********The company refers to its product as the ''Rolls-Royce of elevators.'' Its forte is supplying new buildings that require several elevators with computerized controls. **********''The large-scale project that demands a high level of technology is our market, and such projects are hard to find in Japan,'' said Takakazu Uchiyama, managing director and 30-year-old son of the president. Bulk of Sales Is Abroad **********Only about one-third of Fujitec's $245 million in sales last year came from its operations in Japan. And only 2,000 of its 7,000 employees are in Japan. Overseas, Fujitec has 17 sales offices and manufacturing plants in seven countries. It has been especially successful in the office building booms in Hong Kong and Singapore. **********In the United States, too, Fujitec has captured a number of contracts in the past couple of years. These include supplying elevators for the 43-story Boston Stock Exchange building, the 43-story Louisiana Tower and the Lamar Building in Houston and the 35-story Seattle Sheraton. **********Company officials say that its business has about doubled in the past five years. Shotaro Uchiyama predicts that Fujitec may well grow to the sales level of $500 million a year over the next three years. **********Whether the company can reach or even approach those goals depends largely upon the outcome of its big moves to the United States. Some analysts say the plan involves considerable risks. **********In the United States, Fujitec will be taking on Otis Elevator, a subsidiary of the United Technologies Corporation. Otis is the world's largest elevator producer, with more than 25 percent of the global market. By contrast, Fujitec reportedly has about 2 or 3 percent. The Westinghouse Electric Corporation, another American elevator producer, is also several times as large as Fujitec. **********But others note that Fujitec has a firm track record of successfully establishing local manufacturing facilities abroad. ''We think the Ohio plant will do well,'' said Yasuo Akiyama, an analyst for the Nikko Securities Company in Osaka. **********In recent years, Fujitec has apparently been quite profitable.  Although it is not required to report consolidated financial results, company officials say its profit for the year ended last September was about $24.5 million, for an unusually high 10 percent of total sales. A Leader in Technology **********Moreover, Fujitec is regarded as a leader in elevator technology.  Its top-of-the-line elevator, the company says, is the fastest in the world. At the 500-foot-high tower in Ibaraki City, Mr. Uchiyama enjoys showing a visitor that three coins balanced on edge on the floor do not tip over as the high-speed elevator climbs and descends. **********Last year, Fujitec developed a security system, using a prism on the elevator's ceiling and electronic light-sensing devices.

But the spokesman said the company ''would consider a sale if an interested party made a serious offer.'' **********Volkswagen purchased the plant in 1980 and refurbished it to manufacture 180,000 units a year of its Rabbit and Jetta models to meet what it thought would be growing demand. **********Last year, the company announced plans to invest $82 million to acquire and equip an auto parts plant in Barrie, Ontario. The goal was to have the Canadian plant supply the plant in Sterling Heights and a Rabbit assembly plant in Westmoreland, Pa., with such items as axles and engine parts. **********Under a United States-Canadian automotive trade agreement, Volkswagen would have been allowed to export parts to the United States or to import finished Rabbit models to Canada duty-free. **********But the continuing slump on the American automobile market has badly hurt Volkswagen sales. According to a spokesman, deliveries in the United States in the first eight months of the year totaled 145,964 units, 36.6 percent less than in the period last year. Sales of the American-made Rabbit were off 47.2 percent and sales of imported models dropped 21.7 percent. **********And now company officials acknowledge that the ambitious strategy of coordinating Canadian and United States production will have to be put off indefinitely. Indeed, analysts here say that if Volkswagen is ready to accept purchase offers for the Michigan plant, it probably would consider shelving the strategy altogether. But company officials say there are no plans to sell the Canadian factory. Earnings Reported **********Reporting on the company's performance, Volkswagen said in a letter to shareholders last week that the company had net earnings of $3.2 million in the second quarter, compared with a loss of $4.6 million in the period last year. That was the company's first quarterly loss since 1975. **********The report said that consolidated net earnings in the first half totaled $25.1 million, at present exchange rates, compared with net earnings of $5.9 million in the period last year. Sales rose to $7.9 billion from $7.6 billion. **********The company said that weak domestic sales and flagging export orders would force it to close most of its West German plants for three to six weeks this fall - affecting two-thirds of its 120,000 workers - to reduce inventories. It is the first time since 1975 that falling sales have forced the company to close its German plants. **********The company also said that worldwide sales to dealers in the first six months dropped 1.9 percent, to 1.17 million units, while production worldwide increased 4.1 percent, to 1.2 million units."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/10/business/video-game-industry-is-jarred-anew.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1982-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 963, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY IS JARRED ANEW", "print_headline": "VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY IS JARRED ANEW", "body_text": " **********The video game industry was further jolted yesterday as Warner Communications Inc.'s stock plunged 16 3/4 points on the New York Stock Exchange, to 35 1/8, and Mattel Inc., the second-largest video game company behind Warner's Atari division, said it expects a loss in its current fiscal quarter. **********The announcements indicated to industry officials and analysts that severe competition had quickly soured the once highly profitable game business, hurting even the giants. **********''We've been looking for a shakeout in cartridges all along,'' said Michele Preston, who follows the industry for Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc.  ''The surprise was we didn't expect Atari to be the one shaken out.'' **********The stock market's negative reaction extended to other companies in video games, home computers or retailing, despite statements made by some in an attempt to disassociate themselves from the reaction. **********Coleco Industries, a video game company, dropped 3 1/4, to 34 7/8.  The Tandy Corporation, a retailer of video games and maker of home computers, dropped 6 points, to 50 1/2, while Toys ''R'' Us, a leading toy retailer, fell 4 1/2, to 47. Mattel did not trade at all late Wednesday and all day yesterday. Mattel Earnings **********Mattel said yesterday that earnings for its third quarter ended Oct. 30 rose 39.4 percent, to $28.3 million, or $1.31 a share, from $20.3 million, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues climbed 28.4 percent, to $479.7 million, from $373.5 million. Mattel said that operating profit in the electronics division, mainly video games, more than doubled to $45 million, accounting for 63 percent of operating profit. **********But for its fourth quarter, which closes at the end of January, the toy-and-game company said it expects a loss, despite the fact that shipments of video game hardware and cartridges are likely to exceed levels of last year's fourth quarter. **********Among the reasons cited for the loss are the general retail industry slump and the stiff video game competition, which entails heavy promotional costs. Mattel has been offering a $50 rebate, recently reduced to $25, for purchase of its Intellivision game machine. Warner Falls Sharply **********Warner's shares plunged when trading on the Big Board was finally resumed yesterday afternoon following a halt at about 3 P.M.  Wednesday. However, over-the-counter trading had continued in the interim at levels around $36 a share. **********The company had said Wednesday that its earnings for the fourth quarter, ending Dec. 31, would be substantially below expectations - roughly 60 cents a share compared with $1.17 a share last year and $1.80 or so that analysts had been estimating. The company attributed the decline to lower-than-expected sales of video-game cartridges and coin-operated arcade games. The company also said that Perry Odak, president of the Atari division in charge of video games, had been relieved of all duties. **********Yesterday, Geoffrey Holmes, Warner vice president for investor relations, said Mr. Odak was still on the payroll although his new responsibilities had not been determined. He said Mr. Odak's removal from office was ''a question of management style and philosophy'' and ''had nothing to do with'' Atari's disappointing sales in the fourth quarter. 'Some Tough Questions' **********Not all analysts were convinced that Warner had told the whole story. ''There are going to be some tough questions to answer,'' said Harold Vogel of Merrill Lynch & Company. **********Meanwhile, other companies tried to disassociate themselves from the panic affecting video-game company stocks.  ''There's no reason why all of the stocks should be off,'' said Arnold C. Greenberg, Coleco's president and chief executive officer.  ''The business is healthy. It's just that Atari no longer has the overwhelming market share.'' **********Coleco, which entered the video game business this year, said it expects fourth-quarter sales to exceed record third-quarter sales of $165.6 million. It also said it has increased production of its new video game system, Colecovision, and expects to ship more than 500,000 in 1982. **********Coleco did not project earnings for the quarter or the year.  However, Mr. Greenberg said in an interview that analyst forecasts of $5.25 to $5.50 a share for the year, or $1.40 to $1.65 a share for the quarter, were reasonable. That would put fourth-quarter earnings below the $2.29 a share recorded in this year's third quarter, but it would be in sharp contrast to the loss of 9 cents a share in 1981's fourth period. Retailers' Sales **********Retailers also said game sales were good.  ''We got painted with the same brush; I don't know why, we're not even in the same business,'' said Garland P. Asher, director of financial planning for the Tandy Corporation, referring to the drop in Tandy's stock. Tandy sells Mattel's video system under its own name. He said the company's game cartridge sales were better than expected although they represented only a tiny part of Tandy's business. **********Toys ''R'' Us issued a statement saying the video game cartridge business has been ''very good'' this year and has continued that way during the Christmas season. **********Another company likely to be affected by the downturn in game stocks is Imagic, a fast-growing game-software company that had been planning to make its first public stock offering this month. William F.X. Grubb, president, said Imagic is assessing the situation. **********David J. Londoner, an analyst with Wertheim & Company, said the shrinkage in game-industry profits was inevitable, although it happened surprisingly swiftly. **********''I think the mistake Wall Street made,'' he said, ''is that they viewed this as a proprietary electronics business. It's the toy business. And the toy business does not get 24 to 25 percent pretax margins.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/13/business/scientific-leasing-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SCIENTIFIC LEASING INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "SCIENTIFIC LEASING INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/10/world/un-opens-photographic-display-of-palestinians-slain-in-massacre.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 506, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

A caption says, ''Brutal Massacre in Beirut, Lebanon, September 16-18.'' It says, ''The killing began when armed groups entered'' the camps. **********Israeli officials, now conducting an inquiry into the massacre, have shown that the Israeli Army permitted Lebanese Christian militiamen into the camps and the Lebanese did the killing. Preview of the Display **********Last night, just before the exhibit opened, Mr. Akashi invited Zehdi Labib Terzi, the P.L.O. representative at the United Nations, and M. Fakhri Saghiyya, Lebanon's deputy delegate, to examine the display. United Nations officials said that if either had objected, the exhibition would have been delayed. **********Mr. Akashi, however, said the preview was ''just a courtesy'' that was extended because the event took place in Lebanon and the victims were Palestinians. Asked what he would have done if either had protested, he replied, ''I can't answer a hypothetical question.'' **********In a resolution condemning the massacre and Israel, the General Assembly on Sept. 24 ordered the Secretariat to erect the display. It will remain near the visitor's entrance until Nov. 19. **********In a related development, Mr. Akashi dismissed Israeli charges that a United Nations monthly, the UN Chronicle, was guilty of ''biased and unfair reporting'' of Israel's invasion of Lebanon. In a telephone conversation, the United Nations' public relations chief said he had not completed his reply to the complaint, ''but our findings so far have been that there was not any departure from the principles of impartiality.'' The Israeli Complaint **********The charge of bias came from Yehuda Z. Blum, the Israeli delegate, in a letter to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. Mr. Blum singled out the Chronicle's account and pictures in its October issue dealing with the events in Lebanon. **********Among other things, he complained of the magazine's reference to ''indiscriminate violence turned on the civilian population.'' He objected to a photograph showing cars passing a roadside stand and captioned, ''Beirut in happier days.'' This, said Mr. Blum, implied that Beirut had enjoyed peace until the Israeli Army came, although the city ''had already endured seven years of bloody civil war.'' **********Mr. Akashi's department, he said, ''has recently taken on the task of misinformation,'' and he asked that the October issue of the Chronicle be withdrawn."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/01/business/british-load-parts-for-soviet.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 957, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRITISH LOAD PARTS FOR SOVIET", "print_headline": "BRITISH LOAD PARTS FOR SOVIET", "body_text": " **********Huge blue cranes began loading a Soviet ship today with British-made components for the natural gas pipeline that will run from Siberia to Western Europe. It is the second such shipment from Europe in defiance of President Reagan's attempts to block Western help for the project. **********At the George V Dock on the south bank of the River Clyde, Scottish longshoremen swarmed over a 4,000-ton freighter called the Stakhanovets Yermolenko, lowering into her hold crates half as big as boxcars containing the parts of six giant turbines. **********They are the first consignment of an order for 21 such turbines, worth $182 million to the manufacturer, John Brown Engineering. This company, with headquarters in Clydebank, just across the river, was ordered by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to fulfill the contract despite Mr. Reagan's threats of punitive action and despite her friendship with the President. **********Aware of the Controversy **********Members of the 34-man Soviet crew were affable, welcoming reporters and photographers on board today and discussing the loading operation. Karp Srabov, the chief engineer, said he expected to complete the voyage to Leningrad by Sept. 15. **********Adolf Shikhov, the first officer, was asked whether he was aware of the international controversy surrounding his cargo and, if so, what he thought of it. **********''Of course, we are aware of the dispute,'' he replied. ''We read the newspapers, and we listen to the radio. But we just do our job.We take cargo to its port of destination. We leave the rest to others.'' **********This cargo consists of more than 500 cases totaling 2,000 tons. The biggest items - cylinders 20 feet long and big enough for a man to walk through -weigh more than 35 tons each. Each case bears this stenciled legend in both Roman and Cyrillic letters: ''For Machinoimport USSR Contract 50-0401-22007.'' **********Following the first such shipment of equipment last week - by Dresser France for Creusot-Loire - both the subsidiary of Americanbased D**ger Industries and the French company were placed on a trade blacklist by United States authorities. It was reported in Washington today, hk*ver, that senior Administration officials were recommending that the sanctiions be softened, both for the French and other European companies involved. Doubt About a Compromise **********Executives of John Brown Engineering, a subsidiary of John Brown & Company, said privately that they were dubious about the possibility of a compromise, as suggested over the weekend by Bill Brock, President Reagan's special trade representative. Nor could they shed light on unconfirmed reports that Mrs. Thatcher planned to compensate British companies affected by American punitive measures. **********The Prime Minister is to begin a tour of Scotland Wednesday and may discuss her plans at a meeting with trade union officials.  John Smith, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on trade matters, said Sunday that Mrs. Thatcher should reject any compromise proposals, urged her to work toward a common Western European policy in opposition to that of the United States and argued that John Brown should be indemnified against losses because it was acting in defense of ''a vital national interest.'' **********The Soviet freighter, a trim four-year-old vessel with a black hull and white superstructure, arrived late Monday night after battling heavy seas on her way around the northern tip of Scotland. She will return via the English Channel to avoid the hard going. The ship was especially designed to handle heavy cargo, with two gantries and a loading ramp. Cooperation From Russians **********Loading began at 8 o'clock this morning. Ian McGarvey, an official of the Clyde Port Authority, said the Russians had been polite and cooperative, including helping with the press arrangements. He expressed some surprise at this. **********''I guess it's because all of this is one up for them,'' he said.  ''If it wasn't, none of us would get any closer to the ship than the pier.'' **********The sudden appearance in the last few days of six or seven fresh pipeline photographs from Tass, the Soviet press agency, also led to speculation that Moscow was being particularly responsive to Western requests. But at The Associated Press, which transmitted the photos, Hal Buell, A.P.'s general manager of news photos, said: ''We have over the months requested pictures periodically, and they had not come in. Suddenly they are forthcoming.'' **********The port of Glasgow has been hard hit by the development of container ships, which use the facilities at Greenock, closer to the mouth of the river. So the dock workers, as one heavily tatooed man put it, are ''damned glad of a week's work and not bothered where the stuff we handle goes.'' **********Much the same attitude prevails in Clydebank, which has watched the closure of one shipyard and factory after another in recent years.  Any loss of business by John Brown as a result of American action would cause great bitterness in the view of trade union leaders and politicians here. Criticism in British Press **********British newspapers, including those generally sympathetic to the United States and to President Reagan, such as The Daily Telegraph, have criticized American policy, calling it misguided. **********It may, in fact, be impossible for John Brown to complete its contract, whatever Mrs. Thatcher might wish. The turbines, which will push the gas along the pipeline, need rotors that are supplied by the General Electric Company in the United States.

On the domestic front, the market drop also reflected concern over the slack economy and the uncertain fate in Congress of a tax bill intended to reduce deficits by raising $98.5 billion during the next three fiscal years. Overseas, worries centered on the intensified Israeli attacks on Beirut. **********''Many people appear to be throwing in the towel, although the selling today was not particularly aggressive,'' said Jack Baker, who heads equity trading at the First Boston Corporation. ''A number of institutions pulled their bids to buy stock below current prices and that weakened the market.''

However, several block traders at brokerage houses predicted that the trading pace could increase today, particularly if the industrial average drops below 800. **********Losses were especially apparent in the energy, defense, technology, drug, computer, railroad, airline, brokerage and utility sectors.  The market's setback followed a drop of 5.71 points on Tuesday and provided a sharp contrast to Monday's advance of 13.51 points in the industrial average. Monday's rise matched the Dow's best gain in four months. View on Interest Rates **********The broad upswing Monday was attributed to a decline in interest rates, which did not continue Tuesday and yesterday. Mr. Baker summed up the sentiment of numerous market professionals when he said, ''There are signs that the bulk of the interest rate decline - for the present, at least -may be behind us.'' **********One specific piece of news served to unhinge whatever fragile confidence remained yesterday. Shortly before 3 P.M., the Manville Corporation said its directors had voted to omit the quarterly dividend. At 2:30 P.M., the industrial average had been down only 5.90 points. Manville, formerly Johns-Manville, has suffered from the slowdown in the housing market and recently reported a loss for its June quarter. Its shares fell 1 1/8, to 8 1/8. **********The issue is among the 30 components of the Dow industrial average.

''I can't recall a similar instance since the end of World War II.'' **********Only 383 issues advanced in price on the New York Stock Exchange, while 1,088 stocks finished lower. Yesterday's setback in the Dow industrials was the biggest since a decline of 13.04 points on Feb.  22, when the average finished at 811.26. Subsequent upswings in the market have been blunted by high interest rates. Tektronix Off Sharply **********Tektronix Inc., a leading producer of cathode ray oscilloscopes, plunged 3 5/8 points, to 38 5/8. Some analysts have reduced their earnings estimates for the company and there were reports that one leading analyst changed his rating from ''buy'' to ''hold.'' **********Amid trader fears of a possible price war in home computers, Warner Communications dropped 2 points, to 39 1/4, in heavy trading. This brought its loss so far this week to 5 3/4 points. There were declines exceeding 2 points in such issues as Pfizer, General Dynamics, Texas Instruments and Motorola. **********Hanna Mining fell 1 1/8, to 17, after reporting sharply lower Junequarter profits and reducing its quarterly dividend to 35 cents from 50 cents. **********Avon Products continued to weaken, declining 3/4, to 20 3/8.

''Prepare the Action Alert,'' he orders. **********Carrot-haired, slightly broad of girth in middle age, with steel blue eyes glinting in the excitement of a fresh campaign, Mr. Garcia has just begun to turn up the heat from one of the city's newest ''coalitions'' - the superlobbies that are organizing to influence legislation, especially in the trade sector. **********What distinguishes Mr. Garcia's organization, the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, and other coalitions from the simpler, more socially oriented lobbies of the past is the breadth of their constituency, usually spanning the gap between labor and management. **********Action Alert is a memorandum that is hand-delivered from staff headquarters of the coalition to the line officers - legislative directors of 40 large and medium-size companies, 14 labor unions and three Governors. The objective is to coordinate a campaign of letter writing, Mailgram sending, telephone calling, legislative visiting and some party giving to get more direct lending authority for the Export-Import Bank. **********''We want to prevent our members from tripping all over each other on Capitol Hill so that when we lobby, we can lobby effectively,'' said Mr. Garcia, executive director of the coalition and a longtime participant in earlier export wars as former vice president of the Emergency Committee for American Trade. **********''Wining and dining are less important these days,'' he added. ''In fact, they're a real pain, especially for younger legislators who merely want to go home in the evenings. What counts is coming up with a persuasive case.'' **********Other superlobbies have such names as the Labor Industry Coalition for International Trade (called Licit), the Group of 33 (33 trade organizations and unions seeking more effective enforcement of laws against unfair trade), the Leather Products Coalition (three unions and four trade associations resisting competition from the projected duty-free zone in the Caribbean Basin) and the Committee for the Preservation of American Color Television (known as Compact). **********That they are mushrooming in the trade sector, noted Lawrence B.  Krause, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is a reflection of the growing role of international trade in the economy. Imports and exports now account for about 15 percent of the gross national product, twice the percentage a decade ago. ''It's an area where Government policy matters -matters a lot,'' Mr. Krause said. ''There are issues for labor and management to rally around.'' 'Closer Meeting of Minds' **********Stanley Nehmer, an economist advising coalitions seeking tougher import enforcement, added: ''With a $40 billion trade deficit, and all that that means for employment and profitability, a closer meeting of minds between labor and management is a natural reaction.'' **********The Coalition for Employment Through Exports, which held an organizational meeting attended by 140 company, union and state government lobbyists last April 29 at the Mayflower Hotel, is mobilized to fight on a single issue: the Reagan Administration's proposed cutback in direct lending authority of the Export-Import Bank to $3.8 billion in the fiscal year 1983 from $5.4 billion in 1981 and $4.4 billion in 1982. **********The bank, started as a Government agency in 1934, seeks to encourage the exporting of American goods and services, primarily by offering loans to foreign importers at below-market interest rates. **********Other industrial countries have similar institutions to foster their own exports and have managed on a number of occasions to offer more competitive - or, in effect, more heavily subsidized - financing, winning orders from such companies (and coalition members) as Boeing, General Electric, Westinghouse and Caterpillar Tractor and from such smaller companies as Frederick Electronics and Gould Pumps.  Labor Unions' Involvement **********Labor has joined because of fears that American multinational companies, to obtain more competitive financing, will fill export orders from their foreign subsidiaries instead of domestic plants.  This has already led to some job losses for Americans, according to a recent survey by the Machinery and Allied Products Institute. In a poll of 39 companies, it found that in 1981 contracts worth $386.7 million were shifted to foreign affiliates primarily because better financing terms were available. **********Mr. Garcia, noting that every $1 billion lost in United States exports means 30,000 fewer job opportunities, distributes lists of the lost contracts. The lists show, for example, the failure of the Boeing Company to sell six 757's to Singapore Airlines because interest rates at least three percentage points lower were offered by the European Airbus consortium. There was also the Japanese defeat of a General Electric Company bid to sell Venezuela medium-steam turbines, again because of substantially better credit terms. **********The opposition to the Export-Import Bank, which is now losing money in its efforts to meet some of the foreign competition, comes from deep inside the Reagan Administration, mainly from David A. Stockman, the budget director, and from those in Congress opposed to subsidies for companies while social programs are being cut back. Budget Director's Rationale **********In his interview in the December 1981 issue of The Atlantic that drew so much attention, Mr. Stockman explained that he felt it politically necessary to cut the Ex-Im Bank because it gave the impression that he was dealing with business and social programs evenhandedly. **********''If we're ever caught not cutting this while we're biting deeply into the social programs, we're going to have big problems,'' Mr.  Stockman said. ''I've got to take something out of Boeing's hide to make this look right.'' **********Boeing's president, Malcolm T. Stamper, a leader in the coalition, replied to Mr. Stockman with some passion in a recent speech: ''Too bad he didn't know at the time that taking it out of Boeing's hide meant the useless sacrifice of jobs not only at Boeing but also throughout our 3,000 supplier network in 44 states.'' **********The identification of exports with jobs has brought such labor organizations into the coalition as the United Automobile Workers, the Communications Workers of America, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Seafarers International Union of North America. **********''We cannot allow foreign governments to impair the ability of our exporters to compete effectively in world markets while we declare unilateral disarmament by cutting Ex-Im to the bone,'' said Frank Drozak, president of the Seafarers Union. **********Governors Bob Graham of Florida, Lee Dreyfus of Wisconsin and John Spellman of Washington also joined, noting the importance of farm and industrial exports to their states. **********Mr. Garcia and his legislative directors are now putting their main lobbying efforts behind a budget amendment to lift the Ex-Im lending ceiling to $4.7 billion from $3.8 billion. He expects many more Action Alerts before the battle over the bank's future has ended."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/28/business/conrail-pares-quarterly-loss.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Conrail Pares Quarterly Loss", "print_headline": "Conrail Pares Quarterly Loss", "body_text": " **********The Consolidated Rail Corporation said today that it lost $25.7 million in the first quarter, the smallest loss for that period in the railroad's six-year history. **********In the comparable 1981 quarter, Conrail lost $65.9 million. **********Firstquarter revenue fell 14.2 percent, to $944.2 million, from $1.1 billion. **********Conrail, which until the third quarter of 1981 had been federally subsidized, said carloadings - the number of freight cars filled with a particular commodity - were down 22 percent this quarter from the comparable 1981 period. **********Declines were recorded in iron and steel carloadings, which dropped 33.7 percent; automobiles and automobile parts, down 27.9 percent; chemicals, down 22.7 percent, and coal, down 16.7 percent. **********''Providing that there is no significant further deterioration of the economy, Conrail should be able to continue its progress this year toward its goal of profitability,'' L.

Conheeney, telephoned to say: ''I have in my hand a memo written by Richard Freeburg to Stephen Greenberg dated Nov. 2, 1981.

It's normal activity.'' **********''What Drexel did was 'group raiding,' '' James Flynn, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch, contended.

Australia has been encouraging exploration to reduce its dependence on Saudi Arabian oil, which now accounts for about 35 percent of what the nation uses. Virtually all of Australia's domestic oil comes from the Gippsland Basin in the southeast. **********Promising areas under development are the Cooper Basin in the eastcentral region, the waters of Bonaparte Gulf in northwestern Australia and, south of there, the Canning Basin. A fourth area is the Amadeus Basin in the nation's heartland. **********These projects could reduce Australian dependence on Arab oil someday, but rising consumption could outpace discoveries for years to come. The Government adopted a pricing policy in 1976 that was intended to stimulate exploration. **********Before that, Australian oil cost $2.60 a barrel in the Gippsland Basin. Under the incentive plan, newly discovered oil was priced at ever-rising prices until parity with Saudi Arabian light crude was reached in 1980. Newly discovered oil sells at $32.25, which is equivalent to $35.50 a barrel in United States dollars. **********Australian oil companies have announced through their trade association that they plan to drill 302 exploration wells and 102 development wells this year. In 1981 they drilled 149 exploration wells and 55 development wells. **********But Trevor Jones of the Wall Street branch of Rivkin Securities, an Australian brokerage firm, says there are not enough rigs to drill that many wells, and he believes the total will fall far short of 404 wells. He expects it to be closer to 280 or 300. **********Anthony Mitchell, another native of Australia, is with the Drysdale Securities Corporation at 55 Water Street. He is urging his firm's retail clients to seek capital gains in the Australian oil and gas boom. In the four promising basins, he notes, one out of every four wells drilled was a success in the last quarter of 1981. **********Mr. Jones agrees that a continuing exploration and development effort is essential because the Gippsland producing fields are expected to peak in the late 1980's, barring new discoveries. **********Major discoveries are certainly possible. Mr. Mitchell said superior American seismic technology had contributed to the success ratio in the Gippsland Basin, where new techniques applied to old seismic data have led to successful drilling. **********Mr. Mitchell said that, if the unusually high success ratio in the new fields continued, American and Canadian rigs would arrive in increasing numbers and the drilling pace would intensify. **********Shares of Australian oil companies are depressed at this time. The Australian oil and gas price index fell 27 percent in 1981, and so far this year it has declined a further 10 percent, to 600. **********With the stock prices at low levels, Australian companies are straining to raise much-needed equity capital. Some have had to sell exploration rights to large American companies, Mr. Mitchell said. **********Even so, he says he believes shares of many Australian companies are poised for substantial capital appreciation. Although his firm does not recommend specific issues, h e said S antos Ltd., BHP and Offshore Oil Ltd. seemed well positioned.

Now, according to Western diplomatic sources, drafting is under way on the proposals for the next phase, which concern the machinery for enforcing a cease-fire and the role of a United Nations peacekeeping force. **********Present indications are that these proposals will adhere closely to plans originally drawn up by the United Nations four years ago and will not reflect major concessions to South Africa. A Complex Voting Formula **********The South-West Africa People's Organization, it appears, will then be asked to reconsider the voting issue in the context of this broader proposal -an approach that would implicitly promise that the negotiations might be concluded fairly rapidly. **********There is no indication that South Africa has agreed to reconsider the complex voting formula, which would mix the proportional representation system of voting with direct election on the basis of defined constituencies. But there is speculation that South Africa has agreed to help speed up the negotiations by dropping its major objections to the old United Nations plan. **********These were stressed at the start of last year, when the United Nations got the major sides in the dispute on Namibia, as the territory is also known, to a conference table in Geneva in an effort to win agreement on a cease-fire date. **********South Africa then said it would be impossible to discuss a date until the United Nations demonstrated its ''impartiality'' by rescinding an old General Assembly resolution recognizing the insurgent movement as the ''sole and authentic representative'' of the Namibian people. Some Issues Seem to Be Fading **********South African diplomats later insisted that they could not agree to the stationing of a United Nations force in the former German colony, which South Africa received under a League of Nations mandate after World War I. **********Now ''impartiality'' and the role of the United Nations force appear to be fading as issues. South African officials decline to confirm a press report from London that they have already accepted the proposals for the next phase, pointing out that the proposals have yet to be presented to them formally. But last year's major issues, which were expected to be the big stumbling blocks to the present initiative, are now discussed as if they were minor. **********If this stance is maintained, there will be heavy pressure on the South-West Africa People's Organization to put aside its objections on a voting formula in order to achieve a cease-fire that would end the guerrilla struggle in the northern part of the territory.  Otherwise, the movement will have cast itself in the role of the recalcitrant party, which South Africa formerly played. **********The movement's reasons for objecting to the voting formula have been about as obscure as South Africa's reasons for insisting on it.  But it appears that the movement was pput off by a pattern it discerned in the negotiations, in which the Reagan Administration seemed to it to be tailoring the tactics of the Western group to accommodate South Africa. White Representation in Assembly **********South Africa's reasons for insisting on the mixed voting system, in which each ballot would, in effect, be counted twice, seemed to result from two conflicting aims. One is to insure that right-wing whites supporting the National Party in the territory are represented in the assembly that would draft the constitution for an independent Namibia. **********Since the whites are almost everywhere outnumbered by blacks, this can only be insured under the proportional representation system. But that also happens to be the system that most favors the South-West Africa People's Organization, whose support is thought to be heavily concentrated in the northern part of the country. **********Since it is South Africa's other main aim to see that the insurgents fall short of the two-thirds vote that would be necessary to control the assembly, it follows that it also favors the system of direct voting as a way of diluting the movement's support."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/16/business/barnwell-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-yr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 51, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BARNWELL INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Yr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "BARNWELL INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Yr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/world/britons-show-gratitude-for-american-support.html": {"writer_name": "William Borders", "pub_date": "1982-05-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 672, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRITONS SHOW GRATITUDE FOR AMERICAN SUPPORT", "print_headline": "BRITONS SHOW GRATITUDE FOR AMERICAN SUPPORT", "body_text": " **********The United States support in the confrontation with Argentina was received in Britain today with enormous gratitude and a sense of relief at the sight of two old allies back in the same corner. **********''Yanks A Million,'' screamed The Sun, the country's largest circulation newspaper, in a front-page headline; The Times made the same point more sedately in an editorial titled, ''A Friend Indeed.'' And in sun-drenched Trafalgar Square, a welder named Robert Leland, who with his two young sons was feeding the pigeons, said: **********''It's one of those times, isn't it, when you've got to stand up for what's right just because it's right. That's what we've done over there in the Falklands, and we're glad to have the Americans in it with us.'' **********Throughout the weeks that Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.  was acting as a mediator between Argentina and Britain, spokesmen for the Government here said repeatedly that they understood the necessity for the United States to avoid siding with one or the other, in order to retain the confidence of both. Time and again, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher went out of her way to praise Mr.  Haig, calling him tireless and his peace mission splendid. U.S. Had Been Criticized **********But the public - and some opposition Members of Parliament - did not always see it that way. In one of the earlier debates on the Falklands crisis, David Owen, the foreign affairs spokesman of the new Social Democratic Party, criticized the United States with the observation that ''it is not possible to be neutral between the fire and the fire brigade.'' **********Prime Minister Thatcher has been a particularly strong ally of the United States during her three years in office. When the American hostages were being held in Iran, Britain's support was unswerving, and just last month it was the only Western European country to send observers to the election in El Salvador, doing so at the behest of the United States. **********In recent weeks, Mrs. Thatcher made it clear several times that she expected the United States to support Britain strongly in the Falklands crisis if its mediation effort ended. When that finally happened Friday, Foreign Secretary Francis Pym, speaking for the Government, said: **********''The British people are deeply grateful to the United States. I am extremely glad that the United States has come down decisively on the side of Britain.'' **********In common with several other newspapers, The Times pointed out in its editorial today that the United States decision to impose sanctions against Argentina would raise difficulties for it elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere. But that made the decision all the more admirable, it said, thus gaining the Americans support on this side of the Atlantic.

But some of their comments on it are still tinged with a sense of unreality that the British fleet is really involved in such an adventure so far away. **********That spirit, coupled with the lingering British bemusement at the idea of having a former movie star for President of the United States, was reflected in the paragraph with which The Sun began its front-page story today: **********''Good old Ronald Reagan finally came galloping over the hill yesterday to stand by Britain in its war with Argentina.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/09/business/security-bancorp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SECURITY BANCORP reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "SECURITY BANCORP reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/27/business/l-japan-s-struggle-236932.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 355, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAPAN'S STRUGGLE", "print_headline": "JAPAN'S STRUGGLE", "body_text": " **********To the Business Editor: You do an excellent job of pointing out the shortcomings of an economic and cultural system that many American managers have come to view with uncritical awe. However, you failed to present an effective argument for the point persistently implied: that the Japanese economy cannot continue to prosper if it maintains its present course of development. **********The forte of the Japanese has been to select high-volume, highvalue manufactured products and produce them more carefully and efficiently than anyone else. Their goods are commonly cheaper, of higher quality and more reliably delivered than those of their foreign competitors. Understandably, consumers do not care that the Japanese did not invent the internal combustion engine, the cathode ray tube, the transistor or magnetic recording tape. People buy Japanese televisions, cars, radios, and VCR's because they are relatively inexpensive, they operate reliably and they incorporate the latest features. **********The simple question is, why can this not continue? The Japanese may prove incapable of inventing the next wave of new products, but it is not clear that they need to. Good inventions are often snapped up by others before they reach their peak revenue years. **********The Japanese have stumbled before, and they may do so increasingly if new product technology becomes more turbulent. But it may be wrong to think that a country can prosper by being merely creative. Even if we have created a market by inventing its product, we only hold on to it and profit from it by aggressively pressing the development of product improvements and superior manufacturing methods.

Until now, these transmissions have crossed the country on long-distance lines such as those of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company and MCI Communications Corporation, the nation's second-largest long-distance telephone company.

Over all, advances led declines by more than a 2-to-1 ratio. **********Several Factors Involved **********Oil and oil-service companies benefited from several factors.  ''Emotion played a part,'' said Lincoln A. Werden of Thomson McKinnon Securities. ''Heightened tensions in the Middle East renewed fears of a possible disruption of oil supplies from that area.'' **********In line with this reasoning, he said, shares of companies concentrating their production in the Western Hemisphere performed better than the big international oils. **********The largest gain on the active list among producing companies, for example, was posted by Standard Oil (Indiana).

Texaco and Mobil, two other giants among the international oils, also rose 3/8 each. **********Another factor in sending oil issues higher, according to Eugene Nowak of Dean Witter Reynolds, was the disclosure that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was producing less than 16 million barrels of oil daily, or more than a million barrels below the group's official ceiling. ''Also, spot prices for crude oil have risen recently,'' he said. **********Finally, energy issues have been so depressed lately that they seemed ripe for a recovery, according to analysts.  In this year's first three and a half months, stock prices of domestic oil companies fell almost 20 percent, Robert L. Stern of Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins noted. Meanwhile, international oils tumbled slightly more than 11 percent, while oil-service issues plunged almost 25 percent. Schlumberger Rebounds **********The oil-service sector joined in yesterday's rally as Schlumberger, the industry leader, rebounded 2 5/8, to 44 7/8, after showing a 31 percent increase in quarterly profits. Global Marine and Smith International both moved higher after reporting increased quarterly earnings. **********Sears, Roebuck, the volume leader on a turnover of more than 1.3 million shares, gained 5/8, to 20. The company reported this week that profits rose 35 percent in the first quarter. **********Electric utility issues continued to gain. Con Edison rose 1/4, to 37 5/8.

Polaroid, which reported a sharp drop in quarterly profits late yesterday, fell 3/4, to 18 7/8. Missouri Pacific, down 1 1/4, to 48, also showed lower earnings. **********Improved prices for natural-resource issues resulted in a gain for the American Stock Exchange's market-value index.

Danforth, Republican of Missouri, and his colleagues sponsored a resolution urging Mr. Reagan to clarify his policies and recent actions, which, the measure states, ''have caused anxiety at home and abroad.'' **********In addition, the six officials, who are either former directors of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency or former arms negotiators, said in a statement that they could not support the President's decision to defer talks on a treaty for a comprehensive nuclear test ban. Tests are now banned in the atmosphere, the sea and outer space, but are permitted under ground. **********The two moves reflect concern in Congress and in arms control circles over Mr. Reagan's approach to arms control. U.S. Objective Since Eisenhower **********The statement of the former officials says his decision last month to postpone talks with Britain and the Soviet Union on a complete test ban ''undercuts a national security objective set by President Eisenhower and pursued by every Administration since.'' **********The officials added that the decision also cast doubt on American sincerity in the talks with the Soviet Union on strategic, or longrange, nuclear weapons and other arms issues. **********The statement, which was issued by the Committee for National Security, a Washington-based group, was signed by four former directors of the arms control agency: William C. Foster, who served from 1962 to 1969; Gerard C. Smith, 1969 to 1972; Paul C. Warnke, 1977 and 1978, and Ralph Earle 2d, 1979 and 1980. **********The text was also endorsed by Adrian S. Fisher, who served in 1967 and 1968 as negotiator of the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons, and Herbert F. York, who was negotiator in 1979 and 1980 in the talks on a comprehensive nuclear test ban. Two Former Aides Do Not Join **********Two former arms control directors did not join in the statement: Fred C. Ikle, who is now Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and George M. Seignious, who worked for President Carter. **********On the Senate floor on Monday, Senator Danforth called on President Reagan to provide a comprehensive report on United States nuclear weapons policy by Dec. 1. The Senator noted that more than 10 years had passed since the United States and the Soviet Union had ratified an accord in the arms field. **********''The Government of the United States must get off the dime,'' he asserted.  Senator Danforth also chided the Administration for deferring efforts to negotiate a total test ban and for delaying ratification on two other treaties limiting underground nuclear testing until verification provisions could be strengthened. **********He said ratification of the two treaties was long overdue and the decision to defer the talks for a complete test ban was tantamount to ''throwing years of useful negotiations into the wastebasket.'' The Senator also maintained that it was inconsistent for the President to pursue the strategic arms talks while opposing a complete ban on testing. **********In addition, he said that President Reagan's new policies on stemming the spread of nuclear weapons had created ''grave uncertainty about United States weapons policy.'' Specifically, the Senator called on the President to explain how the relaxation of export controls on nuclear fuel and sensitive nuclear technologies would help halt the nuclear weapons spread. **********''Our credibility as a leader in nonproliferation is at stake,'' Senator Danforth said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/27/world/reagan-and-aides-meet-with-shultz-to-review-policy-haig-is-not-present.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1982-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1409, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HAIG IS NOT PRESENT", "print_headline": "REAGAN AND AIDES MEET WITH SHULTZ TO REVIEW POLICY; HAIG IS NOT PRESENT", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State-designate George P. Shultz conferred with President Reagan today and then said he saw his role as an opportunity ''to advance the causes of peace, freedom and justice in a world so troubled and so anxious to hope for a good future.'' **********Speaking to reporters after flying by helicopter to the Pentagon from Camp David, Md., where he had lunch with Mr. Reagan, Mr. Shultz said he had been ''truly surprised'' by the sudden resignation of Alexander M. Haig Jr. as Secretary. **********Mr. Haig, who is still acting as Secretary of State for an indefinite period, was not present at today's meeting. In his letter of resignation to the President, he said he was leaving because the Administration was not after ''the careful course'' of foreign policy he and Mr. Reagan had originally agreed upon, and he has refused requests from the press to be more explicit. Differences Are Cited **********Mr. Reagan, who announced the resignation Friday, also has given no reasons, and briefings by White House officials have been vague. But a State Department official said today that the Secretary had resigned because of an accumulation of personality and policy differences with Reagan aides. **********Mr. Shultz, who had been in Europe on a business trip, flew here from London aboard a British Airways Concorde jet this morning. He was met at Dulles International Airport in nearby Virginia and taken by the Presidential helicopter to the Camp David retreat in the Catoctin Mountains. **********William P. Clark, the national security adviser, who met Mr. Shultz at Dulles along with James A. Baker, the White House chief of staff, and Edwin Meese 3d, the White House counselor, said later that Mr.  Shultz and Mr. Reagan had had ''a very constructive lunch'' under a pine tree at Camp David. He said they had discussed ''the broad outline'' of the Administration's foreign policy in substantive and procedural aspects. Silent on Policy Matters **********Mr. Shultz, who opened his statement by saying, ''My name is George Shultz; I'm from California,'' declined to discuss policy matters.  ''I have my confirmation hearings to think about and a lot of work to do,'' he said. ''So, these will be days of silence.'' He then went to a guest house for visiting former presidents and other dignitaries on Jackson Place, across the street from the White House. Mr. Shultz planned meetings in coming days with Mr. Haig and other officials. **********According to an aide, Mr. Haig, whose resignation stunned Washington, did not want to embarrass Mr. Reagan by going into detail on his differences with other Reagan aides, but might be willing to talk more freely after he has given up his post permanently. A White House official said the Administration wanted to avoid ''recriminations'' and look ''ahead and not back.'' Resignation Tendered Thursday **********Haig aides insisted that the Secretary had initiated the resignation and had not been asked to step down by the President.  They also said that even though Mr. Haig, who has a well-known temper, has often spoken of resignation to his colleagues, this was the first time that he had ever told Mr. Reagan that he wanted to quit. He did this on Thursday and Mr. Reagan informed him Friday that he had accepted it and that Mr. Shultz would replace him, White House officials said. **********Despite his implied criticism of Mr. Reagan, Mr. Haig was still acting as Secretary for the immediate future. He was in his seventhfloor suite at the State Department this morning engaged primarily in steps to resolve the Lebanese crisis, department officials said. On Friday, after his resignation was announced, Mr.  Haig said that he had assured Mr. Reagan that ''I will stay on in my post for as long as is necessary to insure an orderly transition for my successor.'' **********A spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said today that he did not expect confirmation hearings for Mr. Shultz to begin before the week of July 12, when the Senate returns from its Fourth of July recess. This means Mr. Shultz will probably not be able to assume office for nearly three weeks at least. Memos in the Works **********On Friday, shortly after Mr. Haig's resignation became known, senior officials in the State Department were told by L. Paul Bremer 3d, the executive secretary of the department, to prepare brief memos on key issues to bring Mr. Shultz up to date rapidly. Lengthier guidance papers will be prepared in coming days, officials said, to help Mr. Shultz get ready for his confirmation hearings. **********Senator Charles H. Percy, Republican of Illinois, who is an old acquaintance of Mr. Shultz, a Labor and Treasury Secretary in the Nixon Administration, has predicted rapid and easy confirmation by the Foreign Relations Committee, of which Mr. Percy is chairman, and the Senate. **********Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, said Friday that he will want to question Mr. Shultz closely on his Middle East views.  This is because the Bechtel Group, an engineering and construction company of which Mr. Shultz is president, has vast construction projects in Saudi Arabia and Mr. Shultz is said to believe that American policy has been negligent of legitimate Arab concerns. In 1980, for example, he said that if he had any differences with Mr.  Reagan, it was on Middle East policy. **********With the Lebanese crisis the most pressing question, it was uncertain how much of a direct role Mr. Shultz will play in formulating policy in the weeks before he is sworn in as the 60th Secretary of State. One State Department official said much will depend on Mr. Shultz's preferences when he meets with Mr. Haig on Sunday or Monday. Pressure on P.L.O. Is Aim **********The American goal at the moment is to bring pressure on the Palestine Liberation Organization forces in west Beirut to lay down their arms and to have the P.L.O. leadership leave Lebanon for another Arab country. The Israelis, at the urging of the United States, have undertaken another cease-fire in Lebanon, which was still holding this afternoon. **********At the United Nations Security Council early this morning the United States vetoed a French proposal calling for a limited pullback from Beirut of Israeli forces and those of the P.L.O. **********A statement issued by the State Department said the veto was ordered by the department because it did not include a provision for the disarming of the Palestinian forces in west Beirut. ''This was a fatal defect,'' the department said. **********Mr. Haig became convinced early in the week, officials said, that the only way to avoid an all-out Israeli invasion of west Beirut was to get the P.L.O. to put down its arms. To accomplish this, he felt it was necessary for Israel to maintain military pressure on Beirut, but to manage it in such a way that a major attack was avoided. Clark Move Resented **********Mr. Haig was reported to have been irritated when he learned that Mr. Clark, the national security adviser, had told the Saudi Arabian Ambassador that the United States would persuade Israel to loosen its control over Beirut. This word was conveyed to the P.L.O. by the Saudis and reportedly led to a more stubborn position being adopted by the Palestinians. **********Officials at the State Department said that this dispute with Mr.  Clark was a factor in Mr. Haig's decision to quit, but not the only one. They also cited his unhappiness with a recent hardening of the anti-Soviet policy, which led to stronger efforts to prevent allies from making American-licensed products for use in the planned natural gas pipeline from the Soviet Union to West Europe. **********Aides said they did not know what his Mr. Haig's plans are after leaving office. Mr. Haig was president of United Technologies in Hartford for a year before becoming Secretary of State. **********All senior officials have been asked by Mr. Haig to remain in office pending Mr. Shultz's takeover. It is assumed that Mr. Shultz will ask most to stay on for the next several months until he has a chance to become more familiar with the situation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/06/world/attrition-in-gulf-war-how-long-can-iraq-last-without-help-military-analysis.html": {"writer_name": "Drew Middleton", "pub_date": "1982-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 735, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Military Analysis", "print_headline": "ATTRITION IN GULF WAR: HOW LONG CAN IRAQ LAST WITHOUT HELP?; Military Analysis", "body_text": " **********Heavy fighting in the hills east of Baghdad, reported yesterday by intelligence sources, indicates that the Iranians, despite their failure to break through on Friday, are maintaining pressure along this sector of the front. **********United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization intelligence specialists said that Iran, in attacks around Sumar in the Mandali sector, did not pentrate deeply enough anywhere to spill out onto the plain east of Iraq's capital. **********The current fighting on this central front has been accompanied by a resumption of activity on the southern front, where Iranian forces are within striking distance of Basra. Iranian artillery shelled the city and the Iraqis have admitted to foreign military attaches in Baghdad that shelling did considerable damage Sunday night. **********Iraqis More Active in Air **********The Iraqi Air Force, the sources said, is playing a much more active role in the fighting than the Iranian Air Force is. Fighters and armed helicopters have attacked Iranian positions in the hills.  The Iraqi helicopters, a NATO source said, probably are French-built Gazelles armed with HOT, a tube-launched, wire-guided antitank missile. **********The Iranian Air Force has confined itself to attacks on oil installations far from the front.  The primary military issue raised by Iranian pressure along the frontiers of Iraq, the sources said, is how long Iraq can hold out against a country with approximately three times as many people. **********Although the Iranians have suffered very heavy casualties, especially in their headlong assaults on the Iraqi lines outside Basra last July, they have been able to fill the ranks with relatively untrained soldiers of the Revolutionary Guard whose lack of military skills is balanced by their fanatic valor. One British estimate is that the Iranians have lost at least 25,000 dead since the start of the war in September 1980. The Iraqis, on the other hand, have not risked troops needlessly since the war began. Possible Iranian Plan **********Some believe that the stress laid on conserving manpower was the reason the original Iraqi invasion of the Iranian oil province of Khuzistan foundered in early 1981. **********Since the Iranian attack opened in the hills, the Iraqis have launched several counterattacks. While these appear to have checked further Iranian advances, they inevitably cost lives. **********Intelligence sources analyzing the conflict say Iran may have decided to fight a war of attrition along Iraq's borders to wear down the Iraqi Army, which is the mainstay of President Saddam Hussein's Government. **********If this is to be avoided, these sources said, Iraq must obtain trained infantry and artillery units from outside soon. The Sudan has promised military aid but has not defined the form it will take. **********Intervention by Jordan, which is closer to the battlefield, could be more effective. The Jordanian Army is small, 65,000 compared with Iraq's 300,000, but Israeli intelligence regards it as the best trained Arab army in the region. Jordan: Best and Only **********An Israeli source said he believed that President Hussein would press King Hussein of Jordan, now in Baghdad, to send troops to reinforce the Iraqis in the front line. The King has been the most vocal supporter of Iraq in the Arab world and has repeatedly urged other countries to honor their agreement to defend all Arab countries against aggression and to send troops and supplies. **********Jordan, intelligence sources noted, has sent thousands of volunteers to fight in the Iraqi forces. But the consensus of experts on the war is that Iraq now needs fresh, intact formations. **********''Jordan is not only the best source of trained reinforcements readily available,'' a British source said. ''It is the only one. The Syrians are up to their necks in Lebanon and the Kuwaitis, Saudi Arabians and the small gulf states have nothing to offer now but money. Money won't help the Iraqis if the Iranians continue the pressure.'' **********Some senior American officers believe that despite European pessimism about Iraq's position, that country's air force could force Iran to reconsider a strategy of attrition. Their view is that repeated, successful attacks on Iranian oil export positions such as Kharq Island in the Persian Gulf would so damange Iran's economy that it would be willing to withdraw."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/23/business/core-laboratories-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 78, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CORE LABORATORIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "CORE LABORATORIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/07/world/rebels-said-to-kidnap-over-140-in-salvador.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 220, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rebels Said to Kidnap Over 140 in Salvador", "print_headline": "Rebels Said to Kidnap Over 140 in Salvador", "body_text": " **********Leftist rebels kidnapped two soccer teams and about 120 spectators from a rural stadium, forcing them to march through the night to a mountain guerrilla camp, witnesses said today. **********Carmen de Soriano, a municipal worker in the eastern town of San Sebastian, said in a telephone interview that about 150 rebels dressed in olive green uniforms killed several of the spectators who tried to escape from the stadium Sunday. **********She said relatives reported the members of two soccer teams, each with 11 men, and 120 other spectators were taken away by the guerrillas.

Volume Thins **********Trading on the New York Stock Exchange settled back yesterday to 74.4 million shares - considered a heavy turnover under normal circumstances - after exceeding 100 million shares in each of the four previous sessions. Thursday's volume reached a single-day record of 137.3 million shares. **********Trading totaled a weekly record of 549.9 million shares, easily shattering the previous week's mark of 455.1 million shares. The twoweek total of slightly more than a billion shares exceeded the turnover for all of 1960, when trading amounted to 766.7 million shares. **********In the past two weeks, the market value of the nation's 5,000 leading common stocks has climbed by $136.9 billion, according to Wilshire Associates, a financial services firm in Santa Monica, Calif. Manville Falls 2 3/4 **********One depressant on the Dow industrials yesterday was the Manville Corporation, which plunged 2 3/4 points, to 5 1/8, as the second most active issue. On Thursday, Manville announced that it had filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy laws.  Manville's stock did not trade Thursday. **********Yesterday, Dow Jones & Company said that the American Express Company will be substituted for Manville in the list of 30 stocks comprising the industrial average. The change takes effect at the start of trading Monday. American Express dipped 1/8 yesterday, to 44 7/8. **********Cities Service, again the volume leader after its merger proposal from Occidental Petroleum, rose 3/4, to 47 1/4.  Building-related issues were the market's weakest sector. Jim Walter fell 3 1/4, to 21 1/4, while Owens-Corning dropped 2 1/8, to 19 3/4. Certain-teed declined 1 1/8, to 12 3/4. Analysts noted that housing activity remains quite weak. **********Over all, declining issues on the Big Board outnumbered advances by nearly 2 to 1, reversing the market's strong breadth in recent sessions. **********Analysts have said repeatedly this week that a great deal of institutional money still remains on the sidelines for possible investment in the stock market. **********Mr. Wright, for example, said that his investment advisory firm was now maintaining about 35 percent of equity-portfolio funds - ''or close to $300 million'' - in cash reserves. ''We expect to be fully invested by the end of this year,'' he said. **********In over-the-counter trading, the Hospital Trust Corporation fell 1 1/2, to 23, bid. The bank holding company, based in Providence, R.I., said it had about $22.2 million in loans outstanding to private parties in Mexico that were not guaranteed by United States entities. **********The Nasdaq composite index declined 0.57, to 177.60. The American Stock Exchange's composite index fell 0.96, to 275.41.  On the Big Board, the Mexico Fund declined 3/8, to 2 3/4. This closed-end investment company, formed to invest the bulk of its assets in Mexican securities, was sold in June 1981 at $12 a share by underwriters led by Merrill Lynch. Mexico is now in the throes of a financial crisis brought on by soaring inflation rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/24/business/rsi-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-feb-28.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RSI CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 28", "print_headline": "RSI CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 28", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/20/business/refinery-shutdown.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Refinery Shutdown", "print_headline": "Refinery Shutdown", "body_text": " **********Texaco Inc. announced today that Chevron Erdoel Deutschland G.m.b.H., a subsidiary of Standard Oil of California, and Deutsche Texaco A.G., a subsidiary of Texaco, would close the crude oil refining activities of their jointly owned Caltex Deutschland G.m.b.H. by the end of September.

Most of them are struggling to survive in a grim refugee camp near here. **********Officials from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are trying to resettle them on inhabited, fertile land near here. Officials believe that the relocation, in addition to fostering self-suffiency, would reduce the epidemics arising in the squalid conditions at Mocoron. Some Resist Relocation Plans **********The relocation plans have been resisted by some of the Indian leaders, including Steadman Fagoth Muller, who has toured the United States to make a case against the Nicaraguan Government's treatment of the Indians. **********The relief workers believe that he and others who share his view are opposed on the ground that it will be easier to keep world attention on the Miskito issue if they are kept in a group. **********''Their presence is an embarrasment to the Nicaraguans,'' a relief worker said.  American officials focused attention on the issue last winter by charging that the Nicaraguans were engaging in genocide against the Indians. **********Under the regime of Anastasio Somoza Debayle, the Indians were left alone. After his overthrow in 1979, the new Sandinist Government in Nicaragua decided to end their isolation. **********According to Sifrit Williams, a 52-year-old leader of Miskito refugees who wants to overthrow the Sandinists, the Miskitos generally perferred the Somoza Government because it did not intrude in their lives. Sandinists Press Literacy Drive **********Mr. Williams said the Sandinists have, as part of a nationwide literacy campaign, sent in Cubans, whom the Miskitos mistrusted, to teach Spanish to the Indians, whose second language was often English, a language they learned from missionaries or inherited from English-speaking Caribbean peoples who settled along their coast. **********The Sandinists, Mr. Williams said, also tried to persuade the Indians to form cooperatives. Indians, who engaged in communal farming were nevertheless not amenable to having socialism forced on them, he said. **********''The socialist system goes against their grain,'' said Brian Adam, a soft-spoken, 27-year-old volunteer for World Relief, an evangelical orgnization. He is the only one of some 50 relief workers here who speaks Miskito, which he learned as a child. **********He learned it during the first 12 years of his life when he lived with his Moravian missionary parents among the Indians in Nicargua and Honduras. From his parents and other missionaries, Mr. Adam said, the Miskitos acquired ''pro-Western, pro-American'' values. **********In accusing the Sandinists of human rights abuses, Reagan Administration officials have relied in part on Miskitos' accounts of an incident on Dec. 23 last year. On that day, according to some refugee leaders, Sandinist soldiers massacred about 100 Miskitos, including women and children, in the Nicaraguan border town of Leimus. **********But international relief workers here, including Peace Corps volunteers, say that the attack may have been provoked when a force of some 200 armed Miskito men left the Mocoron refugee to take part in a raid on Leimus. A battle ensued, according to the relief workers, ''not more than 70,'' were killed. **********Whatever happened at Leimus, it has been followed by increased military activity in the areas of Nicaragua populated by Indians. The Sandinists have concentrated much of their military buildup in the area. **********Once in Honduras, some relief workers suggest, it is easy for the Miskitos to be used by leaders who want to topple the Sandinist Government. One of the most outspoken of those is Mr. Fagoth. **********''God has shown him his path,'' said Mr. Williams as he sat on the shaky patio of La Perla, a run-down waterfront bar in Puerto Lempira. Sitting in this same bar in June, Mr. Fagoth miraculously escaped death when someone threw a grenade and opened up with automatic rifle fire. Food Diverted to Guerrillas **********Mr. Fagoth and Mr. Williams have allied themselves with the ''Somocistas,'' as former soldiers of General Somoza's National Guard are called. **********Asked if young Miskito men had joined the ''Somocistas,'' Mr.  Williams, whose wrinkled, leather-skinned face had remained expressionless as he talked about the Sandinists, answered flatly, ''not that I am aware.'' **********But then a grin broke between his sunken jaws, and his bony fingers tried to stifle a laugh.  According to the relief workers, food and supplies intended for the refugees are often diverted to the Somocista guerrilla camps, which, they said, operated from bases at Rus Rus, Srumlaya and Cabo de Gracias a Dios. In one instance, they said, all but a very small amount of a large shipment of food, clothing and medicines donated by the fire department in Houston, Tex., for the Mocoron refugees ended up in the possession of the counterrevolutionaries, as the anti-Sandinist forces are frequently called, after being unloaded at Puerto Lempira. **********According to the relief workers, Honduran army officers are providing arms and training for the counterrevolutionaries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/24/business/personal-finance-does-it-pay-to-renegotiate-a-mortgage.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1982-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1239, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DOES IT PAY TO RENEGOTIATE A MORTGAGE?", "print_headline": "PERSONAL FINANCE; DOES IT PAY TO RENEGOTIATE A MORTGAGE?", "body_text": " **********MORTGAGE rates have fallen and many homeowners who had the m isfortune to buy at peak rates are now beset with a bit of envy. Theq uestion is whether there is anything they can do to get the cheaper r ates, and the answer is yes. Mortgages - even second mortgages and m ortgages on investment and business properties - can be r enegotiated, and such a move might pay if rates have fallen far e nough. **********Many mortgage lenders report an increasing number of inquiries about renegotiating. But trading in a mortgage is not an easy task and it may not be profitable in all instances. The cost of renegotiation - paying closing costs and bank fees all over again - can be several thousand dollars and there are so many variables, including the many different kinds of mortgages involved, that the decision becomes an individual judgment. **********Fixed-rate loans have fallen in a year from 17 1/2 percent and higher to as low as 13 3/4 percent, with most of the decline taking place in recent weeks. The falling-interest-rate environment is as new to the banks as to mortgage holders. ''I've been in the business 34 years,'' said Herbert A. Schneider, executive vice president of the Columbia Savings Bank in New York, ''and 20 years ago there was a slight dip, from 6 to 5 1/2 percent.'' Otherwise, it's been uphill for rates. **********''The key word now,'' said Norman Kailo, sales manager of the Soldoveri Agency in Totowa and Wayne, N.J., and a past president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors, ''is that anyone who bought in the last two years or so should dig out their mortgage instrument, check it over and do some shopping. You can go back to the realtor who sold you the house and ask for advice.'' **********James W. Christian, chief economist for the United States League of Savings Associations, concurred. ''Sure consumers ought to be thinking about it,'' he said. ''But they need to put a sharp pencil to it and figure out whether it's really worth their while.'' **********James Panepinto, vice president in charge of the Chase Manhattan Bank's New York State residential mortgage lending, said the bank was getting a considerable number of inquiries on renegotiating, ''but every case is a little different'' and the number of people involved was a small element of the market. From the customer's point of view, he said, ''there's a break-even analysis to do - it costs x amount to do the refinancing to gain a reduction in monthly payments.'' **********Mr. Kailo believes that money can be saved, depending on the size of the mortgage, on as little as a 2 percentage point spread between a current high-fixed-rate mortgage and what is available now. **********If, for example, Mr. Kailo said, someone has a 16 percent fixedrate $50,000 mortgage for 30 years, the principal and interest portion would come to $672.50 a month. If that mortgage could be traded in for one of 14 percent, the comparable payment would be $592.50 a month, a saving of $80 a month. MR. KAILO estimated that closing costs and points charged by the b ank in renegotiation might add up to $1,600 to $2,000, which is muchl ess than on the original closing, he said. ''In most cases you don'tn eed a full title search, just an update,'' he said. ''You generally d on't need a new survey or another title insurance policy. There's non eed to put down any new escrow fees. **********''Normally if you tell your bank you're going to another,'' he added, ''they're going to lose your loan anyway so they might decide to recast it for you themselves. This could lower your costs even more. You probably would not have to take out a new application fee, which is generally $125 to $250.'' **********Mr. Kailo's examples suppose that the bank is charging two points as its origination fee for the recast mortgage. A point is 1 percent of the $50,000 mortgage in the example and two points equals $1,000.  His example also supposes that there are no prepayment clauses imposed by state statute; there are none in New Jersey and none in New York after the first year of the mortgage. **********But many states have such penalties and Federally chartered thrift institutions have the option of imposing penalties - these would have to be figured into the new closing costs. **********The average life of a mortgage in a metroplitan area ranges from six to nine years, Mr. Kailo said. ''If somebody transferred jobs quite often, it sure as heck wouldn't pay to renogotiate unless there was a 3 or 4 percent difference.'' **********Joseph J. Holzka, a lawyer with Holzka, Donahue, Kuhn & Howard, which represents some banks, suggested that if rates continue to drop, people with mortgages of, say, 17 1/2 percent might get a compromise if they asked their banks to match the cheapest rate available, say 14 percent. ''The bank might say, 'we won't drop you to that, but how's 15 1/2 or 16 percent' - numbers that reflect diminished closing costs in dealing with the same lender,'' he said. **********Inertia, though, would probably keep many homeowners from approaching the task of renegotiating even if it might mean savings, he added. **********How do the banks view these renegotiations? ''Naturally we're going through this now,'' said Mr. Schneider of Columbia Savings. Say interest rates are 14 percent, he said, and someone with a higherrate mortgage comes in to negotiate. ''We would give him a 14 percent rate, provided he would pay three or four origination points. We're not going to do it and just reduce the mortgage rate.'' **********He said he felt it would not be worthwhile to negotiate for a two percentage point difference. ''When you start getting 4 percent and if rates continue the way they are then I can see that some consideration should be given,'' he said. **********If a person decides to switch banks he would face new charges.  There would be, for example, a bank attorney fee of perhaps $200, an appraisal fee of about $125, a recording fee of $15 and a credit investigation charge of $25, he said. But if the new bank accepted documents by assignment, he said, the customer would not have to pay his mortgage tax again. ''If you have to pay that, forget it,'' he said. In New York City the levy on a $50,000 mortgage would be $600 and in Nassau County $350. **********As for second mortgages, Mr. Kailo, the New Jersey realtor, said that some people had taken out secondary financing at 20 percent or more. Now such financing is available at 16 percent in some cases, and there are no points or closing costs involved in renegotiating.  Businesses should also consider renegotiating mortgages, he said, to cut monthly payments and increase cash flow. **********Generally, then, it is up to homeowners to look into what is available if rates continue to fall. ''I'm a believer in window shopping, instead of just going to the bank you're dealing with.'' said Connie S.P. Chen, president of the Chen Planning Group in New York, a financial planner.

SETS CLOSING OF 4 PARTS PLANTS", "body_text": " **********The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would permanently close four automobile parts plants in the next two years. It said it can obtain the parts less expensively elsewhere. **********The move, which will put 9,620 employees on indefinite layoff, brings to seven the number of plant closings announced by General Motors since the company's contract negotiations with the United Automobile Workers collapsed at the end of January. **********However, Alfred Warren, General Motors' vice president for industrial relations and the company's chief negotiator in last month's U.A.W. talks, told a reporter in Detroit that the company might be willing to negotiate keeping open some - but not all - of the four parts plants, if the union comes back to the bargaining table before its contract with G.M. expires in September. **********He added that General Motors might decide to close an assembly plant if auto sales don't improve soon. They have been in a slump for more than two years. Plant in Trenton Included **********The four parts plants, which are part of General Motors' Fisher Body division, include one in Trenton with 3,615 employees; the Detroit Fort Street plant with 2,900 employees; the Cleveland Coit Road plant with 2,810 employees, and Plant No.37 in Detroit with 256 employees. More than a third of the employees at these plants have already been laid off. **********Jim Sponseller, a spokesman for the Fisher Body division, said that the plan to close the plants followed ''a broad-based review of our long-term competitive position.'' He added that auto parts ''are not competitive in the production of many automotive components at this time.'' **********General Motors, he said, had found in a recent study that the plants had a labor disadvantage of about $10 an hour compared with other independent suppliers. Mr. Sponseller said the company would seek parts from suppliers in the United States and Canada. **********Earlier this month, General Motors announced that it would close assembly plants in Fremont and South Gate, Calif., and a trim plant in Euclid, Ohio. Closing Pattern Called Confusing **********''It's kind of confusing because the closings are coming in piecemeal,'' said Arvid Jouppi, a Detroit-based auto analyst with the Colin, Hochstin Company. ''It seems that if they had a general strategy they would announce all the closings at the same time.'' **********Roger B. Smith, the chairman of General Motors, has said since the contract negotiations broke down in January that he would resume talks after the U.A.W. ratified a contract with the Ford Motor Company. General Motors officials have argued that more jobs will disappear at the company if the union fails to go along with its demand for wage and benefit concessions. **********Ford and the auto workers union have reached an agreement, still to be ratified by the union membership, that ties wage and benefit concessions to greater job security. Before the General Motors talks broke down, company officials and union leaders had agreed in principle to link worker concessions to reductions in auto prices. 'Difficult Decisions' **********''These are always difficult decisions for us because we have been located in these facilities for a long time,'' Charles Katko, general manager of Fisher Body and a vice president of General Motors, said in a prepared statement. ''However, we have been unable to operate these plants at costs which are competitive with those of other domestic suppliers.'' **********A total of 249,701 employees have been laid off indefinitely throughout the auto industry, many of them in recent weeks and months as the industry struggles through a prolonged slump in auto sales.  During the 1974-75 recession, these layoffs reached 360,000. Those employees on indefinite layoff are not told that there is a possibiliy of returning to work, whereas those on temporary layoff expect to be recalled. **********General Motors reported 143,000 indefinite layoffs, and the company has temporarily idled an additional 25,150 workers. Ford has laid off 54,261 people, with 12,925 on temporary layoff. The Chrysler Corporation has idled 45,000 employees, with 1,600 on temporary layoff, and the American Motors Corporation has 6,100 auto workers on indefinite layoff and 7,500 on temporary layoff. **********Domestic auto production plunged 30.1 percent this week, to 91,343, from 130,712 in the comparable period of 1981, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication. Ward's added that production for this week was down 12.5 percent from the week before."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/11/world/around-the-world-iran-agrees-to-supply-natural-gas-to-turkey.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iran Agrees to Supply Natural Gas to Turkey", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Iran Agrees to Supply Natural Gas to Turkey", "body_text": " **********Iran has agreed to supply natural gas to Turkey through a pipeline to be built between the neighboring countries, the Foreign Ministry said today. **********It said agreement on the pipeline was reached in last week's visit to Teheran by a Turkish delegation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/12/business/fpa-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FPA CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "FPA CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/30/world/account-of-american-s-death-in-el-salvador-is-put-in-doubt.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Meislin", "pub_date": "1982-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 527, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ACCOUNT OF AMERICAN'S DEATH IN EL SALVADOR IS PUT IN DOUBT", "print_headline": "ACCOUNT OF AMERICAN'S DEATH IN EL SALVADOR IS PUT IN DOUBT", "body_text": " **********An autopsy on a young American who was killed by Salvadoran soldiers last month cast doubt today on military claims that he was shot while trying to escape. **********According to people familiar with the autopsy, the American, Michael Kline, had been shot three times in the back and head and had received a fourth wound, which left powder burns. This would indicate that the fourth bullet had been fired from a much closer range than had the other three. **********Mr. Kline, 21 years old, was killed on Oct. 13 after Salvadoran soldiers removed him for questioning from a bus in Morazan Province.  What he was doing in the area, which has seen heavy fighting recently, is a mystery, as are many other details of the case. **********The Salvadoran military had used the bullet wounds in the man's back to support its more recent version of the incident - that Mr.  Kline had been shot from a distance of about 30 feet while trying to escape from soldiers who had removed him from the bus as ''suspicious looking.'' 'Long Hair, Dirty Clothes' **********He had ''long hair, dirty clothes and rubber sandals,'' the soldiers who seized him reported. They said he spoke and understood little if any Spanish, and his only identification was his signature on $500 in traveler's checks. **********According to the soldiers, the shooting took place about 4 miles from the checkpoint where Mr. Kline was originally seized, while he was being transported to the military headquarters at San Francisco Gotera in a private pickup truck that the soldiers had commandeered. **********The account was given to United States officials by Sgt. Jose Desposorio Lopez Garcia, one of the soldiers involved in the incident. **********The military's initial report, delivered Oct. 15 by a spokesman for the armed forces press committee, was that Mr. Kline was a 32-yearold ''gringo mercenary'' who was shot by soldiers after seizing a gun from one of them. His identification as a mercenary was based on his carrying of ''medicines,'' including Alka Seltzer, and machine oil. The account was later modified to say that he tried but failed to grab one of the weapons. **********Neither account would explain the appearance of the powder burn, however, and an embassy official here said the three Salvadoran soldiers involved in the incident would be interviewed again in an effort to resolve the discrepancy. **********The official said the embassy had ''just received the report'' of the autopsy, which it had requested, and was ''analyzing it to draw our own conclusions.'' 'At Least One Powder Burn' **********The embassy official confirmed, however, that ''there is at least one powder burn'' on the body but declined to specify where it was.  According to the official, Mr. Kline had arrived in the country on Oct. 11, having recently spent time in both Mexico and Guatemala. The purpose of his trip, the official said, ''is just a big mystery - his mother said he had an interest in journalism, but there is no evidence he ever pursued it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/24/world/around-the-world-israeli-official-given-suspended-jail-terms.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Israeli Official Given Suspended Jail Terms", "print_headline": "Around the World; Israeli Official Given Suspended Jail Terms", "body_text": " **********A judge sentenced a member of Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Cabinet today to suspended prison sentences totaling 51 months and fined him $175 for larceny. **********The official, Aharon Abuhazira, the Minister of Labor, Welfare and Immigrants Absorption, said he intended to resign his post while appealing his conviction to the Israeli Supreme Court. **********Mr. Abuhazira was sentenced to one jail term for paying the family grocer and depositing money in an election fund with checks drawn on a charity fund he had headed in 1975.

Little news was forthcoming again today from the battlefield, but the assault will occur as soon as weather conditions improve and needed supplies and troops are positioned, probably within the next day or two, according to correspondents on the scene and military sources here. **********''British troops are knocking on the door of Port Stanley,'' said a pooled dispatch received today from the Falklands. **********Setback for Moderates Sighted **********The plans for future development, which have been discussed with increasing frequency in recent days, appear to represent a blow to moderate British officials, including Foreign Secretary Francis Pym, and to the United States, which had hoped that an accommodation could be reached with Argentina once military hostilities ended. **********But the tough line of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher - that the islands are not being retaken merely to be handed over to Argentina - is now clearly in ascendancy, and planning has begun for permanent military defenses, for economic development, for encouraging new settlers and perhaps even for eventual independence. **********''I cannot, myself, see a role in anything relating to sovereignty for the Argentines on the Falkland Islands,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in a television interview Wednesday. The islanders ''never wanted to go to Argentina before,'' she said. ''They'll be even less likely to do so now.'' 'We Must Be Loyal to Them' **********Mrs. Thatcher, speaking of the islanders, said that ''they've been loyal to us, we must be loyal to them.'' Legally, the 1,800 islanders are British citizens, although 300 do not have the automatic right to live in Britain because neither they nor a parent or a grandparent was born here. **********On Tuesday, Mrs. Thatcher asked Lord Shackleton, son of the explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton and author of a 1976 report on the future of the islands, to bring his recommendations up to date. **********''Things are a little bit different,'' Mrs. Thatcher said, ''but I want to be ready to go ahead as soon as we are able to.'' In her planning, Mrs. Thatcher is said to be hoping to involve other countries, particularly the United States and particularly to help maintain the islands' security. **********That is among the subjects Mrs. Thatcher plans to raise with President Reagan at their various meetings in France and Britain this weekend and early next week. An Expensive Proposition **********Maintaining British sovereignty is likely to be an expensive proposition. Even before the current difficulties, the islands had been costing Britain about $9 million a year. About 80 percent of that went to pay for the ice patrol ship Endurance and the small garrison of 40 marines. The remaining $1.8 million was provided by Britain's Overseas Development Administration for a variety of projects like road building and public services. **********''We do need things like development that we just don't have the funds for,'' said Alastair Cameron, an official at the Falkland Islands Office, which represents the islanders' interests in Britain. ''We need a broader based economy.'' **********The cost is likely to be high. For one thing, a far larger military garrison is being contemplated, although little discussion of its precise size has taken place. For another, damage done in the fighting will have to be repaired. **********The loss of the economic ties to Argentina will also prove expensive to the islands. In recent years, the only regular air service was provided by the Argentine state airline from Comodoro Rivadavia. A variety of supplies, including oil and gas, also came from Argentina, which is 250 miles away. **********Mrs. Thatcher said Wednesday that the small airstrip at Stanley would have to be extended to handle long-haul planes. That would cost $21.6 million, according to estimates by the Overseas Development Administration. Viable Economy Is Goal **********Perhaps most importantly, Mrs. Thatcher and her aides have been talking about providing the islands with a viable economy. In recent years the limited business opportunities have resulted in a slow population decline - a loss of 200 residents in the last four years alone. **********One issue in forming development plans will be the fact that the islands are virtually run economically by the 131-year-old Falkland Islands Company, a miniature version of the great trading companies like the East India Company. **********The Falkland Islands Company owns nearly half the land on the two main islands, employs about a third of the workers, provides the main banking service, manages the external sea-freight service, dominates retail distribution on the islands and controls the only significant product - about 2,250 tons a year of wool. **********Among the complaints of the islanders is that the company, a subsidiary of the Coalite Group of Britain, is run from London and brings its profits back to Britain as dividends rather than using them for further development of the islands. The only British taxes paid by the islands or their inhabitants are on the dividends sent to Britain. Possibilities and Problems **********But how much industry can be profitably developed is questionable.  Export of mutton would probably not be viable because the sheep on the Falklands are bred for their wool and are not suitable for use as meat. Oil and gas has been widely discussed, but no commercial reserves have been discovered. **********Another proposal has been tourism and the Overseas Development Administration has made money available for promotion, but no one has applied for it. ''The Falklands are a long way from anywhere,'' a development administration official said. **********According to the 1980 census, the islands' population of about 1,800 included only 890 wage earners. And whether development can proceed as long as relations with Argentina are hostile also remains in doubt. **********For his part, Lord Shackleton, whose earlier report complained about the flow of money out of the islands and to Britain, professed confidence about the islands' prospects, although he acknowledged that time would be needed. Among the possibilities raised were fishing and alginate, a product of seaweed, which is plentiful. **********''You can see immense possibilities,'' he said, ''if you look over a very long time scale.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/15/business/rubbermaid-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RUBBERMAID INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "RUBBERMAID INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/02/world/the-un-today-nov-2-1982-general-assembly.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

A Moscow street is named for him, and his name is borne by countless chapters of the Young Pioneers, the Communist children's organization. **********Stalin's Informers Recalled **********But as an informer, Pavlik was also a pioneer of a practice that became the mainstay of Stalin's terror, sending millions to forcedlabor camps or to their death for real or imagined crimes against the state. One memoir of the time describes a woman who had denounced so many neighbors that she suffered a paralyzing stroke when she learned that labor camp inmates were being rehabilitated after Stalin's death in 1953 and would be coming home. **********Denunciations may no longer pack the wallop they did in Stalin's day. But habits and memories die hard, and the legacy of Pavlik Morozov survives in the distrust Soviet citizens often still demonstrate for strangers, in the whispered hints that an acquaintance may be a ''stukach,'' an informer. **********The 50th anniversary of the 1932 killing of Pavlik demonstrated no diminution of his legend, including a tribute by one reporter who wrote that his heart contracted with painful emotion as he entered Gerasimovka and read the sign, ''Home of Pavlik Morozov.'' Line Is Difficult to Draw **********It is difficult to draw the line between official surveillance and unsolicited informing in a society as controlled and secretive as that of the Soviet Union. Each research institute, factory or government office is presumed to have its resident watchdogs. **********There are also innumerable free-lancers - the pensioners who report what they view as suspicious doings in their housing projects, the would-be emigre who is promised an early visa if he cooperates with the authorities, the jealous worker who denounces a better-paid colleague in an anonymous letter. **********The endemic distrust often serves in itself as a curb on activities that may be deemed suspicious by the authorities. A prominent Soviet poet, recounting one of his many trips abroad, fell silent or changed the subject each time his maid walked through the room. At a small gathering of intellectuals, all friends, a foreign reporter is quietly steered aside by a man with information to impart. **********A dissident writer who works at home said he had been summoned several times to the local police station to explain how he made a living. It turned out that someone had denounced him as a ''parasite,'' meaning a person seemingly living without earned income. Some Official Irritation Shown **********The scope of such practices may be gauged by the fact that the authorities have been showing sporadic irritation in the press, at least over anonymous denunciations, popularly known as ''anonimki,'' that are deemed unfounded. **********At the last party congress, in February 1981, Leonid I. Brezhnev said the party's view of such denunciations was well known. ''They have no place in our life!'' he said. **********These words, the official record states, ''drew prolonged applause.'' They also prompted yet another spate of criticism in the press against officials who pay heed to anonymous informants and against the leniency shown slanderers when they are brought to light. **********In one such report, the daily newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya told the story of a graduate student whose doctoral dissertation - on the critical subject of ''intensifying livestock production in semi-arid areas'' - had been pigeonholed for years by false denunciations that generated successive inquiries. **********''Whatever the anonimshchik churned out was taken on faith, while his victim was told: Prove this is not so if you can,'' the newspaper said. 'Honorable' Informing Approved **********But even while assailing the authorities for acting on anonymous information, the reporter reminded his readers that ''constructive criticism'' - even from an ''honorable anomimshchik'' - had a vital role in Soviet society. **********The weekly newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta recently described an informer who was said to have falsely besmirched an investigative reporter in more than 50 letters. When finally imprisoned, the weekly said, the man could not understand why it was wrong to pass on rumors and insinuations. **********''He still believed, he was absolutely certain, that he had done nothing illegal, improper or punishable,'' the newspaper wrote. In jail, he told the paper's reporter, ''I simply wanted to bring these things to the attention of the agencies of control.'' **********In fact, people brought up on the Pavlik Morozov legend may be justified in questioning the prosecution of a man for sending what is euphemistically called a ''signal'' to the authorities. Time of Kulaks' Persecution **********The deed for which Pavlik was murdered - and immortalized - was to turn in his father for aiding fugitive kulaks, the landowning peasants who were being expropriated and persecuted by Stalin during the farm collectivization drive of the late 1920's and early 1930's.  Generations of young people have since then been raised on the image of the tall Urals village youth standing under a portrait of Lenin in the courthouse and proclaiming, ''I accuse my father not as his son, but as a Pioneer.'' **********Soon after, Pavlik's grandfather and cousin killed the boy and his 9-year-old brother with knives fashioned from scythes, a deed for which they were executed by a firing squad. **********According to another recent report in Sovetskaya Rossiya, children still do write in about their parents. But the paper's attitude toward the letters suggested a waning, or at least a new interpretation, of the Pavlik legend. **********Informers' scribblings on sheets of school notebooks, the paper said, leave one feeling somewhat uneasy. Behavior Now Called Unnatural **********''There is something fundamentally unnatural,'' the paper said, ''in having a child, an adolescent, a youth assailing the holy of holies - respect and love for father and mother.''

They say this could eventually erode Israel's superiority. **********An immediate problem for Israel, the informants say, is Libya's shipments of weapons to Palestinian guerrillas still in Lebanon.  Israeli estimates are that there still are 10,000 to 12,000 guerrillas. **********But the Israelis also cite a long-term problem - what they see as an Arab military potential. They say they fear that the stream of weapons and support equipment, American, Soviet, British and French, into the Arab countries could in time give their Arab neighbors a qualitative strength approaching Israel's present superiority. **********Speaking of immediate concerns, one Israeli informant said that field guns and antitank and antiaircraft weapons were being airlifted from Libya into northern Lebanon. The weapons are drawn from stocks that were sent to Libya by the Soviet Union and, according to Western analysts, were beyond Libya's ability to absorb. 2,000 Guerrillas in Beirut **********The informant said that 2,000 Palestinian guerrillas remained underground in Beirut, that 6,000 were with the Syrian Army in the Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon and that 2,000 to 4,000 were around Tripoli in the north. Most of the arms being flown into Lebanon, Israeli sources said, probably will go first to the guerrillas with the Syrians and then to the forces around Tripoli. **********At the moment, the Israelis say, they do not see the Syrians as an immediate danger. Syrian forces along the Lebanese frontier, they say, have pulled back slightly and show no signs of aggressive action. **********The Israelis are worried, however, by the pace of Soviet arms shipments to Syria. Some say that Syrian losses in tanks, which were relatively light, already have been made up, and they say there is a steady flow of SAM-8 and SAM-9 surface-to-air missiles into Syria. **********The Syrians were imprudent enough to deploy the first of these in the Bekaa Valley, where they were promptly destroyed by Israeli planes. Since then the missiles have replaced the SAM-6's guarding the approaches to Damascus. Later Reports More Sober **********Later reports by Israeli veterans of the summer's military campaign are a good deal more sober than the estimates made in the moment of victory. **********For example, they point out that the Syrian armor and infantry fought effectively in defense, clinging to their positions under heavy air and artillery attack. Two weaknesses, however, were said to have developed. **********The Israelis said that Syrian coordination of the artillery with armor and infantry was slipshod and that the Syrians were not impressive when they operated outside fixed positions. **********A long-term Israeli view is that, given time to obtain new supplies, and with more training, the Syrian Army and Air Force can re-emerge as Israel's most dangerous potential foes. **********An independent study group sponsored by Israeli universities reported in a recent paper that, from 1973 until the present, Arab arms purchases were as follows: Syria, $9.2 billion; Iraq, $8.35 billion; Saudi Arabia, $13 billion, and Libya, $9.4 billion. Egypt, which Israeli intelligence classifies as at least a potential enemy, received $3.51 billion in arms. Outstanding Orders Listed **********The known outstanding orders, the report said, are: Iraq, $6 billion; Saudi Arabia, $17.92 billion; Libya, $450 million, and Egypt, $2.66 billion. Jordan, whose army and air force are rated highly by the Israelis, has received $980 million in arms supplies to date but is said to have outstanding orders for $2.38 billion in arms. **********The Arab armies and air forces, an Israeli intelligence source said, ''are going through a cycle of complete rearmament in the most advanced weapons.'' He said that the Syrians had almost completed the cycle and that the others were ''moving rapidly toward completion.'' He said also that the armed forces in each of the countries were being trained in the maintenance of their weapons as well as in their use and in the command and control systems to be employed in battle. Arab Strength Is Projected **********On the basis of the arms sales, the independent study concluded, by 1986 five Arab countries - Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Libya - will be able to deploy 12,300 tanks, 11,100 armored personnel carriers, 8,050 artillery pieces, 230 surface-to-surface missile launchers, 2,370 combat planes, 1,045 helicopters, 520 surface-to-air missile batteries and 101 combat ships. **********Israelis, however, note that there are weaknesses in the Arab military structure. One is the failure of Arab high commands to work together in war against Israel. A second is the rivalries in peace among them. **********Jordan and Syria are mutually hostile, the Israelis point out.  Iraq's military substance is being eroded by the war with Iran.  Egypt, potentially the most powerful Arab country, is still ostracized because of its peace treaty with Israel. **********A final weakness, Israelis say, is a lack of initiative shown by unit commanders in battle, a weakness that is common to all the Arab armies save that of Jordan. This is said to be a legacy from the years of Soviet military tutelage."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/12/world/mexican-wrath-falls-on-teen-age-seer-and-sect.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1982-11-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1058, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MEXICAN WRATH FALLS ON TEEN-AGE SEER AND SECT", "print_headline": "MEXICAN WRATH FALLS ON TEEN-AGE SEER AND SECT", "body_text": " **********All over Mexico there are shrines to the Virgin Mary and myriad saints that are visited by thousands - in some cases millions - of pilgrims each year. The visitors ask for miracles, give thanks for favors granted or merely seek forgiveness and protection. **********But New Jerusalem, site of a reported apparition of the Virgin Mary in October 1973, has suddenly become famous throughout the country, not because of its miracles but because Mexican news organizations have chosen to denounce those in charge of the shrine as charlatans, asserting they use violence, sex and extortion to promote their faith. **********The particular targets of the attacks are 72-year-old Nabor Cardenas, an unfrocked priest who is referred to as Papa Nabor, and 16-year-old Arcadia Garcia, who claims to receive messages from the Virgin Mary and is known here as Mama Maria de Jesus. Between them, they control the lives of the 5,000 or so pilgrims who have settled in New Jerusalem, some 180 miles northwest of Mexico City. **********On Sept. 18 violence erupted when a small group of ''dissidents'' who followed a different medium were attacked with sticks and stones and chased out of the community. They then took their complaints to newspapers and a leading television station, which began a fierce campaign against the sect, calling for state intervention and repeating unproved charges that pilgrims were forced to pay huge sums of money and that Mama Maria participated in orgies with her ''monks.'' 'Virgin Will Protect Us' **********The controversy, however, has served only to strengthen the faith of those living here. ''The Virgin provoked the scandal so that the Word would spread, so bells would ring all over the world,'' Father Nabor said. ''But nothing can happen to us. The Virgin will protect us.'' **********The Bishop in nearby Tacambaro, Luis Morales Reyes, is alarmed.  For years he has quietly combated the sect, but now he is more fearful of society's reaction to New Jerusalem.  ''I'm not saying we're going to have a Guyana,'' he said, alluding to the mass suicide at Jonestown in 1978, ''but even two or three dead would be serious.  I say, leave them in peace.  It's enough to say that the apparitions are false.'' **********He has met with the Governor of Morelia state, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and obtained assurances that the police will not intervene. ''They're an enclave and we must accept them,'' the Bishop said.  ''I know Father Nabor well. He was my teacher when I was a seminarian. He's a good man. But he's now suffering from religious paranoia.'' Sect Grows More Isolated **********Since its foundation nine years ago, the sect has become gradually more isolated from society. According to the faithful, the Virgin of the Rosary appeared to an old peasant widow, Gabina Romero de Sanchez, with instructions that a shrine be built here. Then, on Oct. 7, 1973, before a crowd of some 10,000 people gathered by Father Nabor, at that time the parish priest in nearby Puruaran, Mrs.  Sanchez unwrapped her shawl and an image of the Virgin appeared ''miraculously'' on a piece of cloth. **********Soon afterward, construction of the shrine began, with Mrs. Sanchez - who became known as Mama Salome -claiming to be receiving daily messages from the Virgin of the Rosary on how the religious community should be formed. Word of the miracle spread through Mexico and busloads of pilgrims would arrive at the shrine each weekend. **********But after the Bishop of Tacambaro at the time, Jose Abraham Martinez, declared the apparitions to be false and suspended the priest, Father Nabor turned his wrath against the entire Roman Catholic Church. The messages from the Virgin suddenly began to denounce Rome and proclaim that only those living in New Jerusalem would be saved when the world ends in 1990. **********Father Nabor also built up his own organization, with hundreds of nuns and monks adopting the names of saints and taking vows of poverty, chastity and obedience to the orders emanating from the stern priest and his aging medium. **********Even after Mama Salome died in March last year, the phenomenon survived because, within weeks, Arcadia Garcia, then only 14 years old, and a 21-year-old ''nun'' known as Santa Maria Margarita claimed to be receiving messages from the Virgin through the spirit of Mama Salome. Until the clash between followers of the two groups in September, Father Nabor listened to -or used - them both. An Unlikely Seer **********Today Mama Maria de Jesus has been accepted as the chosen vehicle for messages from above, but she seems an unlikely seer. Although wearing a special habit, much of the time she seems to behave like a spoiled teen-ager, running around the shrine in tennis shoes and carrying a doll called Yolis that is dressed to look like her. Among her closest aides are three brothers, Michael, Patrick and John Moore, who moved here from Fort Collins, Colo., several years ago. **********But she is not shy of exhibiting her powers. While answering the questions of visitors, she was prompted by Father Nabor to offer some message from the Virgin Mary. She then appeared to go into a trance, rolled onto the floor, where she was held by Michael Moore, and then, with her eyes closed, proceded to speak in the different voices of various saints, each willing to be interrogated by the visitors. **********''The Pope is a fraud,'' she said, supposedly speaking in the voice of the Archangel Gabriel. ''Pope Paul VI is imprisoned in the basement of the Vatican so that the Antichrist can enter. The anti-Christ is already here. He is 29 years old and comes from Guadalajara and soon he will be called to Rome. This is the Ark of our Holy Mother. Only those at Her feet will be saved.'' **********As she spoke, a huge crowd of nuns, monks, children and old people gathered to watch in silent awe.  Barely two miles away in Puruaran, though, New Jerusalem was still viewed with skepticism. ''I tell you, they're all mad,'' said a gas station attendant, who warned the visitors against traveling to the shrine. ''But madder still are those who go there.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/17/world/europe-missile-compromise-is-proposed-by-us-experts.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Europe Missile Compromise Is Proposed by U.S. Experts", "print_headline": "Europe Missile Compromise Is Proposed by U.S. Experts", "body_text": " **********An arms control group headed by Paul Warnke, former United States arms negotiator, proposed a compromise today in limiting missiles in Europe. **********Under the plan, the Atlantic alliance would drop plans for the deployment of 572 medium-range missiles and the Soviet Union would scrap 380. **********Mr. Warnke and three other former officials, members of the Committee for National Security, a private group, told reporters that this would leave the Russians with 215 SS-20's carrying 645 warheads and the West with 184 American, French and British submarine-launched missiles with 544 warheads."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/20/business/pennsylvania-banks-set-merger-accord.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 281, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PENNSYLVANIA BANKS SET MERGER ACCORD", "print_headline": "PENNSYLVANIA BANKS SET MERGER ACCORD", "body_text": " **********Two of Pennsylvania's largest bank holding companies, the Pittsburgh National Corporation and the Provident National Corporation, said today that they had agreed in principle to merge. **********The combination would create one of the nation's biggest banking organizations. **********Under the merger, a new holding company, the PNC Corporation, would be started with assets of about $10.2 billion.

It was defeated here by the Concerned Citizens Group, a party that was created and led by Mr.  Climaco. **********Although the 66-year-old Mayor does not personally represent a political threat to Mr. Marcos, he has used his office and the city of Zamboanga to illustrate what he calls the failures of the Marcos regime. **********One of his first projects after he became Mayor in 1980 was to erect a billboard on the front of the two-story City Hall listing the crimes committed in this city of 350,000. For 1981 the figures are 255 killed, 10 kidnapped, 208 robbed. Eight Bombings During May **********''Practically every night people get killed here,'' said Mayor Climaco. ''In May eight bombs killed two and injured about 50.'' The billboard, he said, is his way of challenging the regional and district military commanders who are in charge of security in this southern area. **********President Marcos has declared the Government the victor in the 10-year-old battle with the secessionist forces of the Moro National Liberation Front, but Mayor Climaco said his scoreboard and the frequent bombings here proved otherwise. **********Region 9, of which Zamboanga is part, is one of the two autonomous regions established by the Marcos Government to give the Moslem minority a say in the administration of the southern part of the country. **********''But the autonomous government is a joke,'' said Mr. Climaco. He said he was convinced that it was Mr. Marcos's failure to give the Moslems what had been promised that made Zamboanga a battleground. **********For several years, this city was considered unsafe for outsiders.  Residents carried guns, and there was a curfew. Industrialization Sought **********Zamboanga, now open again, is part of the region that the Government is seeking to revitalize and industralize, largely in response to urging by Moslem countries of the Middle East that supply oil to the Philippines. Some of the projects, however, are badly behind schedule and over their budgets. **********On the unpaved road outside the site where the Ministry of Tourism is building a convention center for the city, Mayor Climaco has put up two billboards attacking ''incompetence, irregularity and graft'' in the project. One sign reads, ''Lord Almighty, hear our prayers, as we know not when this long-overdue and extravagant monster of the Ministry of Tourism will be complete.'' **********Mayor Climaco, an energetic showman, has vowed not to cut his hair until martial law is lifted. Though his hair has been growing for 10 years, it is sparse and graying and only reaches his shoulders. **********During Mr. Climaco's tenure, the city's income has increased from $3 million to $6.7 million. New streets have been built, and the Mayor has planned an industrial park and new housing areas that he hopes will accommodate some of the refugees who came to Zamboanga to escape guerrilla fighting in the rural areas.

Bankers and officials are concerned that money funds have become excessively sensitive to publicity given banking problems and are pulling out their money from unquestionably sound institutions. **********Although the money funds, by offering much higher rates of interest than banks, have attracted billions of dollars that might otherwise have gone into savings accounts, much of this has been recycled back into the big banks by investing the funds in large certificates of deposits. **********At present the money funds control about $200 billion. Based on figures supplied by Donoghue's Money Fund Report of Sept. 13, the 10 largest money market mutual funds, out of a total of 205, held $24.7 billion in bank C.D.'s. The problem, bankers say, is not so much the aggregate size of these holdings, but the fact that at times a fund will suddenly pull a large amount out of a bank. **********Millions Withdrawn **********Last July, for example, following the failure of the Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City, a number of money market funds pulled hundreds of millions of dollars out of the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, or did not renew deposits when they expired. **********As a result, Chase, the nation's third-largest bank, and Continental, the sixth largest, had to pay considerably more than other banks for their deposits. **********The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest commodities exchange, removed Chase from the list of banks whose certificates of deposit may be delivered against the board's domestic futures contracts. Earlier, Continental had voluntarily removed itself from the list. **********The pullback by the money market funds was in response to losses incurred by the two giant banks as the result of energy-related loans they had purchased from the Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City, which failed last July 5. Chase, in addition, had experienced a large loss as the result of its dealings with the now-defunct Drysdale Government Securities Corporation. Quarterly Losses for 2 Banks **********These problems caused Continental to report a $61 million after-tax loss in the second quarter and Chase a $16 million loss. This was the first time in recent history that any of the nation's top 10 banks had reported a quarterly loss, and in that sense the news was dramatic. **********In terms of the banks' basic soundness, the losses were minute. At Continental, the loss represented only 2.9 percent of its equity and reserves for loan losses, and at Chase only 0.35 of 1 percent.  Equity is the amount invested in the bank by its shareholders. **********Chase and Continental were not the only major banks affected.  Rumors spread about other big banks and they, too, became victims.  Most of the withdrawn deposits were shifted into Treasury bills or commercial paper, which are i.o.u.'s of large corporations. **********In many cases, the money fund managers themselves had no fears about the basic soundness of the banks from which they had withdrawn money. **********The problem is that the fund managers must worry not only about the actual creditworthiness of the bank whose C.D.'s they hold, but also about the public's perception of that bank's creditworthiness.  Each money fund regularly publishes a prospectus showing its investments. The fear is that the fund's investors might withdraw their money if they see that the fund is holding a C.D. of a bank that had recently encountered problems. **********''There are two things that we consider - creditworthiness and perception of creditworthiness,'' said Jeffrey B. Lane, senior executive vice president of Shearson/American Express, which runs a number of money market mutual funds, the largest of which is the $6.4 billion Shearson Daily Dividend Fund. **********There are 400,000 investors in Shearson funds who make their investments through 4,200 brokers, Mr. Lane noted. ''I don't want to have to convince the 4,200 brokers that the bank's C.D. is good, it's not worth my time,'' he said. Impact on Markets Cited **********It is this kind of attitude that is troubling many officials and bankers. They argue that because of the vast size of some of the money market mutual funds, their managers should consider the effect of their actions on the financial markets as well as the short-term interests of their clients. **********Most money fund managers do not agree. ''You have $200 billion of assets floating around, that's no small matter,'' Mr. Lane acknowledged. ''But we are not being paid to take risks, be diplomats or heroes. We want our customers to sleep well.'' **********Mr. Lane, like most other money fund managers interviewed, declined to discuss specific investments.  Even those who are deeply concerned about the impact of the money funds on the market concede that the fund managers' first responsibility is to their investors. **********''I've felt for a long time that we'd be better off if we had a smaller money market mutual fund industry,'' said J. Charles Partee, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board. ''I've always thought of the funds as being impersonal investors with no continuing relationships that they want to preserve. They represent total self-interest - I wouldn't expect anything else from them.'' 'Social Responsibility' **********There are some money fund executives, however, who have begun to ponder whether the size of their organizations has created new responsibilities. ''Our first responsibility is the interests of our shareholders,'' said the manager of one of the nation's biggest money market mutual funds, who asked not to be identified. ''At the same time, we realize that we have some kind of social responsibility too. There are other constituencies that must be served, including the overall economy.'' **********Continental, Chase and other banks that had trouble raising deposits from the money market funds obtained funds from other banks, both domestic and foreign. **********''We took care not to be simply reactive, and based our decisions on judgments about the real creditworthiness of the banks involved, not about popular perceptions,'' said Charles S. Sanford Jr., executive vice president of the Bankers Trust Company. **********Many bankers and officials are saying that the giant money funds should have recognized similar responsibilities. Major Banks Dropped **********But John N. Breazeale relates how his fund no longer holds deposits in any of the nation's major banks, except for the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. Mr. Breazeale is first vice president of the $6.75 billion Cashfund Inc., which is managed by Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis Inc. **********On March 31, according to its prospectus, Cashfund held $233 million in C.D.'s issued by Continental Illinois. ''If you had called me at that time, I would have been very proud of that,'' Mr.  Breazeale said. But since then Continental's second-quarter loss was disclosed and Cashfund rid itself of Continental paper. Continental, as well as other banks, declined to comment for the record on the actions of the money funds. **********Cashfund also no longer will hold C.D.'s of the Bank of America, the nation's largest. On March 31, Cashfund held $50 million of that bank's C.D.'s. Asked why Cashfund dropped Bank of America, Mr.  Breazeale said he was not sure, but thought there might have been concern about its foreign loans. **********It also will no longer buy C.D.'s of the Seattle-First National Bank, another bank that reported a $55.4 million loss in the second quarter. On March 31, Cashfund held $95 million in C.D.'s from the Seattle bank, the largest in Washington State. **********Although Cashfund no longer holds deposits in the nation's major banks, except for Morgan, Mr. Breazeale said, ''I believe personally that these banks are viable entities, but I thought for a while that things would get worse before they'd get better.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/17/business/prime-back-to-16-1-2-at-4-big-banks.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1982-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 592, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRIME BACK TO 16 1 2% AT 4 BIG BANKS", "print_headline": "PRIME BACK TO 16 1 2% AT 4 BIG BANKS", "body_text": " **********A tentative trend toward lower interest rates was aborted yesterday as four major banks raised their prime lending rates half a percentage point, to 16 1/2 percent, reversing a downward move they made March 8. **********As a result, the prime rate at all the nation's major banks now stands at the 16 1/2 percent level.  The four big banks that announced they would return their prime to the 16 1/2 percent level were the Chase Manhattan Bank, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, the Bankers Trust Company and the First National Bank of Chicago. **********''We were very reluctant to make this move, but the fact is that the cost of funds over the past week has significantly exceeded this increase in the prime,'' said Willard C. Butcher, chairman of the Chase. Money Supply Rise Cited **********Despite hopes last week that interest rates had begun a downward trend, in recent days most short-term rates have risen. Part of the impetus for the reversal, according to bankers, was the announcement by the Federal Reserve System last Friday that the money supply increased by $3.4 billion in the week ended March 3. **********Money market participants expect the Fed to tighten its monetary policy when the growth in the money supply exceeds its targets, as it now does. For this reason, holders of funds demand greater returns on their money, and interest rates are driven upward. **********As a result, the interest rates that banks must pay to borrow funds themselves have been rising sharply. The rate on three-month certificates of deposit that are issued in denominations of at least $1 million - a chief source of bank funds - rose to almost 14 1/2 percent yesterday from 13.65 percent a week earlier. **********Similarly, the rate on Federal funds, overnight money that banks trade among themselves, rose to about 15 1/4 percent yesterday from 13.7 percent a week earlier. 'Overburdened Credit Markets' **********A number of bankers and economists were surprised by the sudden spurt in interest rates. ''The consensus forecast of declining interest rates has been refuted again by the reality of overburdened credit markets,'' said Alan Lerner, senior vice president and economist at Bankers Trust. **********At 16 percent, the prime was the lowest it had been since last December, when it stood at 15 3/4 percent before going back up to 17 percent in mid-February and then falling again. **********Some bankers, even some whose banks had not gone to the 16 percent level, had been hopeful that interest rates would fall considerably further as a result of the recession and declining inflation. ''We could be seeing a prime of 14 percent within the next 30 to 45 days,'' George R. Baker, executive vice president of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company, said last week. **********But the recent rise in basic interest rates has dashed some of these hopes.  Mr. Lerner said the prime rate might climb an additional two percentage points within the next few months. He expects the increase because he believes the money supply will rise in the weeks ahead, which will encourage the Fed to maintain a relatively tight grip on the money supply. **********The prime is a key lending rate because interest rates on many business loans are tied to it. In borrowing from banks, major corporations are often charged rates below the prime, while interest rates charged on loans to smaller companies are usually scaled up from the prime."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/22/world/joyful-cheers-attend-the-royal-birth.html": {"writer_name": "James Feron", "pub_date": "1982-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 556, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JOYFUL CHEERS ATTEND THE ROYAL BIRTH", "print_headline": "JOYFUL CHEERS ATTEND THE ROYAL BIRTH", "body_text": " **********A long day of waiting for a royal birth ended tonight.

Within a minute there were ''hip hip hoorays'' followed by a chant of ''We want Charlie!'' **********After about an hour, Prince Charles came out. As the crowd roared, he answered reporters' questions briefly, but as any new father might. 'Rather a Shock to My System' **********How do you feel, he was asked.  ''It's rather a grown-up thing, I find, rather a shock to my system,'' he replied.  What's the baby like?  ''The baby is blond, sort of fairish.'' How is Diana doing?  ''She is just so relieved. We're both delighted.'' What is the boy's name?  ''You better ask my wife. We've thought about one, but we had a little argument.'' Hilde Vernlie from Zurich broke through the metal barricades to the center of the street and popped a cork on a bottle of champagne she had been carrying all day. Young men squatting on a wall opposite the hospital, St. Mary's, tore paper into confetti and threw it into the air; the pieces were caught in the lights of television lights behind them. Crowd Begins a Chant **********Now the crowd did a turn on a soccer cheer: ''Nice one, Charlie.  Nice one, son. Nice one, Charlie. Let's have another one.'' It was a happy ending to a long day under dripping skies. Fiona Stevenson, of Wrexham, Wales, said it was worth the wait. She had listened to reports on the radio all day, she said, but finally, ''I had to come.'' **********She said she was pleased that such a joyous event had come so soon after the end of the fighting in the Falklands. The point was echoed by others in the crowd who were stirred by the sense of national unity that happy events for the royal family can bring. Policemen Stand Guard **********Throughout the day two policemen stood at the top of the steps at the entrance to the Lindo Wing of the hospital. They kept the goodnatured crowd at bay across the street but granted passage to those who needed to get in, including one pregnant woman who arrived, to the crowd's cheers, with her husband. **********Joanna Fitzgerald, of Willesden, and her sister Mary were wearing red felt bowlers banded in a Union Jack motif. They stood against the barrier yelling, ''Come on Diana.'' **********Occasionally people arrived with bouquets of flowers. A teen-aged girl, clad in a summery white dress, received an ovation when she came bearing a single yellow rose. A woman selling flowers around the corner said that Americans were among those who had ordered bouquets to be sent in. **********Vendors were busy. One was selling Wedgwood ware for 1, or $1.80, a plate. Selling better were Union Jacks, to the entreaty, ''Show your colors - buy a flag.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/29/business/mexico-softens-impact-of-bank-nationalization.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1982-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 594, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MEXICO SOFTENS IMPACT OF BANK NATIONALIZATION", "print_headline": "MEXICO SOFTENS IMPACT OF BANK NATIONALIZATION", "body_text": " **********Mexico's new Government moved to soften the impact of the nationalization of the country's private banks last September by announcing plans to sell off 34 percent of the nationalized banks. **********The move is expected to stir criticism from leftist and nationalist groups that have pledged to fight any efforts by the one-month-old Government of President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado to reverse or weaken the state takeover of the banking system. **********But the proposal, contained in a bill sent to Congress Monday night, does not contemplate returning shares to the former bank owners. It would offer them for purchase by Federal, state and municipal agencies, bank workers and bank users. No single shareholder would be allowed to own more than 1 percent of the stock in the banks. **********The Federal Government will retain a controlling 66 percent interest in the banks, while the Minister of Finance will serve as chairman of the board of all the banks, the proposal stated. **********In his inaugural address Dec.1, Mr. de la Madrid stressed that the bank nationalization was ''irreversible,'' but he promised ''new and imaginative'' ways of enabling society to participate in both the management and ownership of the banks. His proposal to sell 34 percent of the nationalized banks was in fulfillment of that campaign pledge. **********''To nationalize does not imply absolute state control,'' Mr. de la Madrid said. ''The nationalized banks should belong to the people and not to a new minority of leaders.'' Means of Selling Shares Unclear **********According to the Mexican Bankers' Association, the total capital of the nationalized banks exceeded 80 billion pesos, or around $500 million at current exchange rates, last September. Theoretically, the Government could obtain some $170 million from the sale of 34 percent of the stock.Many other questions raised by the bank nationalization last September still have to be clarified, including how the former bank owners are to be compensated and what will happen to the shares owned by the banks in major Mexican industries. **********Monday night, in an apparent move to open negotiations on these issues, Jesus Silva Herzog, Finance Minister, met for the first time since the change of Government Dec.1 with a small group of former bank executives, including Agustin F. Legorreta, formerly head of Banco Nacional de Mexico; Manuel Espinosa Yglesias, formerly chairman of Banco de Comercio, and Carlos Abedrop Davila, president of the Bankers' Association. **********But Mr. Abedrop told reporters after the 30-minute meeting that two lawsuits brought by owners of expropriated banks challenging the constitutionality of the nationalization decree signed by former President Jose Lopez Portillo on Sept.1 would not be withdrawn and would await a ruling by the courts. Reorganization Planned **********Meanwhile, the Government is reportedly preparing to reorganize the 57 different banks nationalized into six to eight large financial institutions. Four banks with joint public and private capital before the state takeover - Banco Mexicano Somex, Banco Internacional, Banca Promex and Banco Provincial de Sinaloa - will also eventually conform to the new 66:34 share ratio. **********When the bank nationalization was announced, there were strong rumors that Mr. de la Madrid, at that time President-elect, disapproved of the measure and of Mr. Lopez Portillo's charge that the banks were responsible for the huge flight of capital that provoked a series of currency devaluations this year. **********Since then, the bank nationalization has been enshrined in the Mexican constitution and, as such, is politically almost impossible to reverse."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/23/business/advertising-co-founder-leaving-doyle-heekin-agency.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-09-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 228, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Co-Founder Leaving Doyle-Heekin Agency", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Co-Founder Leaving Doyle-Heekin Agency", "body_text": " **********James R.

The effect of that ruling was to force the Europeans to post bonds for the amount of countervailing duties -fees sought to offset subsidies by foreign governments - that could be imposed once the cases were fully adjudicated. **********The dumping findings and the countervailing duty findings are cumulative, meaning that a company in Europe could be hit with a countervailing duty on top of an antidumping duty. **********Although bonds are posted, the actual fines will not be levied until after a final determination of whether the domestic industry has been injured by imports.

The nation's 19,000 agents sell 65 percent of all airline tickets, and a reluctance on their part to place travelers on a given flight shows up quickly in empty seats. **********Executives from Braniff, for example, said that a major reason they had to file for protection under Chapter 11 last week was the large drop in ticket sales - put at 40 to 50 percent -by travel agents. **********Now, confronted with the Braniff bankruptcy action, some travel agents and their customers are showing reluctance to buy tickets on other financially troubled carriers, including Continental, Republic, Western, and World Airlines. **********The pressure comes just as those carriers are beginning to rebound from an increase in traffic, and in an effort to allay travel agents' fears, Republic has mounted a major campaign to reassure them. **********Risks to Carriers Serious **********While it is too early to tell how widespread these fears are, the possible risks to the troubled carriers are great. **********''The financial destiny of a weak airline is, in reality, in the hands of a travel agent,'' according to Julius Maldutis, the airline analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc., ''rather than those of senior lenders or banks, as is commonly assumed.'' **********As Paul Bessel, vice president of industry affairs for the American Society of Travel Agents, noted, the agencies also have a great deal of discretion in choosing airlines. Only an estimated 20 percent of customers specify an airline, usually specifying only time and date. **********''It is making us more cautious,'' Rudolf U. Gross, president of Englewood Travel, a large travel agency in New Jersey, said in discussing the Braniff case. He acknowledged in an interview that he was being particularly cautious about making advance bookings on the troubled carriers. **********Skip Oldham, vice president of George Oldham Associates, a travel firm in Johnson City, Tenn., has printed in red an explanation of travelers' rights under the airline default protection plan. **********''I want people who are buying tickets on the financially troubled carriers to know what they are getting into and the risk they are running,'' he said. Travel Could Be Delayed **********He said that in case of a bankruptcy, some travelers could find their trips delayed because other carriers would take them only on a standby basis. And in some of the country's smaller cities, finding an alternate carrier could be difficult. In any case, however, tickets would be honored and travelers would lose no money. **********Though he has not asked his agents to avoid booking on such carriers, as some travel agencies have done, he said he was not buying tickets from such carriers for flights far in advance. **********Many agencies have not changed their policy in dealing with troubled carriers. Sandy Leto, for example, the retail manager of Revere Travel Inc., a large agency in New Jersey, said her only criteria continued to be the best fare and time for her customers. **********But, she acknowledged, if a customer brought up the potential problem of a troubled airline, she would tell them of the possible risks and ask: ''Do you want to take a chance?'' **********Not surprisingly, it is the business community, which accounts for about half of air travel, that seems most sensitive to the booking issue. **********Even though almost all passengers who were stranded by Braniff's sudden suspension of service on May 12 were able to get seats on another carrier, it was on a standby basis, with delays. That, Mr.  Gross of Englewood Travel said, is very hard on an executive expected at a certain place at a certain time. Some Refunds Sought **********''It's just not acceptable to a businessman,'' Mr. Gross said, adding that some business people bought new tickets on other airlines and a few were seeking refunds for the Braniff tickets from him. **********Most agents said in interviews that they do not try to dissuade a customer from switching from a troubled airline, since to do so could mean loss of the customer's business in the future. Some also noted, however, that there were customers who specified flying on one of the troubled carriers in order to help them survive. **********Among the airlines themselves, reaction to the booking problem has been mixed. At Republic in Minneapolis, David E. Moran, senior vice president of marketing, sent telegrams to all travel agencies last Monday seeking to reassure them. **********''In view of the current industry situation, you may have certain concerns with respect to booking carriers which have, over the past several months, been reported to be in financial difficulty,'' the telegram read. ''We wish to take this opportunity to reassure you of Republic's position.'' **********In addition, Mr. Moran said, the airline was getting help from some retired employees who were calling agents around the country to reassure them. Sales Up at Republic **********Like other executives, Mr. Moran stressed the positive. Republic had an operating profit in the first quarter, he said, and sales by travel agents so far this year have totaled $234 million, an increase of 33 percent from the comparable period a year ago. **********Other carriers, such as Western, said that so far they had not seen a decrease in sales from travel agents. Craig B. Benedetti, vice president-marketing for Western, said the airline was not making any special efforts to reassure travel agents. **********He also noted that Western and the other airlines with financial probems were not in such severe straits as Braniff.  Braniff repeatedly had to promote quick discount sales, in which two tickets were offered for the price of one, to raise enough cash to meet the week's expenses. **********Bruce Plowman, director of public affairs for Continental, said the carrier had been hurt when Laker had failed and there was a falloff in travel agent sales. But, he said, traffic had been increasing and there was a cash reserve of $100 million held between Continental and Texas International Airlines, both owned by the Texas Air Corporation. Short-Term Help **********While some agents are taking protective measures, they do not want to contribute to the failure of any carrier. Thus while Mr. Gross is being careful about advance bookings on Pan American World Airways, he is promoting the airline on a short-term basis to help it survive. **********Mark Carter of Anchor Travel, however, an agency that handles sailing tours to the Carribbean, said he was advising his agents to avoid writing tickets on some of the troubled airlines if possible.  ''We might get stuck with clients who will be unhappy and want a refund on the spot,'' he said. **********Under an airline default protection plan worked out among the carriers and travel agents, customers who buy regular tickets from travel agencies on airlines that default or go bankrupt are guaranteed travel on other airlines, generally on a standby basis.  Under the plan, travel agents are not required to refund money for tickets. **********In the case of Braniff, some airlines also honored tickets bought directly from that airline though not required to do so.  Many travel agencies are now including in their ticket folders an explanation of the rights of passengers in the event of an airline bankruptcy. The notice was drafted by the American Society of Travel Agents, which is an industry group representing 10,000 travel agencies. **********Part of the note reads that ''although some airlines are having serious financial probems, this does not mean that they will go bankrupt or suddenly suspend operations.'' The note then adds the warning, ''But they might.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/02/business/western-savings-in-webb-stock-pact.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1982-11-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 550, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WESTERN SAVINGS IN WEBB STOCK PACT", "print_headline": "WESTERN SAVINGS IN WEBB STOCK PACT", "body_text": " **********Western Savings, the nation's 29th-largest savings and loan association and the biggest in Arizona, said today that it had agreed to acquire a nearly 25 percent stake in the Del E.

Webb More Profitable **********Mr. Johnson's successor, Robert K. Swanson, has raised more than $150 million in cash by selling many of Webb's large hotels and casinos since taking the reins of the company last year. Analysts have credited him with putting the formerly debt-laden company on a profitable path. **********Webb, which is based in Phoenix, had a net income of $5.3 million on revenue of $414.8 million in 1981.  William E. Hallinan, research director of Young, Smith & Peacock Inc., a Phoenix brokerage, said the sale by the foundation would likely be a boon to the price of Webb shares because its major stockholder no longer will be in a position of having to sell part of its holding each year. **********As is required of all charitable foundations by the Internal Revenue Service, the Webb Foundation must distribute 5 percent of its assets annually. The Webb Foundation earned no income from its sole holding, Webb stock, which has not paid a dividend since December 1980. **********The sale should help the Webb Foundation, set up by the late Del E. Webb, to provide for medical charities in in the far western part of the United States, Mr. Johnson said. **********John Driggs, chairman and chief executive of Western and its parent company, the Western Financial Corporation, and a brother of Gary Driggs, praised Mr. Swanson in a prepared statement. He added that the investment ''will provide Western with important diversification of assets.'' Western Savings, which is also based in Phoenix, has more than $2.5 billion in assets. **********Among its interests, Western Savings operates Leisure World, a retirement community in Mesa, Ariz. Webb, in addition to its other interests, operates two large retirement communities, Sun City and Sun City West, northwest of Phoenix. Western Savings provided the first mortgage loan at Sun City in 1962. **********Shares of Western Financial closed at $11.75, up $1.375 on the American Stock Exchange. The announcement of the acquisition was made today after the market closed.

''There were two days last week when falling prices caused the open interest in T-bonds to drop by 5,000 contracts.'' **********In New York, Jerry Laurain, financial futures trader at Merrill Lynch Commodities, observed that the decline in open interest ''could also be directly linked to the slowdown in activity in the cash market for Government paper since the Drysdale affair erupted last month.'' **********Mr. Laurain noted: ''Everyone in the money market has become extremely cautious since then. Government securities dealers and others in the market have been limiting their exposure.

King Juan Carlos, accompanied by Queen Sofia, was the first to salute the Pope as he stepped from the plane at the airport outside the capital. **********Pope Notes Tensions **********The Pope, in reply to welcoming remarks by the King, recalled ''the well-known tensions, sometimes leading to open clashes, which have taken place in the bosom of your society.'' **********But, he went on, ''my journey is beyond any political or partisan purpose.'' The Pope will nonetheless confront some of Spain's major political problems when he visits, in the course of an exceptionally long foreign trip, the Basque and Catalan regions, where autonomist and even separatist movements are strong, and Andalusia in the south, a traditionally impoverished area.

Warm Welcome on Drive **********The Pope was warmly received on his drive through the capital after a restrained welcome by a carefully limited crowd at the airport. **********The Pope is expected to make statements on the political problems at appropriate moments as he meets with farmers, industrial workers, students and intellectuals, as well as Mr. Gonzalez and other political personalities. **********He confined his remarks today largely to religious matters. But in a subsequent address to the Spanish bishops, he urged them to defend the church positions against abortion and divorce. The new Government is widely expected to move for the legalization of abortion. King's Welcoming Remarks **********The King, in his welcoming remarks, recalled that since 1494 Spain's Kings and Queens had borne the title Los Reyes Catolicos, conferred upon them by the papacy, and noted that the Pope had already seen the consequences of Spain's spreading of the Catholic gospel in America, the Philippines and Africa. **********The King did not mention that in the years since Francisco Franco died in 1975, the Catholic church in Spain has lost a great deal of its power. **********A new Constitution has for the first time separated church from state, a fact later enshrined in a new concordat with the Vatican. A sweeping liberalization of public life, including the right to divorce, has excluded the church from much of the position of official guardian of public morality that it occupied through the centuries. Election Delayed Visit **********The Pope's visit was postponed from earlier this month when elections were called for last Wednesday. The parties of the left protested that the Pope's presence during the campaign would give unfair advantage to the parties to their right. The visit was originally planned for last year but was put off after the Pope had been wounded by a Turkish gunman in May 1981. **********Liberal Spanish church sources in Rome stressed that the Pope was visiting the country at a moment when the Socialist election victory had underlined the church's loss of influence on public affairs.

''I have the feeling that there now exists on the Soviet side a recognition of the need for an early resolution of the crisis,'' he said. **********But Mr. Zia declared that his Government's ''dialogue'' with the Soviet Union had remained ''uneven'' because of the Soviet view that a solution to the Afghan problem, and the return home of the 2.8 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, lay in direct talks between the Pakistani and Afghan Governments. **********Departing from his prepared text, Mr. Zia said: ''To be crude and direct, we have always stated that Pakistan will not talk to this man who came to be head of the Afghan regime by riding on Soviet tanks.  We will not talk to him.'' **********Mr. Karmal came to power in December 1979 as the result of a Soviet-supported coup that overthrew the Marxist Government of President Hafizullah Amin. Soviet forces intervened in Afghanistan hours after the coup. 'We Have Shouted the Loudest' **********Mr. Zia contended that ''Pakistan has remained in the vanguard of efforts directed toward insuring the restoration of Afghanistan's freedom,'' and has thus ''raised the Soviet Union's ire against us.'' **********''We have shouted the loudest,'' he said.  Mr. Zia agreed last year to indirect talks with the Afghan Government, but he contended in his speech yesterday that ''there is no occasion to believe that a solution to this grave problem is at hand.'' **********On relations with the United States, Mr. Zia recalled the ''severe strains'' that emerged in the late 1970's, when, concerned that Pakistan was refusing to permit the international inspection of its nuclear installations, the Carter Administration suspended aid. **********He said that the aid program reconfirmed by President Reagan Tuesday would enable Pakistan ''to safeguard national integrity and withstand potential threats to its security.'' **********''It bears repetition that the region in which Pakistan is situated is beset by continuing strife and ceaseless turmoil,'' Mr. Zia declared. ''At the periphery of a highly volatile region, Pakistan serves as a bastion of stability, and offers the best hope for the restoration of a measure of tranquility.'' **********He added, ''The assistance which we expect to receive from the United States, by consolidating Pakistan as a nation confident in its security, would inevitably impart to the geopolitics of our region an essential equilibrium.'' **********In response to a written question on Pakistan's refusal until now to permit international inspection of its nuclear sites, Mr. Zia said that Pakistan would allow such inspection, ''but not on discriminatory grounds.'' He meant, presumably, that other nations with nuclear development programs were not subject to inspection. **********Mr. Zia said he had called on India to arrange the mutual inspection of nuclear installations by the two countries, but he said India had not replied to the offer. 'A Social Evil' **********Mr. Zia was also asked about accusations that Pakistan was a major source of illicit drugs destined for the United States. ''Our policy is that Pakistan is trying to stop this traffic, not only because it is hurting somebody else but because we feel it is a social evil,'' he said. **********He contended that Pakistan, since embarking on a vigorous effort to crack down on drug smuggling in 1979, had drastically reduced its production of opium. But he also placed blame for the problem on the huge profits that derive from drug trafficking in this country. **********''You are so kind,'' Mr. Zia said in reference to the great amounts spent by Americans on illicit drugs. ''You have so much money to give that I don't know what to do at this end'' to curb drug trafficking."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/23/world/briton-and-haig-in-useful-start-on-the-falklands.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1982-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 888, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRITON AND HAIG IN 'USEFUL START' ON THE FALKLANDS", "print_headline": "BRITON AND HAIG IN 'USEFUL START' ON THE FALKLANDS", "body_text": " **********Britain's Foreign Secretary, Francis Pym, said after a four-hour meeting today with Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. that they had made ''a useful start'' in discussing the latest ideas for resolving the Falkland Islands dispute. **********But alluding to the failure so far of diplomacy to end the threeweek-old crisis, he said on arriving here, ''I will not disguise from you that there are real difficulties and real obstacles.'' He refused to tell reporters what the plans of the British flotilla heading toward the Falklands were. **********Meanwhile, the Argentine President, Lieut. Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri, said his Government was prepared to ''continue the dialogue'' with Britain, but reiterated that Argentina would fight to hold on to the archipelago. He made his comments while on the way to the Falklands, his first visit there since Argentine troops seized the islands April 2. (Page A8.) **********'American Ideas' Considered **********Mr. Pym brought from London his Government's counterproposals to those offered by Argentina earlier in the week to Mr. Haig in Buenos Aires. But he said that in his talks with Mr. Haig, in which they were alone for two hours, they also considered ''American ideas'' for bridging the differences between the Argentines and the British. **********Mr. Pym refused to say whether he was hopeful or not because he said that the Americans and British would work on the various detailed proposals overnight and that he and Mr. Haig would meet again Friday.  Mr. Pym was also scheduled to see President Reagan on Friday. **********''So, we've made a useful start, but there is much work to be done and we are dealing with a very difficult problem,'' he said to reporters at the State Department. **********''We've begun to discuss the details of our various ideas and we are exploring them and we are going to do further work and I can't say more than that at the moment,'' he said. ''In the sense that we've shared ideas, and come together and had a good talk, that is progress.'' **********The British flotilla is believed to be only days away from the Falklands area; British military defense sources have said that the fleet will be within aircraft range of the islands by late Friday, and there were indications that some sort of action might be taken even sooner against South Georgia, a Falklands dependency 800 miles to the east. But there was surprisingly little sense of crisis surrounding today's meeting. **********British officials stressed their Government's interest in finding a diplomatic solution, and American officials said they were working behind the scenes with both sides to avert conflict that Washington believes is in neither side's interest. Argentine Minister Due **********Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez of Argentina is due to arrive in Washington on Sunday to attend the special meeting Monday of foreign ministers of the Organization of American States. The meeting will consider Argentina's request that action be taken against Britain for its threat to the Argentine occupation of the Falklands. **********Mr. Haig will meet with Mr. Costa Mendez, the State Department spokesman, Dean Fischer, said, but no firm date is set. As to the idea of Mr. Pym remaining in Washington for either direct talks with the Argentine official or indirect contacts through Mr. Haig's mediation, that seemed unlikely. **********Mr. Pym said today that ''my intention is to return tomorrow night to London.'' Diplomats said the British have stressed to Mr. Haig their insistence that Argentina withdraw its troops from the Falklands; that British administration over the islands be restored, at least for a short period; that the ultimate question of sovereignty be subject to future negotiations, and that the wishes of the inhabitants of the Falklands be taken into account. Argentina Demands Guarantees **********The Argentines have been willing to consider various interim arrangements after the withdrawal of their forces, but want guarantees that they will ultimately be recognized as having sovereignty over the islands. **********Mr. Pym, alluding to the fairly wide differences, said on arrival aboard a British Airways Concorde at Dulles Airport: ''We will do everything we can to try to find a peaceful settlement to this dispute. But I have not disguised from the British people and I will not disguise from you that there are real difficulties and real obstacles.'' **********Mr. Pym's visit to Washington went beyond the diplomatic talks with Mr. Haig. He also sought to build support for Britain's position with American public opinion. He went directly from the session at the State Department to the Senate to meet with members of the Foreign Relations Committee. **********A member of that committee, in advance of the meeting, said the Reagan Administration should openly condemn the Argentines for their occupation of the Falklands. 'Inherent Bias' Noted **********Senator Paul E. Tsongas, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the Administration should ''condemn unequivocally, openly and loudly'' the Argentine action. **********''I am struck by the inherent bias of a so-called policy of neutrality which treats a blatant aggressor and its victims as equals,'' he said. ''If Argentina has a claim to the Falklands, then Mexico has a claim to much of the southwestern United States.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/09/business/the-video-game-sales-war.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1982-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 985, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE VIDEO GAME SALES WAR", "print_headline": "THE VIDEO GAME SALES WAR", "body_text": " **********Everyone, it seems, is trying to enter the home video game business, bringing forth a profusion of new game-playing machines and games. **********Where there was once little more than Space Invaders, there are now such games as Space Raiders, Space Wars, Space Battle, Spacechase, Space Fury, Space Cavern, Space Hawk and Space Vultures, not to mention Communist Mutants From Space. Needless to say, the exhibits for all these new games take up a lot of space at the Consumer Electronics Show here, and are clearly the high point of an otherwise somber trade gathering. **********The profusion of entrants is not surprising. Home video game cartridges, which sell for $20 to $25 apiece, have been one of the fastest-growing areas of consumer electronics, accounting for an estimated $1.2 billion in sales last year. **********Yet the market has been controlled by a handful of companies. Last year there were four manufacturers of video game devices - Atari Inc., Mattel Electronics, Magnavox and Astrovision, now called Astrocade. Then, there was one company, Activision, that concentrated on game software for the Atari system - that is, the cartridges of instructions that make the game work. In its second full year, marked last March 31, Activision earned $12.9 million on sales of $66 million. More Newcomers **********This year there appear to be another half-dozen producers of game machines. They include Coleco Industries, a toy and game company, the Emerson Radio Corporation and Commodore International Ltd. **********There are also about a dozen new companies making software for Atari machines and, to a lesser extent, for Mattel systems, the two leaders in producing hardware for home video systems. They include start-up companies such as the Imagic Corporation of Saratoga, Calif., and Apollo Inc. of Dallas. **********Also involved are CBS Inc., and more traditional game companies such as Parker Brothers, Tiger Electronic Toys Inc. and the U.S.  Games Corporation, a subsidiary of the Quaker Oats Company. Hollywood is also getting into the act. Twentieth Century-Fox, MCA Inc., Paramount and Lucasfilm Ltd. have announced plans to enter the business. **********James H. Levy, president of Activision, said that if all the products displayed here reached the market, the number of games available for the Atari game system alone would double, to more than a hundred from about 60 now. Market Potential **********The entries come as there is growing Wall Street speculation that the business of making devices - essentially, microcomputers dedicated to the sole function of playing video games - is slowing down. One threat to these machines, which range in price from $150 to $300 - are inexpensive personal computers that play games as well as performing other, more computer-like things. **********Many analysts, however, among them Michele Preston, with Cyrus J.  Lawrence Inc., reject that notion. She said that while there were 4.5 million game machines sold last year, some eight million will be sold this year, representing a gain of 70 percent. Only eight million households, or about 10 percent of the nation's total, have games. **********Michael J. Moone, president of Atari's Consumer Electronics division, also said that the business is healthy in the United States and the international market has barely been scratched. ''We're beginning to see the tip of the iceberg of the two-game home,'' he said. **********Even if the overall business is still growing, the crowded field is sure to reduce profits. ''They can't all have prosperity at the same time,'' said Harold Vogel, an analyst with Merrill Lynch . Crowded Shelves **********The newcomers are expected to have a tougher time entering the market, if only because retailers will be hard-pressed to find shelf space to carry all the competing products. **********''There is a fairly narrow funnel at the retail level,'' said Josh Denham, president of Mattel Electronics.  Competitors say the weakness of the market leader, Atari, which has 70 percent of the installed machines, is the relatively poor quality of its graphics. Its home video version of Pac-Man, despite the hoopla surrounding its release, disappointed to consumers used to the more refined arcade version. **********By emphasizing superior features, others think they can make inroads on Atari's market. Mattel and Magnavox have introduced audio attachments to their games. Other Exotic Effects **********Another company receiving widespread attention at the show is the General Consumer Electronics Corporation of Santa Monica, Calif., a company formed a year ago by former Mattel officials. Instead of attaching its game to a TV set, General plans to sell a game that includes its own screen that will allow for superior graphic effects. **********The game companies are also competing vigorously to win the licensing rights to popular arcade games as well as themes from movies and comic books that can be spun off as video games, such as Parker Brothers' first game, The Empire Strikes Back, a space war game. **********For its part, Atari is introducing a more expensive game, priced at $300, about twice that of its existing units. Another company, the Arcadia Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., is planning to sell a $70 ''supercharger'' that would upgrade the quality of Atari's existing game. **********Other manufacturers, among them Emerson & Tryon Inc. of Beechwood, Ohio, a maker of computerized backgammon and chess games, hope to compete with Atari on the basis of price. Many of the newcomers say they will be satisfied with achieving only a tiny sliver of the huge market. **********''We're not expecting to do a billion and a half dollars in this product,'' said Tim A. Shane, president of Tryon.  Barry Britman, director of product and marketing development for Emerson, said his company had little choice. ''This is the hottest area right now,'' he said. ''Our audio business has been a tough push.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/02/business/leading-indicators-down-0.6.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1982-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 957, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LEADING INDICATORS DOWN 0.6%", "print_headline": "LEADING INDICATORS DOWN 0.6%", "body_text": " **********The Government's index of leading economic indicators, which is being watched for a sign that economic recovery is near, declined six-tenths of 1 percent in January, the Commerce Department reported today. The decline would have been much greater if the index had not been adjusted to remove the impact of winter weather on the number of hours logged by factory workers. **********As it was, the six-tenths of 1 percent drop added to other recent economic developments that are dampening hopes that a recovery from the current recession will begin this spring. Last month, for example, the Government reported a drop in industrial production and in retail sales. **********The January decline was the ninth in a row for the index of leading indicators, which is intended to forecast movements in the economy. The December index, which was originally reported as an increase of six-tenths of 1 percent, was revised by the Commerce Department to a decline of three-tenths of 1 percent. The tentative increase, reported a month ago, had been seen as the first sign that the end of the recession might be near. Factory Workweek Left Out **********For January, the Commerce Department took the unusual step of leaving out one of the 10 components of the index - the average factory workweek. With it left in, the decline would have been 2.8 percent. **********Commerce Department officials said they had removed the workweek figure - which declined sharply to 36.9 hours in January from 39 hours in December - because it had been distorted by severe winter weather during the reporting period. Using it, they said, would have distorted the pattern of the index. ''It is not serving the right purpose to put out a number that is an aberration,'' said Robert Ortner, the Commerce Department's chief economist. **********This was the first time in recent years that one of the components of the index had been dropped.  William Cox, who was the Commerce Department's deputy chief economist in the Carter Administration, agreed with adjusting the index because of the impact of the January weather. ''I understand it,'' he said. ''The drop in the workweek was simply wild in January, and it would have been misleading to leave it in.'' Mr. Cox is now assistant chief of the economics division of the Congressional Research Service. **********Of the index's nine components that were reported for January, six declined, led by a drop in new orders for consumer goods and a drop in stock market prices. A rise in the money supply showed the biggest gain of the three components that went up in January. **********While the Reagan Administration is sticking officially to its forecast of a recovery in the second quarter, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard McNamar said today in a Washington speech: ''We'll have poor economic numbers through April. In fact, the current downturn will be far worse than envisioned in our earlier scenarios.'' Outlook for Unemployment **********The unemployment rate, which was 8.5 percent in January, ''may yet get to 10 percent before we get things turned around,'' Mr. McNamar said. ''Don't be surprised.'' His comments seemed much less hopeful than the recent assertions of Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan that the economy, led by a recovery in the second quarter, would come ''roaring back.'' **********The January index of leading indicators, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said in a statement, ''provides evidence that the recession has yet to run its course.'' But the January figure, he added, is ''not inconsistent with the forecasts of a second-quarter recovery in the economy.'' **********Mr. Ortner said, ''I think the January index means the economy was not up in January, probably not up in February, and possibly not up in March.'' If the index is down in February and March, he added, ''then the best you might hope for is a June upturn.'' **********Alan Greenspan, a key outside economic adviser to the President, said today that a spring recovery would be put off a month or two unless there were some signs of a rebound in economic data in the next two weeks. **********''While the evidence suggests the rate of decline is slowing and, in fact, we may have hit bottom, indications of an upturn are scant at best,'' Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee. A Bleaker Point of View **********Another economist, Jack Carlson of the National Association of Realtors, was more pessimistic. He said the downturn in the indicators in January means the recession will last ''at least six months more.'' **********The December index was revised downward because of new data showing lower inventories. This decline will make the economy more sluggish in the first quarter, Mr. Ortner said. But he said the drop in inventories eventually would open the door to a recovery. When they get low enough, he explained, companies will begin ordering again and production will rise. **********The index of leading economic indicators is closely watched, especially during recessions, because it has not failed to foretell a recovery since World War II. During recent recessions, in fact, the index has risen for two months on the average before the recovery began. **********Even though some private forecasters, such as Lacy Hunt of the Fidelity Bank in Philadelphia, still predict a recovery in the second quarter, they have scaled down their expectations. ''The recovery is very weak,'' Mr. Hunt said. ''It is not going to be that visible.'' **********One of the key risks still is high interest rates. ''The actual course of activity will be heavily influenced by the trend of interest rates,'' Mr. Baldrige said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/17/business/lenox-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 28, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LENOX INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "LENOX INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/28/business/money-fund-assets-a-record-199.93-billion.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 244, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Money Fund Assets a Record $199.93 Billion", "print_headline": "Money Fund Assets a Record $199.93 Billion", "body_text": " **********Assets of the nation's money market funds rose sharply again during the week ended Wednesday, to set another record high.

Brown & Sons, who has followed I.B.M. for more than 20 years, thinks the shares could double by 1984. He bases this view on a long-range earnings projection to $10 or more a share in 1984 with a price/earnings multiple of 12. **********At present, I.B.M. carries an earnings multiple of 10 on profits estimated at $5.65 a share for the calendar year 1981. Mr. Bradley notes that I.B.M.'s multiple has at least equaled 12 in every year in the last quarter century. The stock closed yesterday at 56 3/4, unchanged. The relatively unimpressive 1981 result in part reflects currency loss es estimated by Mr. Bradley at more than 50 cents a share. **********I.B.M. earned $6.10 a share in 1980, with about 28 cents of that reflecting a tax rate uncharacteristically low for the company, Mr.  Bradley said. **********In his bullish outlook, Mr. Bradley calls I.B.M.'s incoming orders and shipments ''quite strong.'' He argues that the company's impressive acceleration in revenue growth has been masked by currency setbacks amounting to $1.5 billion in the first nine months of 1981. **********He believes, therefore, that the indicated 9 percent growth resulting in revenues of $20.1 billion for the nine months is significantly understated. ''The true growth is almost double that percentage and accelerating,'' he said. **********Most importantly, he believes revenue growth in 1982 could approach 20 percent, particularly if the dollar either stabilizes or weakens or if the world economy strengthens more than most expect. **********For 1982, Mr. Bradley estimates I.B.M. will earn $6.75 to $7.30 a share and that the company will earn $8.25 to $8.80 a share in 1983 and thus set the stage for at least $10 a share in 1984. **********The analyst says that the world markets for I.B.M.'s many products are very strong and that the company has introduced many important new products in recent years that are about to emerge from start-up cycles. **********In Mr. Bradley's view, I.B.M. is in roughly the same position in its current product cycle as it was some years after its 360 mainframe computer was introduced in 1964, and some years after its 370 mainframe model was introduced in 1970, when these lines began to pour forth major profits. **********This time around, he says, the product line is ''much broader.'' The success he says I.B.M. has been achieving with its 303X, 4300 and 8100 families of computers has been obscured by the currency setbacks. **********Mr. Bradley also notes that I.B.M. has undergone a major change in share ownership as evidenced by the 133 million shares traded last year, or some 526,000 shares per trading session. **********''Obviously, a lot of that trading has to do with covered options and other arbitrage,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''But it is also highly probable that the percentage of individual ownership has risen sharply in the last couple of years.'' I.B.M.'s 4-for-1 stock split in 1979 priced the shares below 100 for the first time in more than a generation and was designed to makethe stock more attractive to individuals. Com pany statistics are saidto indicate success. **********Mr. Bradley believes that individuals setting up Individual Retirement Accounts under the expanded law will in some cases buy I.B.M. since the stock has provided predictable dividend growth in the past and offers the prospect of capital appreciation in future. **********An analyst at the Value Line Investment Survey views the shares positively, too, noting that I.B.M. is about to move back into the profitable computer services business after an eight-year absence. In addition, I.B.M. is soon expected to introduce robots for use in factories. The analyst went on to say that, ''while less expensive systems will make up an ever-increasing percentage of the sales mix, capital additions should provide profit protection via improved operating efficiencies.'' **********The Value Line analyst added that I.B.M.'s agreements to sell its personal computers through Sears and Computerland represented a cost-effective method of distribution. **********Whether I.B.M. will show the kinds of stock market gains that once accompanied its key measures of growth - book value per share and return on equity - I.B.M. has slowed considerably from its heyday. **********With a revenue base estimated at $28.3 billion in 1981, the company ranks among the top 10 industrial companies in the nation and as such is believed by many to be too large to grow at a 20 percent or better rate for long."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/12/business/back-in-vogue-with-mutual-funds.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1982-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1494, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BACK IN VOGUE WITH MUTUAL FUNDS", "print_headline": "BACK IN VOGUE WITH MUTUAL FUNDS", "body_text": " **********RICHARD TISCH, president of the Richbar Sales Corporation, a 46-year-old New York dress importer, has a bout $850,000 in investments, and almost all of it is in mutual f unds.

One's small investment became part of a big pool that offered diversity, liquidity and lower transaction costs, with professional management thrown in for good measure. **********But in the 1970's, the stock market went sour, and funds had net redemptions in seven of the 10 years. During this period, moreover, money market funds began to become very popular with the public. It was not until 1980 that another reversal occurred - one that is still gathering steam - and mutual fund purchases again exceeded redemptions on a consistent basis. **********A bright marketing idea currently in vogue has been to multiply the number of funds offered under one roof. This recent emphasis on allowing shareholders the right to move money among a ''family'' of funds under the same management company has been an important lure in attracting additional business. **********''Mutual funds have become segmented to serve more and more specialized purposes,'' said George S. Johnston, president of Scudder, Stevens & Clark, a New York-based investment adviser that manages nine mutual funds. ''The consumer, as well as the big institutions, has become a selective shopper.'' **********Reflecting this, $16.8 billion was shifted in the first nine months of this year from one fund to another within a single mutual fund organization. This compares with $14.4 billion moved among fund families in all of 1981. The two biggest shifts were to municipal bond funds and aggressive growth funds. **********Fund groups allow almost limitless transfers by telephone, regardless of their size. Most organizations charge about $5 for each movement, but others allow free, restrictionless phone switching. **********The funds, quick to notice the rise in shifting, even offer guides to their own increasingly complex groups of offerings. As an example, for a fee of one-tenth of 1 percent of any portfolio of $100,000 or more, Scudder Fund Investment Counsel provides a consultant to give advice and recommend exchanges among the funds managed by the company. Those with smaller portfolios in mutual funds must decide the three basic switching questions on their own: when to get in, when to get out and when to get back in again. **********In addition, there are a number of newsletter advisory services that track the performance of different funds as a guide to those contemplating a switch. Among them are Telephone Switch Newsletter, Huntington Beach, Calif.; Switch Fund Advisory, Gaithersburg, Md., and NoLoad Fund X, San Francisco. **********''There are mutual funds across the entire financial spectrum from the most conservative kind of investment to the most speculative kind of investment,'' said David Silver, president of the Investment Company Institute, the national association of mutual funds. ''It's the whole idea of risk-adjusted investments.'' **********The institute categorizes the 515 non-money market funds that existed as of September 1982 into nine broad groups, each with a distinct financial objective and a different risk-reward relationship. They range from capital appreciation funds to balanced funds and from natural resources funds to fixed-income funds. Newer types of mutual fund products include gold funds, international funds and option funds. **********''The fundamental in choosing a mutual fund is your own circumstances,'' Mr. Silver said. ''Look at your age and your financial resources. What is your personal style? How will you sleep best at night?'' **********Because personal styles differ and some people can accept risk more easily than others, investors in mutual funds have portfolios ranging from $500 to $1 million or more. Many people consider their fund to be their one-stop shop for financial services and have all or most of their assets in this single investment. **********Further attracting more and more investors is the record that mutual funds have achieved in the five years through last Sept. 30.  Mutual funds in general, and stock funds in particular, turned in significantly better returns than the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks and the Consumer Price Index, according to Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks fund performance. **********Its tabulation shows that all funds advanced 107.16 percent and equity funds rose 90.86 percent, compared with gains of 43.54 percent for the Dow, 63.48 percent for the S.& P. 500 and 59.40 percent for consumer prices. **********To simplify starting and marketing new funds, fund managers have recently developed a series concept - one fund with, say, three different portfolios from which an investor can choose the appropriate grouping for his needs. The portfolios are generally centered around a particular industry, like technology, energy or consumer products, and run by the same money managers and board of directors under a single prospectus. **********The future growth of mutual funds may be augmented by other investment vehicles with which the funds can join forces. For instance, the new and enormously popular retirement plans are already heavily into mutual funds. Twenty-six percent of all the money in Keogh plans and 10 percent of all the money in Individual Retirement Accounts were placed in mutual funds last year - and the dollar amounts this year have already exceeded 1981. **********Almost half of the sales by the mutual fund industry are currently accounted for by no-load funds, which sell their shares at net asset value without the addition of a sales charge. In 1972, only 20 percent of fund sales were of the no-load variety. **********''Individual investors have become aware that they could call a number and there would be people to answer questions,'' Mrs. Berger said. ''Many previously thought that if they bought a load fund from a broker, he would be there but there would be no one if they bought a no-load.'' Of course, millions of Americans still buy mutual funds with a sales charge because of the performance of these funds or the persuasion of the salesman. **********The anticipated expansion of money management accounts at brokerage firms, banks and savings and loan associations is also expected to be a boon for mutual funds. Many of these accounts, which attempt to give customers continuous access to current money market rates, now sweep cash automatically into money-market funds based on a predetermined formula. **********''There's no reason,'' as Mr. Silver put it, ''why money cannot be swept into equity funds directly.'' Others see even more new markets developing that will appeal to many of those who have never before been involved with mutual funds. **********''Until now, mutual funds have been relatively small, serving specialized niches in the market for savings and investment vehicles,'' said Paul V. Teplitz, director of Cambridge Research Institute, which studied the subject for the no-load association.  ''Although the product appeal of bond and equity funds may not be as dramatic as the recent appeal of money funds, their potential market is very large.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/21/world/around-the-world-kohl-despite-setback-is-hopeful-on-83-vote.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kohl, Despite Setback, Is Hopeful on '83 Vote", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Kohl, Despite Setback, Is Hopeful on '83 Vote", "body_text": " **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today that he still believed his Christian Democratic Party had a good chance of winning the general election in March, despite losing a Hamburg state election Sunday. **********''We did not achieve our aim; we have undoubtedly suffered a setback,'' Mr. Kohl told reporters after party leaders met to discuss the victory of the opposition Social Democrats. **********Meanwhile, the Social Democrats issued a draft of a manifesto today calling for an international employment agreement to revive the world economy. **********The draft proposed an immediate meeting of major industrial nations to devise a joint policy on economic expansion.

''So I looked for a product that could be sold on a regular basis like a magazine,'' he said, going on to describe the Agency Book, an annual directory, now on the drawing board, that is scheduled to bow by the end of the year. **********It is the latest attempt to profit from ad agencies' desires to be visible to advertisers who are looking for a new agency. A more elaborate effort is a two-year-old British import called the Advertising Agency Register, which has a file of 10-minute, agencyproduced videotapes of promotional messages, which may or may not include examples of their work, to be screened by advertisers. **********In the past year and a half, more than 60 advertisers have used the facilities, which include access to each agencies' portfolio of print advertising (with or without case studies). Agencies supply brochures on themselves for any interested potential clients.

It expects to have a distribution of 23,000 copies and a page rate of $695. **********The magazine, its founder says, is intended to forever answer the question: ''That's a great ad, I wonder who did it?'' It does not, however, address the question: ''Why isn't it listed in Credits?'' **********Mr. Fenwick, of Paris and New York, was in Paris yesterday, most assuredly plotting even greater advertising sales triumphs.

It would be sold through regular game distribution channels or given away by the sponsor as a promotion tool. **********The first success was the game named for the Fortune 500. Each company whose name was used paid $30,000 for the honor.

And it may suggest the type of analysis that could help the Reagan Administration get its economic policy working. **********A leader of the growing ranks of young conservative economists, the 42-year-old Mr. Feldstein is committed most to reducing the deficit by chopping domestic spending, especially the growth of entitlement programs, the biggest of which is Social Security. And while he has suggested delaying the July 1, 1983, instalment of the tax cut, he is against taking it away entirely and opposes most other permanent tax increases because they just encourage spending. **********This makes him a supply-sider, as is the President. But while he pushes for tax cuts and incentives to spur investment, he is not in tune with the all-out supply-siders who directed early Reagan economic policy and who were subsequently frustrated by restrictive monetary policy. **********Mr. Feldstein acknowledges the need for a restrictive monetary policy to fight inflation.

Some economists wondered today whether he would be able to have a strong impact on an economic policy that has essentially been taken over by politics. **********''It's a very tough environment for economic policy making at this time,'' said Alan Greenspan, chairman of the council in the Ford Administration.

While he has created some controversy in his current position as head of the National Bureau of Economic Research, he is wellrespected among his fellow economists. Merchandising Economics **********At the same time, Mr. Feldstein has done well in merchandising his brand of conservative economics. He turned the bureau, an independent institution best known for its offical role of declaring the beginnings and ends of recessions, into a trimmer, business-like operation. **********But according to some critics, including the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Arthur Burns, the bureau under Mr. Feldstein has moved from objective research to special issues, reflecting his direction of studies toward his area of interest -the effect of tax policies on savings and investment. **********Mr. Feldstein took over the bureau, based in Cambridge, Mass. in 1977, at the age of 38. It was his second laurel of the year.  Earlier, he had won the John Bates Clark Award from the American Economic Association, the highest honor for an economist under 40. **********Ten years earlier, Mr. Feldstein had come to Harvard as an assistant professor of economics. After graduating from Harvard in 1961, with the idea and the pre-med courses to go to medical school, he changed course while at Oxford on a Fulbright Scholarship. He took three degrees at Oxford, ending with a Ph.D. in economics. Dumping Keynesian Thought **********When he returned to Harvard, he was still a mainstream Keynesian, then the school of leading liberal economists. But once he started examining the products of this demand-oriented approach - which favors Government intervention in the economy - he began the move to his conservative track, deciding that big social programs with good intentions had just ''ended up making things worse.'' **********Mr. Feldstein, who will take a two-year leave of absence from Harvard to head the council, had been sought for one of the two other slots on the council during the Ford Administration and was considered at the beginning of the Reagan Administration. The nomination has to be confirmed by the Senate. **********He now lives in Belmont, Mass., outside of Boston.

But, if anything, the reverse may be true: Too much talk, and too many meetings and memos are prime confusion creators. **********Much of the new electronic circuitry enabling us to communicate more quickly results not in better communication but in more. That simply adds to the confusion. Too much communication may be as bad as too little. **********People also don't realize that lack of communication may in fact be a form of communication; that if the boss doesn't tell you something it may be because he or she has nothing to say, or doesn't know what to say. The conventional wisdom is that if the administration doesn't communicate, it is because it doesn't want the rank and file to know. It is as likely to be the case that the administration may not want the staff to know how little it knows - not necessarily because the administration is stupid, but because it is waiting for more information. **********The staff may also not understand that in many circumstances doing nothing is best. Saying or doing nothing may be the administrative analogue of the medical commandment: ''Above all, do no harm.'' Nor is waiting to ''let nature take its course'' all that easy - because the administration is often pressed to do something. Managerial selfrestraint can save everyone time and misplaced energy. **********Instead, we seem to see a whole class of administrators emerging, who are so busy communicating that they have little time to do anything else, e.g., their jobs. Communication has become an end rather than a means. **********There is some truth in the aphorism that those who say don't know and those who know don't say, but even more truth in the idea that the clearest form of communication is what people do, not what they say. **********There is a herd instinct in management, as there is everywhere else. The virtue of communication has been so touted that the virtues of a lack of communication are forgotten. So much of what passes for information today is misinformation, disinformation, dated, ephemeral, biased, plain wrong - and to ''share'' (the current euphemism) all of it immediately may only widen the pool of ignorance. Such sharing may paralyze, panic, or cause serious mistakes to be made. More may be accomplished by a judicious silence, while the facts are checked, re-checked and assessed. **********The thoughtful administrator will share what is worth sharing.  Meetings should not be called for their own sake nor memos issued to show that ''we are communicating.'' The time wasted in pointless communication is clear in the widespread cynicism about meetings, conventions and the like. That doesn't mean these have no place.  Rather, formal business communication should meet the five-way test: 1. Is it necessary? 2. Do we have something solid to say? 3. Do we have somethin g concrete to ask? 4. Is it not known? 5. Does it need explanation? **********The profusion of electronic communication may lead to further confusion. The emphasis is on how little time it takes or how easy it is to communicate, yet the experienced executive knows how often he was grateful for not being able to communicate instantly either his feelings or his directions. There is something about composing our hot thoughts at leisure on cool paper that forces us to arrange, winnow and work through our ideas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/11/business/dow-severs-asahi-link.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 180, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Severs Asahi Link", "print_headline": "Dow Severs Asahi Link", "body_text": " **********The Dow Chemical Company and Japan's Asahi Chemical Industry Company are ending a 30-year joint venture to allow both companies to pursue their respective operations in Japan, Dow announced. **********Asahi will buy 50 percent of Dow's interest in Asahi-Dow Ltd. for about $185 million, obtaining sole control of seven Japanese plants, a Dow spokesman, A.A.

The former record was set on Nov. 1, 1978, when the Dow rose 35.34 points, a spurt that was set off then by news that the Federal Reserve had acted to strengthen a declining dollar. **********''The market acted today like a hungry dog grasping for a ragged bone: declining interest rates,'' commented Monte Gordon, research director of the Dreyfus Corporation. **********Comparatively Little Fanfare **********Volume on the New York Stock Exchange, where floor members greeted the heavy trading and increasing stock prices with comparatively little fanfare, rose to 92,860,000 shares, the second highest ever, from 55.4 million shares traded on Monday. **********The record turnover on the exchange of 92,880,000 shares was posted on Jan. 7, 1981, after Joseph Granville, a prominent stock forecaster, sent his clients a flash telegram advising them ''to sell everything.'' **********The exchange's tape, which records each stock trade, was only about 4 minutes late during most of the session, despite the near-record volume. **********Charles Comer, technical analyst of Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc., attributed this to the fact that most of the activity was from large institutional investors who trade in blocks of 10,000 shares rather than the 100-share trades common among small investors, and thus the tape had to handle fewer trades. A record 1,564 blocks changed hands yesterday on the Big Board, compared with 959 on Monday. Forecast by Kaufman **********The market opened the session higher and prices started to shoot up late in the morning after Henry Kaufman, the prominent Salomon Brothers economist known for his interest rate expertise, forecast that rates in long-term Government bonds would plunge to 9 percent or 10 percent in the next 12 months from the present 12.5 percent. Mr.  Kaufman's forecast reversed the view he had held for months, that interest rates would rise. **********Mr. Kaufman also said that he expects the Federal funds rate, the cost of short-term loans that banks make to each other, to trade between 6 percent and 7 percent within a year, against the current 10 percent. **********''Mr. Kaufman today did a double-take over the course of interest rates for the next 12 months and this triggered a wild bond rally today which was followed by the upsurge in stock prices,'' commented Kenneth S. Rolland, chief investment officer of the trust and investment division of the Chemical Bank. 'Fundamental Trends' **********However, Wayne Nordberg, chairman of the investment committee of Prescott, Ball & Turben, said ''it's unfortunate that investors find it necessary to rely so heavily on the judgment of one individual and seem unable to perceive for themselves fundamental trends that have been developing for many months in the capital markets.'' **********Mr. Rolland of Chemical Bank said, ''The rally should continue in such groups as utilities, banks and housing.'' The stock market in the last three sessions has soared 54 points, mainly because interest rates have been falling steeply since Thursday. When interest rates decline, many investors switch money to stocks from Treasury issues, savings certificates and other interest-bearing investments. Declining interest rates are also an indication that corporate profits will improve as companies reduce the cost of borrowing funds. **********Another bullish factor for the stock market yesterday was the report of a 33.7 percent jump in July housing starts, to an annual rate of 1.2 million units. It was the first time in more than a year that housing starts have risen above the 1 million rate. **********In the day's trading, the Dow was up 9.32 points at 10:30 A.M., then eased a bit before surging ahead after 1 P.M. when Mr.  Kaufman's remarks circulated around Wall Street. At 3 P.M., the index was up 22 points and in the last hour of trading it climbed 15.8 points. Blue Chips Biggest Gainers **********Price advances on the Big Board yesterday led stocks that declined in price by almost 10 to 1, with the blue chips the biggest gainers.  General Motors soared 4 1/4 points, to 45 3/8; International Business Machines added 3 1/8, to 66; American Telephone, 2 1/2, to 55 1/8; Procter & Gamble, 3 1/8, to 88; General Electric, 4 1/4, to 68 3/8; DuPont, 1 5/8, to 32 3/4, and American Brands, 1 7/8, to 40 1/8. **********Early this month, major market indicators other than the Dow had dropped to their lowest levels since the spring or summer of 1980.  Yesterday, however, they rebounded with a vengeance. The New York Stock Exchange composite index of approximately 1,500 issues rose 2.66, a daily record, to 62.41, and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index made its largest single advance in its 64-year history, climbing 4.95 points, to 109.04. Utilities Rise **********Utility stocks, which are sensitive to interest rates, dominated the active list yesterday. In addition to benefiting from lower interest rates, investors in utilities also retain certain tax breaks in the latest Congressional tax plan. Middle South Utilities was up 7/8, to 13 7/8, Consolidated Edison rose 3/4, to 19, and Northern Indiana Public Service gained 3/4, to 11 7/8. **********Cities Service, which rejected a $3.8 billion takeover bid from Occidental Petroleum on Monday, was halted from trading at 2:46 P.M.  when the stock was up 4 3/8, to 37 5/8. Occidental Petroleum rose 3/4, to 18 1/4. **********In the computer group, Hewlett-Packard climbed 3 1/2, to 32 3/8, after reporting that its profits in the quarter ended July 31 rose to 83 cents a share from 65 cents. **********J.C. Penney added 2 5/8, to 39 3/8, after reporting higher secondquarter profits.  Prices on the American Stock Exchange also rose, with the marketvalue index gaining 6.03, to 244.30.

STYLE", "print_headline": "ANNUAL MEETING, G.M. STYLE", "body_text": " **********Roger B. Smith, chairman and chief executive officer of the General Motors Corporation, once again played the reluctant host of the automobile industry's version of the old television game show ''Beat the Clock'' as he presided over the annual meeting of stockholders today. **********As he had last year, Mr. Smith limited questions and statements from shareholders to two minutes each, with a large illuminated clock ticking off the seconds. Anyone tempted to ramble on, or to talk about homes demolished for a new G.M. plant in the area of Detroit and Hamtramck known as ''Poletown,'' was likely to have his or her microphone turned off. **********This year, Mr. Smith's plan was to tighten up the meeting to as little as one hour by eliminating the traditional period for general questions and answers. **********The plan failed. The meeting went on for four hours, and Mr. Smith sat through complaints about ''X''-car transmissions, parts falling off Chevrolets, air bags, executive bonuses -and Poletown. **********Although annual meetings give individual stockholders their one chance a year to directly address top management, Mr. Smith and other corporate executives have grumbled that minor shareholders seeking publicity and groups pressing for social causes have made the sessions unruly, irrelevant and long. **********Thus, in G.M.'s annual report for 1981, the company announced that this year's meeting would be split into morning and afternoon sessions, with the morning meeting held only to satisfy legal requirements. ''At this statutory meeting, stockholder questions and comments will be limited to matters pertaining to the election of directors and to those management and stockholder proposals included in the agenda,'' the report said. 'Stockholder Forum' **********Public comment would be reserved for what the company termed a ''stockholder forum'' at its Technical Center in Warren, Mich., about 15 miles from G.M. headquarters here. As originally explained by Mr.  Smith, the company directors would be meeting at the same time, so none would be present at the forum. **********Mr. Smith said today that the split sessions were mainly an effort to save the corporation money by combining the stockholders meeting and monthly board meeting. G.M. directors are paid $500 for each meeting they attend, in addition to annual retainers of $15,000, plus $10,000 to $15,000 for service on board committees. **********However, G.M.'s announcement drew a flurry of complaints and the company did an about-face, adding two periods for general comment, one of which stretched the morning session to four hours. **********About 500 of the 675 stockholders then boarded buses for a free lunch at the Technical Center and the forum, which, despite earlier indications that no board member would be present, was conducted by F. James McDonald, president of G.M. Polite Questions on Cards **********As it turned out, that was the quiet session, lacking the activists present in the morning meeting and lasting only about an hour and a half. Polite questions were written out on cards for Mr. McDonald, who was flanked by lower-ranking executives. **********At the morning meeting and a subsequent news conference, Mr. Smith said that negotiations were continuing with Toyota on producing one of the Japanese company's cars in one of G.M.'s idled plants on the West Coast. He said it ''would not be unreasonable to expect a decision one way or the other by fall.'' Earlier negotiations on joint production between Toyota and the Ford Motor Company dragged on for months before the effort was dropped. **********Mr. Smith also had to contend with a flurry of questions about the company's plans to change the way it pays bonuses to its senior exectives. The new plan, disclosed on the same day the United Automobile Workers union had signed a new labor contract containing concessions for the first time at G.M., appears likely to produce executive bonuses at a lower level of profitability than the old plan. It promptly became the subject of intense negotiations between the company and the union. **********Mr. Smith said the company had agreed with the union to pay bonuses at the old level and not expand stock options for the life of the labor contract, which runs until September 1984. But he also said that executives could begin to accumulate credits under a new ''performance achievement plan'' without limitation. This latest plan, which is in addition to the bonus and stock option plans, provides for as much as $60 million a year to be paid to the top 500 executives of the company, if certain long-term goals are met. No Bonuses in Last 2 Years **********The G.M. proxy statement said payments are expected to begin in 1985 if the automobile business improves. No bonuses have been paid for the last two years. **********Perhaps reacting to recent moves by white-collar workers at G.M. to seek union representation, Mr. Smith said, ''We are not planning any additional across-the-board layoffs of salaried employees.'' More than 27,000 salaried workers have been dismissed over the past three years, he said. Unlike the past, the recent layoffs have been based on performance evaluations, rather than seniority, and some dismissed workers have complained the company has been trying to trim costs by laying off older, higher-paid employees. **********Mr. Smith said the company's reduced costs and the ''huge pent-up demand for motor vehicles that has been building out there for several years'' would restore the company to something resembling its past profitability. Last year, G.M. reported a profit of $333 million. In 1979, it earned $2.89 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/17/world/no-headline-174662.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 171, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********Around the World; Berlin Police Question 6 Palestinians on Blast **********WEST BERLIN, Jan. 16 (AP) - The West Berlin police detained but later freed six Palestinians after the bombing Friday night of a restaurant owned by an Israeli.

A lot of snow and a lot of oaks.'' **********Which just goes to show the value of a liberal arts education.  It is true that Mr. Giles does not get to see a lot of trees these days, because his home is on Madison Avenue and he has not been jogging in Central Park lately because of what he calls ''the press of business in a recessionary time.'' **********But he still harbors fond thoughts about trees, and those thoughts have now borne fruit in a $3 million, four-month network television advertising campaign for the life insurance and health insurance industries. It will appear on evening news programs on the three major networks tonight. **********''The first thing we wanted the advertising to do is to be visible,'' he said this week. ''More than anything else, we had to make sure the advertising was out there grabbing people and making them stop and think.'' **********Doing some heavy thinking, two or three teams working within the 20-member Giles group came up with tree-type notions, and so did Mr.  Giles himself, who had been doing his own independent thinking. And so the campaign features on-screen depictions of a symbolic, sturdy, sheltering, good-for-all-seasons tree. **********''It's our tree,'' Mr. Giles said proudly to a visitor to a windowless conference room at Grey's Third Avenue headquarters. ''The tree idea literally took root,'' he went on. ''It seemed to stand for what the life insurance and health insurance people are.'' **********Sitting across the conference table from him was John P. Little, a vice president at one of the two industry organizations that are jointly underwriting the campaign. Mr. Little's group is the American Council of Life Insurance, which boasts 550 member companies and 97 percent of the assets of all United States life insurance companies. **********''The attributes of a tree,'' Mr. Little said, ''equate with the attributes of the life insurance industry.'' Similar views concerning the health insurance industry were voiced by James R.L. Holdsworth, an advertising expert with the other co-client, the Health Insurance Association of America, which says it has 325 member organizations responsible for 85 percent of total private health insurance premiums in the country, not counting Blue Cross/Blue Shield. **********Once the tree symbol was picked, a specific kind of tree had to be settled on. The sequoia was discussed, and then discarded as being a specifically West Coast tree - and an ill-proportioned one at that. **********In due course, it was decided to depict what Mr. Giles called a ''good old solid oak.'' ''There was no philosophical reason to go to an oak,'' he confessed; it simply came to the fore in their discussions as ''the classic tree.'' **********Oak, Mr. Holdsworth said, ''has a protective quality.'' ''Permanent protection,'' Mr. Giles observed.  Then came the question of whether to show film of a real oak or to use an animated oak - that is, to put it crassly, a cartoon. As Mr.  Giles told it, ''We thought we could make the tree more magical'' by animation than by going the real-oak route. **********And Mr. Little said that using an oak drawn by an animator - in this case, Richard Williams - offered more flexibility, notably in showing the tree growing before the viewer's eyes. **********''A real tree doesn't grow'' so that the viewer can see it growing, Mr. Little said. ''It just sort of sits there.'' And so the commercials have as their logo what Grey calls ''an animated tree of life and health.'' It is not any individual species of oak, but a sort of generic oak - what Mr. Little called ''a Giles oak.'' **********For his part, Mr. Giles said: ''We thought of having the tree talk, but it's hard to take a talking tree too seriously. The tone of the commercials had to be serious and direct.'' **********Accordingly, the first of the commercials has a human offstage voice intoning: ''The life and health of the nation are rooted in the life and health of its people'' and similar sentiments while the Giles oak is seen sprouting, growing and enduring in fair weather and foul. And a Grey brochure about the campaign shows the oak in full greenery, over a headline that reads, ''A Growing Commitment to America's Life and Health.'' **********Why make the oak green? ''The answer is realism,'' Mr. Little said. ''I don't see many red trees or purple trees out there.'' And Mr. Giles said: ''Green is healthy; life is green.'' As he spoke, he leaned across the conference table, made of a gleaming, richly grained wood.  Oak wood, right?  ''Mahogany,'' Mr. Giles suggested.  ''Rosewood,'' Mr. Holdsworth countered, and that settled that.  The client is always right."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/04/world/around-the-world-seoul-holding-9-suspects-for-arson-at-us-center.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 89, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Seoul Holding 9 Suspects For Arson at U.S. Center", "print_headline": "Around the World; Seoul Holding 9 Suspects For Arson at U.S. Center", "body_text": " **********The police said today that they had arrested a total of nine South Korean suspects in connection with a fire set last month at a United States cultural center in Pusan in which a Korean student was killed. **********Two were seized today, the police said. **********The nine suspects, mostly university students from Pusan, include five women.

Haig Jr. said today that he had obtained President Hosni Mubarak's agreement for an intensified effort in coming months to achieve a breakthrough in the negotiations with Israel on Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. **********In a 90-minute meeting at Mr. Mubarak's office in Oruba Palace, Mr. Haig was reported to have said that the United States believed Egypt and Israel had spent enough time over the last 20 months inconclusively discussing the issues and that he was ready to give his attention to helping them accelerate their efforts for an agreement. **********Kamal Hassan Ali, Egypt's Foreign Minister, told reporters later, ''Our view is that we welcome the participation of Secretary Haig in the process because we feel that it will push forward the negotiations for the autonomy.'' Haig to Meet With Begin **********Mr. Haig flies to Israel on Thursday to confer with Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir on their reaction to his plans for pushing the negotiations forward. Assuming that the Israelis agree, Mr. Haig must then decide whether to devote a considerable part of his time in the near future to Middle East negotiations or whether he will appoint a special negotiator to do most of the work, with Mr. Haig giving instructions from Washington. **********Mr. Haig told reporters that he had received ''the very firm and clear commitment of President Mubarak to intensify our efforts in the period ahead to achieve progress on autonomy and to work in concert for broadening the peace process with a view toward a lasting, just peace in the region.'' **********He said he hoped ''to achieve a greater momentum with the results of a breakthrough in the period ahead.'' Accord on Principles Sought **********The Israelis and Egyptians have been negotiating to draw up a broadly worded declaration of principles that would outline the duties and responsibilities of a so-called self-governing authority that would be elected by the Palestinians living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Both areas have been occupied by Israel since the 1967 war. **********Israel and Egypt have been in fundamental disagreement since the negotiations began in May 1979. The chief obstacle arises from differing interpretations of the self-governing authority itself. **********The Egyptians believe that this body should have about 120 members and should have administrative, legislative and judicial authority for running the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Israelis, concerned that this might lead to more independence than they are willing to concede, want the body about 15 members who would have only administrative responsibility. **********The Israelis are scheduled to complete their withdrawal from Sinai on April 25 and the Americans believe that in the three months before then there is an opportunity for more active negotiations. **********The Egyptians and Israelis also disagree on future security arrangements for the Palestinian are a, with the Egyptians wanting theIsraeli milit ary and police presence and duties to be very limited.  There is also a major difference over whether East Jerusalem should be included a s part of the West Bank and its Arab residents permittedto vote for t he ruling authority. **********The Egyptians contend that since East Jerusalem, like the West Bank, was controlled by Jordan before 1967, it should be treated in the same way as the rest of the West Bank. The Israelis, having annexed East Jerusalem, have refused to include it in the negotiations and have said that Arab residents should not be allowed to vote in the West Bank negotiations. **********Following Mr. Haig's meeting with Mr. Mubarak, American and Egyptian officials met to review in detail the Egyptian position on the issues so that Mr. Haig would have a clear idea of where Cairo stood. The Americans will do the same with the Israelis, officials accompanying Mr. Haig said. There is no intention on this trip, they said, to introduce any new American plan, although American suggestions for compromises have already been submitted. **********Both Mr. Haig and Egyptian officials said there was no intention to set a deadline or target date for concluding the negotiations, and Egyptian officials went out of their way to say they felt no particular sense of urgency. **********The United States would like to show progress in the autonomy negotiations to demonstrate to Saudi Arabia and Jordan that it takes seriously the possibility of carrying out the Camp David accords, despite Saudi and Jordanian skepticism. ---- Israeli Rules Out 'Concessions' **********JERUSALEM, Jan. 13 (Reuters) -Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today that Israel was not prepared to make any ''further concessions'' in negotiations on autonomy for Palestinians in the occupied areas. **********He also said at a meeting of Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Security Committee that as far as Israel was concerned the question of East Jerusalem was closed. In 1980, Israel declared that all Jerusalem, including the Arab eastern sector captured in the 1967 Middle East war, was its capital. **********Mr. Shamir rejected a suggestion by former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the opposition Labor Party that the Government allow Arab residents of East Jerusalem to vote in elections for an administrative council in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********''Such suggestions cannot influence the Government, but they do impair Israel's image abroad,'' the Foreign Minister said.  ''There is no room for further concessions,'' he declared. ''As far as we are concerned, the matter of East Jerusalem is closed, and we have advised Egypt and the United States to this effect.'' **********Mr. Shamir also told the committee that the security situation in southern Lebanon would be high on the agenda in talks with Mr Haig.  He said Israel would stress that the situation along its border with Lebanon was ''unbearable.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/23/business/socal-tar-sands.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Socal Tar Sands", "print_headline": "Socal Tar Sands", "body_text": " **********The Standard Oil Company of California has agreed in principle to develop commercial oil production from the GNC Energy Corporation's 2,000 acres of tar sands holdings near Sunnyside, Utah, the companies said.

And, as often happens on the first day of a new procedure on Wall Street, mechanical problems arose, and the connection was broken a number of times. **********''It's a nonevent day as far as trading goes,'' said Pat Marchese, a floor broker for E.F. Hutton & Company. ''It had no effect on the volume of business.'' **********A Lack of Drama **********''It was not as dramatic as most people would think,'' said Hugh Quigley, managing director of the over-the-counter department of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., a leader in the effort to stimulate off-the-board trading in listed stocks. ''We did not have as many transactions as we anticipated.'' **********The limited program links the computers of the New York and American stock exchanges and five smaller exchanges with the computers of hundreds of broker-dealers in the over-the-counter market. The tie allows the electronic pooling of price and size information on 30 stocks - the most active of a group of 200 that can be traded both over-the-counter and listed on exchanges. Twenty-three of those stocks are traded on the Big Board, which fought an unsuccessful battle against creating this linkage without rules restricting ''internalization'' - the matching of buy and sell orders in brokers' offices. **********Under the new system, a customer's order does not go to an exchange floor as was routine. Now it may first be filled within the customer's own brokerage house, or be exposed, simultaneously, to exchanges and other market makers for execution at the best price.  Only if the exchange shows the best price will the order be routed there and filled either by a specialist or through the outcry auction system. Praise for Trading Floor **********On the Big Board floor yesterday, prices declined sharply and volume was 45.6 million shares, down from the average daily volume for the first four months of this year of 52.4 million. There seemed to be little talk therefore about the new tie, and when asked about it, brokers insisted that the viability of their auction market, rather than the possibility of losing volume and revenue, was the major reason for their reluctance to embrace the experiment. **********''Certainly there's a degree of self-interest on the part of the specialists,'' said George H. Rose, floor partner of Lazard Freres & Company, about the opposition to the linkage. ''But there is concern about the public getting the best price.'' **********''I'm not the usual veteran who says that everything that's new is wrong,'' said George C. Dinsmore of Stokes, Hoyt & Company, a specialist firm. ''But I don't think you can play in a ballpark where one team has three strikes and one team has two. We don't mind another competitor, as long as the rules and regulations are the same.'' **********''If the market gets fragmented and order flow gets short-stopped, the structure of the market will be irreparably harmed,'' added Donald Stone, a partner of Lasker, Stone & Stern, another specialist concern, and vice chairman of the Big Board. ''This is a step backwards, not forwards, in building a national market system.'' **********Mr. Quigley of Merrill Lynch sees things differently.  ''This was an extraordinary market day, down sharply on light volume, and not many people were concerned with this event,'' he said. ''But as time goes by, and people begin to utilize this linkage, our penetration should increase.

A top American official, summing up prospects at a background briefing this evening, said the chances were only 50-50 that the conference, which may run through Saturday, would be a success. **********Added Peter Rees, Britain's Minister of Trade, ''The fog of war still covers the field.'' Failure Could Add Tension **********A conference failure could heighten world economic tensions by causing countries to flout international rules more than in the past and to turn more to nationalistic and protectionist policies. **********The United States has threatened to dump surplus grains and dairy products on world markets if the Europeans refuse to phase out their export subsidies, which American farmers say have depressed world farm prices and hurt their earnings. The Europeans pay $8 billion a year to subsidize their farm exports. **********Sir Roy Denman, the Common Market's chief trade negotiator, said that farm export subsidies were ''a fact of life'' and that the United States, too, had the right to subsidize exports. He said the only international rule governing such subsidies was that they may not lead to the acquisition of more than an fair share of the market. **********Other officials said that if the United States dumped its surplus farm products to punish the Common Market, countries outside the 10-nation bloc, such as Australia and New Zealand, would be hurt more than Common Market members. **********Added Robin W. Gray, Deputy Secretary in the British Department of Trade: ''Quite a lot of people in the world would get cheap food.'' An American official, who asked not to be identified, said the United States was considering selling surplus butter and grain at below-market prices to countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and even the Soviet Union. **********The United States is having trouble selling as much grain as it wants to the Russians. Under pressure from France, the European Economic Community has been negotiating a big cut-rate grain sale to the Russians. American sales of cheap food to the Soviet Union could touch off a major political row in Washington. One-Year World Supply of Butter **********Richard E. Lyng, Deputy Secretary of Agriculture and a member of the American delegation here, estimated current stocks of butter in the United States at 220,000 metric tons, a year's supply for the world. He put stocks of all types of grain after domestic consumption this year at 160 million tons. **********Many European officials here believe the United States will begin dumping surpluses in world markets, regardless of what occurs at this meeting. But the hard line against the American farm demand reflects other factors as well. **********For years, the United States has protested against the common agricultural policy, which many in Europe consider to be the cement of the Common Market. Agriculture is one of the few areas where the community is integrated. The United States protested because the common policy guaranteed high prices for farmers and provided for subsidized exports to reduce surpluses. **********Common Market officials believe that the fresh American demands against Common market subsidies are part of the long-range campaign of the United States to dismantle the common policy. This is why, they say, they have to stand firm. Support for the French **********France's Trade Minister, Michel Jobert, has been especially adamant, but at an unusual Common Market council meeting here tonight, all the ministers supported Mr. Jobert, according to community sources. The council meets again Friday to consider any fresh compromises. **********The American demand for a phasing-out of subsidies had been characterized earlier by American officials as ''the bottom line'' for any successful conference. An American official said tonight: ''Other important issues should be separable from agriculture,'' a statement that was seen by some analysts as the beginning of an American retreat on the issue. **********One American official suggested a compromise under which the conference would agree merely to study the agricultural issue, without any commitment to end subsidies. But, according to this official, in an agreement between the United States and the Common Market, the Europeans would pledge to accept certain disciplines over their subsidies. ''Willing to Discuss Troubles'' **********Asked about such a formula tonight, Mr. Denman, the Common Market negotiator who is also the Common Market's Ambassador to Washington, said: ''We're reasonable people and always willing to discuss other people's troubles.'' **********Little progress was cited elsewhere, although a hint from Brazil that it might consider a study of relaxing trade in services within the GATT framework aroused considerable interest. **********Developing countries, led by Brazil and India, have resisted such a study on grounds that any liberalization is precluded by their national development programs and their critical debt situation. **********The United States - joined by Canada, Japan and the European community - is pressing for a services study, hoping it would lead to negotiations to bring about more liberal trade in services by the end of the decade."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/12/business/medcom-merger.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Medcom Merger", "print_headline": "Medcom Merger", "body_text": " **********Medcom Inc., a producer of information programs for medical personnel, and Medtrain Inc., a medical-care products concern, announced signing a letter of intent under which Medcom will be merged into a Medtrain subsidiary in a transaction valued at $35 a share.

About 400 holders of national flood insurance have filed claims so far, and that number is expected to climb to a thousand, according to Brendon Bailey, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Federal Government has offered national flood insurance since the early 1970's; most private insurance agencies do not offer flood insurance. **********Packager Would Close Down **********Packaging Plus could go out of business because of $7 million in damages. ''Absolutely everthing in our business was ruined,'' said William Holodak, president of the promotional packaging company, whose annual revenues run less than $10 million. ''We are hoping the Federal Government will get involved with grants or loans,'' he added. ''If not, it is the end for us.''

''The Mad River sure lived up to its name,'' said Robert Zelinger, a vice president at the Chamber of Commerce. **********The Waterbury Buckle Company lost some of its land in the flooding, adding up to about $50,000 in damages, said Allan Frew, executive vice president. **********TRW Inc.'s Geometric Tool plant in New Haven faces ''easily $1 million in damages,'' said Thomas Vaccaro, the plant manager, who watched the plant basement and some outer buildings fill with water.  Most of the factory workers will be laid off temporarily, he said.  The flood destroyed precision cutting tools waiting to be shipped out, along with blueprints, production orders and electrical wiring. **********Mayor William Rado of Naugatuck said that the Uniroyal Inc.'s footwear warehouse ''is digging boots out of the water'' and that the Peter Paul Cadbury Company was pumping out its basement. **********As the plants bailed out and calculated their losses, electrical engineers and pumping specialists were doing a brisk business. ''You couldn't believe it,'' said Gene Nadeau, project manager at Northeast Testing, which dries and restructures transformers and switch gears.  ''We are working double shifts, but there are only so many of us.'' **********The Geometric Tool plant has been pressed by a number of eager flood specialists. ''We had a fellow pull up in front of the plant with a moving van; he wanted to sell us boots,'' Mr. Vaccaro said.  ''Eleven dollars a pair, so we bought some.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/15/business/company-news-standard-metals-officers-backed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Standard Metals Officers Backed", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Standard Metals Officers Backed", "body_text": " **********The Standard Metals Corporation announced that more than 62 percent of its shareholders had voted in favor of retaining the current management, after a long proxy fight waged by a group of dissidents led by the Oklahoma Publishing Company. **********Boris Gresov, chairman of Standard Metals, told shareholders at the annual meeting that the company would show a loss for the first quarter, ended March 31.

On July 30, Gulf's board had said it would ''vigorously contest'' the F.T.C.'s decision to delay the merger and it made a new proposal to the agency last Tuesday. But the F.T.C.  turned down that proposal Wednesday and called for Gulf to divest a major refinery. **********An F.T.C. official, who asked not to be identified, said that Gulf's recent statements asserting that the agency had blocked the bid were possibly an attempt to fend off a breach of contract suit from Cities Service. Suit Against Gulf **********''Gulf has got to say we're the cause because there's probably a clause in the merger agreement that allows them to get off when there is government interference,'' the official said. He emphasized, however, that he had no actual knowledge that such a clause existed.  Earlier today, Cities Service, charging breach of contract, filed suit against Gulf, asking for $3 billion in damages. **********F.T.C. officials also stressed that their objections to Gulf's proposals that the merger would diminish competition in retail markets should not be seen as a shift in the agency's antitrust policies. ''There have been no formal changes whatsoever, certainly not since the recent merger guidelines came out,'' said Walter Vandaele, economic adviser to the director of the Bureau of Competition. ''We were surprised as other people were that Gulf pulled back. We were willing to negotiate any terms and said we would sit down at any time.'' **********The F.T.C. voted unanimously on July 29 to bar Gulf from proceeding with its plan, saying the effect of the action would be to limit competition in several areas of petroleum marketing. A hearing on a prelimimary injunction was scheduled in Federal District Court here on Aug. 16, at which time the court was to decide whether to allow the merger. **********The key issue apparently blocking the F.T.C.'s approval of the merger plan was the agency's insistence that either Cities Service sell its refinery in Lake Charles, La., or that Gulf divest itself of one of its refineries to lessen concentration in the gasoline market. The F.T.C. also was concerned that Gulf would gain a major stake in the Colonial Pipeline, a major conduit for petroleum products from the Gulf of Mexico to the New York area. **********''Gulf said that the sale or divestiture of a refinery was nonnegotiable,'' said an F.T.C. official. ''We responded that there was no issue that was not negotiable.'' **********In assessing why Gulf decided to drop its merger bid, most F.T.C.  officials said that they were surprised by the action. Officials said repeatedly that if Gulf felt strongly that the agency's position on the antitrust issue was wrong, the best forum for dealing with their differences would have been in court."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/30/business/texaco-canada-ltd-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TEXACO CANADA LTD reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "TEXACO CANADA LTD reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/19/business/src-laboratories-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SRC LABORATORIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "SRC LABORATORIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/25/business/advertising-lord-geller-wins-insurance-account.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 52, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lord, Geller Wins Insurance Account", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Lord, Geller Wins Insurance Account", "body_text": " **********Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein has been named the agency for the Life Insurance Company of Virginia.

They would be competing primarily against 14,000 small commercial banks. **********The benefactors are expected to be small businesses that, until now, have been totally dependent on their local banks for credit.  Now, with thrift institutions allowed to make business loans, borrowing options could increase for many small companies and prices could decline. **********''There is a lot of room to compete,'' said Allan G. Bortel, first vice president for research at Shearson/American Express in San Francisco. ''If small banks are charging their business borrowers one or two percentage points above prime, the thrifts could charge less and still make money.'' **********But many bankers fear that the result will be that both the thrift institutions and the banks will lose. Many analysts have been predicting that the nation already is overbanked and that, even before the latest measure, market forces would cause many banks to go out of business. Now, instead of 14,000 or so institutions lending to small, local companies, the number could rise to 18,000 or 19,000. **********''All of a sudden we have 4,000 new commercial banks on the scene,'' said Llewellyn Jenkins, president of the American Bankers Association and vice chairman of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. Opposition From Banks **********For this reason, although most banks are pleased with the provision in the bill that allows them to offer higher rates to attract deposits back from money-market mutual funds, many are disturbed by the measure, calling it a ''sweetheart bill'' for the thrift institutions. **********''My judgment is that this is not such a great thing,'' Mr. Jenkins said. ''This is a way the thrifts might be able to help themselves in the long run, but they can't do it overnight. They could get into a lot of trouble.'' **********It remains unclear how many savings and loan associations will begin making business loans in the near future. Even some thrift executives are not sure. **********''I don't know if we will or not,'' said Thadis R. Seifert, executive vice president of the Southern Missouri Savings and Loan Association in Poplar Bluff, a $122 million-asset institution. **********Mr. Seifert said that, until about four years ago, Southern Missouri had been making commercial loans that were secured by real estate, which is allowed by Missouri law. But Federal regulators ''were too nit-picky'' about these loans, so Southern Missouri's board decided the business was not worth the effort. **********Others are more certain, however. ''More will take advantage of the new powers than many people expect,'' predicted Mr. Bortel of Shearson/ American Express. **********''Commercial checking and commercial lending will bring us low-cost funds and give us the ability to make loans even when high interest rates shut down the mortgage market,'' said Roy G. Green, president of the Fidelity Federal Savings and Loan Association in Jacksonville, Fla., who is also chairman of the United States League of Savings Association, the trade group of the savings and loan industry. **********Mr. Green predicted that Fidelity, which has assets of $280 million, would start slowly.

Disappointment With Moscow **********The Syrians were also hard pressed because of what was seen here as a bitterly disappointing Soviet reaction to the Israeli invasion. It is believed that Damascus expected the Soviet Union would quickly make up for the Syrian losses in planes and missiles. But the only new equipment arrived here early Friday - a few hours before the cease-fire - in only six transport planes, according to diplomatic sources. **********Unlike Japan, France and Britain, which publicly denounced the invasion of Lebanon and called for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces, Moscow issued only a relatively mild public statement through Tass, the official press agency. **********''The Japanese threatened to take sanctions against the Israelis.  No such threat was made by the Soviets,'' a Syrian said. ''We knew the Soviets would not use their whip against Israel in our defense but they could at least have waved it.'' Trip to Moscow Put Off **********President Assad had intended to travel to Moscow early this summer to obtain a firm commitment of support, but the trip was delayed at Soviet request, according to Syrians. The Soviet Ambassador here has been summoned at least three times, the first time on the day of the invasion, by Foreign Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam. **********For the Syrians, what was at stake throughout this week was the security of their country, much more than any desire to help the Palestinians or to protect Lebanese civilians, Western diplomats say. **********The vital national interests of the Syrians include a continuation of the country's military and political presence in Lebanon, a country that Syrian officials often describe as ''the lung through which Syria breathes.'' **********Secondly, the Syrians wanted to keep the Israeli Army away from the strategic Beirut-Damascus highway and out of the Bekaa Valley, a potential Israeli invasion route into Syria. **********Although Syrian officials deny it, there are indications that on the first days of the Israeli invasion the Syrians took at face value Israel's assurances that their only objective was to drive the Palestinians back so they could not reach Israel with shells and rockets. Syrians at First Shunned Combat **********The Syrians would not have endangered their own vital security interests to prevent the Israelis from achieving this. Syrian forces did not intervene in the first stage of the invasion, and most Western diplomats here believe that they would have stayed out of the fighting altogether if the Israelis had not attacked them. After the Israelis moved into Syrian-held areas, the Government here declared that the fighting had been ''imposed'' on it, an expression used by all Syrian spokesmen and since then. **********But even then, for at least two days, the fighting was like shadowboxing. Clashes were confined to artillery exchanges and demonstrative sorties by the air force. Only after the Israelis threatened the Bekaa Valley and the Beirut-Damascus highway - and the missile sites and access road to Syria - did the fighting became savage. **********On Wednesday,the Syrians committed more than 200 planes and lost about two dozen, according to their own reports. Reinforcements were rushed to the force in Lebanon. **********Still, throughout that fighting the Syrians seemed certain that the Israelis would not attack them through the Golan Heights from Israel. Once the missiles in the Bekaa Valley had proven so vulnerable, this assumption no longer seemed valid and the Syrians did not want to put it to the test, diplomats say. Syria Guards Its Own Interests **********The Syrians' emphasis on their own territorial security has been a long feature of Syrian policy toward Israel and the Palestinians.  Despite its hard-line position toward Israel, since the war of 1967 Syria has not permitted Palestinian guerrillas to operate against Israel from Syrian territory. **********Syrian-Palestinian relations in Lebanon have been swaying back and forth between close association and open military confrontation.  When the Palestinians challenged Syrian control over Lebanon during the 1975-76 civil war there, the Syrian Army turned on them. It drove the Palestinians from controlling positions east of Beirut - along the same highway that was at stake in this week's fighting -but permitted them to take up positions in the south of the country toward the Israeli border. **********But the diplomats also feel that by taking on the Israeli Army despite their troubled relations with the Palestinians, the Syrians have been able to enhance their role in the Arab world as the only Arab power able to challenge the Israelis militarily."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/15/business/campanelli-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-july-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 60, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CAMPANELLI INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "print_headline": "CAMPANELLI INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/03/world/around-the-world-philippine-police-search-for-missing-athlete.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Philippine Police Search For Missing Athlete", "print_headline": "Around the World; Philippine Police Search For Missing Athlete", "body_text": " **********The Philippine police reported today that they were intensifying their search for a prominent athlete said by his family to have secretly married a daughter of President Ferdinand E.

'' But these things are subject to interpretation,'' he said, ''and w e want to be sure that the present Government, face-toface, understands and agrees with the policies that have been followed so f ar.'' CARE Expects No Difficulty **********Dr. Johnston said he assumed ''there's going to be absolutely no difficulty,'' but wanted to be sure.  Mr. Mitten, the executive director of Church World Services, has been visiting Poland with representatives of Danchurchaid, the aid organization of the Danish Ecumenical Council. Church World Services distributes medicines, hospital equipment, blankets, heavy winter clothing and some food through the Polish Ecumenical Council. . **********Late yesterday officials in New York had not heard from Mr. Mitten, who was believed to be in Copenhagen.  Larry Hollon, an aide, said the purpose of Mr. Mitten's visit was threefold: to study the ''logistics'' of the situation, to talk to Polish church officials to ''determine what they see the needs to be,'' and to ''simply express the continuing support and solidarity and to tell them that we continue to be concerned about the needs there.'' **********Catholic Relief Services, which distributes food staples and clothing through churches in Poland, increased shipments last July and has been continuing them despite the crackdown. Bishop Edwin B.  Broderick, the agency's director, said distribution was closely monitored through a system that required signed receipts from recipients."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/27/business/bank-building-equipment-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-july-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANK BUILDING & EQUIPMENT CORP reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "print_headline": "BANK BUILDING & EQUIPMENT CORP reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/20/world/turkey-says-it-has-arrested-51-leftists-in-ankara-raids.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 148, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turkey Says It Has Arrested 51 Leftists in Ankara Raids", "print_headline": "Turkey Says It Has Arrested 51 Leftists in Ankara Raids", "body_text": " **********Military authorities today annnounced the arrest of 51 leftists and said that about 7,660 suspected terrorists were at large, some in self-exile in Europe. **********The 51 reported seized in raids throughout Ankara were members of the underground Revolutionary Path and Revolutionary Left organizations, which were blamed by the Government for most of the left-wing violence that occurred before the military coup in September 1980. **********Security agents confiscated 14 handguns when they made the arrests, a statement said.

Israeli officials say his unconditional release is the last major demand that must be met before Israel agrees to the Palestinian evacuation. **********Israel also demands the return of the bodies of nine soldiers killed in Lebanon, but the freedom of Mr. Ahiaz is of prime concern.  His captivity has provoked sporadic controversy because of attempts by two prominent Israelis to visit him. **********Israeli officials say the talks on a Palestinian withdrawal do not involve the release of two pilots shot down during the war and being held by the Syrians. That, the officials say, would be an Israeli demand in future talks on the withdrawal of Syrian and Israeli forces from Lebanon. Israeli military officials say that they are holding 7,400 Palestinian guerrillas captured during the war, but that the disposition of these prisoners will not be determined until after the evacuation of west Beirut. Israeli Pilot Sent Two Letters **********Little is publicly known about the captured pilot. The military spokesman here would say only that Mr. Ahiaz was born in 1946, has a wife and two children and flew a Skyhawk fighter-bomber. The spokesman declined to disclose the pilot's rank or say whether he was a regular or reserve officer. **********But his wife, Yael, and his father-in-law, Aharon Sakharov, discussed the pilot's situation briefly today by telephone from their homes in Herzliya. **********''I don't think anything right now,'' said Mrs. Ahiaz, with apparent nervousness in her voice. ''Let him first come home.'' Her father, Mr. Sakharov, who is in the banking and insurance business, said Mrs. Ahiaz was ''managing just like any other mother in Israel while her husband is in the army.'' He said the older child, Ari, 3 years old, ''understands more or less'' about his father's captivity. The other child, Itai, is one year old. **********Mr. Sakharov said the family had received two letters from the prisoner through the Red Cross, but he declined to disclose the contents. He also said he doubted that the Red Cross had been able to deliver one of the packages the family had sent the pilot two weeks ago, although a package sent about a month ago did apparently reach him. Photographed and Interviewed **********Since he was captured, the pilot has been seen twice in photographs that were distributed by United Press International. In an interview with U.P.I. on June 28, he said that he was being well cared for and that the Palestinians had saved his life, which had been threatened by farmers when he landed by parachute after his plane was hit. The pilot, who was accompanied to the interview by two guards, was quoted as having said that he hoped the Israelis would not invade west Beirut. **********The only Israeli to visit the prisoner was Uri Avneri, a leftist former member of Parliament. After a visit July 3, he said Mr. Ahiaz was in relatively good spirits and had not been seriously injured when he was shot down. **********An attempted visit by Abie Nathan, the self-styled peace advocate, aroused controversy in Israel. Mr. Nathan said he met with P.L.O.  officials in west Beirut on July 7 and asked for the release of Mr.  Ahiaz. The Palestinians refused, he reported, but said that Mrs.  Ahiaz and her children would be permitted a visit. Mrs. Ahiaz declined the offer. The Minister of Tourism, Avraham Sharir, has urged Attorney General Yitzhak Zamir to take measures to prevent Israelis from visiting P.L.O. officials in time of war."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/19/business/l-the-labor-department-replies-110342.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 394, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPLIES", "print_headline": "THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPLIES", "body_text": " **********To the Business Editor: William Winpisinger seems to hold the view that worker health and safety can only be measured in terms of inspections, citations and fines, and that employers must be bullied by big government into providing decent workplaces for their employees. **********We reject that notion.

That isn't necessary and, for an agency with positions for 1,200 inspectors covering three million worksites, it isn't possible. **********We must be discriminating in the allocation of our resources. That is why in fiscal year 1982 we doubled inspections at the most hazardous worksites and have excused many employers with established safety and health records from scheduled inspections, although we still respond to complaints and investigate accidents. **********We certainly have not exempted 75 percent of all manufacturing firms from OSHA inspections, as Mr. Winpisinger charged, however.  We have pioneered a self-inspection program. We also encourage firms with strong safety and health programs to participate in our voluntary protection program.

They are encouraged to provide that service when asked, but we call them compliance officers because we expect employers to comply with health and safety regulations.

Several Israeli soldiers also reportedly broke into the offices of the Institute for Palestine Studies, a private establishment, but removed only a few items. **********Dr. Sabry Jiryes, director of the P.L.O. research center, said the troops took away its entire library of 25,000 volumes in Arabic, English and Hebrew, a printing press, microfilms, manuscripts and archives. He said they smashed filing cabinets, desks and other furniture and made off with telephones, heating equipment and electric fans. **********He also said they spent a week in the seven-story building, which is in a residential quarter of the mainly Moslem West Beirut, and left the place ''a mess.'' **********''More seriously,'' he added, ''they have plundered our Palestinian cultural heritage.'' Rubber Stamps Stolen **********Reporting on the break-in at the Institute for Palestine Studies, officials of that organization said several Israeli soldiers entered last week, looked around and took rubber stamps and a few publications but did not loot the place. **********The institute, a nonprofit research organization, was founded in 1963 by intellectuals from a number of Arab countries. It is run by a board of 40 trustees from Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. **********According to Dr. Jiryes, the documents taken by the Israelis from the P.L.O. research center had been collected since it was established in 1965. **********The building is littered with broken furniture and fixtures, twisted metal shelves and a blown-up strong box. ''They used explosives to pry the safe open,'' Dr. Jiryes said. **********He estimated the material losses at $1.5 million. ''But the papers we have lost are invaluable and possibly irreplaceable,'' he said.  According to the center's brochures, these were the world's largest collections of manuscripts on the question of Palestine. P.L.O. Sign Was Altered **********The Israeli troops' positions in West Beirut have been taken over by a force comprising United States Marines, French paratroopers and Italian soldiers, as well as units of the regular Lebanese Army. The area where the center is situated was patrolled today by French forces. **********The Israelis had also occupied the P.L.O.'s main office on the Corniche Mazraa, at the southernmost edge of downtown West Beirut.  Before they left, they removed the word ''Palestine'' from a sign carrying the P.L.O.'s name that was mounted outside the office. **********A Palestinian source asserted that the Israeli invasion was intended ''to obliterate all memory of Palestine, the country we have left behind.'' **********Several thousand Palestinians came to Lebanon as refugees in 1948 after the state of Israel was founded in Palestine. Their number in Lebanon eventually grew to about half a million. **********Beirut became not only an operation base for the P.L.O. fighters but also a place where the Palestinians tried to revive their cultural heritage. In addition, it became a center for diffusing Palestinian informaton and collecting archives on the Palestinian problem. Institute Has Reopened **********The Institute for Palestine Studies, where such archives are kept, had been closed since the Israelis entered West Beirut on Sept. 14, but it reopened Wednesday. **********A Syrian, Dr. Constantine K. Zurayk, a professor emeritus at the American University of Beirut, is chairman of the board at the institute. A Palestinian, Dr. Walid Khalidi, currently a visiting professor at Harvard University, is secretary. **********Aside from its documentation of events bearing on the Palestine question, the institute publishes the Journal of Palestine Studies, a quarterly magazine, in English and French. Its publications are done in cooperation with the University of Kuwait. **********Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are among the main providers of funds for the organziation.

But she said further hostilities could still be avoided if Argentine forces were withdrawn. **********''Everything, but just everything, has been turned down'' by the Argentines, she said in a television interview. Asked if the battle for Stanley could be avoided, she said, ''There is just a possibility now, but I don't rate it very highly.'' **********Reinforcements Brought In **********Tonight, Mrs. Thatcher told reporters: ''We shall repossess those islands. There will be, I am afraid, a very considerable battle at Port Stanley, very considerable.'' **********Reinforcements and supplies, including more Harrier jets, are being brought in by land, sea and air for a final push. With British forces just seven miles from the center of Stanley, artillery ferried into place on sites above the capital by helicopter has begun pounding Argentine positions. **********''We have got very close in and we are beginning to apply pressure to the main enemy positions throughout Stanley,'' Maj. Gen. Jeremy Moore, the ground commander, said in a British Broadcasting Corporation radio interview today. ''Clearly, I'm going to build up that pressure.'' Among the close-in positions captured by the British was Two Sisters Ridge overlooking Moody Brook Camp, the former base of British marines stationed on the islands. 7,000 Argentines in Stanley **********Military sources here said today that the Argentine strength in Stanley was officially estimated at 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were believed to be airmen and sailors whose land fighting ability was questionable. **********The British forces, the sources said, are equal in size or larger.  This means that the 3,000 men of the Fifth Brigade, shipped to the South Atlantic aboard the liner Queen Elizabeth 2, have almost certainly joined the 5,000 troops who landed around Port San Carlos 12 days ago. **********The rapid advance toward Stanley -partly on foot and partly by helicopter - and the softening up of the Argentine defenders were vividly described today in dispatches from the battlefront.  Correspondents told of troops slogging 40 miles through marshes and rivers and up hills while carrying equipment, of sporadic but intense clashes with Argentine outposts and patrols, and of helicopters crossing East Falkland Island to the forward positions within 50 feet of the ground to avoid attack. **********''Men travel in fighting order, their packs coming up later in the rear,'' reported Robert McGowan of The Daily Express in a pooled dispatch. ''Spending freezing hours in the open, in falling snow, without cover or sleeping bags, has become almost routine in the headlong drive to the capital.'' **********British military sources cautioned today that several pockets of Argentine troops were clustered around Stanley and that the British forces might choose to take them on one at a time. They said it would be up to the commanding officers to decide whether to allow all or part of the Argentine garrison an opportunity to surrender before an attack. Reagan Phone Call Reported **********On the diplomatic front, President Reagan was reported to have telephoned Mrs. Thatcher to urge a postponement of a final assault ''while the victory at Goose Green sinks in,'' and Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. was said to have been lobbying Foreign Secretary Francis Pym. But British officials said operational plans were now in the hands of commanders with the troops. **********''I am not seeking to humiliate anyone at all,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in her the television interview. ''I am just asking that the invader returns his troops to the mainland.'' She said the attack could be avoided only if Argentina agreed to begin withdrawing now and completed the pullout in 10 to 14 days. **********The questioner noted that Mrs. Thatcher had been urged by Mr. Haig to be ''magnanimous'' in victory, and asked: ''What does 'magnanimous' mean to you?'' She replied, ''It is not a word that I use in connection with the Falklands.'' To ''hand something'' to the Argentines, ''to an invader, and an aggressor, and a military dictator, that would not be magnanimity,'' she said. ''It would be treachery or betrayal of our own people.'' **********Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defense said today that two more Harriers were lost in raids on the Stanley area ''in the last few days.'' The planes, damaged by ground fire, were forced to ditch on their return to the task force at sea and the pilots were recovered safely, a spokesman said. **********The ministry reported that additional Harriers had been flown directly from Britain to the Falklands, using inflight refueling, but did not say how many. The 17-hour, 8,000-mile journey set a record for the Royal Air Force. Harriers are now known to be operating from land positions on the islands, which means that an almost unlimited number could be accommodated in the South Atlantic. **********The ministry also said today that ''an accident involving explosives yesterday at Goose Green has caused some casualties among our troops'' and among the Argentine prisoners there. Reports from the scene suggested that an ammunition supply had blown up, killing several Argentines. One report suggested that the ammunition had been booby-trapped by the Argentines, but another said the ammunition was defective."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/06/business/north-carolina-natural-gas-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 37, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NORTH CAROLINA NATURAL GAS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "NORTH CAROLINA NATURAL GAS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/21/business/beverly-enterprises-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BEVERLY ENTERPRISES reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "BEVERLY ENTERPRISES reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/24/business/litton-net-falls-31.7.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 46, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Litton Net Falls 31.7%", "print_headline": "Litton Net Falls 31.7%", "body_text": " **********Litton Industries, a diversified manufacturer of high-technology equipment based in Beverly Hills, Calif., said yesterday that net income in its first fiscal quarter ended Oct. 31 declined 31.7 percent, to $52.9 million, or $1.26 a share, from $77.4 million, or $1.86 a share, a year earlier."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/21/business/urs-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-july-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "URS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "print_headline": "URS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/14/business/timex-sets-entry-into-growing-field-of-health-products.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Faludi", "pub_date": "1982-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 502, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TIMEX SETS ENTRY INTO GROWING FIELD OF HEALTH PRODUCTS", "print_headline": "TIMEX SETS ENTRY INTO GROWING FIELD OF HEALTH PRODUCTS", "body_text": " **********The Timex Corporation, the world's largest watchmaker, yesterday announced its entry into the expanding home health-care field with a line of health monitoring instruments that it will sell through drugstores. **********The company said it would start marketing the first products - a blood-pressure monitor, a thermometer and a bathroom scale - in California drugstores in October and would move to national distribution by April 1983. The products all use digital electronics developed earlier for Timex clocks and watches. **********''We are very comfortable with this product line because it is an extension of our work with electronics and sensors,'' said Norman Zatsky, chief scientist at Timex, which is based in Waterbury, Conn. **********The move is the private company's second major attempt this year to branch into fast-growing markets in high technology. Three months ago, Timex announced its plan to produce a personal computer for about $100, the least expensive microcomputer so far. Drugstore Distribution Network **********In entering the competitive high-technology market, Timex's strategy has been to hold back until it can mass-produce the products cheaply. It then distributes a low-priced item through the many discount outlets and drugstores that sell its inexpensive watches.  ''Existing drugstore distribution is a key to our business strategy,'' said Bruce Dodson, director of operations for Timex's new Medical Products Corporation. **********But this time, analysts are questioning whether Timex will be able to parlay its household name and distribution channels into a lucrative business. ''What works in watches does not carry over to health care,'' observed David Talbot, a health-care industry analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert. Just because Timex sells watches in drugstores ''does not mean that they have any leverage with pharmacists,'' he added. **********The products, although competitive, are not the cheapest on the market, Mr. Zatsky said.

Although relations have grown closer in recent years, it is the complaints of the Indonesian Government that are being voiced most clearly. **********Diplomatically, relations have improved in one respect since last spring, when Morton Abramowitz was rejected by Indonesia as the United States Ambassador. **********Having taken the extraordinary step of rejecting Mr. Abramowitz - and been accused of doing so because he is Jewish and outspoken as well - the Indonesian Government is now said to be prepared to take anyone offered. Suharto to Visit U.S. in October **********President Suharto is expected to be warmly received when he visits Washington next October, his first such trip since 1975. Moreover, a recent visit to Washington by the Indonesian Minister of Research and Technology, Bachruddin Jusuf Habibie, who has been seeking advanced American weapons, reportedly went well. **********While Jakarta has been seeking more weapons and while it believes that the United States is right to want to match the Soviet Navy's buildup in the Pacific, some Indonesians are worried about the focus on military matters. **********''The Reagan Administration is so military,'' said Jusuf Wanandi, director of Jakarta's Center for Strategic and International Studies. Dr. Wanandi, who is highly regarded by diplomats for his knowledge of government and military thinking, said the American military focus was out of step with Indonesia's top priority, the economy. Need for Economic Aid Stressed **********''The countries around here think of their main threat as domestic,'' he said.  He said Indonesia needed economic help more than ever because world prices for its oil, tin, rubber and other exports have been so depressed that the country's reserves and development plans are swiftly being cut back. **********Yet the United States, he said, has withdrawn support for international commodity agreements that might have kept prices higher, has lost interest in aiding international lending institutions and has declined to sign the Law of the Sea Treaty. **********''It is boggling our mind,'' Dr. Wanandi said. ''Economic help is more important for our stability than a few more tanks.'' Reflecting Indonesian ambivalence about the rearming of Japan, which occupied Indonesia in World War II, Dr, Wanandi asked where it might end if the United States kept urging Japan to bear more of a military burden in Asia. Concern About Japan Voiced **********''What, really, do you want the Japanese to do?'' he said. ''If they really decide to arm, if they set their minds to it, if they can work out some consensus in the next five years, they could become a nuclear power. They can do anything they want, you know.'' **********American policy toward China causes further grumbling, an attitude that in the military's case goes back to 1965, when Peking was accused of encouraging the Indonesian Communist Party, which was powerful at the time, to stage a coup. The party was later liquidated. **********Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusum@aatmadja said in a recent interview: ''I wish that the United States more actively supported our position, especially on the Cambodian question, rather than the Chinese position.'' **********He was alluding to China's emphasis on opposing the Vietnamese militarily and making their occupation of Cambodia as expensive as possible. Indonesia For Aid to Vietnam **********Though a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, an anti-Communist grouping, Indonesia favors economic aid for Vietnam and feels that its fear of China is well founded. **********On June 10, the Deputy Secretary of State, Walter J. Stoessel Jr., told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that United States relations with China ''are seen by our Asian friends as a positive influence on the future direction of China's foreign policy and a stimulus to regional cooperation.'' **********When asked about that testimony, Dr. Wanandi said, ''One of the confusing things is what your China policy is.'' Indonesia, which broke diplomatic relations with China in 1967, but has revived trade relations since then, has its own problems with its China policy. **********In an interview with Newsweek last month, the Foreign Minister said China was the most dangerous influence in Southeast Asia. Two weeks ago, the Minister of Information, Lieut. Gen. Ali Murtopo, said in a seminar that the greatest threat in Southeast Asia was the Soviet Union. **********The Foreign Minister later explained that perhaps he had been thinking of the past, and his colleague of the future. But what struck some Indonesians as most significant about the mix-up was its possible relevance to Indonesia's stance in the East-West alignment. **********''According to us,'' said the newspaper Merdeka, ''to cry anti-Soviet and anti-People's Republic of China and, at the same time, to sing the United States' song will lead the people to interpret our foreign policy wrongly.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/11/business/thomson-net-declines-2.8.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Thomson Net Declines 2.8%", "print_headline": "Thomson Net Declines 2.8%", "body_text": " **********Thomson Newspapers Ltd., citing troubles at its flagship newspaper, The Globe and Mail of Toronto, today reported a 2.8 percent drop in second-quarter earnings. **********The newspaper group also announced the acquisition of two more dailies in the United States, The Daily Mining Gazette in Houghton, Mich., and The Griffin (Ga.) **********Daily News, raising its total holdings to 139 daily and weekly newspapers in Canada and the United States. **********Thomson said it earned $24.3 million (Canadian), or 49 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared with a profit of $25 million, or 50 cents a share, in the same period of 1981.

''If we are not going to make spending cuts, we won't raise taxes. I don't plan to deliver the revenue side until the spending cuts are in place.'' **********Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, responded that the two sides were very close to agreement on spending cuts. But he also noted that the prospect of making the kinds of cuts the Senate seemed to be looking for would be ''very painful for the House.'' **********The tax bill calls for spending cuts of $17 billion besides new tax revenues totaling $98.9 billion in the next three fiscal years. Earnings Limitation at Issue **********Four provisions that appear to have caused the present logjam involve the earnings an individual could have and still be eligible for aid to families with dependent children. All four provisions were proposed by the Ways and Means Committee and would cost the Government an estimated $325 million over three years, according to figures before the conference committee. **********The conferees from the House also had indicated their willingness to accept a compromise that would cost only $246 million.  But Senator Russell B. Long, Democrat of Louisiana, charged that these provisions would really cost three times as much as the estimates said, or roughly $1 billion, and would allow people to make as much as $12,000 to $18,000 and still receive welfare. ''The whole purpose of this conference is to deal with welfare and to get the genie back inside the bottle,'' Senator Long said. **********Earlier in the day the committee had moved ahead on a host of provisions that would pare Medicare costs to the Federal Government. Conable Seeks Compromise **********The committee, however, continued to postpone action on the most controversial aspects of the bill, including those that would raise taxes on business. But Representative Barber B. Conable Jr., the upstate New York Republican who is the ranking minority member of the House Ways and Means Committee, started trying to fashion a new compromise on proposals to limit tax advantages in leasing. **********Separately, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan said at a news conference that the Administration would ''go all out to make sure'' that the bill passes. A key strategy being used by the Administration is to give the impression that the bill deals primarily with closing existing tax loopholes and not with enacting new taxes. **********Meeting off and on through the afternoon, the committee agreed on nearly a dozen proposals that would reduce the cost of Medicare to the Government by $8.6 billion over three years. Medicare Steps Agreed Upon **********The committee did agree to back off from two provisions that would have raised costs directly to Medicare beneficiaries. One would have increased certain deductibles, and the other would have required copayments by patients for home health care services. **********Another area of agreement today would require employers to offer older employees - age 65 to 69 - the same health benefits given to younger employees, and these would take precedence over Medicare.  The measure is expected to save the Government $1.1 billion over three years, but it would apply only to companies with more than 20 employees. **********The committee did not take up major business provisions, including reductions in accelerated depreciation and in safe harbor leasing.  But Representative Conable began floating a new proposal on leasing that would penalize leveraged leases to retain benefits for some safe harbor leases. Sales of Tax Credits Allowed **********Safe harbor leasing permits companies to sell to other companies tax credits they cannot use themselves. This became possible under last year's tax act. Certain kinds of leases, known as leveraged leases, had been permitted even before that. **********Tax experts said the Conable proposal would appear to create problems for some major companies, including the Xerox Corporation.  A staff member for the minority counsel's office of the House Ways and Means Committee said the proposal, which would raise the same $8 billion in tax revenues as the Senate proposal on safe-harbor leasing, had been distributed to conference members. **********''The Senate bill would virtually wipe out safe-harbor leasing,'' the staff member said. ''Our proposal would take a little out of safe-harbor leasing and a little out of leverage leasing. We have received overwhelmingly favorable reaction from the companies that are involved in safe-harbor leasing, including airlines, steel companies, paper companies and builders of oil refineries.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/12/business/monogram-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MONOGRAM INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "MONOGRAM INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/20/world/europe-relieved-by-lebanon-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 805, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EUROPE RELIEVED BY LEBANON PACT", "print_headline": "EUROPE RELIEVED BY LEBANON PACT", "body_text": " **********Western Europe reacted quietly but with an evident sense of relief today to the news that the Israeli Cabinet had agreed to the plan, negotiated by the United States, for the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization from Beirut. **********There were no official comments from senior Western European leaders, many of whom are on vacation. But officials of several foreign ministries said they welcomed the prospect that the plan, worked out by the special American envoy, Philip C. Habib, would restore a measure of peace to the area. **********In London, a ranking official paid tribute to what he described as Mr. Habib's ''almost unbelieveable perseverance,'' and expressed the hope that nothing would happen to upset the agreement. But he voiced doubts that it would lead to a long-term settlement of the Palestinian problem ''because of the continued intransigence of the Israelis.'' **********Much will depend, specialists here and in other Western European capitals said, upon the way in which P.L.O. attitudes evolve.  Almost no support for Israel has been expressed in Western Europe in recent weeks, even by those normally sympathetic to its problems. A 'Terrible Moral' Price **********A diplomat in Madrid said this month that, in his view, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel had ''paid a terrible moral and political price for what will prove to be ephemeral gains'' - a view that appeared to be quite widespread. **********Reaction to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon has been hostile here from the start, even among many prominent British Jews.  Although Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who is on vacation in Switzerland, has made no public comment, a junior minister at the Foreign Office, Douglas Hurd, said last week that ''thousands of innocent civilians, Lebanese and Palestinian, have been killed or wounded in Lebanon in pursuit of objectives which are very far from clear and are probably not going to be realized.'' **********Mr. Hurd called upon the United States to reassess its entire approach to the Palestinian problem if it wanted to give the Israelis any real security. **********Other Western European politicians have made the same point. The vast majority were highly critical of President Reagan's policies until he finally spoke bluntly to Mr. Begin in a successful effort to force an accommodation. 'The Savagery of Its Attack' **********In an editorial this morning, The Times of London suggested that the United States would remain less sympathetic to Israel for some time and might evolve a more evenhanded policy. It said that Israel, ''by the savagery of its attack,'' had ''come perilously near putting itself on the same level as those who seek the destruction of Israel.'' **********French officials, eager to defuse the tensions resulting from anti-Semitic attacks in Paris, made no immediate comment. But the country's newspapers paid tribute to Mr. Habib and President Reagan for bringing about the agreement. **********Figaro called the envoy ''the tireless negotiator.'' Sud-Ouest, a large provincial paper published in Bordeaux, said that although Washington at first gave ''an impression of complicity with Jerusalem,'' Mr. Reagan's telephone call on Aug. 12 ''forced the Israeli Cabinet to submit'' to the Habib plan. **********The comments represented a considerable shift because most papers previously supported the P.L.O., and several had dismissed Mr. Habib as a ''messenger boy.'' More Trouble Ahead? **********Nonetheless, the French press predicted more trouble ahead. Le Monde said the ''specter of partition'' of Lebanon haunted many minds, and Le Matin, which follows a left-of-center line, suggested the next battle ground might be in the north of the country. **********In Bonn, a ranking West German source said: ''The Government is pleased about any advance toward peace in the area and the end to the suffering of the people there, and hopes that the Habib plan will help to re-establish the independence, sovereignty and safety of the Republic of Lebanon as well as advance the discussions toward a just solution for the Palestinian problem.'' **********Chancellor Helmut Schmidt has voiced sharp criticism of Israeli policy, telling the newspaper Die Welt that ''people are being killed indiscriminately - women and men who have nothing to do with the war, who bear no responsibility for this war.'' Some newspapers used the word ''vernichtungskrieg,'' which means ''war of extermination,'' to describe the Israeli thrust. **********Prominent public figures have been more outspokenly anti-Israeli than at any time in decades. The publisher of Die Zeit, Countess Marion Donhoff, compared the Israeli cutoff of water and food for west Beirut to Nazi actions against the Warsaw ghetto in World War II. Johannes Rau, the deputy chairman of Mr. Schmidt's Social Democratic Party, said on the West German radio last Sunday that Mr.  Begin's policies were ''inconceivable and incomprehensible.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/18/business/credit-markets-decline-in-rates-is-expected-to-continue.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 766, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DECLINE IN RATES IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; DECLINE IN RATES IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE", "body_text": " **********With the Federal Reserve all but advertising an easier credit policy, interest rates are expected to resume their downward trend this week despite the sudden and unnerving disappearance of buyers last Thursday and Friday. Money market specialists became even more convinced of this Friday, after the Fed reported a $6.9 billion jump in the nation's basic money supply for the week ended Oct.6. **********Despite the central bank's strenuous efforts to de-emphasize this M-1 figure, which consists of currency in the hands of the public and funds in all types of checking accounts in banks and savings institutions, expectations that the number would be much higher tended to drive many institutional buyers away late in the week. So did the sharp price swings earlier in the week, dealers said. **********Downward Trend Seen **********Now that the market's immediate fears of a retightening of credit have been soothed, analysts believe that interest rates should have a downside bias at least until after the Nov.2 election, or perhaps until after the equally crucial Christmas shopping season. **********''Regardless of how the remarks of Fed officials are interpreted, we believe that its current easing is only a temporary departure caused by the weakening economy,'' said Philip Braverman, vice president of the Chase Manhattan Bank and senior economist of its bond department. ''At this time, the Fed's No.1 problem is not inflation, but the state of the economy, and it must act accordingly.'' **********How temporary will the Fed's new easier credit tack be? ''Probably no longer than early January,'' Mr. Braverman said.  By then, he continued, the market should be responding to a number of factors that could force the Fed to once again tighten the credit spigot. These factors include the growing belief that the recent easing of consumer credit rates will be translated into a strong Christmas retail season, as well as the release of consumers' pent-up demand for new cars and housing. Shift Seen After January **********After Jan.1, prices for natural gas and other basic consumer needs are expected to rise sharply, which would also raise the specter of renewed inflation, all of which would then provoke the Fed into resuming the monetary course it embarked on three years ago, or at least so goes the argument. **********Mr. Braverman said that despite the expected pick-up in consumer demand, the economic recovery was still a long way off. ''It certainly won't be visible in the first quarter of 1983,'' he added. **********Meanwhile, the money market will be struggling with pent-up demand from business borrowers as well as the ballooning credit needs of the Government in the short term. Corporate borrowers are seizing upon the lower interest rates to convert short-term debt into long term, rather than using their borrowings for expansion and upgrading of existing plant, Mr. Braverman noted. Inventory Problems for Dealers **********Another reason for last week's erratic money market, which could be repeated this week, is the financial situation faced by the dealers who serve as both distributors and marketers of fixed-income securities for the Government and private business. **********''Nonbank dealer finance rates are about the same as the overnight interbank, or Federal funds rate, 9.25 percent,'' Mr. Braverman said Friday. ''The dealers expected much lower financing costs and now find their inventories, heavily weighted with issues selling at deep discounts, most uncomfortable.'' **********This is especially true of Government securities dealers who inadvertently took on large amounts of deep-discounted Government coupon issues, mostly in swap deals, at a time when retail interest declined. Several dealers said this was also true of ''premium issues,'' such as the 14 percent Treasury bonds of 2011, which sold as high as 29 points over face during the week and dropped to 126 1/2 by late Friday. Each point is equal to $10 on each $1,000 of face value. **********Dealers stocking Treasury bills, which closed the week with yields of roughly 7.5 percent, compared with the carrying cost of 9.25 percent on average, were also unhappy. But the low short-term rates did help the long end of the market and strengthened the positive yield curve (in which long-term rates are higher than those on shorter instruments, which is a normal yield structure). **********But, here again, if short-term credit becomes cheaper, there will be less incentive for corporate borrowers to stretch out their debt by shifting to the longer maturities, Mr. Braverman pointed out.

The amendment has prompted American allies to charge that the United States, which is itself a leading arms exporter, is unwilling to make military purchases abroad. **********''The allies are really upset over this,'' a State Department official said. ''I can't overestimate how much they're upset about it.'' **********Lack of cooperation in the arms field has been a perennial problem in the Atlantic alliance. Metals Have Special Alloys **********Specialty metals are metals with special alloys such as cobalt, titanium and zirconium. They are found in virtually all items of military equipment, including aircraft, missiles, ships and ammunition. **********The restriction on the import of items containing the metals, according to a Defense Department memorandum, jeopardizes the procurement of equipment or components bought from American allies by the Pentagon or by its contractors. In 1980, according to the memorandum, such trade amounted to $400 million. **********Although the Pentagon estimates that the military equipment bought by the United States from foreign nations contained less than 1 percent of the specialty metals, the entire military trade package would be placed in jeopardy, officials said. **********Imports of the metals were first restricted in 1973, but Congress, expressing its support for standardization and interchangeability of equipment within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, gave the Pentagon authority to waive the restriction in 1977. Defense Department officials are now considering strategies to restore the waiver, which was eliminated in the Defense Appropriations Bill at the urging of the specialty metals industry last December. The legislation was submitted by Senator James Abdnor, Republican of South Dakota, and was accepted by the House in conference. **********Pentagon officials are equally concerned that the principle of arms cooperation and standardization in NATO and among other allies may have already been harmed. 'Every Embassy' Said to Protest **********A Pentagon official said ''every embassy in NATO'' had written protest letters about the trade restriction. ''They're expressing their concern that we are going back on an agreement,'' the official said. ''We're concerned that it will kill standardization. They'll get annoyed with us, turn inward and develop their own equipment that won't be adaptable to ours.'' **********The United States sells about six times as much in military systems to its allies as it imports, and Pentagon officials are concerned that the specialty metals clause may cause the allies to view ''our efforts at alliance cooperation as nothing more than an effort to sell U.S. arms by reimposing barriers to cooperation.'' **********Negotiations are now under way for the sale of weapons systems such as the F-18 fighter and the M-1 tank to United States allies. ''It is estimated these sales could amount to several billion dollars, providing tens of thousands of jobs,'' the Pentagon memorandum said.  ''These jobs could be placed in jeopardy.'' **********Wolfgang Kandel, first secretary for defense, research and engineering in the West German Embassy here, said West German officials hoped that the waiver would be reinstated. ''We are very concerned,'' he said. ''All the defense cooperation we have built up would not be possible. It is supposed to be a two-way street.'' **********Pentagon officials fear that the clause may also prompt the renegotiation of a number of foreign contracts for American arms.  The sale of F-18's to Australia, for instance, carries an American commitment to buy Australian arms components. But, a Pentagon official said, unless the Australians buy the specialty metals for those components in the United States, ''it's going to be real difficult to keep our commitment.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/20/business/utl-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UTL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "UTL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/08/world/around-the-world-reagan-brezhnev-talks-termed-highly-possible.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Reagan-Brezhnev Talks Termed 'Highly Possible'", "print_headline": "Around the World; Reagan-Brezhnev Talks Termed 'Highly Possible'", "body_text": " **********A meeting between President Reagan and Leonid I.

Toyota would have been at 71.9 percent with 719,000 units. **********There is a dispute between the bill's supporters and opponents over whether Honda, which has just spent $250 million to build Accords in Marysville, Ohio, and Volkswagen, which has had an assembly plant making Rabbits at New Stanton, Pa., since the mid-1970's, would come under the standards. **********Spokesmen for both the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company testified against the bill, known as the Fair Practices in Automotive Products Act, arguing that it was not the right way to solve the problems of the industry. Both companies had joined forces with the U.A.W. in its bid two years ago to get quota restraints imposed on Japan. The Reagan Administration in the spring of 1981 negotiated a three-year voluntary restraint package with the Japanese. Jurisdictional Disputes **********The leadership's handling of the bill has created jurisdictional tensions in the House. Sam M. Gibbons, Democrat of Florida and chairman of the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, is a fervent opponent of the bill. He complained today that even though this was a trade bill, his committee got only eight days to to consider it, while the Energy and Commerce Committee kept it for nine months. That committee's chairman, John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, is one of the bill's most vocal supporters. **********Mr. Gibbons, whose committee never even voted on the bill, said there had been a ''violation of Ways and Means jurisdiction.'' He likened the bill in the rules panel's deliberations today to the Smoot Hawley tariff of 1930 that touched off the protectionism of the 1930's. That bill, which began as a narrow tariff measure, ultimately encompassed virtually all imports as legislators sought to protect their industrial constituencies. Studies Question Benefits **********Studies by the Congressional Budget Office have found that the bill would actually cause jobs to be lost because of foreign retaliation and would lead to higher automobile prices for American consumers. **********By 1990, said the office's director, Alice M. Rivlin, some 38,000 auto jobs would be created, while 104,000 jobs would be eliminated because of restrictions placed on nonauto exports. **********Barber B. Conable Jr., Republican of upstate New York and ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, warned that passage of the bill would ''render meaningless'' what was agreed on in the ministerial document at a recent trade conference in Geneva at which 88 countries agreed to ''refrain from taking or maintaining'' protectionist measures. **********Representative Dingell countered: ''This is not protectionist legislation. We are merely doing what every other nation does. The issue is the survival of American industry. If we're not careful we'll have to put on a loin cloth like Mahatma Ghandi because there will be nothing left.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/05/business/briefs-231642.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 319, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** American Home Products Corp. said the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act applicable to its intended acquisition of 14,166,666 shares of Brunswick Corp. had expired with no request from the Justice Department or the F.T.C. for additional information. *********** Beckman Instruments Inc. said its shareholders had approved the acquisition of the company by Smithkline. *********** Bic Pen Corp. said its Mexican subsidiary would lose about $1.5 million as a result of the devaluation of the peso. *********** Bradford National Corp. said it had begun negotiating with an unidentified party the sale of its health services division. *********** First Tennessee National Corp. said it and Harpeth National Bank in Franklin had agreed to the acquisition of Harpeth by First Tennessee. *********** Gabe Holdings said it holds about 16.2 percent of Cadence Industries common stock, or 223,700 common shares. *********** Halco Industries, Maurice H.

James came out fighting. The chairman of Dresser Industries, maker of the equipment, Mr. James publicly branded the President's move \"sheer idiocy.\" **********This time around, as Dresser battles to avoid being penalized by the Reagan Administration for its French subsidiary's sales to the Soviet gas pipeline project, Mr. James has left the public discussion to Dresser's senior vice president, Edward R. Luter, and to the company's lawyers in Washington, at least so far. **********Is Mr. James reticent because he was an early and avid supporter of the Reagan-Bush ticket (George Bush is a former Dresser employee) and because President Reagan named him to his Export Council in 1979? **********Wall Street followers of Dresser, as well as business associates and friends of Mr. James, say that would be completely out of character. They expressed the view, confirmed by Mr. Luter, that his silence reflects a desire to speak with one voice in the trade dispute rather than a reluctance to take a personal stand against President Reagan. Believes Reagan Is Misled **********Further, Mr. Luter explains, Mr. James believes that President Reagan has been misled by advisers in adopting the policies that now threaten Dresser. **********''Jack James is the type of man who would support you as long he thinks you are right - then he would feel free to speak out,'' said J. Rawles Fulgham, a Dresser director who is president of the Interfirst Corporation, a Dallas bank holding company. **********''It's just a case of recognizing that Ed Luter does well handling the media on controversial issues,'' said John Lawrence, Mr. James's predecessor as chairman and chief executive at Dresser. **********Silent on the specifics or not, Mr. James is clearly behind Dresser's decision not to order its French subsidiary to stop shipment of compressors to the pipeline project. **********''We feel like we are on the horns of a dilemma,'' Mr. James said in a telephone interview Wednesday from Dresser's headquarters in Dallas. ''We have to try to be good citizens in every country in which we operate. The laws of the United States are not the laws of the whole world.'' **********A conservative, finance-oriented executive, the 64-year-old Mr.  James is described on Wall Street as a man who ''watches everything down to the last penny,'' one analyst said. 'Made Dresser Blossom' **********''There's no question in my mind that he is a far better manager than I ever was,'' added Mr. Lawrence, who now runs a consulting company bearing his name in Dallas. ''I put some things in place, but he made Dresser blossom.'' **********Mr. James became president and chief executive in 1970, and chairman in 1976. Dresser's sales of oilfield equipment, energy transportation and processing machinery, industrial equipment, refractories, and mining machinery jumped from just over $900 million in 1972 to more than $4.61 billion in 1981. Net income in that period rose to $292 million from $38.9 million. **********A native of Pennsylvania, whose family owned a small coal mine, Mr. James served as an Army intelligence officer in Europe during World War II. His Army service and the death of his brother Delbert in the Normandy invasion contributed to what friends describe as ''Jack's super-patriotism.'' **********After the war, Mr. James graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, joined the Corning Glass Works as a financial executive and moved to Dresser in 1957. Fought U.S. Inquiries **********The patriotism that friends allude to has not stopped Mr. James from frequent jousts with the United States Government. Under his leadership, Dresser attracted attention for its litigious and vocal resistance to Federal investigations of its questionable payments overseas, which Dresser's own investigation in 1976 put at $313,500. **********Later, there was the battle with the Carter Administration, during which Mr. James argued that a ban on the export of equipment ''would hand American export business to foreign competitors on a silver platter.'' **********Nor has Mr. James backed away from bitter business disputes. He joined Willard F. Rockwell Jr.'s slate of candidates for the board of the SCM Corporation in Mr. Rockwell's long, but unsuccessful effort to topple SCM's management. **********Mr. James has been amply rewarded for his accomplishments at Dresser. Although his base salary last year was $377,651, additional benefits, deferred compensation, and realized stock gains lifted his compensation from Dresser to $2,640,223, according to a report in Forbes magazine. That ranked him ninth among the nation's top executives at publicly held companies. The year before, the New York-based management consulting firm of Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby said that his total compensation package of about $1.27 million was the highest reported. **********The compensation does not result in high living. Mr. James lives quietly with his wife, Helen, in Dallas, his daughter having married and moved away. Pressed to name a hobby, he will say he enjoys reading history. Acquaintances say that running Dresser is both his work and his favorite hobby. **********''He's a very hard worker - sometimes it seems like he does nothing else,'' Mr. Lawrence said.  Mr. James laughs when asked about such descriptions, noting that he has one year left until his retirement. ''I have cut back on my travel to about 75,000 miles a year from 100,000 miles,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/25/business/plan-to-buy-advent-ended.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 159, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Plan to Buy Advent Ended", "print_headline": "Plan to Buy Advent Ended", "body_text": " **********The Kloss Video Corporation said it had scrapped plans to acquire the Advent Corporation, a maker of stereo speakers and large-screen televisions that has been operating under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code since last year. **********Herbert Kloss, president of Kloss Video, said that ''we made a proposal to Advent but it wasn't possible to do it under the conditions we had set.'' **********He declined to specify what the proposal or the conditions were. **********Advent was founded by Mr. Kloss in 1967 to produce large-screen projection televisions.

Casey, Director of Central Intelligence, is that the pipeline would not only make Western Europe dependent on Moscow for vital energy supplies but would also earn the Soviet Union about $10 billion a year in hard currency that could be spent on Western technology with military applications. **********Mr. Weinberger is understood to believe that a Polish default would not only impose further economic burdens on the Soviet Union but would delay the pipeline. The Administration concedes, however, that West European banks and governments are shying away from this approach. **********Secretary of State Haig, in testimony Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, defended the Administration's decision to pay the Polish debts. He said the President's action ''will require the Soviet Union to make the money good.'' He added, ''Had we called default, they would have been relieved of that burden'' because Poland could have been considered bankrupt. **********Mr. Weinberger's arguments with the Western Europeans is that the West should not help the Soviet Union develop its oil and natural gas resources, especially when Western intelligence estimates anticipate Soviet shortages in the years ahead. **********In the Reagan Adminstration's internal debates over Poland, Mr.  Weinberger and some of his Pentagon aides have taken the most pessimistic view of developments. Recently, for example, Mr.  Weinberger commented that he felt ''the Polish Government is run by a Russian general in a Polish uniform.'' **********Covert Operations in Poland? **********Although he is known to favor most policies that would make it harder for the Soviet Union to support the military regime in Poland, Mr. Weinberger has not pushed for covert operations in support of Polish resistance to martial law.

If there's a real rebellion the nation could wake up Wednesday with Democrats in control not only of the House, as today, but of the Senate too. That would be good news for the party, but analysts fear its implications for economic policy. **********It could yield a Congress of fractious Democrats fighting among themselves for key committee posts and fighting with the Republican White House over policy. The result, analysts say, would be legislative paralysis. **********If voters are somewhat less hostile and merely increase the Democratic majority in the House, there is likely to be more progress on economic matters, says Barry Bosworth, a senior economist at the Brookings Institution. He would expect action then on Social Security and defense spending. **********In addition, he says that the next Congress is likely to be more aggressive than its predecessor in urging the Federal Reserve Board to pursue a generally more stimulative monetary policy. Given the depths of the recession, he thinks such action would be warranted. Eroding Employment **********The battle against double-digit unemployment is likely to last longer than many dared to think even a few months ago. The Labor Department report on employment for October, due Friday, is almost certain to show further erosion, analysts say. The reason: continued weakness throughout the economy. Roughly 300,000 workers were laid off last month, says Donald Ratajczak, director of Georgia State University's economic forecasting project. That should push the jobless rate to around 10.4 percent. And, since unemployment is a lagging indicator, and the economy has not yet shown clear signs of touching bottom, further rises are likely. On a monthly basis, unemployment could peak at around 10.8 percent late this year or early in 1983, Mr. Ratajczak says - but an 11 percent rate is not out of the question. Moreover, a sluggish recovery, low inflation and high productivity gains make a rapid reduction in the jobless rate unlikely. Judging Inventories **********For corporate managers, few problems this year have proven more intractable than determining proper inventory levels. After cutting sharply into stocks during the first half, many businesses geared up production in anticipation of a rise in demand during the second half. But the economy has not come roaring back, and inventories again are riding at unacceptably high levels. **********Due in large part to the pile-up of unsold autos, total manufacturing inventories probably rose slightly during the third quarter, says M. Kathyrn Eickoff, executive vice president at Townsend-Greenspan & Company. **********Consumer demand remains weak, and industrial production seems to have fallen further in October, Miss Eickoff says. As a result, she says, stocks are likely to be drawn down again by an inflationadjusted $6 billion during the fourth quarter, putting a drag on G.N.P. Moreover, after so many mistakes, companies are likely to be even more cautious about adding to stocks well into 1983, Miss Eickoff says. Soft Landing for the Dollar **********Despite falling interest rates and rising trade deficits, foreign exchange traders have continued to bid up the value of the dollar.  After posting impressive gains in 1981, on a trade-weighted basis the dollar has risen another 14.5 percent since the beginning of the year, according to economists at Morgan Guaranty Trust. **********Most experts do not expect the rise to continue. Against currencies like the German mark and the Japanese yen the dollar is at least 20 percent overvalued, they say. But they think it's unlikely the dollar will give back all of its gains over the next 12 to 18 months. **********A selloff is coming, argues David Rolley, an economist at Chase Econometrics, but the dollar is likely to remain a safe and quality currency, two characteristics that have been key to its recent rise.  In spite of what is likely to be a record 1983 trade deficit, these qualities should help limit the dollar's fall, he says. **********The drop is likely to be most pronounced vis-a-vis the mark and the yen, says Charles Raymond, president of Predex, a currency forecasting firm. By the end of 1983, the dollar should decline 8 percent against the mark and 13 percent against the yen, he says. **********Kenneth N.

(Page 23.) **********With negotiations continuing among Lebanese, Israelis and representatives of the United States, France and Italy, the three nations contributing troops to the new Beirut peacekeeping force, it now appeared likely that the Italian and American troops would not land before Tuesday. This is because of the Yom Kippur holiday on Monday. French Units Confined to Embassy **********Some French troops have already landed in Beirut, but have been confined thus far to the French Embassy, the ambassador's residence and a French cultural center. **********Officials said that the marines would not land on Sunday, as scheduled, because Philip C. Habib, the American special envoy, meeting in Israel with Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and other officials, had been unable to work out a satisfactory arrangement. **********A State Department official said the United States wanted ''no intermingling'' between the Marines and Israeli troops.  The main problem is that the 800 marines are supposed to be deployed at Beirut International Airport, which is situated south of the city and has been under Israeli control. The Americans want the Israelis to leave before the marines arrive, and there has been no agreement on a timetable. Peace Force to Total 3,000 **********The three-nation force, expected to total about 3,000 troops, is being sent to Beirut to help the Lebanese Government establish control, although the troops are not supposed to engage in combat.  Their presence is also meant to put pressure on the Israelis to hasten their withdrawal from the Beirut area and eventually from all of Lebanon. **********The Israelis, who had previously moved into the predominantly Christian eastern sector of Beirut, entered the city's largely Moslem western sector on Sept. 15 after the assassination of President-elect Bashir Gemayel. They said they were going into West Beirut to prevent further bloodshed, but the massacre of Palestinians last week by the Christian militia, an Israeli ally, led to fresh demands from the United States for the Israeli withdrawal. **********One official said he believed the matter of the Marine deployment would be resolved without too much difficulty, but he acknowledged that the negotiations had become protracted. **********While the Israelis have announced a schedule for withdrawing from West Beirut and turning over their positions to the Lebanese Army.  President Reagan is seeking an Israeli pullback from the entire Beirut area, including the airport. Israel has not responded directly to that demand, although it consented to the deployment of the threenation peacekeeping force. The Israelis have wanted to keep a presence in Beirut as the three-nation force was deployed, and to retain rights to continue to remove captured Palestinian munitions and to send patrols in and out of Beirut. **********The new Lebanese Government of President Amin Gemayel aswell as the United States, France and Italy oppose a continued Israeli presence.  And Mr. Gemayel has rejected Israel's request for the right to patrol freely. **********Throughout the past week, the State Department has sought to leave the impression that the arrival of the peacekeeping forces would occur without difficulty, and that, even if some Israelis remained in West Beirut, the deployment would proceed. **********On Friday, a senior State Department official, meeting with reporters, said he expected the Israelis to be gone from West Beirut by Sunday. But there are apparently differences over the limits of West Beirut, with the United States including the airport and the Israelis apparently not. **********The Italian contingent, which is aboard a chartered ship, had been supposed to land today, but has delayed its landing because of the continued Israeli presence in the port area. **********American officials said that they have concluded an exchange of letters with the Lebanese Government on the terms for the presence of the American troops, similar to the document that was made public when a three-nation force was in West Beirut in late August and early September supervising the evacuation of Palestinian and Syrian forces. **********In the killing of the United Nations observers by a land mine, the Defense Department said the two Americans were majors, one from the Air Force and the other from the Army. They were in a jeep 9 miles east of Beirut in the vicinity of the Beirut-Damascus highway when it struck a the land mine. **********An Irish major and a Finnish captain, also in the jeep, were also killed, the Pentagon said.

Haig Jr. had expected it to be, and there is no assurance that he will be able to find a formula that will avert open hostilities between Argentina and Britain. **********As the Secretary, gray with fatigue, ended 11 continuous hours of negotiations with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher Monday night, the hopeful atmosphere that had built up here in the last 48 hours evaporated. Mr. Haig seemed sorely disappointed. Asked whether he was more hopeful, he replied, ''Not at all.'' Then early this morning doubts arose about the willingness of the Argentines even to continue the talks. **********Mr. Haig had expected to head back to Argentina Monday night, but the American Embassy announced early today that he was staying over in London after having had a number of telephone conversations with the Argentine Foreign Minister. **********There was no dependable, detailed account of what had occupied Mr.  Haig, Mrs. Thatcher and the other officials inside 10 Downing Street all day. But it is believed that the Secretary failed, at least for the time being, in an intensive attempt to put together a package solution to break the stalemate and avoid British naval action. **********According to diplomats monitoring the progress of Mr. Haig's diplomacy, the discussions have involved two broad questions: Who moves first to defuse the immediate military threat, and what happens to the Falklands and their 1,800 inhabitants after that? An Atmosphere of Bitterness **********In an atmosphere that is full of distrust and bitterness, the first question seems no closer to solution than it did four days ago. The Argentine junta says that Britain must turn back its main battle fleet, now only about a week from the islands, before Argentine troops can be withdrawn from the Falklands. The British say the troops must leave before the fleet can be halted. **********The obvious diplomatic solution is some mechanism under which the two things could be accomplished simultaneously. But for either side to do that would involve grave political risks: Lieut. Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri could be accused of knuckling under to British sea power and Mrs. Thatcher could be accused of giving up this country's only really strong bargaining chip. **********To put the matter another way, General Galtieri and his junta partners do not want to have to negotiate with a British naval gun pointed at their heads, and Mrs. Thatcher does not want to negotiate with someone who, from the British point of view, remains in control of a British possession that has been seized by illegal means. **********The Prime Minister had very little elbow room in her talks with Mr. Haig. Whatever she agreed to, she knew when the long meeting began, she would have to defend on Wednesday at a special session of the House of Commons. And even as she talked, it became obvious that many Members of Parliament were prepared to accept few concessions. Three-Part Package Proposed **********One of the plans that was on the table reportedly called for a three-part package: Argentine withdrawal from the islands, British recall of the fleet and a joint interim adiministration with a single Argentine flag left flying in Stanley, the capital of the Falklands, as a token of sovereignty while larger issues were sorted out. That, said Alan Clark, a hard-line Tory M.P., was unacceptable; it was ''exactly the sort of solution we forced on Czechoslovakia at Munich.'' Appearing with Mr. Clark on television, Stanley Clinton Davis, a foreign policy spokesman for the Labor Party, agreed. **********Neither of the national leaders involved is in a strong position at home, and the Falklands crisis is more about domestic than about international politics. For Mrs. Thatcher to seem to yield to aggression might bring her down; for General Galtieri to fail to retain some vestige of a sovereignty tenuously established after 149 years of national frustration might cause his regime to collapse. **********A number of ideas have been put forward to hedge on the sovereignty question, including the ''Hong Kong solution'' - under which Argentina would gain control but lease the islands back to Britain for a given period - and the ''Andorra solution'' - under which sovereignty would be shared. **********But officials in Buenos Aires have been saying privately that those ideas are unacceptable, presumably because they fear that the Argentine public would see them as a sellout after a glorious victory. It is not known whether the Falklanders, who rejected similar proposals in 1980, have changed their minds in the 10 days since the invasion on April 2. Concern for Islanders' Views **********Mrs. Thatcher has tied herself, seemingly irrevocably, to the idea that the views of the islanders themselves are paramount. She has said so several times in recent days. But how are those wishes to be determined, and when? How to be sure the islanders are free to say what they think? **********Once that is decided, other questions will arise. Is she offering a veto, a guarantee that no solution unacceptable to them will be acceptable to Britain? Or is she merely promising that their interests, which can be defined in many ways, will be served? **********Few people in British politics believe that there can be any return to the status quo ante, because Britain lacks the military means to protect the islanders for years to come from a hostile Argentina. It would take thousands of troops or a large flotilla or both, and this country cannot afford to tie down a large proportion of its resources in the defense of a small colony without strategic importance. **********Yet Mrs. Thatcher's comments about the primacy of the islanders' wishes have created the expectation that she will take exactly that stand. Fleet Entering South Atlantic **********The deadlock will be broken, if it is broken at all, only by the pressure of events. As the fleet, now thought to be about 1,000 miles north of Ascension Island, enters the South Atlantic, it may come to seem to General Galtieri, and perhaps even to the resolute Mrs. Thatcher, that it is better to accept some loss of face, whatever the political risks, than face the consequences of military engagement. **********In any war between the two countries, the odds would favor Britain, a fact that must worry General Galtieri. But substantial British casualties would also be highly likely, and Mrs. Thatcher will have to take into account that while opinion polls show wide support for her present policy, they also show that a majority of the public thinks that regaining the Falklands is not worth losing the life of one British soldier. **********Late Monday night, as Mr. Haig and his deeply gloomy entourage awaited further word from Buenos Aires, a British official said, ''Our message to the Argentines remains: 'Get out or be put out.' '' For his part, he said, he expected Mrs. Thatcher to continue to send it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/10/world/around-the-world-somali-leader-in-us-to-seek-more-assistance.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Somali Leader in U.S.  To Seek More Assistance", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Somali Leader in U.S.  To Seek More Assistance", "body_text": " **********President Mohammed Siad Barre of Somalia arrived here today to seek more economic and military assistance from the United States. **********He will spend three days in Washington and has scheduled talks with President Reagan and other officials.

If business executives can straighten out t heir heads long enough to think clearly, however, they will fall d own on their knees, thank God for this tax bill, and beg for more l ike it. **********Business's unhealthy addiction to tax subsidies has grown like Topsy since the early 1970's. Successive Presidents and Congresses have responded to increasingly insistent pleas from business for more ''confidence boosters'' by adding and adding to the loophole dosage. **********These deep corporate tax cuts may have induced temporary busineses euphoria, but they never had any noticeable effect on business investment as a share of the gross national product, a ratio that has shown no discernible trend up or down since World War II. And predictably, by favoring some kinds of investments over others, the ever-expanding loopholes seriously distorted capital spending patterns, to the detriment of business productivity. **********Last year, business overdosed on tax breaks. The huge new injection literally turned the corporate income tax into a corporate income subsidy. So intemperate was the new approach that a panel of loophole-crazed executives told the House Ways and Means Committee this spring that they preferred it to paying no taxes at all. **********At the same time, the 1981 act made corporate tax sheltering, rather than marketplace forces, the paramount factor in capital spending choices. Bad investments were made good, and good ones bad.  So extreme were the act's distortions that, by 1987, an investment in an industrial plant would need over four times the expected pretax profitability of an investment in office equipment to compete on the after-tax bottom line. The victims of such loophole madness include economic growth, jobs, productivity, wages, and ultimately even business profits. **********Compounding the problem, the cost of augmenting business' selfdestructive dependence on tax breaks was financed with borrowed money. Unlike the pattern of previous years, the 1981 corporate tax cuts were not offset by automatic individual tax increases from inflation-driven ''bracket creep.'' **********Instead, the $500 billion in business tax reductions over this decade, together with the rapid defense buildup, created an intolerable imbalance between Federal receipts and expenditures.  These changes - and not the illusory tax cuts for most individuals - share almost all the blame for the enormous booming Federal deficits. **********Last year's hallucinogenic rosy scenario has been discolored by recession, high interest rates, runaway deficits, record unemployment and business failures, and declining investment. Facing up to the colossal failure of its experiment with subsidized corporate profits and suspension of the basic rules of economics, Congress responded so rationally and so responsively this year that one could almost forget it was the same deliberative body that enacted the 1981 bill. **********The first task was to reduce the Government's fiscal imbalance without disturbing whatever fragile recovery we may be on the edge of. Here, the 1982 tax act was finely crafted. Far from raising taxes during recession, as some have charged, the bill only nicks at next year's scheduled tax reductions, adding a mere $18 billion -or less than 3 percent - to expected fiscal year 1983 receipts. In fiscal year 1987, however, the act is expected to raise some $64 billion - cutting the deficit by about one-third. **********AT the same time, the 1982 act creates substantial new incentives for more productive, higher-quality business investment by cutting back on the worst excesses of last year's corporate tax changes. To be sure, most earnings from new equipment will remain slightly subsidized, or, at best, tax-exempt. But this is clearly an improvement over the huge tax rebates - ranging as high as 194 percent of pretax profits for some investments -instituted by the 1981 bill. **********The efficiency of market incentives will be further enhanced by provisions narrowing or closing loopholes under which particular industries - such as insurance, defense contractors, drug companies and oil - had been freeloading on the tax system and the economy for years. **********Business leaders can complain that the 1982 act is a wage-earner's bill -and to a large degree that's right. The overwhelming bulk of the tax increases will come at the expense of corporate freeloaders and tax cheats - a far cry from the individual income tax increases advocated by big business or the consumer energy taxes unsuccessfully floated by the Administration. But the 1982 act is good for business, too. **********The decline in interest rates that paralleled progress on and passage of the 1982 bill may be mere coincidence, but it probably isn't. A return toward reliance on the marketplace to govern investment decisions is far more consistent with business' avowed economic philosophy - and it makes far more sense - than the complex web of tax subsidies enacted last year. **********Business should see the 1982 act not as a defeat but as an opportunity - a chance for companies to start kicking the loophole habit and become productive, tax-paying members of society once again. If business leaders can finally face up to the pain of withdrawal and admit they can't win while everyone else is losing, the new tax bill will be an important first step on the rehabilitation process toward a fairer, more rational tax system and a healthier economy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/07/world/attorney-general-in-rome.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 27, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Attorney General in Rome", "print_headline": "Attorney General in Rome", "body_text": " **********Attorney General William French Smith arrived here today on a five-day visit for talks on fighting Mafia drug smuggling to the United States."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/11/business/gulf-energy-development-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GULF ENERGY & DEVELOPMENT CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "GULF ENERGY & DEVELOPMENT CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/09/world/archbishop-says-pope-s-visit-to-argentina-is-nonpolitical.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 79, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Archbishop Says Pope's Visit To Argentina Is Nonpolitical", "print_headline": "Archbishop Says Pope's Visit To Argentina Is Nonpolitical", "body_text": " **********Archbishop Paul C.

''We protest against the brutal br eaking of workers' strikes by the police and army, the shooting of p eople, beatings, the internment of many thousands of people in pri sons and camps. **********''We protest against the breaking up of families, the separating of children from their parents, the imprisonment of the sick and of minors. **********''We deem disgraceful and illegal the practice of breaking human dignity by forcing people to sign so-called declarations of loyalty, using various kinds of pressure and blackmail and dismissing from work those who refuse to sign.'' **********The petition began by citing a principle of international agreements - that all nations have the right to self-determination and to freely develop their own political, economic, social and cultural lives. This principle, it said, lay at the basis of the ''renewal'' that began with the creation of the Solidarity union in August 1980, and it was therefore violated in the military takeover. **********The petition ended with the observation that, except for the German occupation in World War II and the Stalinist postwar period into the middle 1950's, never has there been so many overcrowded prisons and camps on Polish soil as now. **********''Whoever until now has tried to enslave our nation has met with resistance and anger,'' the petition said. ''We remind those who introduced the state of war of this.'' **********''State of war'' is the constitutional provision under which martial law was declared.

Among them is said to be Andrzej Wajda, the film director. Mr. Wajda, who had been politically active in Solidarity and became something of an unofficial spokesman for the union's cultural members, dropped his activities under martial law and spent much of his time at home. His decision to sign the petition is said to have been an agonizing one. **********The demands in the petition, for releasing detainees, ending martial law and holding a dialogue with the union, are similar to those made in the West and also by the church. **********The Polish Conference of Bishops, which met two days ago, drafted messages to both Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish leader, and to the Polish people.

Take the case of a motor oil manufacturer whose product, instead of protecting engines, damages them. The harm is already done, and the manufacturer is faced with a lot of $800 to $1,200 claims. But with a little luck, he can still buy an insurance policy to cover the claims - even though the damage has already occurred. **********Such a policy is called retroactive insurance; the most prominent example involved the MGM Grand Hotel fire in Las Vegas, Nev. When the blaze that killed 85 people broke out 18 months ago, the hotel only had $30 million of insurance. Faced with more than a billion dollars of claims, the hotel managed to buy an additional $170 million of backdated coverage. **********Although the tax consequences of so-called retro insurance are unclear, and some critics say such insurance interferes with prompt resolution of legal claims, similar policies have caught on with a variety of purchasers. Some of them are trying to obtain after-thefact protection for a particular mishap. But others, including a growing number of lawyers and doctors, are now buying retro insurance to cover periods during which they know of no unusual claims against them. **********''Some years ago there was a shortage of capacity, and many people found the insurance they wanted was unavailable,'' said William Quinn of Frank B. Hall & Company, which brokered the MGM Grand coverage.  ''Now there's a soft insurance market, and they are going back and trying to cover the gaps.'' **********Retro insurance can serve other purposes, too. For the electrical contractor who wired the MGM Grand Hotel, $40 million of backdated coverage cleared the way for the company to be bought by an acquirer who did not want to take on a dangling contingent liability that would not be resolved until the lawsuits arising from the fire went to trial. **********According to Paul Ingrey, president of Gibraltar Casualty, the MGM Grand situation prompted interest in retro insurance in some unusual subsequent cases. There was an individual inquiry, he said, from the owner of a boat that crashed and a corporate request from the General Dynamics Corporation to cover cost overruns. Neither of those received Gibraltar coverage, he said. **********Asbestos manufacturers, too, have shown interest in retro insurance, although Mr. Ingrey said no insurer had yet been willing to take them on. **********''The kind of case where I can see this having a real public policy use would be in something like the hospital industry,'' Mr. Ingrey said. ''Ten years ago, a 500-bed hospital might only have bought $5 million of insurance. Today, they'd probably look to buy $20 million, and they might want that much for the whole period in the 70's, too.  It's to everyone's advantage for the hospital to be properly insured. The patients know the money is there, and the hospital can manage its risks better.'' **********There is a tax advantage to retro insurance, too. Normally, MGM Grand would have had to wait until it actually paid the disaster victims before it could deduct the cost of their claims. **********But insurance premiums are deductible in the year they are paid.  Retroactive insurance premiums are more valuable as deductions than normal premiums because they are larger. How much larger depends on how likely the insurer thinks it is that he will have to pay a claim. According to a lawyer for MGM Grand, for example, the hotel will deduct the full $37 million of premiums paid for its $170 million retro coverage. **********It is here that the legal problems begin. Robert Hunter, president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, a consumer activist group in Alexandria, Va., said retro insurance premiums were not really insurance and should not be deductible.''You can't insure a person who's already dead,'' Mr. Hunter said. **********Earlier this year, the Internal Revenue Service said it was considering issuing a revenue ruling on how retro insurance should be treated. **********Mr. Hunter raises other problems. Because the insurance companies make their profit on retro insurance by investing the premium money at high interest rates until the claim is paid, he said, there is a strong incentive for them to delay payment, or refuse settlement offers in order to get the use of the money for a longer time. **********''There is an element of truth to that,'' Mr. Ingrey conceded.  ''But insurance companies don't generally control court or settlement schedules.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/04/world/beirut-confession-on-israel-tv.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 283, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BEIRUT CONFESSION ON ISRAEL TV", "print_headline": "BEIRUT CONFESSION ON ISRAEL TV", "body_text": " **********Israeli television broadcast an interview today with a man who identified himself as a Lebanese Christian militia commander and who said that he killed 15 Palestinians in the Beirut refugee camps during the massacre last month. **********''I was in Shatila and Sabra and I killed Palestinians,'' the man was quoted off camera as saying. **********''I killed only 15 Palestinians in the camps, but I will continue to kill them all my life.'' **********The broadcast said the man, who called himself Michael, refused to repeat the statement on camera.

Inflation will be guided by nonmonetary events such as the course of Federal spending and world oil prices, he said. ''Investors are probably better off not assuming that inflation has been permanently derailed,'' he added. **********In yesterday's trading, prices of Treasury notes fluctuated narrowly, closing with gains of about a quarter-point. Bonds were mostly unchanged. **********The new 9 3/4 percent notes due in two years rose to an offered price of 100 from the average of slightly over 99 29/32 at Wednesday's auction.

The merger of the two railway systems was approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission March 25. **********Mr. Claytor's appointment yesterday to head the merged companies - which last year had combined revenues of $3.6 billion - seems to follow from a comment he made last September when he was given the added duties of chief executive at N.& W. At that time, he observed that he was concentrating on the consolidation of the two railroads, adding: ''If it works out that way, I may well work my way out of a job before my first stockholder's meeting.'' **********A close associate of Mr. Claytor in Roanoke, who asked not to be identified, yesterday said that Mr. Claytor, a lawyer by training, had developed ''a good grip'' on the railroad business. A graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School, Mr. Claytor started his career at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1948 and joined N.& W. as a solicitor in 1951. He became senior vice president in 1968, an executive vice president in 1971 and president in 1980. **********Mr. Hall, on the other hand, is a longtime railroad man, having started with the Southern in 1943 as an agent-telegrapher. He rose through a variety of jobs, became executive vice president for operations and then president in 1979. **********Norfolk Southern also yesterday named successors at both railways, which will operate separately, and selected four executive vice presidents and thirteen vice presidents. **********Although each railway had revenues of $1.8 billion last year, Norfolk Southern will have to grapple with a recession that has cut sharply into railroad shipments, which have only partly been offset by increased hauling of coal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/21/business/talking-business-with-zvi-porath-of-elscint-cat-scanner-s-new-rival.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore BARMASH", "pub_date": "1982-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 698, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Interview", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Talking Business with Zvi Porath of Elscint; CAT Scanner's New Rival", "print_headline": "Talking Business with Zvi Porath of Elscint; CAT Scanner's New Rival", "body_text": " **********In advanced medical diagnostics, a new generation of technology is competing with the CAT scanner, which has revolutionized medical imaging. Nuclear magnetic resonance, or N.M.R., systems, producing pictures of the body based on the responses of atomic nuclei in a magnetic field, are considered by some experts to be safer and more effective than the CAT scanner. A half-dozen companies worldwide produce one or two of the systems. But only Elscint Ltd., an Israelbased company whose stock is traded on this country's over-thecounter exchange, derives almost all of its revenues from three imaging systems. **********Zvi Porath, Elscint's chief economist, had been a consultant to the World Bank and his country's representative to the board of the International Monetary Fund. Here the 41-year-old executive discusses his company's prospects. **********Q. How can a small company in a small country compete with the world's technology giants? A. Our management believes that 75 percent of success is being in the right field and only 25 percent is hard work. Among the world's technology giants, imaging is only about 4 or 5 percent of sales. It is our total business so that survival depends upon excelling in our specialty. Those with the highest market share pay enormously for medical market education. We don't want the largest market share. The market is big enough for giants and small companies. **********Q. Will the new N.M.R. system hurt the CAT scanner's sales? A. The excitement about the nuclear magnetic resonance potential has created some confusion in the marketplace over both the scientific and commercial aspects. It will probably have a marginal, short-term impact on CAT scanner purchase decisions. But the market for the CAT scanner is too large and viable to be seriously set back in the next two to three years. The N.M.R.'s cost is about twice that of the CAT scanner and requires a special site in the hospital. We are showing our N.M.R. prototype system and booking orders for delivery in mid-1983. We see parallel markets. **********Q. What is Elscint's main thrust? A. It is not so much our products as our strategic planning. Since Elscint was founded in 1969 by Dr. Avraham Suhami, our management has concentrated only on the medical imaging field, building expertise in different technologies, all of which have a synergistic effect, while developing the company into a multinational concern. **********This has resulted in the introduction of CAT scanners, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, digital radiography and most recently nuclear magnetic resonance systems. We have had some failures. But through managerial depth, the addition of many skilled scientists and perhaps above all a pure stubborn streak, we have survived. We don't like to operate on the edge of disaster but we have come to enjoy working under pressure. **********Q. But aren't you taking risks by growing fast? A. Scientific companies always take high risks. The question is whether they have the hard-headed ability to generate the expertise to minimize failure. Last May, we decided to spend about $60 million on R.& D.  over the next three years to maintain our international posture. An infant company has to show products before it gets orders. A mature company shows its specifications to the market. When it gets the order, it means that its credibility has been accepted. It took us less than five years to advance from one stage to the other. Managing R.& D. money productively and building market infrastructure in Israel and 15 foreign countries will help us minimize our risks. **********Q. What is your company's growth outlook? A. The market today is over $2.5 billion a year but it is projected by 1986-1987 to rise to more than $5 billion a year. Our goal is to obtain 10 percent of this world market and we expect to be there by next year. **********One of our most ambitious efforts was our first full display of all of our medical diagnostic systems at last week's annual convention of Radiological Society of North America in Chicago. The medical imaging field is continuously growing, whether in war, peace or economic difficulties, and we expect to grow with it.

But the prospects of such legislative moves in a generally conservative Congress are not seen as bright. **********Vietnam Parallel Is Drawn **********''The situation in El Salvador is all too reminiscent for many of us of a decade and a half ago,'' Senator Dodd, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said this morning. ''Because we failed to properly debate the issue before we became too deeply involved and enmeshed and mired in Vietnam, we found ourselves in an extremely difficult situation.'' **********The Reagan Administration has consistently rejected the idea of negotiations with the armed Salvadoran opposition, saying this would be tantamount to handing the country over to leftists who would create an undemocratic government. **********Thomas O.

Mr. Enders has said that more military and economic assistance will be requested from Congress. Certification on Rights **********At the end of last month, the White House concluded that El Salvador had made adequate progress in reducing human rights violations and political violence to allow continued United States assistance to that nation. The cer tification requirement was attachedto foreign aid legislation late last year. **********The White House certification has provoked widespread criticism of the Administration's support of the Salvadoran Government.  On Tuesday, the head of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops repeated his opposition to continued support for military aid to El Salvador voiced at the time of the White House certification decision. **********Archbishop John R.

Hogg, president and chief executive officer of Mastercard, ''investments in money market funds will be available to holders of checking accounts and Mastercard credit cards issued by commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan institutions through a facility of Fidelity, which manages many leading securities and money market funds.'' **********The new range of banking services will be introduced in April by a cross section of the 12,500 American banks and thrift institutions that are members of Mastercard, Mr. Hogg said, and gradually be extended to all members ''once the pilot test program is proven satisfactory.'' **********Huge Withdrawals of Funds **********He went on to note that savings institutions, particularly the thrift units, have experienced huge withdrawals of funds in recent years because their customers have been investing in money market funds and related instruments. ''Meanwhile, brokerage houses have been moving into the banking field through mergers with financial services institutions and providing yet another rival for the saver's dollar,'' Mr. Hogg said. **********But wouldn't the Mastercard-Fidelity system also encourage the withdrawal of funds from the banking and savings institutions? Not quite, Mr. Hogg replied. Most members of the plan would set ''thresholds'' that would force customers to keep between, say, $2,000 and $2,500 in interest-free checking accounts. ''Anything above these thresholds would be automatically swept into a money market fund, much the same way as some brokerage houses do with idle money in the accounts of their securities customers,'' he explained. **********Perhaps the most dramatic part of the new system is that commercial banks and savings institutions, which are currently prevented from engaging in the securities brokerage business, will be able to offer their customers discount brokerage services. The Fidelity Financial Services Group would execute these orders for the member institutions in a manner similar to their regular buying and selling of stocks and bonds for the many mutual funds it manages. Some 52 million people have Mastercards through 24,000 banks and savings institutions worldwide. Visa Proposal Rejected **********Mr. Hogg added that the plan was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission last Friday, while a similar proposal by Visa U.S.A., another major credit card association, was rejected the the S.E.C. that day. **********A spokesman for Visa, Richard Rossi, said the S.E.C. rejected his company's plan because the agency thought its member banks would channel the investment funds back to member banking institutions. Mr. Rossi also said last Friday that Visa planned to discuss the matter with the regulatory agency this week with a view to eliminating the objectionaable aspects. **********Mr. Hogg said the Mastercard plan was approved in part because the various investment funds placed by the customers of its member banks would be handled by Fidelity Financial Services, a separate and professional money management company that manages 25 mutual funds with assets of $14 billion. **********''It is conceivable that Fidelity could, for example, use some of the funds from a member bank to buy its certificates of deposit because it handles so much investment funds,'' he said, adding: ''But our new system is not intended to provide member banks with an inflow of investment funds from its customers; it is aimed at offering them competitive investment vehicles currently denied us.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/13/business/japan-s-gnp-off-0.9-first-decline-since-1975.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1982-03-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 444, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAPAN'S G.N.P.

Last year, Mr. Suzuki said that he would stake his ''political life'' on his ability to trim the size of the public sector and balance the budget by 1984.

''This is a political act.'' **********Hundreds of Mr. Nkomo's former guerrillas who had joined the army have deserted with their arms. The Government blamed ''dissidents'' for an armed attack on Mr. Mugabe's official residence on June 24. **********They were also blamed for a holdup in the Victoria Falls Hotel, in northwest Matabeleland, last Saturday by three gunmen who killed a hotel employee. The gunmen were captured. **********The next day time bombs exploded in the jet intakes of warplanes at an air force base in Gweru, formerly called Gwelo, destroying or damaging at least 13 planes. The Government blamed saboteurs but did not identify them. **********(Reuters, quoting security sources, said that 11 people had been detained in connection with the attack on the air base.) Matabele fears that the Shona sought political domination over them were heightened by Mr. Nkomo's dismissal, moves by Mr. Mugabe toward a one-party state and detention without trial of some 200 people, most of them Nkomo supporters."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/16/business/beverage-management-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-25.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BEVERAGE MANAGEMENT INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 25", "print_headline": "BEVERAGE MANAGEMENT INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 25", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/21/world/human-services-dept-seeks-right-to-cut-public-role-in-rule-making.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1982-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 919, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HUMAN SERVICES DEPT.

It was published last month in the Federal Register, the medium through which the Government gives advance notice of changes in regulations. It is open to public comment until Aug. 23; at that point the department decides on its final form, and it takes effect after publication in the Register. Regulations are then subject to judicial review. **********Department officials said one of the major disadvantages of current procedure is the inordinate amount of time, often a year, that notice and comment require. **********For months the department has been preparing new or revised rules for several programs, including Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and Head Start, which provide benefits for the poor, the elderly and children. **********While the department can make substantial changes in Federal benefit programs by issuing new regulations, it cannot make a change inconsistent with laws passed by Congress. The discretion of the Secretary of Health and Human Services is broadest in areas where Congress has not been very specific. **********The Secretary, for example, has broad discretion in defining ''reasonable'' hospital costs that will be reimbursed under Medicare, in deciding how to count the financial resources of a family applying for Medicaid benefits and in setting health and safety standards for hospitals and nursing homes. **********Advocates for the poor, consumer groups, hospital administrators, nursing home operators and others who receive benefits from the department are opposing the change. 'End Public's Right to Comment' **********Sara Rosenbaum of the Children's Defense Fund, a national nonprofit organization, said Friday that the proposal would ''end the public's right to comment on regulations before they are issued.'' The change, she said, ''could not have come at a more important time'' because of the major regulatory changes being prepared. The changes are expected to reflect not only new laws enacted by Congress but also the Reagan Administration's efforts to control Federal spending. **********Eugene Tillman, a lawyer in private practice here, said that under the proposed rules, the department could ''escape judicial review'' of any decision to forgo public notice and comment. The proposal says that although the department will try to offer opportunities for public comment, this policy ''is not intended to create any judicially enforceable rights.'' **********Mr. Tillman, who used to work at the department, said the proposed rules ''represent an erosion of the public participation principle which has been firmly established over the past decade.'' **********''Given the broad range of health, welfare, commercial and research interests affected'' by the department's regulations, he said, the ''opportunities for public participation should not be diminished.'' **********Department officials acknowledge that rules have often been improved as a result of comments submitted by state and local officials, trade associations and private citizens. **********''Our main concern is situations where we do not have enough time for notice and comment because of statutory deadlines and program needs,'' said Terry Coleman, the department lawyer who supervises the issuance of regulations. ''The vast bulk of regulations take a year to put out when we go through notice and comment.'' **********Last year the department had only seven weeks to issue regulations carrying out many statutory changes in welfare, Medicaid and Medicare. The changes, signed into law by President Reagan on Aug.  13, took effect at the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, in some cases before the public comment period was over. **********A Federal district judge in Pennsylvania held that the welfare regulations were invalid because the Government had not allowed enough time for public comment. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit later allowed the cuts to take effect under the new rules. Procedures Required by Law **********Under the Administrative Procedure Act, Federal agencies are supposed to publish proposed rules in the Federal Register and then allow at least 30 days for public comment. The agencies must consider the comments before issuing final rules. However, the law says that an agency may waive this requirement and issue emergency rules when ''good cause'' exists. Some courts have held that a statutory deadline is ''good cause.'' **********Under the law, rules relating to ''public property, loans, grants, benefits or contracts'' are exempt from the requirement. But since 1970, the department has, in effect, waived the exemption and solicited public comment on rules pertaining to social welfare programs. Federal courts have often upheld the right of citizens to participate in the rule-making process under the department's policy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/14/business/l-letters-the-fed-s-doing-030411.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Fed's Doing?", "print_headline": "LETTERS; The Fed's Doing?", "body_text": " **********To the Business Editor: In ''What's Behind Today's Disinflation'' (Oct.31), William Nordhaus asserts that the recent decline in inflation reflects declines in rates of rise of energy and other volatile prices, and declines in wage increases because of recession. **********He concludes that slower money growth was not a factor.

''The elections will exacerbate the war and the United States will want to find someone to pay for the broken plates,'' he said. **********After a rebel attack Jan. 27 destroyed numerous Salvadoran helicopters and aircraft, the Reagan Administration asserted that infiltration of arms to the Salvadoran left had reached levels comparable to those recorded before the guerrillas' abortive ''final offensive'' of January 1981. 'Export' of Subversion Charged **********Without offering any specifics, Administration officials also suggested that both Nicaragua and Cuba were continuing to supply weapons to the Faribundo Marti National Liberation Front. Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. described Nicaragua as ''a base for the export of subversion and armed intervention throughout Central America.'' **********But Western diplomats in the region have expressed open skepticism about United States charges that huge arms shipments from Nicaragua to El Salvador have been renewed. **********''I'd say that the more concerned Washington becomes with the situation in El Salvador, the more it seems to be striking out against Nicaragua in frustration,'' one influential Western diplomat said. **********The diplomat said that Nicaragua remained an important propaganda base for the Salvadoran left and that top guerrilla commanders as well as democratic opposition leaders frequently visit Managua. They also said that some Salvadoran guerrillas receive training here and others pass through Nicaragua to and from Cuba. **********But while a small amount of armaments were thought to be still reaching Salvadoran rebels from Nicaragua, the diplomat said there was no evidence of large-scale smuggling. ''If you manage to cut of Nicaragua completely, it wouldn't make much difference to the situation in El Salvador,'' a Western diplomat said. **********In an interview, Mr. Ramirez said ''the best way to end speculation about this is for the Nicaraguan and Honduran armies to carry out joint patrol operations'' along their common border. He added that Nicaragua had long insisted on such an approach and that he was hopeful that the new Honduran administration of President Roberto Suazo Cordova would soon agree. **********Mr. Ramirez said that despite Nicaragua's ''confrontation'' with Washington, the Sandinist Government remained hopeful that relations would improve. He pointed out that the United States was permitting anti-Sandinist exiles to undergo military training in Florida and was trying to block credits to Nicaragua in the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. ''But we continue to insist that a dialogue with the Reagan Administration is possible, that a permanent channel of communication be maintained,'' he added, **********Domestic opponents of the Sandinist regime have also been sharply critical of Washington's verbal attacks on Nicaragua. ''I wish the United States would keep quiet for a while,'' said Alfonso Robelo Callejas, a former junta member and now opposition leader. ''Every time Haig opens his mouth, he strengthens the Sandinists by justifying their arms buildup and stimulating the nationalism of the people.'' **********The Reagan Administration has nevertheless expressed growing concern at the rapid buildup of the Sandinist army, which, it claims, now poses a serious threat to Nicaragua's neighbors in Central America. Washington has also charged that Soviet, East German and Cuban officers are training Sandinist troops. Last month, it censured France for agreeing to sell $15.8 million worth of arms, including rockets and rocket-launchers, to Nicaragua. Defense Against 'Aggression' **********In response, Nicaraguan officials have argued that they must be prepared to defend themselves against outside ''aggression'' and they have pointed to press reports as evidence that the United States had discussed the possibility of forming an inter-American peace force with Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay to operate in Central America. **********Despite the rapid growth in the Sandinist army over the last year, however, Western diplomats here question recent claims by United States officials that Nicaragua now had some 125,000 people under arms.

Rambouillet, France, 1975 - The conferees rejected a return to fixed exchange rates among their currencies, while agreeing on the need for monetary stability and for international economic cooperation. But currency upheavals and international economic sparring matches ensued. **********Dorado Beach, P.R., 1976 - The nations agreed that the greatest danger was overly rapid, inflationary growth. But unemployment, which was not officially discussed at the meeting, soared to 15 million people in the industrial countries over the following 12 months as world economic growth ''paused.'' **********London, 1977 - The industrialized nations committed themselves to a 5 percent growth rate for the year. But West Germany and Japan failed to meet goals for rapid growth that had been set for them as a means to bolster the world economy. While the American economy spurted ahead, promises for a comprehensive energy program were not fulfilled. **********Bonn, 1978 - The conference ended with a modest set of pledges to maintain policies of slow growth and with lower expectations of what economic meetings could accomplish. The United States had to promise to put its own economic house in order by reducing oil imports in order to win concessions from Tokyo and Bonn. But oil consumption and imports continued to swell, increasing inflation and aggravating monetary instability. **********Tokyo, 1979 - The energy issue dominated the meeting. The United States and other nations agreed to specific limits on oil imports through 1985 to curb market speculation. Because of its recession, the United States was the only nation to meet its import goal, and interest in the oil market faded as supplies increased. **********Venice, Italy, 1980 - The economic talks again centered on energy, with the participants agreeing to develop alternate energy sources and to reduce oil imports sharply. A world surplus of oil began to develop during the following year because of higher prices and slower economic growth worldwide. **********Ottawa, 1981 - This meeting, the first summit conference for many of the heads of government, including President Reagan, was largely a get-acquainted session, a medium for communication rather than a generator of decisions. Worrisome disagreements on economic policies, because of France's election of a Socialist Government, and resentment of Japan's trade protectionism did not materialize.

Many governments fear individual liberty; many others do not even accept the original and distinctive intellectual foundations of the belief in human rights. Those opposing the human rights movement find themselves in a world already shaped by it, and they are compelled to fight on its ground, using the terminology of democracy. A nominal consensus on human rights thus hides the reservations of leaders who remain more comfortable with the ancient priority of duties over rights, and of rulers who simply find it inconvenient or threatening to respect their subjects' rights. For such people there is a great temptation to legitimize their own interests by broadening the basic concept of rights to include these interests - thus allowing some to claim, for example, that duty to authority is a special kind of right and others to claim that certain theoretically desirable rights cannot be afforded at their country's stage of development. **********This leads to increasing uncertainty as to what desirable things really are rights. This uncertainty has been encouraged by some new interpretations of social and economic rights, such as the newly minted concept of the ''right to development.'' The urgency and moral seriousness of the need to eliminate starvation and poverty from the world are unquestionable, and continue to motivate large American foreign aid efforts. However, the idea of economic and social rights is easily abused by repressive governments, which claim that they promote human rights even though they deny their citizens the basic rights to the integrity of the person, as well as civil and political rights. Human Rights In Inte rnational Relations A continuing problem for human rights polic y is the fact that it traditionally aims at affecting the domestic behavior of other countries, while governments are reluctant to alter their nation's polit ical system for foreign policy reasons. The leverage that the United States does have is strongest in friendly countries , where we have more access and more influence. Such influence is an important resource in pursuing human rights, but its concentration i n friendly countries creates a danger: human rights policy might high light and punish human rights violations in friendly countries, whil e giving unfriendly countries immunity. If this took place it would not fairlyrepresent the distribution of human rights abuses in the w orld.  Moreover, a nation that came to display a general pattern of undermining or estranging friendly governments would obvio usly limit its future influence over them, including its influence ov er their human rights behavior. This is a second problem of human r ights - theneed to avoid pressing only where our influence is greates t rather than where the abuses are greatest. **********The world after 1945 has been characterized by competition between two adverse ideologies, one represented by the United States and one by the Soviet Union. The United States is the nation that has most vigorously undertaken the effort to make human rights a specific part of its foreign policy. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, is ruled by a very small elite through a massive bureaucratic and police apparatus. Its regime inherits in a modified form the Marxist tradition that reacted against the philosophic ideas on which the original human rights concept was based, and superimposes this on a heritage of absolute monarchy. In contrast to the Western democracies, whose original human rights principles gradually radicalized themselves, producing a greater and greater transformation of social life, the alternative Marxist conception of justice in the U.S.S.R. was soon withered by tactical compromises with the necessities of absolute rule. Effect of Soviet Policy **********The effect of Soviet foreign policy has not been to encourage human rights. The Soviet Union dominates, without their consent, not only the non-Russian peoples of the former czarist empire, but also the nations of Eastern Europe. The efforts of the people of East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland to create freer and more pluralist systems have all been frustrated by Soviet intervention or pressure. In 1979 the Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan to impose a government unacceptable to the overwhelming majority of the Afghan people. In the developing countries, the Soviet Union has a tendency to use its influence to move governments toward political structures of the Soviet type where possible. For example, in Ethiopia, whose Government is a friend of the Soviet Union, there has been persistent Soviet pressure to create a Communist Party on the Soviet model. Thus a world in which several major powers were in theoretical agreement over human rights has given way to a world in which the two great powers are fundamentally divided over this issue. United States Human Rights Policy **********This Administration believes that human rights is an issue of central importance both to relieve suffering and injustice and to link foreign policy with the traditions of the American people. **********But no nation can carry out an effective human rights policy unless it shows that its principles can make it successful and confident.  The strength and prestige of the most powerful democratic nation is inevitably important for human rights. **********The other side of this principle is that it is a significant service to the cause of human rights to limit the influence the U.S.S.R. (together with its clients and proxies) can exert. A consistent and serious policy for human rights in the world must counter the U.S.S.R. politically and bring Soviet bloc human rights violations to the attention of the world over and over again. U.S. Response **********At the same time, the United States must continue to respond to serious human rights problems in friendly countries. U.S. human rights policy will not pursue a policy of selective indignation.  Every act of torture or murder is equally repugnant to the American people, no matter who commits it. Of course, the means available to us to halt such human rights violations always vary with the specific case. Our specific response to human rights violations appropriately differs from country to country, but the intensity of our concern should not. **********But a realistic policy must be alert not only to human rights violations by governments, but also to those by opposition groups. It should be obvious that murder, torture, the intimidation of free expression, interference with free elections or attacks on the independence of the judiciary are equally reprehensible whether they are committed by a government or by a group attempting to replace or capture it. Building Freedom It would narrow the range of action of our human rights policy ex cessively to limit it to responding to individual violations of hu man rights when they appear. This ''reactive'' aspect of human ri ghts policy is essential. But it must be accompanied by a second tr ack of positive policy with a bol der long-term aim: to assist the gradual emergen ce of free political systems. It is in such systems that we can mos t realistically expect the observance of human rights across the boar d. The development of liberty is, in turn, encouraged by the emergenc e of areas within a political system where free choiceand free expres sion can become familiar and respected, even while they are not pe rmitted in other parts of the political system. Among these areas whe re freedom can develop are labor unions, churches, independent jud icial systems, bar associations and universities.  Where we do not have leverage over the shape of an entire society, wecan nourish the growth of freedom within such institutions. **********United States policy is guided primarily by the criterion of effectiveness, choosing the response that is most likely to actually improve human rights. In the majority of cases this criterion suggests an emphasis on traditional diplomacy. Traditional diplomacy maximizes the limited leverage we do possess, while minimizing counterproductive reactions, damage to bilateral relations and international tension. Traditional diplomacy has the drawback of being least visible precisely where it is most successful. But this Administration is pledged to employ traditional diplomacy vigorously on behalf of human rights."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/04/world/british-navy-now-fighting-budget-war-military-analysis.html": {"writer_name": "Drew Middleton", "pub_date": "1982-07-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 973, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Military Analysis", "print_headline": "BRITISH NAVY NOW FIGHTING BUDGET WAR; Military Analysis", "body_text": " **********The Royal Navy, which emerged battered but triumphant from the Falkland Islands war, is now the center of a struggle for money and power within the British military establishment.

They question, however, whether Britain has the financial resources to provide a navy strong enough to contribute to NATO antisubmarine forces and simultaneously to operate outside the alliance area. **********Defense Minister John Nott announced in the House of Commons on Thursday a major program to build about $1.7 billion worth of new warships and fighter planes to replace some of those lost in the South Atlantic fighting. But he said the decision did not change his plans to trim the Royal Navy's surface fleet to help pay for a $13 billion Trident submarine missile program. **********Mr. Nott appears determined, on the basis of an official position paper circulated in Parliament last month, to stand by the reductions proposed earlier for frigates and destroyers. The total of these ships is to be cut from 60 to 42. **********An American naval expert said the British might be able to ''get away'' with this reduction as long as there were no calls for naval operations elsewhere. Even so, he pointed out, building replacements for the lost ships will strain the budget. **********At the same time, British and American sources see serious weaknesses in Britain's military posture. There are not enough surface-to-air missiles or advanced fighter aircraft to offer an effective air defense of the island.  Well Trained but Ill Equipped **********The army, particularly in West Germany, is also in a sad state. The general opinion at NATO headquarters is that the British Army of the Rhine is the best-trained and worst-equipped force on the alliance's central front. More modern tanks and more helicopters are desperately needed. **********The Falkland war, from the standpoint of the ground forces, was hardly a test of weaponry. The two main antiaircraft weapons, Rapier and Blowpipe, served well, and the British say Blowpipe is the only weapon that can hit a target coming head on; but neither is new. **********British sources say a debate is under way over the use of aluminum in the frigates that are to be built. Aluminum is light, which is an advantage, but it melts at high temperatures. **********All-steel ships would be more resistant to damage from missiles and shells but less efficient, because if steel radar and missile installations were placed high on a ship, the vessel would become unwieldy. Similar Problems for U.S. **********Similar problems face American naval designers. British sources say the United States Navy uses more aluminum in construction than do the British. This could be a disadvantage against an enemy armed with the French-made Exocet missile or a comparable weapon. **********The Royal Navy, Britons and Americans argue, also needs to design a surface-to-air missile that is more effective than the Sea Dart.  That missile takes too long to aim and fire. **********The Falkland war also underlined to the navy lobby in London the need for a third light aircraft carrier. Present plans call for two carriers for service in the North Atlantic. But some naval sources in London contend that in the light of the Falkland experience, three carriers are needed, two for NATO and one for contingencies outside the alliance area. Britain, they argue, has as much at stake in the Persian Gulf as the United States and should be able to deploy a carrier in a crisis there without weakening the alliance. **********Basic to the overall British military problem is the cost of the submarine-launched Trident ballistic missile. The newest version of this missile, the D-5, will raise the cost to $13 billion over the next 10 years. Opposition to Trident **********The Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is determined to acquire the Trident. But it faces serious opposition in Parliament and among military experts. **********The opponents do not deny the need for a British nuclear deterrent, but they oppose the acquistion of one whose cost will eat into the funds available for conventional forces. These funds are already limited. The British will do well if planned military spending for the fiscal year that began in April maintains an increase of 3 percent after inflation. **********The 3 percent increase was agreed upon five years ago by NATO members. Until now Britain has kept fairly close to the figure.  Critics of the Trident program argue that by going to a less expensive form of nuclear deterrent, money could be saved to strengthen the country's conventional forces. Most American military experts agree with this. In their view, recent events in the South Atlantic and the Middle East have emphasized the importance of professional conventional forces."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/16/business/company-news-shelley-feldman-sues-allegheny.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shelley Feldman Sues Allegheny", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Shelley Feldman Sues Allegheny", "body_text": " **********Shelley Feldman Associates, a Miami-based consultant and manager in the food service equipment business, filed suit in the Federal District Court in Chicago against Allegheny International, its subsidiary the Sunbeam Corporation and the Welbilt Corporation. **********The suit charges that Allegheny breached its contract to sell to Feldman the five food service subsidiaries of the Sunbeam Corporation after Allegheny acquired Sunbeam ealier this year.

Reutershan, who has been president of the exchange since it began operating on March 12, 1980, says that it was not set up specifically to rival Lloyd's of London, but was intended to allow American insurance companies to insure almost any type of risk in the United States and to prevent loss of domestic business to foreign insurers. At least half of the more than $4 billion in premiums that Lloyd's writes every year originates in the United States. **********The New York Insurance Exchange was created by legislation enacted during the 1978 and 1979 sessions of the New York Legislature. Mr.  Reutershan, who has spent virtually his entire working life in the insurance business, assesses the exchange's progress and its future. **********Q. Has the exchange been able to broaden the scope of the business it can handle? A. At first, business was conducted in reinsurance of all kinds in the U.S. and international, direct business of all kinds outside the U.S., and direct business rejected by the Free Trade Zone in New York State, which was set up to protect certain specially licensed domestic insurance companies in New York State from competition in ordinary lines of business. In February 1982, the New York State Legislature passed an amendment that permits the exchange to write direct business throughout the United States. **********Q. Are you meeting your goals in premium volume, since the insurance industry is faced with soft market conditions? A. The goals we had set for growth in premium volume are on target, despite soft market conditions. Premiums of $63.2 million for the first six months of 1982 were 133 percent higher than in the corresponding period in 1981. We predict $150 million for the year, more than double 1981's premiums, and $850 million in five years. **********Q. Who makes up the exchange membership and how is it managed? A.  Currently, the membership stands at 78 brokers and 31 underwriting syndicates whose aggregate capital is $150 million. The exchange, whose chairman is T.V. Learson, formerly chairman of the International Business Machines Corporation, is managed by a 12-man board of governors. One-third of the governors are public representatives and the others represent underwriting and broker interests in the exchange. Currently, there are about 60 foreign syndicate investors from 21 countries, and they provide about a third of the total investment in the exchange's syndicates. **********Q. There is a growing fear that many reinsurers, particularly newcomers, may not be able to meet their payment obligations if faced with major catastrophes. What is your feeling about this? A. There is the possibility of some reinsurers going insolvent since current soft market conditions and low prices have made many of them accept sizable risks at inadequate premiums. The New York Insurance Exchange's security fund covers this contingency of insolvency of an underwriting syndicate member and is unique in the insurance industry anywhere in the world. The security fund now exceeds $16.6 million and covers all proper contracts written on the exchange, whether direct or reinsurance - domestic or foreign. **********Q. The exchange initially expressed hopes of providing employment for thousands in the metropolitan area. Have you revised your forecasts? A. We made a projection on the number of people to be employed by the exchange and its related operations of 15,000 at the end of 10 years. We're actually ahead of our target with more than 1,000 currently employed. Unfortunately, other observers applied the 10-year goal to employment results after one or two years of operation.

''It is time to work.'' More Israeli soldiers, meanwhile, left West Beirut today, continuing the thinning out of the forces that invaded the city after Bashir Gemayel's death. Israeli tanks and armored personnel carriers, however, were still in evidence in downtown areas, along the Corniche Mazraa and near the former headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and there were patrols with rifles at the ready elsewhere. Israelis Are Loading Trucks **********The state radio said that units of the Lebanese Army, which began replacing Israelis in West Beirut on Monday, would move into more downtown areas on Wednesday.

There were three abstentions. Twelve were not present, but some reports said at least some had been prevented from arriving by security problems. **********By contrast, the session at which Bashir Gemayel, the leader of the rightist Christian militias, was elected was attended by only a bare quorum, or 62 members, as Moslem leaders sought to organize a boycott. Bashir Gemayel was chosen on the second ballot, receiving 57 votes.

They are planning or have started ventures in which music, movies, video games and other forms of entertainment or information would be transmitted electronically to homes and recorded by machines that would automatically be turned on to receive the transmission. **********Such electronic distribution of programming, sometimes called telesoftware, has the potential of being cheaper than traditional forms of retailing, such as record stores and video outlets. **********The American Broadcasting Companies, for instance, plans next year to introduce its Home View Network, in which movies and other pay television programming would be broadcast in scrambled form by ABC stations and affiliates in the pre-dawn hours. Subscribers to the service would have videotape recorders equipped with special decoders made by Sony. The transmitted signals would automatically awaken the tape recorders, which would tape the programs and then shut off. **********National Public Radio, in cooperation with a Codart Inc., a San Francisco company, plans a similar service for music. It will be introduced next month over KQED, the public radio station in San Francisco. **********Subscribers will punch in the numbers for the pieces they want to record. The recorder would then be turned on and off automatically all night, allowing subscribers to make customized records. **********Information might also be distributed that way. Dow Jones & Company has a business news service in which subscribers can receive and record radio broadcasts on topics that interest them. **********EECO Inc., an electronics company in Santa Ana, Calif., has developed a system in which magazines, newspapers or catalogues could be broadcast over the air or over a cable TV channel for taping on a video cassette recorder. A 150-page magazine, including color pictures, text and sound, could be sent in 15 seconds and would take up only five inches of tape, according to Stuart Krasney, director of marketing development. **********Video game software and computer software -which consist of instructions for the computer -are also viewed as potential candidates for electronic distribution. **********Such distribution, is already being done on Compuserve and The Source, two electronic information services for personal computer owners. National Public Radio has teamed up with National Information Utilities of McLean, Va., in an attempt to send out computer software by radio frequencies, also during the night, to automatic recording machines. The NABU Manufacturing Corporation of Ottawa plans to start delivering software by cable in that city next month and will test its concept in the United States next year. **********The plans vary in detail but have similar characteristics. They are aimed at avoiding physical distribution. But unlike ''on-line''services, they do not require the person to be constantly connected to a central computer or tuned to a television set or radio. **********The advantage of electronic distribution, say its proponents, is that prices would be lower than with physical distribution. Yet there is uncertainty as to what the price of the various services would be and whether they would catch on. It is far from certain that the future will show a nation of recording devices clicking on and off while people sleep. **********''All of these schemes have a lot to say for themselves, but they're the first ones out,'' said Mark R. Kriss, an analyst with the Yankee Group, a Boston telecommunications consulting firm.  ''Typically, they run into problems.'' **********One major problem, he said, could be opposition from retailers, whose software sales are the profitable part of the consumer electronics business. The hardware, from home computers to video cassette recorders, is heavily discounted. **********One such plan has already failed. Last year, the Digital Music Company attracted attention when it proposed to distribute music over cable television systems, allowing subscribers to record some of it on a pay-per-album basis. But record wholesalers and retailers opposed it, and the record companies decided not to supply programming. **********The new services might face similar problems in that program providers might not want to participate. ABC, for instance, has not yet announced agreement with any movie studios for programs for its pay-television service. Other companies proposing such services are vague about suppliers and their charges for the service. **********Companies entering the electronic distribution business say they will pay royalties to producers. But the producers might not consider the fees sufficient and might have concerns about piracy. **********A company selling a $250 program for personal computers will not let a software service broadcast it for home recording to subscribers who pay $10 a month. Also, many such programs require detailed manuals for users, which cannot be easily distributed electronically. So such telesoftware plans could evolve into ''junk services,'' broadcasting only programs that do not carry high value, Mr. Kriss said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/19/business/colonial-commercial-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COLONIAL COMMERCIAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "COLONIAL COMMERCIAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/15/business/rexham-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REXHAM CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "REXHAM CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/17/business/delorean-sale-cleared.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 233, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DeLorean Sale Cleared", "print_headline": "DeLorean Sale Cleared", "body_text": " **********A Federal bankruptcy judge here cleared the way today for an Ohio auto parts company to purchase the United States assets of the DeLorean Motor Company for $1.5 million, plus assumption of about $9 million in debt. **********The sale, which yields DeLorean's secured creditors about 3 cents on each $1 in debt, gives Consolidated International Inc. of Columbus, Ohio, ownership of 649 cars with an estimated retail value of $17.5 million; spare parts worth another $1.2 million, and sole United States distribution rights. **********DeLorean Motor filed for protection from its creditors on Oct. 25, six days after John Z.

According to economists, however, this low figure masks a continuing succession of workers losing their jobs in older industries - textiles, rubber, brass and various kinds of metalworking - and the creation of new jobs. Manufacturing in advanced fields such as electronics is healthy, but much of the slack is being taken up by nonmanufacturing employment, such as finance and real estate, insurance, law and professional, hotel, educational, and government workers. Over all, nonmanufacturing employment now accounts for 71.2 percent of jobs in the state, up from 67.9 percent six years ago, according to statistics compiled by the Connecticut Department of Labor. **********Such shifts in labor trends are valuable for those who are prepared.

Haig Jr. resigned today as Secretary of State. In a letter to President Reagan, he said the Administration's foreign policy had moved away in recent months from the ''careful course'' he and the President had laid out. **********Mr. Reagan made the first, surprise announcement of the change at 3 P.M. without giving any reasons for Mr. Haig's departure. He said he would nominate George P. Shultz, a former Treasury Secretary, to the State Department post. **********It was unclear, even to some of Mr. Haig's most intimate advisers, whether his resignation was at his initiative or had been forced upon him. **********A Stunning Surprise **********Mr. Reagan's announcement was stunning, coming as it did during what may be the culmination of the Israeli campaign against the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon. Mr. Haig, who appeared before reporters in the State Department's main auditorium an hour and a half after the President's statement, did little to clear up the mystery over the circumstances of his resignation. **********He read his resignation letter, in which he said that when the Reagan Administration took office, ''we agreed that consistency, clarity and steadiness of purpose were essential to success.'' **********''In recent months,'' the letter went on, ''it has become clear that to me that the foreign policy on which we embarked together was shifting from that careful course that we had laid out.'' Speculation on Lebanese Issue **********There was immediate speculation on Capitol Hill, particularly among supporters of Israel, that Mr. Haig was leaving because of disagreement over the policy to be followed in Lebanon. **********Mr. Haig has advocated a conciliatory approach toward the Israelis and had seemed to be supported by Mr. Reagan over the opposition of Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger and William P. Clark, the national security adviser. There had also been disputes over how strenuously to try to prevent Washington's European allies from going ahead with the construction of a gas pipeline from the Soviet Union. **********A White House official later told reporters that Mr. Haig had informed the President of his plans to resign on Thursday but had not given him his resignation letter until today. Mr. Shultz, president of the Bechtel Group Inc., an international construction and engineering company, was contacted by Mr. Reagan in London this morning, the official said. **********The official said there was no single precipitating event that caused the resignation. A close friend of Mr. Haig's said he had quit for a mixture of policy and personality reasons. He was concerned about White House officials becoming personally involved in operational matters, such as dealing with Middle Eastern ambassadors, and he was upset at the harder line being taken toward the European allies by Mr. Reagan. **********One aide said that Mr. Haig, who was involved in trying to bring pressure on the Palestinian forces in Beirut to give up their arms and leave before the Israelis moved into the city, was upset that Vice President Bush had taken it upon himself to advise Arab nations that the United States would persuade Israel to stay out of Beirut.  Mr. Haig was said to have felt that this would encourage the P.L.O.  not to leave Beirut. **********Mr. Haig, 57 years old, had been involved in a continuing series of disputes with other senior Administration officials almost from the start of the Administration. In the past, he reportedly threatened to resign over what he perceived as encroachment by other officials on his responsibilities. **********Pending Mr. Shultz's confirmation by the Senate, something that is expected to occur promptly, Mr. Haig has agreed to remain in office.  Hearings on the Schultz appointment are planned by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, possibly as early as next week. **********The news of Mr. Haig's departure came as a complete surprise in a city accustomed to leaks even of the most delicate decisions. At 2:45 P.M. White House reporters were told that President Reagan would make an announcement in 15 minutes in the press room. This usually happens only in matters of the highest importance. **********Some reporters speculated that the President, who had just attended a working lunch with Mr. Haig and other members of the National Security Council, might speak about the Lebanese crisis. Others thought he might announce the resignation of another controversial Cabinet member, Labor Secretary Raymond J. Donovan. Reagan Reads Statement **********Instead, shortly after 3 P.M., Mr. Reagan appeared and seemed to have trouble reading his brief statement. He said he would take no questions when he was through. **********''It's an announcement I make with great regret regarding a member of our Administration who has served this country for 40 years above and beyond the call of duty, who has served me so well and faithfully with his wisdom and counsel I have respected and admired for all the time our Administration has been here, but who now is resigning, leaving Government service after all this great time,'' the President said. **********By not mentioning Mr. Haig at the start, the President created a sense of drama. He ended the suspense a moment later: ''And with great regret, I have accepted the resignation of Secretary of State Al Haig. I am nominating as his successor, and he has accepted, George Shultz, to replace him. And that's the extent of the announcement. Again I say I do this with great regret.'' **********Initial indications were that the change in secretaries of state would not necessarily produce any major shifts in policy. Mr.  Shultz, who is highly regarded by such foreign policy authorities as former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, has had no direct experience in foreign affairs, but is particularly strong in international economic matters, the area in which Mr. Haig had been weakest. **********Mr. Weinberger, commenting on the Haig resignation, said: ''I am sorry Al Haig is leaving the Government. I have known him for many years and have the utmost respect for his ability, his knowledge, and his effectiveness in foreign policy and many other areas of public affairs.'' **********As the news of his resignation swept through Washington, Mr. Haig returned to his seventh floor office at the State Department and summoned his senior aides for a meeting, an official said. **********He seemed tired, one official said, as he discussed the sudden resignation. According to several participants, he did not go into much more detail than he had in his resignation letter. Mr. Haig said that he had been ''increasingly concerned about the drift of policy and how it was being made.'' **********Then, accompanied by such longtime aides as Lawrence S.  Eagleburger, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, and Sherwood Goldberg, the executive assistant, Mr. Haig walked to the rostrum in the Dean Acheson Auditorium. **********After prolonged applause from department employees, Mr. Haig was introduced by his spokesman, Dean Fischer, and then immediately started reading from his resignation letter. **********Asserting that Mr. Reagan's assumption of office had ''brought an opportunity for a new and forward-looking foreign policy resting on the cornerstones of strength and compassion,'' Mr. Haig said, ''I believe that we shared a view of America's role in the world as the leader of free men and an inspiration for all.'' **********''We agreed that consistency, clarity and steadiness of purpose were essential to success,'' Mr. Haig wrote to Mr. Reagan. ''It was in this spirit that I undertook to serve you as Secretary of State. **********''In recent months it has become clear to me that the foreign policy on which we embarked together was shifting from that careful course which we laid out,'' he continued. ''Under these circumstances, I feel it necessary to request that you accept my resignation. **********''I shall always treasure the confidence which you reposed in me,'' he said. ''It has been a great honor to serve in your Administration, and I wish you every success in the future.'' **********He then praised Mr. Shultz for his ''experience, professionalism and integrity.'' And he said he had the ''most profound respect'' for the Foreign Service and the State Department's employees. He concluded by thanking the press for its ''professionalism and objectivity.'' **********In his time in office, Mr. Haig accomplished no significant diplomatic breakthroughs. No major treaties or other documents were worked out. Rather, many months were spent in seeking agreement within the Admininistration on policy positions on a number of issues. Much time was also spent in seeking White House and Congressional approval for senior appointments in the department.  Some of those named were less conservative than many of Mr. Reagan's supporters wanted."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/07/world/plan-for-the-plo-is-discussed-at-un.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 137, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Plan for the P.L.O.

The increase appeared to be more the result of price rises than growth in volume. **********The decline in factory inventories brought the inventory-toshipments ratio down from 1.73 to 1.72, the first decline in that measure since last June, when it was at 1.57 .

Shipments for all of last year increased 8.2 percent, to about $2,000billion. **********The Commerce Department said that December factory orders for durable goods increased by three-tenths of 1 percent, rather than the 1.6 percent estimated last week. **********December's orders for nondefense capital goods decreased 4.2 percent, to an adjusted $22.81 billion, following an increase of 13.4 percent in November.

Walesa Hopes to Speak Thursday **********Mr. Walesa intended to deliver the speech on Thursday in Gdansk at a rally marking the shooting of workers during riots in 1970 and the erection in 1980 of a monument in their honor. **********It would be Mr. Walesa's first political appearance since his release last month from 11 months of internment. But Jerzy Urban, the Government spokesman, said Monday that no permit for such a rally had been issued. **********The Polish announcement on the cutback of cultural relations with United States Government agencies said special procedures would be introduced in considering any American invitations, grants or offers of training to Poles. **********No more Polish visas are to be issued to employees of the United States Information Agency. U.S. Contacts Already Limited **********The United States Government had already limited its exchange projects with Poland under martial law. However, scholarly exchanges under private American auspices, such as the International Research and Exchanges Board of New York, had continued. It was not immediately clear whether these nongovernmental contacts would now be affected. **********The Polish announcement of retaliations against what it called a ''notoriously'' anti-Polish policy of the United States came after a cool Western reaction to moves made by Poland ostensibly to ease the rigors of martial law. **********For weeks, Polish officials had been saying that procedures to end military rule would be introduced at a meeting of Parliament on Dec.  13, the anniversary of the military takeover. **********Poland had hoped that the West would then lift trade sanctions imposed under martial law. The sanctions have struck a blow at the already ailing Polish economy. **********But the legislation introduced in Parliament on Monday, while eliminating the internment of political prisoners and the monitoring of telephone calls, kept sweeping Government powers, actually strengthening many aspects of military rule. **********Martial-law rules prohibiting the distribution of antigovernment leaflets and the creating of public disturbances are to become part of the penal code. Other practices to remain institutionalized include the dismissal of workers who ''sow disorder,'' the use of the riot police, wiretapping, press censorship, summary military trials, and the militarization of key factories, mines and transport facilities. Parliament Reconvenes Saturday **********Parliament is expected to approve the legislation on Saturday.  Before adjourning today after a two-day session, it enacted a new state secrets law under which Poles may be liable to prison terms up to 10 years for divulging unauthorized information. **********Secretary of State George P. Shultz, traveling in Western Europe, told Pope John Paul II on Monday that the moves modifying martial law did not meet American criteria for lifting sanctions. The foreign ministers of the European Economic Community meeting in Brussels took a wait-and-see attitude. **********The cutback in cultural relations with the United States came against a background of acerbic sniping between the two countries.  On Dec. 3, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish leader, made a bitter speech attacking the United States before an audience of coal miners and threatened to restrict relations. He was believed to be especially incensed by a remark by Secretary of State Caspar W.  Weinberger calling him a ''Russian general in Polish uniform.'' Visa Applications to Be Screened **********In addition to barring employees of the United States Information Agency outright, today's announcement said visa applications from all Americans would be scrutinized ''with an eye to the interests and security of the state.'' **********''In its visa policy,'' the announcement continued, ''the Polish side is taking into account the fact that the American side has for months markedly reduced all kinds of political contacts.'' **********Referring to General Jaruzelski's warning, the announcement said there had been continued criticism of Poland and ''intensification of the aggressiveness in the program of the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe.'' **********It said that Washington had reneged on some joint scientific projects and that intelligence agents had ''repeatedly abused scientific and cultural cooperation for the purposes of penetration and subversion.'' **********The American radio stations, which are popular in Poland, have been a constant target of invective, with officials charging that ''foreign stations'' were fomenting unrest. **********Mr. Walesa, in the prepared text of the speech he had planned for the Gdansk rally on Thursday, said the efforts of the outlawed Solidarity should now be channeled into four areas - labor unions, factory self-management, cultural unions and youth organizations. **********But the speech seemed ambiguous on precisely what course of action he was advocating and how it was to be achieved. He appeared to be deliberately vague and to keep his options open in an attempt to salvage some of Solidarity's gains. **********''We must find ways to achieve our aim,'' the prepared text said.  ''We need, perhaps, more time and different ways. It is now time for this great social movement, this great river to divide itself into several channels and flow peacefully to the sea.'' **********The first channel, he suggested, would be ''the trade unions we have won.'' It was not immediately clear whether he was suggesting that workers make use of the new official unions that have replaced Solidarity. These unions, which have been condemned by some Solidarity activists, are hemmed in with restrictions in their ability to strike. Self-Management Is Weakened **********The second channel, Mr. Walesa said, would be the worker selfmanagement councils that were long sought by Solidarity but were weakened in their functions in the legislation that was recently adopted. **********The third would be independent associations of writers, scientists and performing artists to safeguard ''free but wise and responsible thought,'' he said. **********And the fourth would be ''independent organizations where young people could speak their mind,'' he said.  ''None of these channels will flow without the other,'' he said.  ''All of these elements are essential, otherwise we will once again make mistakes. I am ready to serve toward a true agreement in that direction.'' **********Mr. Walesa, affirming that he remained ''faithful to our ideals,'' ended his prepared text as if he expected his audience at the proposed rally to be surrounded by hostile police and security forces. He advised his listeners to go home in peace and said: **********''Let no more damage be done today and may the others go home. Let us not be pushed off a peaceful way of achieving our aims.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/16/business/pentair-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PENTAIR INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "PENTAIR INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/13/business/unifi-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-27.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNIFI INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 27", "print_headline": "UNIFI INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 27", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/08/business/patents-computer-improvement-corrects-spelling.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1982-05-08", "snippet": "A computer improvement patented this week for the International Business Machines Corporation provides automatic spelling corrections.

TEMPLETON, an investment fund manager, said recently that there was a 50-50 chance that the Dow Jones industrial average would reach 3,000 in five years - a startling prediction at a time of considerable market distress. **********In a telephone interview from his home base in Lyford Cay, Nassau, the Bahamas, yesterday, he discussed the stocks he has been buying in his continuing quest for market gains. He mentioned as he always did that the overall market itself did not have to go up for his portfolio to profit if he chose individual stocks with skill. But his portfolio would, of course, do better if a rousing bull market developed, he added. **********Mr. Templeton is not the only investor who thinks there is a good chance of a considerably higher market in the years ahead. However, few of the optimists have so much at stake. He has managed the $600 million Templeton Growth Fund with signal success over the years. **********A $10,000 investment in 1954 would have bee n worth $374,000 through April 30, 1981, had all distributions been reinvested. This record has earned Mr. Templeton a reputation in Wall Street as a stock picker without peer. **********Mr. Templeton also manages the five-year-old Templeton World Fund, which experienced explosive asset growth in reaching $588 million at the end of January. The World Fund duplicates the holdings of the Growth Fund and is based in the United States. Individuals here can own the World Fund without paying the penalties imposed on foreigners who buy the Canadian-based Growth Fund. **********That Dow 3,000 prediction comes about through Mr. Templeton's usual approach to investments. In short, he buys bargains. At current prices, he says the market, as measured by the Dow industrials, represents the best bargain in his lifetime. **********Looking back to the Depression, Mr. Templeton notes that the stock market reached a valuation nadir in June 1932. At that point, the Dow Jones industrials had fallen from their peak level of 360 in September 1929 down to 42. Prices, then, were one-ninth as high as they were before the crash. **********Even so, replacement costs of the assets owned by the 30 companies making up the Dow were 20 percent less than the combined book values of the Dow companies. The contrast today is startling. On the same basis, replacement costs of the 30 Dow stocks are 70 percent above combined book values. Translated into market terms, the replacement costs for the 30 Dow components would amount to 1,700. Yesterday, the Dow closed at roughly half that level, or 830.57. **********In the telephone interview, Mr. Templeton said that people who said wistfully that it would be wonderful to get the great bargains of June 1932 failed to recognize that prices were far lower now. **********Ever cautious - Mr. Templeton once said that he made far too many mistakes - he added that he was talking long-term, not short-term.  It is entirely possible in his view that the market will drop 20 percent more before prices go higher. **********If so, Mr. Templeton will not be stuck with a lot of high-priced shares. For he is still buying shares at low price/earnings ratios, as he did in 1939 when he borrowed $10,000 to buy $100 worth of every stock selling for no more than $1 a share on each of the two major exchanges. Thirty-four of the 104 companies that qualified were bankrupt. Still, he liquidated his account four years later for $40,000. **********Under the securities rules, Mr. Templeton cannot disclose the shares he is buying today. But he has completed his buying in the following: **********American Standard was purchased at 4.8 times this year's earnings.  He notes that Alcan Aluminium is selling at 15 times this year's earnings but estimates that, in five years, earnings could reach $12 a share, up from the current $1.25. There is the Australian & New Zealand Banking Corporation, now at 4.4 times this year's earnings.  and a position in Canadian Pacific Enterprises at 3.8 times the year's earnings. **********He notes that Champion International, the building materials and paper product company, is selling at a somewhat high price relative to this year' s earnings at 8, but says current earnings are ''depressed.' ' The Ewnia Insurance Company of the Netherlands, a recent purcha se, is selling at 3.3 times this year's earnings. Gulf Oil, another new holding, sells at 4.2 times this year's earnings. **********Heck's Inc., a Charleston, W.Va., discount store chain, is at 4.7 times this year's earnings. It is at that low multiple, he notes, although the company has not had a down year in the last 20. **********Mr. Templeton has also completed his buying in a publisher named News International of London, now selling at 1.6 times this year's earnings. He bought Northern Trust of Chicago, which is selling at 4.3 times this year's earnings. He has also purchased shares of Republic New York, the bank-holding company, at 4.6 times this year's earnings, and shares of the Royal Bank of Canada, now selling at 3.8 times this year's earnings. **********He bought Royal Dutch Petroleum at 3.5 times this year's earnings, and United States Home at 5.3 times this year's earnings. Recently Mr. Templeton purchased Union Carbide, selling at 4.5 times this year's earnings. As the name of the World Fund suggests, Mr.  Templeton roams the globe in search of bargains. Whether he will continue to do as well as in the past with twice as much money to put to work remains to be seen."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/01/world/spain-s-new-leader-outlines-cautious-plans-to-parliament.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 556, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SPAIN'S NEW LEADER OUTLINES CAUTIOUS PLANS TO PARLIAMENT", "print_headline": "SPAIN'S NEW LEADER OUTLINES CAUTIOUS PLANS TO PARLIAMENT", "body_text": " **********Felipe Gonzalez said today that his new Cabinet would pursue a domestic policy of austerity and would review its military ties to the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. **********In a 70-minute address to Parliament, Mr. Gonzalez, who led his Socialist Party to victory in the election Oct. 28, outlined a domestic and foreign posture as moderate and cautious as the men he has carefully picked for the first Socialist Cabinet since the Spanish Civil War. A parliamentary vote naming the 40-year-old Mr.  Gonzalez Spain's third Prime Minister since the death of Francisco Franco is expected Wednesday or Thursday after a full debate. **********Mr. Gonzalez promised an economic program that he acknowledged could have been adopted by the center-right Governments that led the country for six years; although standing by an electoral pledge to create 800,000 new jobs over the next four years, he called for greater domestic saving, promised to encourage private investment and rejected any nationalizations or major state intervention in the economy. Few Bold Changes **********''The people have voted for change, and it is our duty to fulfill it,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. ''The singularity of the program does not lie so much in the details as in the manner of its execution.'' Aside from a broad commitment to modernizing and streamlining the administration, the boldest specific changes he sketched were a new university law and a bill to prohibit politicians and high state officials from holding more than one Government post. **********Mr. Gonzalez's cautious approach is dictated by an extremely difficult economic situation - Spain's unemployment of 16 percent is the highest in the West - and by distrust of the Socialists by some senior businessmen and the conservative military establishment. **********The Socialist leader offered only the bare bones of a foreign policy. He said it would not be presumptuous for Spain to expect to enter the European Economic Community within the next four years, extending somewhat a demand by his future Deputy Prime Minister, Alfonso Guerra, that Spain be admitted by 1985 or withdraw its application. Bases Treaty With U.S. **********Mr. Gonzalez insisted that while Spain was a member of ''the Western world,'' his Government would ''examine with all attention'' its military treaty with the United States and ''restudy with the necessary rigor'' its six-month-old membership in NATO. He reasserted Spain's longstanding claim to the British colony of Gibraltar but hinted that his Government wanted to open the land frontier that has been shut since 1969. **********His language on the Atlantic alliance appeared to confirm a statement by Fernando Moran, the next Foreign Minister, that the new Government will stop work on Spain's integration into the NATO military structure. But, according to Socialist sources, the Government will not pull out of the alliance. **********In selecting members for his Cabinet, Mr. Gonzalez picked a team considerably more moderate than the sometimes radical base of his party. The new Economics Minister will be Miguel Boyer, a 43-year-old representative of the party's Social Democratic wing who has considerable experience in Spanish industry. The key Defense Ministry post will be held by Narcis Serra, the Mayor of Barcelona. The Interior Ministry will be run by Jose Barrionuevo, who was in charge of the Madrid police force."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/17/business/congressmen-plan-a-court-challenge.html": {"writer_name": "Hedrick Smith", "pub_date": "1982-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 798, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONGRESSMEN PLAN A COURT CHALLENGE", "print_headline": "CONGRESSMEN PLAN A COURT CHALLENGE", "body_text": " **********A bipartisan group of Congressmen has decided to file suit this week to challenge the constitutionality of the $98.3 billion tax bill before Congress on the ground that it originated in the Senate and not in the House of Representatives as the Constitution requires. **********Representative W. Henson Moore, a Louisiana Republican, said today that despite pressures from the White House and the House Republican leadership and the personal disapproval of President Reagan, he would take the lead in filing a lawsuit in Federal court before the scheduled vote on the tax bill on Thursday. **********Representatives Philip M. Crane of Illinois and James G. Martin of North Carolina, both conservative Republicans, and Carroll Hubbard Jr. of Kentucky and Stephen L. Neal of North Carolina, both conservative Democrats, said they would join the suit. Still Supports Reagan **********Mr. Moore said that, unlike some conservatives, he does not oppose raising taxes now, nor does he want to break with President Reagan politically. But he stated that he felt on principle that the Federal courts should be asked to reassert constitutional procedures. **********In a telephone interview, he contended that the legislative strategy of the Administration and House leadership had ''made a mockery of the Constitution'' by allowing the Senate Finance Committee to write a complete tax bill and the Senate to pass it, without the proposal ever being reviewed by the House before being sent to a House-Senate conference committee. **********''This is the first time in the Reagan Administration that I've not been on the President's team,'' said Mr. Moore, a four-term Republican. ''A lot of us were shocked by the procedure when it was first brought up. I told the President at the White House on Aug. 5 about my feelings and the probable lawsuit and he was not very happy.'' **********Mr. Moore continued: ''Their approach has been, 'Let's break the rules. Let's brush aside the Constitution.' As much as I want the President to win, as much as I want to help with the deficits and to bring down interest rates, I can't be a part of that. I just think this is wrong.'' **********Although the Senate has modified tax bills in the past and has even originated bills raising funds in various ways, Mr. Moore and his colleagues contend that the procedure followed this year was unprecedented. **********The Representatives contend that they must file suit now, before the bill becomes law. Waiting to let a taxpayers suit begin the process later on, Mr. Moore said, could lead to a protracted fight in the tax courts. **********The suit by the Congressmen will be based on the first clause of Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution, which states: ''All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.'' **********Earlier this year, the House passed H.R.4961 which included six minor, technical modifications of the tax code, each reducing revenues slightly. The Senate Finance Committee removed all six provisions, Mr. Moore said, and wrote its own tax bill, which included 107 different provisions. **********''The only things they kept were the House enrollment number and the 'be it enacted' clause,'' complained Mr. Martin. The Separation Question **********Representative Barber B. Conable Jr. of upstate New York, ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said that historically Federal courts had been unwilling ''to go beyond the H.R. number'' - designating that the bill had technically originated in the House - ''because they don't like to intrude on the internal functions of Congress because of the doctrine of separation of powers.'' **********For his part, Mr. Moore, a lawyer who specialized in constitutional law at Louisiana State University, cited the case of Hubbard v. Lowe in 1915, in which a Federal court voided a bill that had begun in the Senate and to which the House added a tax provision. Even though the tax action was initiated by the House, he said, the court nullified the bill because it had been enrolled with a Senate number and was thus deemed a Senate revenue bill. **********In another case, United States v. James, he said, lawyers had been advised that the courts allowed Senate-originated legislation changing the price of stamps in 1875 - from one cent for a two-ounce letter to one cent for a one-ounce letter - on grounds that that was not a revenue-raising bill in the sense of the Constitution. **********''Our case clearly does not fall under that type of decision,'' Mr. Moore said. ''This is not about postage stamps. This is the largest revenue-raising bill in history.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/27/business/atlantic-richfield-rises-2.6.html": {"writer_name": "Dylan Landis", "pub_date": "1982-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 372, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ATLANTIC RICHFIELD RISES 2.6%", "print_headline": "ATLANTIC RICHFIELD RISES 2.6%", "body_text": " **********The Atlantic Richfield Company, the nation's seventh-largest oil concern, said yesterday that net income for the second quarter rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier, to $409.8 million, or $1.62 a share, from $399.6 million, or $1.60 a share.

A partner in the concern, she is project manager for Tower 49, as the new building is to be called. The project is a joint venture with the First Boston Corporation. **********At first Solomon Equities owned a handful of office buildings and apartment buildings in the city and concentrated on upgrading them.  Then in July 1981 Mr. Solomon spotted an opportunity to start a major Manhattan office development project. He said Tower 49 had its origins when a group of British investors wanted to sell a partial assemblage in midblock. **********In the next six months, Mr. Solomon said, the property was acquired, with the British group remaining as limited partners. Then additional parcels were bought to complete the assemblage, a financial package was worked out with First Boston, more than 100 commercial tenants were vacated, project plans were raced through city offices to become eligible for the expiring midtown zoning laws and air rights were purchased from some surrounding properties to enhance the size of the building. **********The initial work was swift and expensive. Mr. Solomon grimaces when asked about the cost of vacating tenants and paying some of them to break their leases. He denied a story that he had paid Adonis Gargassoulas $2.3 million to vacate his dance studio at 9 East 48th Street four years before the lease expired. ''That's a privileged matter,'' he insisted, adding that the figure ''was less than $2 million.'' **********Solomon Equities also paid a dollar short of $1 million to the Church of Sweden at 5 East 48th Street for air rights over the building. **********Tower 49 is virtually an all-consuming project for Solomon Equities. The company's only other properties now are two apartment buildings at 55 East 86th Street and 50 East 72d street - both to become condominiums. **********The design for Tower 49, a 16-sided building sheathed in soft green glass with about 15,000 square feet per floor, is being done by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. The building will have a landscaped public plaza, and there will be 13,000 feet of retail space at and below street level. **********Mrs. Solomon, who met David when they were both studying architecture at Cornell University, has focused on the development side of the project, working with the architects and construction managers of the Tishman Construction Corporation. She used to be a loan officer for Citibank. **********Mr. Solomon has concentrated on financing and on vacating tenants for the project. Before starting his own company, he had been a partner in another New York real estate firm, Nelson & Solomon Associates. He said he had also taught architecture at the University of Virginia and Harvard. **********A working partnership between husband and wife in a small company has presented no problems, the Solomons said. ''I like to say we work side by side, not together,'' Mrs. Solomon said. It's a subtle distinction that both feel is important. They have divided their labors so successfully, Mr. Solomon said, that sometimes they work all day without ever seeing each other. **********At a time when many sages of the real estate business in New York are worrying about the market, Mr. Solomon insists that his leasing prospects look good. Like other developers with projects in progress, Mr. Solomon sees a continued demand for quality office space in midtown. He said space in Tower 49 would lease for about $40 or $45 a square foot. **********The First Boston Corporation, an international investing banking and securities concern, is a relative newcomer to Manhattan real estate development.

This allows a company to issue securities ''off the shelf,'' without further disclosure, after the initial filing has been made. Exxon filed the notes with the S.E.C. yesterday. **********The company said that the securities would be issued through the Bermuda office of Exxon Finance N.V., a subsidiary based in the Netherlands Antilles. Bermuda currently has no withholding tax on capital gains. Exxon said that it planned to issue the securities in stages throughout the rest of 1982 on whichever market had most favorable rates at the time. **********Morgan Stanley Inc., which has been Exxon's investment banker for many previous securities issues, declined to comment on the announcement, except to say that it intended to ''remain competitive in a marketplace in which there will be increasing experimentation and aggressive competition.'' 'A Matter of Flexibility' **********''It's a matter of flexibility,'' said Jack F. Bennett, a senior vice president of Exxon, at a news conference at the company's headquarters. ''The 'shelf' rule will allow us to sell at the most attractive times on the most attractive markets: Today Europe may be most attractive; next week that may change.'' The issue will be the company's only external financing in 1982, he added. **********According to the statement to the S.E.C., Exxon's pending securities would be issued in both bearer and fully registered forms. Those issued in registered form, most common for bond issues in the United States, would be $1,000 each, while those in bearer form, more often used in the Eurobond market, would be issued in denominations of $1,000 and $5,000 each. The minimum investment in either form, however, would be $100,000. **********Both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's have assigned a provisional AAA rating to the securities. Mr. Bennett said that the maturities and terms of the issues had not yet been determined. However, he said, he expected most to be in the three- to five-year area, possibly with provisions for extension to 15 years. Sales to Private Investors **********Mr. Bennett said the securities would be sold to private investors as well as to investment banks. Under previous S.E.C. rules, such issues would have been sold through a specific investment bank, or syndicate; under Rule 415, the company may split its issue among several investment houses, or sell directly to investors. **********Exxon is the 11th company to have announced a securities issue under Rule 415. Other large registrants include Du Pont, Citicorp and American Telephone and Telegraph. So far, however, there have been no sales because of the delay required between filing a statement and issuing the securities. **********Analysts said that Exxon was probably issuing the securities now to compensate for a cash-flow problem caused by falling oil prices, which has hurt earnings at all the major oil companies. They added that the money would probably not be applied to any single project.  The planned sale would be Exxon's first offering of guaranteed registered debt since 1976."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/09/business/toyota-and-gm-study-joint-plant.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1982-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1330, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TOYOTA AND G.M.

STUDY JOINT PLANT", "body_text": " **********The world's two largest auto makers, the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Company, are discussing joint production of small cars in the United States, Toyota said today. **********In a three-sentence statement, the Japanese company confirmed that on March 1, Eiji Toyoda, president of Toyota, and Roger B. Smith, chairman of G.M., had met in New York to discuss the possibilities of such a venture. ''The two companies have committed themselves to give further consideration to this possibility,'' the statement said. ''It is too early for any additional announcement.'' **********(General Motors, in Detroit, confirmed the Toyota announcement in an equally brief statement.  (In Grand Rapids, Mich., F. James McDonald, president of General Motors, said in a speech that, if an agreement with Toyota were reached, the joint venture would build 400,000 to 500,000 small cars annually, The Associated Press reported. ''It's imperative for us that we be in the small-car business,'' Mr. McDonald added.) The statement by Toyota was apparently prompted by a report of the March 1 meeting in this morning's issue of Nihon Keizai, Japan's leading economic newspaper. **********If the talks did lead to joint production, it would be the most significant of the international ties between car producers. ''This announcement will send a tremor through the industry worldwide,'' said an executive for the Nissan Motor Company, who asked not to be identified. **********For General Motors, a link with Toyota would offer access to the Japanese company's small-car technology and manufacturing expertise, which analysts here said the American company needed. **********''G.M. has not been so successful yet with its small lines like the 'J' car,'' said Yukio Kobayashi, an analyst for the Nomura Securities Company. ''If G.M. had full confidence in its ability to develop small cars by itself, it would not talk to Toyota.'' **********According to Nihon Keizai, the tentative plan calls for production of small cars that would be designed by Toyota and built in a currently idle G.M. plant. The plan, the newspaper reported, had been prepared by G.M. The first high-level contact between the two companies, it added, had been in December, when Seishi Kato, chairman of the Toyota Motor Sales Company, called on Mr. Smith in Detroit to suggest joint production. Advantages to Toyota **********For Toyota, a joint venture with G.M. would represent a comparatively low-risk means of starting to produce cars in the United States. A cooperative effort might also help deflect any drive to place further restrictions on imports of Japanese autos to the United States. **********Toyota has been actively interested in beginning auto production in the United States for more than a year. Last July, Toyota and the Ford Motor Company suspended months of inconclusive negotiations on a possible joint venture. **********Recently, three extensive studies for Toyota were completed to assess the advantages and pitfalls of setting up an American production facility. They were done by the Nomura Research Institute, Arthur D. Little and S.R.I., formerly the Stamford Research Institute and now a private consulting group. Their results have not been disclosed. Company Has Been Reluctant **********Unlike Nissan, which is building a $300 million plant near Nashville to make light trucks, Toyota has been reluctant to start its own manufacturing facility in the United States. Its biggest concern is whether it can transplant its highly efficient manufacturing system into a different cultural context. **********Toyota does have a small plant in Long Beach, Calif., where it makes truck beds; the plant, opened in 1972, is part of the company's testing of the American manufacturing climate. According to the company, productivity at the California plant remains 30 percent below that of comparable operations in Japan. **********''Joining with G.M. would give Toyota a way of going into the U.S.  without making a big investment and taking a big risk,'' said Hisamichi Sawa, a director of Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Ltd. of Japan. **********Given the current trade tensions between Japan and the United States, the Japanese Government has been encouraging companies in sensitive industries such as autos to join in projects with American concerns. **********''If Toyota does link in some way with General Motors, we would welcome it as an important instance of industrial cooperation between companies from the two countries,'' said Yoshiyasu Nao, deputy director of the automobile division of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. ---- The View From Detroit Special to the New York Times **********DETROIT, March 8 - Industry analysts were skeptical of Toyota's motives for entering the talks.  Some said that Toyota might try to use the negotiations to deflect growing trade frictions between the United States and Japan by emphasizing a willingness to make cars here, thus reducing auto exports to the United States. **********''There is some thought in Detroit that Toyota actually has no plans to build cars in the United States, that they are just buying time'' against growing American protectionism, said one industry executive, who asked not to be identified. **********But one analyst disagreed. ''The motivation for Toyota is mostly political,'' said David Healy, of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., in New York. ''If they were making a financial decision, they would continue to make cars in Japan. Nevertheless, I think they will do it. Toyota has been very conservative in the past, but now with Nissan and Honda planning vehicle production here,'' pressure on Toyota has increased, he said. Failed Talks With Ford Cited **********The skeptics pointed to last year's failed negotiations between Toyota and Ford as evidence that Toyota might not be serious. Those talks failed partly because the two sides could not agree on what kind of vehicle to build. **********Toyota has lagged behind its Japanese competitors in moving some production to this country. In addition to Nissan's Nashville plant, The Honda Motor Company is planning to build passenger cars in Marysville, Ohio, where it currently makes motorcycles. **********General Motors is interested in joint production with Toyota as a means of reducing the investment the company would have to make to produce a new line to replace the aging Chevette subcompact, Mr.  Healy said. G.M. has already made huge investments in new mid-sized, front-wheel drive models, but the prolonged sales slump has forced the No.1 auto maker to defer capital investment for some lines. **********G.M. could ''shift off the small car development costs when it comes times to replace the Chevette,'' Mr. Healy said. ''I think the sharp-pencil guys at G.M. took a look at it and figured they couldn't do it'' - profitably build a new line of subcompacts - ''in the United States.'' Possible Sites in California **********If a joint production venture were agreed upon, attention will focus on two G.M. assembly plants in California, at Fremont and South Gate. G.M., which has announced that it is closing these plants, refused to comment on the possibility they would be used in a venture with Toyota. **********Such a venture would complicate the already entangled alliances among the world's major auto makers.  G.M. owns 34.2 percent of Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan, which has supplied G.M. with small pickup trucks, deisel engines and other components. G.M. has also purchased a 5 percent interest in the Suzuki Motor Company, and industry observers have speculated that Suzuki and G.M. will eventually begin joint production of minicars.  ''It does get complicated'' if Isuzu, Suzuki and Toyota all get involved in joint ventures with General Motors, Mr. Healy conceded. **********Ford owns 25 percent of Toyo Kogyo of Japan, which makes Mazda cars. The Chrysler Corporation has developed close ties with the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and owns 15 percent of that Japanese auto maker. Mitsubishi and Chrysler said last month that they were discussing joint small-car production in the United States."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/27/business/santa-fe-coal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Santa Fe Coal", "print_headline": "Santa Fe Coal", "body_text": " **********Santa Fe Industries said that it would invest $140 million in the development of a coal mine, the Lee Ranch Mine, in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico.

Habib, the special United States envoy, that they would accept some Palestinians, coupled with the willingness of Jordan and Iraq to take others, raised hopes here that the evacuation of the Palestine Liberation Organization from Lebanon could begin as early as the middle of next week. **********''Habib now has to take everything that has been agreed upon in principle with the P.L.O. and put it together in a formal package for withdrawal,'' said former Prime Minister Saeb Salam of Lebanon, the main intermediary. ''The only major question left is the Israelis.'' **********Plan to Be Conveyed to Israel **********Lebanese officials said they expected Mr. Habib to convey to Israel this evening the results of the negotiations during the last three days so that they can be considered at Sunday's meeting of the Israeli Cabinet. **********(In Jerusalem, a high-ranking official said Israel would not accept a withdrawal plan under which a substantial number of Palestinian guerrillas would still be in west Beirut while a peacekeeping force was being deployed.) **********There is always the danger that either side could derail the plan by stirring up a clash along the battlefront. That fact was underlined this evening when a brief duel involving artillery, machine guns and rockets broke out between Israeli troops entrenched around Beirut International Airport in the southern suburbs and Palestinian guerrillas in the Burj al Brajneh refugee camp. **********Egypt and Syria previously demanded various forms of political compensation for consenting to take in the guerrillas, but a Lebanese official indicated that the demands had been abandoned. He quoted Mr. Habib as having said, ''That problem has been solved.'' **********Asked whether all the Arab nations had now agreed to take guerrillas so that a withdrawal could be carried out, Prime Minister Shafik al-Wazzan of Lebanon said, ''We have sufficient answers to start a comfortable implementation.'' **********According to senior Lebanese officials, a meeting is set for Sunday at the presidential palace in Baabda, a southeast suburb of Beirut, between Mr. Habib and military experts from France, the United States and Lebanon, with the Lebanese representing both themselves and the Palestinians. **********The meeting will draw up a final plan and timetable for the withdrawal, specifying exit routes and forms of transportation and the deployment of a peacekeeping force, made up mainly of French and Americans, in the Palestinian camps and around west Beirut in conjunction with the Lebanese Army. **********The Beirut radio said that a French military delegation arrived today and that the United States would be represented by an embassy military attache. The meeting is expected to last 48 hours. **********It is understood that Mr. Habib is waiting for a list from the Palestinians stating precisely how many people would be leaving, their affiliations and their destinations. **********There are three categories of Palestinian armed personnel in west Beirut: part-time militiamen, who are Palestinian civilians living and working in Lebanon; professional soldiers belonging to one or another of the eight member groups in the P.L.O. coalition and, most importantly, three brigades of the Palestine Liberation Army. **********The army is made up of Palestinian refugees organized into brigades that are attached to the army of the country in which the Palestinians reside. At the moment there are four brigades stationed in Lebanon - one each from Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. **********Since the start of the Israeli siege of west Beirut, most officials have said that there weare about 6,000 Palestinian military people trapped in west Beirut. It now appears that the number is closer to 9,000, Lebanese Government sources said. Since the P.L.O. does not keep a formal roster of military personnel, it may take some time to come up with a list. **********Lebanese officials described Mr. Habib as confident that if he can tie up all the details with the Palestinians and the Lebanese, he will be able to bring the full weight of the United States to bear on Israel to accept the deal. **********There is no difference between the basic objectives of his plan and what Israel has been demanding, since both want an immediate Palestinian withdrawal from Lebanon. There are, however, differences over details. **********Israel wants the peacekeeping force to arrive here only after the Palestinians have left. The Israelis fear that if the force is interposed between them and the Palestinians, the Palestinians will not leave, or at least not all of them. **********According to the Habib plan, the peacekeeping force would be deployed at the start of the Palestinian withdrawal. The basic idea is for the force to arrive in the morning and begin to take over Palestinian frontline positions. The Palestinians would then begin withdrawing in the afternoon and continue doing so in stages over a period of 14 days. Arrival Time of Peace Force **********Mr. Habib conceded the point of the earlier arrival of the peace force because the Sunni Moslem leaders in west Beirut were making the same demand. They fear that the Palestinians' withdrawal would encourage the Israelis and their Lebanese Christian Phalangist allies in east Beirut to try to impose their authority in the predominantly Moslem western sector. **********''We want to be protected from the Israelis and Phalangists as much as the Palestinian refugees do,'' said former Prime Minister Salam, who is the titular head of west Beirut's Sunni Moslem community. **********The Israelis have expressed no preference for the mode of withdrawal, except for the stipulation that the Palestinians take only their personal weapons with them. The Palestinians have conceded that point, saying that they will turn over their heavy weapons to the Lebanese Army on the last day of the evacuation. **********Another potential problem is that the Israelis want the Palestinian military removed from all of Lebanon. The question remains whether this is meant to cover the estimated 5,000 Palestinians in the northern port of Tripoli and in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley. **********These Palestinians are not covered by the Habib plan, although there is a basic understanding that they will either leave or subject themselves to Lebanese authority as soon as the P.L.O. leadership departs. Lebanese Government sources said they expected the leadership to go to Damascus, where the P.L.O. maintains its formal headquarters. **********Finally, the P.L.O. will be allowed to keep a diplomatic mission in Beirut, as it has in other Arab capitals, and it is not clear how Israel will react. ---- Israeli Aide's Reaction Cool Special to the New York Times **********JERUSALEM, Aug. 7 - A high-ranking Israeli official said tonight that Israel would not accept an evacuation plan under which a substantial **********The official said that Israel had not received any new plan, but that it would not accept a plan that would provide the deployment of a peace force on the **********''The vast bulk of them must be gone before the peacekeeping force gets into place,'' the official said.

All good things come to an end, however, and they did for Mr. Tsai in 1968, when the five mutual funds he managed - the most noted was the Manhattan Fund - entered a bear market. Their values plunged and so, correspondingly, did Mr. Tsai's reputation for financial wizardry. **********But Mr. Tsai (pronounced sigh) walked away from that debacle about $30 million richer - the profit from the sale of his mutual fund management company to the CNA Financial Corporation of Chicago. In the years since, his public visibility has receded, but his riches have increased. Today, at 53, he is an executive vice president and the largest shareholder of the American Can Company, a $5 billion packaging concern, and has grandiose plans for turning the sluggish, old-line manufacturing company into a department store of financial services. **********It is an endeavor that has more than its share of skeptics.  American Can, which has suffered from steadily declining earnings, has a history of ill-fated acquisitions, leading some analysts to question the wisdom of this move. And, the healthy price American Can paid to acquire Mr. Tsai - by way of buying the Associated Madison Companies, the insurance company he controlled - has caused some to wonder whether American Can or Gerald Tsai got the better deal. **********''This is something that bears close watching,'' said George Thompson, an insurance industry analyst with E.F. Hutton. ''American Can's track record is questionable when it comes to diversifying into businesses they are not entirely familiar with. But they'll probably dive in with both feet. They've been known to change their course in the past. And nothing Tsai does surprises me. He always seems to land on his feet.'' **********IN this case, Mr. Tsai has certainly landed upright. As owner of 669,613 shares of American Can - just under 4 percent -with a market value of slightly over $18 million, Mr. Tsai, who was recently named to the company's board, owns more of its shares than the rest of its directors combined. As head of the American Can's financial services sector, Mr. Tsai will receive a $248,500 yearly salary plus a maximum $350,000 bonus a year. **********But Mr. Tsai has always had a knack for getting the best out of a situation. ''With Gerry, you don't bet the horse, you bet the jockey,'' said one close business associate. ''You invest when Gerry invests, and you get out when he does. He starts Manhattan Fund, sells it to CNA and makes a personal fortune. He leaves CNA and buys Associated Madison and sells that for a fortune. How many times can you do that? I don't know.'' **********There was a time when Mr. Tsai was the king of Wall Street. Glowing newspaper and magazine articles sang the praises of a man with a Midas touch. The CBS television network even aired a documentary about his money magic. **********While he has slipped from public view, he says that bothers him little. ''I really don't miss those days,'' he said in an interview in his Pan Am building office, which is decorated with family photographs, an aerial picture of his 10-acre waterfront estate in Greenwich, Conn., and models of the helicopter he once piloted for relaxation. (A forced landing in the Hudson River made him think twice about his hobby.) **********Nonetheless, while not missed, those days are certainly remembered. He has a press kit ready with information about his 30-year career as an investor and, while generally exuding calmness, he bristles at any suggestion that the performance of his mutual funds was less than stellar. ''For eight years, we were always at the top,'' he said.  ''People don't remember that. We had one bad year - 1968 - and they criticize me. But I wasn't even managing the fund. I had two portfolio managers, and they managed it.'' **********The move to American Can is the culmination of a desire - the desire to build a financial services supermarket - that began two decades ago, and he is quick to stress that his dream existed before Sears, Roebuck & Company and Dean Witter got into the act. **********''I had the idea long before them,'' he declared. ''For many years, even back in 1965, I remember telling people that 'Someday you will see a building and it will have a bank on the first floor, an S.& L.  on the second, a brokerage next and then an insurance company, and a cemetery on the 13th floor. It will be a financial department store.' '' he said **********''That's been in my head for all those years and today I'm doing what I've dreamed of all that time. I really want to build a large successful financial services company. I have an obsession to do that.'' **********American Can apparently shares that obsession. Finding its core paper products and container business on the decline, it has been trying to latch onto higher growth areas, and had decided late last year to expand more heavily into financial services, which promise higher returns and less capital investment. **********About that time, Mr. Tsai saw a newspaper article on American Can's intention to use the proceeds of the sale of some of its forest product assets to pay for its foray into financial services. Mr. Tsai proposed a meeting with William S. Woodside, chairman of American Can, and the two spied opportunity in each other. **********''WHEN the opportunity arose with Mr. Tsai, it was too good an opportunity to let go by,'' said Mr. Woodside. ''Gerry Tsai is one of the key factors in our whole financial service sector, and when we bought his company, we were more interested in buying Gerry.'' **********Mr. Woodside said that American Can plans to invest at least $500 million in financial services and anticipates that the sector will have more than $1 billion in assets within three years. He said he and Mr. Tsai had decided to expand into two areas: buying more specialty insurance companies and expanding into related financial services such as the brokerage business. But Mr. Woodside's plans are still fuzzy. **********''It depends on what comes up,'' Mr. Woodside said. ''We're openminded about it. We have no specific thing next; it depends on an opportunity, the price and the potential for growth.'' **********Since coming to American Can last April, Mr. Tsai has already orchestrated the $152 million acquisition of the Transport Life Insurance Company, a specialty insurer based in Fort Worth. At a price equal to 10 times the earnings of Transport Life, analysts noted that Mr. Tsai had paid top dollar for his first acquisition.  ''How do you maintain earnings at those prices?'' one analyst said. **********More recently, American Can received permission to operate a money market fund - the National Benefit Life Daily Income Fund - which would be distributed through the Associated Madison insurance companies. **********Some say breaking into financial services is not as simple as merely buying up finance companies. ''It's like asking how fast Dean Witter can get into the phonograph, greeting card or beer bottle business,'' Robert H. Stovall, senior vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds, said. ''It's a different business and would take quite a while. It has taken us a couple generations to build Dean Witter.  When we think of the competition, we think about those in the business today rather than somebody like American Can.'' **********Mr. Tsai, however, is undaunted and says it is not his intention to compete with giants like Dean Witter anyway. ''That's not our game plan,'' he said. American Can, he said, will find its own niches. **********Mr. Tsai's history on Wall Street, however, is an interesting tale in itself, a story in which he became richer at every stop along the way. **********In 1968, when Mr. Tsai sold his mutual fund management company to CNA, he moved over, too, as a top executive and a CNA director. This sale had netted him a tidy profit. He had initially invested between $500,000 and $1 million (he says he can't recall the exact number) to start the funds and received stock valued at about $30 million when he sold them to CNA. **********(Fortunately for Mr. Tsai, he got out in time. In June 1971 a United States appeals court ruled that any profits from the sale of a mutual fund management company must go to the fund shareholders and not to the fund managers.) **********Then, in 1973 , after selling his CNA stock, he left the company to form his own institutional brokerage firm, G. Tsai & Company, a private, 30-person brokerage firm with offices in New York, Boston and Los Angeles, and formed his own personal holding company, the Tsai Financial Corporation. Through Tsai Financial, he made his investments. **********In 1978, Mr. Tsai spent $2.2 million to buy the controlling interest in Associated Madison Companies, a relatively modest insurance company. After greatly expanding the company's operations and investing another $2.4 million, Associated Madison was sold to American Can for $127 million in cash and stock. **********Mr. Tsai, who earned $429,290 a year as chairman of Associated Madison, also owned 18.6 percent of Associated Madison's common shares, which he exchanged for $18 million in American Can stock. **********Close associates describe Mr. Tsai as extremely courteous and gentle, devoted to his family, and as a workaholic who exists on little sleep. Indeed, Mr. Tsai, in all seriousness, said he wishes that someone could ''invent a pill so that one doesn't have to sleep.'' Even his nightly sleep of five hours is interrupted by thoughts. ''I write myself notes all through the night,'' he said, pulling a card from his pocket covered with his nocturnal scribblings. These sleeping habits ''give him a leg up on normal human beings,'' said John Rosenwald Jr., a director of Associated Madison and a senior partner at Bear Stearns & Company, the brokerage firm. **********MR. TSAI'S office, as his demeanor, is calm. Dressed immaculately in a gray suit and gray tie, he sits behind a large desk with a slick black top and only three papers neatly resting on it. There are several blank computer screens at his elbow. Modern art - a large canvas with bright stripes -covers one wall and a panorama of the city spreads out from a picture window behind his desk. **********It is from this spot that Mr. Tsai mapped his plans. Indeed, his first step toward his goal of heading a financial services company was his interest in Associated Madison. **********''Associated Madison was a cheap, small, solid company,'' said William A. Shea, an Associated Madison director and senior partner at Shea & Gould, a Manhattan law firm. ''It was a good little company and a good place to start.'' **********Mr. Tsai, who did not have prior experience in the insurance business, is credited by analysts with turning a sleepy insurance company around and supervising the growth of its assets to $180 million from $50 million. **********As chairman of Associated Madison, he made three key moves. He lured top insurance executives from the rival United States Life Corporation with promises of managerial freedom and attractive salaries; he bought National Benefit Life, a high-growth massmarketing insurance company, and he upgraded Associated Madison's investment portfolio to increase its yield. **********He says he earned a return ''substantially higher'' than 15 percent from Associated Madison's investment portfolio and points out that running an insurance company, with its large pools of investment money, is ''not different than running a mutual fund.'' But while Associated Madison was growing, it was still not large enough to satisfy Mr. Tsai's ambitions. **********''He would smell opportunity, and someone bigger would end up taking the deal,'' Mr. Rosenwald said. ''A number of acquisition ideas were frustrated when bigger companies snapped up the things he identified.'' **********And National Benefit Life was developing some unanticipated problems. Its inside financial controls were flimsier than first thought, making cost control difficult, and some of its reserves were insufficient. ''The problems at National Benefit were bigger than they thought, and they saw a few rough quarters ahead,'' said Thomas G. Richter, an insurance analyst with Robinson-Humphrey/ American Express in Atlanta. **********Even without the problems, large amounts of capital were essential if National Benefit was to grow. ''We were growing so fast, we needed new capital,'' said Mr. Tsai. And, hence, when he picked up the newspaper that day and read about American Can, Mr. Tsai's interest was piqued. **********Today, Mr. Tsai has his capital, he has a comfortable corporate position, and he has the ability to add more stories to his financial department store. But it did not come without a price -his independence. Giving that up, he said, was a long and hard decision.  Instead of making business decisions alone, he now has a boss, something on the minus side of the ledger when he analyzed the deal.  But he has accepted the trade-off with a philosophical calmness.  ''You can't,'' he added, ''have everything in life.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/23/world/habib-being-sent-to-arab-capitals.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1982-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 800, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HABIB BEING SENT TO ARAB CAPITALS", "print_headline": "HABIB BEING SENT TO ARAB CAPITALS", "body_text": " **********Philip C. Habib, the special Middle East envoy, is being sent by President Reagan to Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and possibly other Arab countries to try to persuade them to accept the Palestine Liberation Organization forces in west Beirut as part of a solution to the Lebanon crisis. **********Administration officials said the decision to have Mr. Habib leave Beirut for the weeklong mission, which will include a visit to Israel, was taken when it seemed that the Arabs were not moving quickly enough on working out a way for evacuating the Palestinian forces. It is feared that Israel will lose its patience and move its troops into west Beirut. **********Today's Israeli attacks against Syrian and Palestinian positions in eastern Lebanon and west Beirut were regarded by officials as part of Israeli psychological pressure, meant to warn that force would be used, if necessary, to insure the withdrawal of the Palestinians. **********Arab Plan Presented **********The White House and the State Department said Mr. Habib's mission was intended ''to explore further the ideas and understandings that have emerged in Washington and in Beirut for further progress toward a solution of the problems of Lebanon in general and of the west Beirut crisis in particular.'' **********Two Arab Foreign Ministers, Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia and Abdel Halim Khaddam of Syria, met here this week with President Reagan, Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other officials and presented a plan for ending the siege of west Beirut. **********The plan calls for the transfer of the 6,000 Palestinian troops in west Beirut to northern Lebanon until decisions have been made by the Arab League on evacuating them to other Arab countries. The Americans told the visitors that the idea would not be acceptable to Israel or to Lebanon unless plans were worked out in advance on what countries would give refuge to the Palestinians. Use of U.S. Troops Held Possible **********If there were guarantees of an ultimate haven, the Americans said, then it was possible to conceive of a plan in which the United States would provide troops to help insure the safety of the Palestinians in transit. **********A meeting of Arab League foreign ministers is expected next week, maybe on Tuesday, to discuss possible arrangements for an evacuation.  In return for the Palestinian withdrawal, the United States has undertaken to insure that Israel will live up to its pledge to pull back its troops, initially from Beirut and eventually from all of Lebanon. **********American officials fear that enough Arab countries may not agree to take the Palestinians or that somehow the P.L.O. leadership will renege on its avowed willingness to withdraw. The Israelis seem willing to allow one more week or so for the American diplomatic efforts to succeed, officials said. The Americans said Israel was growing restless at the inability of Mr. Habib to conclude a deal. Habib Carries Reagan Letters **********Mr. Habib, carrying letters from President Reagan, will discuss the situation with the leaders of each country he visits, officials said. In addition to Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, he will probably also go to Jordan if King Hussein returns from a trip abroad in time, officials said. **********Among the countries that were said by Prince Saud to have offered a refuge are Iraq and Algeria. But officials said there were no plans for Mr. Habib to go to either one. **********Mr. Habib will be accompanied by Morris Draper, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, who has been with him throughout the Beirut negotiations. **********The talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria on Friday are viewed as important because Syria is still expected to take a large Palestinian contingent even though it has so far refused to accept more than the P.L.O. leadership. Relations With Syria a Topic **********In addition to discussing the crisis in Lebanon, Mr. Habib is expected to be empowered to talk about Syrian-American relations.  The United States believes that, in the aftermath of the Lebanon crisis, Syria is looking to end its dependence on the Soviet Union and expand contacts with the United States. Officials said they were impressed by the moderation displayed here by the Syrian Foreign Minister. **********One issue that continues to bother American officials is the perception in the Arab world that the United States is willing to enter into direct talks with the P.L.O. without American conditions being met first. The State Department stressed again today that it had no intention of dealing with the P.L.O. directly until the guerrilla group t recognized Israel's right to exist and accepted certain United Nations resolutions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/19/business/lomas-nettleton-mortgage-investors-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 59, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LOMAS & NETTLETON MORTGAGE INVESTORS reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "LOMAS & NETTLETON MORTGAGE INVESTORS reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/18/business/us-oil-output-f-ell-6.2-in-81.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Oil Output F ell 6.2% in '81", "print_headline": "U.S. Oil Output F ell 6.2% in '81", "body_text": " **********The American Petroleum Institute, a private trade association, estimated that 1981 domestic oil production averaged 15.9 million barrels a day, a 6.2 percent drop from 1980. **********It said in a year-end report that imports of crude oil and petroleum products fell to 5.7 million barrels a day in 1981 from 6.7 million. **********In another recent year-end report, the Department of Energy, using different calculations, estimated that total United States oil consumption in 1981 dropped to an average of about 16.3 million barrels a day, 4.3 percent below from 1980.

Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company, did not explain why it was withdrawing from Libya beyond saying in a prepared statement that the decision was based solely on economics. Industry analysts said that Mobil might have been under pressure from Saudi Arabia to withdraw from Libya, because the two Arab nations are at odds. **********Mobil is one of the four American oil companies in the Arabian American Oil Company, which produces most of Saudi Arabia' oil.  Mobil becomes the second to announce its withdrawal from Libya. The Exxon Corporation said last November that it was withdrawing from the North African nation, which as recently as 1980 was the third-largest source of American oil imports. A few days after Exxon announced its plan to withdraw, Mobil said that it had halted oil production in Libya. **********Mobil, which had been active in Libya since 1955, filed its ''notice of surrender'' of its exploration and producing interests with Libya's Secretary of Petroleum on April 13, and the 90-day waiting period ends July 13, said John Flint, a company spokesman. He said he did not know why the action had not been disclosed earlier. **********Mobil said yesterday that it was negotiating with Libyan officials on compensation for its holdings. The company declined to discuss this issue in detail until it is resolved. **********Mobil's Libyan operation, Mobil Oil Libya Ltd., was a 34 percent partnership with the National Oil Corporation, the Libyan Government oil company, which held 51 percent, and Veba, the state-run West German company, with 15 percent. **********The Reagan Administration, charging that Libya was behind terrorist activities, imposed an embargo in March on oil imports from Libya. At that point, Libyan oil sales to the United States had slowed to 21,000 barrels a day from an average of 320,000 barrels a day in 1981. **********Oil industry analysts said that Mobil's main dispute with Libya was over price. Mobil and most other foreign oil companies in Libya operate in joint ventures with the Libyan Government's oil company, which usually controls 51 percent of the ventures and imposes a basid price of $35.50 a barrel, $1.50 more than Saudi Arabia's base. **********It was also difficult for Mobil ''to serve two masters,'' said Alvin D. Silber, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., explaining that Libya and Saudi Arabia ''have been at opposite poles of the internal OPEC struggle.'' The Saudis, moreover, have sided with Iraq in that country's war with Iran, while Libya has favored Iran. **********Although both countries are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties, Libya has sought to keep prices relatively high, while Saudi Arabia has been more moderate, and Libya has lost some of its market to less expensive crudes. **********''So, an oil company that operates in both places is sort of in the middle,'' Mr. Silber said.  He called Mobil's undepreciated investment in Libya ''negligible,'' and said that it should not result in a write-down of more than 10 cents or 20 cents a share. Mobil would not estimate its Libyan investment. Its operation consisted until last November of 86,000 barrels a day produced in a partnership field with the Libyan Government oil company. Part of the Mobil share then went to Veba. **********Mobil had 200 workers in Libya, 60 of them Americans.  After Exxon pulled out of Libya, that company said it had collected ''somewhat lower than book value'' for its Libyan assets from the Government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The figure has been estimated within the industry at $95 million. Other Companies in Libya **********Other American oil concerns still in Libya are the Occidental Petroleum Corporation and the Oasis Oil Company, which comprises Conoco Inc., the Marathon Oil Company and the Amerada Hess Corporation. **********An Occidental spokesman said that the company would stay in Libya.  Reuters news agency quoted a spokesman for Conoco as saying that the company has been holding discussions with Libya for the past year, ''but they are not concluded yet.'' **********In referring to these companies, Mr. Silber noted: ''They don't have this problem of also being large operators in Saudi Arabia.

Based on that finding, Leo Burnett, the Chicago advertising agency, created ads for Swanson frozen TV dinners that showed an overworked housewife reaching for the product. The campaign proved ill-conceived when it made its debut some years ago. Harassed consumers, it turned out, did not like to be reminded of how hectic their lives were. **********In a study in the early 1970's, Needham, Harper & Steers/Chicago, on behalf of its client, the McDonald's Corporation, confirmed what consumers could see for themselves: Many fast-food establishments were dingy. The agency set about making McDonald's fast-food outlets seem more inviting. **********Its efforts included the now-famous slogan, ''You deserve a break today,'' and coupled with McDonald's work to add sparkle to its resturants, helped sales to soar. **********Research can indeed make the difference between success and failure in advertising campaigns, and spending for such studies has been growing rapidly in recent years. Estimates of the amounts vary, but some experts calculate it at $250 million to $500 million a year, substantially more than twice its level 10 years ago. 'Getting the Right Insight' **********''What is really crucial,'' said Joseph T. Plummer, research chief at Young & Rubicam, the country's largest advertising agency, ''is getting the right insight into the consumer. When you are armed with that, you can really have the creative imagination do its best work.'' **********Advertising research has been defined as the study of the making, the value and the placement of advertising. Advertising agencies, research companies and the advertisers themselves are the major practitioners of such research. Much of it studies how well specific products sell and therefore also fits under the broader heading of marketing research. **********''What's happening.'' said Alan J. Gottesman, a senior analyst at L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, ''is that more and more people are believing that having information is really vital and necessary in planning for the future. The world has become full of data freaks. More and more data are being created, and people are figuring out ways to utilize them.'' **********Alvin J. Silk, professor of management science and associate dean of the Alfred P. Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the increases in research included the testing of advertising copy, the selection of advertising media and more experimental studies, largely involving appraisals of cost efficiency. Competition a Key Factor **********Analysts said outlays for advertising research had apparently been rising each year, outstripping inflation for more than a decade - although expenditure data are scanty because companies generally keep this secret for competitive reasons. **********Michael J. Naples, a former Lever Brothers research executive who heads the Advertising Research Foundation, said: ''Increased competitiveness in the marketplace in the 1970's has led to greater research expenditures to reduce the risk of making wrong decisions - which could be very expensive for a company.'' **********That competitiveness, he suggested, was caused by ''a maturing of the consumer marketing companies'' such as Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and Kellogg. **********Another reason why research expenditures have grown, Mr. Naples said, is that ''since new products have become very important to the growth of businesses, and since the introduction of a new product is the single largest risk factor that many companies have in terms of expenditures, there has been a need for better information.'' **********Research determined, for instance, that of the one-third of the population that often consumes low-calorie sodas, a majority were women. Coca-Cola wanted its recently introduced new beverage, diet Coke, to generate additional male drinkers of low-calorie soda. **********Accordingly, its initial advertising featured two well-known men - Phil Esposito, the sports announcer and former hockey player, and Judd Hirsch, the actor who appears on the television show ''Taxi.'' **********Indeed, it was only after research in the late 1970's had shown that the market for low-calorie soda was broadening that Coca-Cola was encouraged to put its new product on the market. **********Another reason for the growth in research, analysts said, was the proliferation of techniques and tools.  Specialized research companies have also proliferated. In the past 15 years or so, said Mr. Plummer, an executive vice president at Y.& R., the number of research companies ''has exploded - there are hundreds of them, all over the map.'' **********In addition to research companies, the more than 350 members of the Advertising Research Foundation of New York include advertisers, ad agencies and companies such as newspapers that serve as media for advertising. The foundation's mission is to help increase the saleseffectiveness of advertising through research. **********Advertising research inspires considerable enthusiasm and loyalty among its champions, who say the chance of error is higher in the application of research findings than in the findings themselves. **********''Research is just information,'' said Mr. Plummer. ''It doesn't do anything itself. It just sits there. Data are inert. So most of the time, mistakes involving research are made in the interpretation, not in the actual carrying out of the research itself.'' **********In terms of expenditures, a major form of the research explores media. Jack J. Honomichl, who writes a column about research for the trade journal Advertising Age, has estimated that about $150 million a year is spent on the measurement of audiences for electronic and print media. Delivering the Message **********Analyzing that emphasis, J. Kendrick Noble, first vice president and a media specialist at Paine Webber, said, ''Ultimately, the advertiser wants the most sales per dollar'' spent on advertising. **********He suggested that ''advertisers are spending more time trying to determine how to position their messages before the public most effectively,'' and that this ''traces back to the advent of the computer,'' which facilitated more sophisticated data analysis. **********Other forms of ad research include what the industry calls ''campaign tracking studies,'' which provide information about ad campaigns; ''copy testing,'' which means testing specific pieces of advertising; ''qualitative research,'' which includes in-depth interviews about specific products or advertising copy; and ''attitude research,'' which deals with aspects of consumers' life styles."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/28/business/advertising-addenda.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 37, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Addenda", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Addenda", "body_text": " *********** Albert Jay Rosenthal & Co., Chicago, has acquired Fran Wollack and Associates. *********** Soskin/Thompson Associates, a direct marketing division of J.

''Now they've gone after the Syrian missile sites and they've seem to gone beyond just going after the Palestinians.'' **********Mr. Zablocki's statement came as questions arose in Congress and within the Reagan Administration about Israel's use of American arms in the invasion of Lebanon. The United States has traditionally supplied arms to Israel on the agreement that the weaponry would be used only for defense. **********''Obviously the issue has to be considered,'' said a senior State Department official. ''It's got to be addressed in some ways in the future. But at the moment the focus is a cease-fire and diplomacy.''  'We Should Call a Halt' **********Former Under Secretary of State George W. Ball told a House subcommitee that the United States ''shouldn't permit the Israelis to accept our bounty every year and work at cross-purposes to our larger interests.'' **********''At some point we should call a halt,'' he added. ''That's the one sanction we have that they'd pay attention to because they're wholly dependent upon it.'' **********The increased tempo of the conflict today, with Israeli jets battling Syrian MIG's and attacking Syrian antiaircraft sites, has plainly concerned some members of Congress. **********''Many members have asked my assessment of this, and there are questions about the use of our foreign military items,'' Mr. Zablocki said. He added that the $6.8 billion foreign aid authorization bill, which was scheduled to reach the House floor in the next few days, had been delayed until the summer because the Reagan Administration had been unable to gather support for it and because the Lebanon fighting had caused Administration uneasiness about appearing to support the Israeli invasion. **********The bill would provide $2.4 billion in military and economic assistance for Israel in the fiscal year 1983, including $1.7 billion in military loans and grants. **********Moshe Arens, the Israeli Ambassador, met key legislators in private sessions today to give them Israel's position. ''The Israelis got questions on what their aims are, but they saw no shifts,'' away from support for Israel, said one lobbyist close to the Israelis.  ''The feeling is, there is potential for change if this thing drags on and people see the Israelis moving deeper into Lebanon.'' U.S. Avoids Criticizing Israel **********State Department officials voiced considerable concern about Israel's air attacks on Syrian missile batteries in Lebanon but declined to specifically criticize the Israelis. Officials insist privately that the Reagan Administration wants to avoid any statements that would upset Israel because the key aim of American diplomacy is to bring about a cease-fire in Lebanon. **********Alan Romberg, a State Department spokesman, said the United States had been told by Britain that three suspects arrested in last week's assassination attempt on the Israeli Ambassador to Britain, Shlomo Argov, were linked to ''a dissident terrorist group called Black June.'' He said the group had ''opposed recent P.L.O. policy and leadership.'' **********Although Israel's attacks against Palestine Liberation Organization bases in Lebanon came after the shooting of Mr. Argov, Israeli officials have made it clear that it was only one of what they said were many terrorist attacks against Israelis that had led to the invasion. No Comment on 'Justification' **********Asked whether the information from Britain had altered American judgments of Israel's rationale for the military assault, Mr. Romberg said, ''I'm not going to address the question of justification.'' **********Israeli officials, in their meetings on Capitol Hill, told members of Congress that Syria had ''provoked'' the latest Israeli attacks on antiaircraft sites in Lebanon."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/29/business/moran-energy-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MORAN ENERGY INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "MORAN ENERGY INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/15/business/banks-to-help-aeg.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 54, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Banks to Help AEG", "print_headline": "Banks to Help AEG", "body_text": " **********Twenty of a group of 22 West German banks have agreed to make available to AEG-Telefunken A.G. the equivalent of $100 million of an unguaranteed $270 million credit, a statement issued today said.

Noble, chairman of the Synthetic Fuels Corporation, ''is that, whatever the immediate supply situation, the Middle East remains highly volatile and the free world continues to depend on imported oil. Synthetic fuels can support the economic and defense security of this country and they can act as a brake against unwarranted oil price increases anywhere in the world.'' List of Projects Selected **********The projects selected today, their sponsors and the sponsors' estimates of total costs were: **********- Memphis: Memphis Light, Gas and Water, a city agency, which wants to turn coal into synthetic natural gas; $822 million. **********- Gillette: Hampshire Energy, a joint venture of several concerns, including Koppers, which proposes a coal-to-gasoline conversion plant; $2 billion. **********- Breckenridge County: Ashland Sythetic Fuels, a subsidiary of Ashland Oil, and Bechtel Petroleum, a subsidiary of the Bechtel Corporation, which want to build a plant to produce fuel oil from coal; $5.2 billion. **********- Creswell: Peat Methanol Associates, which plans to convert peat to methanol; $350 million. **********- West Pittsburg: California Synfuels Research, which proposes to convert heavy crude oil that refineries cannot now handle into a variety of liquid fuels; $49 million. **********Wycoal Inc., which had planned to build a $3.5 billion coal gasification plant in eastern Wyoming, dropped out of the competition this week, citing high interest rates, rapidly rising costs and an abundance of crude oil that cast doubt about ''the marketability of the product.'' Appeals Will Be Accepted **********Projects that lost out in today's decision will be able to apply by May 31 for a second round of awards. The corporation, created by a 1980 law, has $14.6 billion to use over the next several years. The five losers were a coal liquefaction plant in Murphy Hill, Ala.; a coal gasification plant in Daggett, Calif.; a coal liquefaction plant in Shelbyville, Ky.; a coal liquefaction plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn., and an oil shale plant in Uintah County, Utah. **********Three major synthetic fuels projects are already under way with Federal aid provided under an interim program of the Department of Energy: the Great Plains coal gasification project in North Dakota, and neighboring shale-oil projects in Colorado sponsored by the Union Oil Company of California and by a partnership of the Tosco Corporation and the Exxon Corporation. **********But the Tosco-Exxon Colony Project has drawn increased scrutiny for possible cost overruns, and the corporation today passed a resolution authorizing Mr. Noble to develop a monitoring system and take other steps that he feels necessary, short of ending the commitment. **********The contract, which includes a loan guarantee of $1.1 billion for Tosco, is reported to provide that it can be cancelled if total overruns exceed the original $3.1 billion estimate by more than 32 percent. Exxon did not apply for Government support. Meeting With Tosco Planned **********The corporation said that it had not yet decided whether to permit Tosco to draw its guaranteed loan -amounting to $100 million - from the Federal Financing Bank. Tosco has asked for this money next month. Mr. Noble said there would be a meeting with Tosco in the next few days to discuss the project. **********The original goal of the corporation was for a synthetic fuels industry that would produce the equivalent of 500,000 barrels of oil a day by 1987 and 2 million by 1992.

B ut the charity was going to pay a bargain price for the house, and t he taxpayer wanted to know whether the difference between the fair m arket value of the vacation home and the amount he intended to c harge could be claimed as a charitable deduction. **********Thousands of dollars hung on the outcome, and the taxpayer could not afford to go ahead with the deal if the deduction were denied. So he did what more and more people are doing these days and requested a special advance ruling - known as a private letter ruling - from the Internal Revenue Service. The answer, issued earlier this year, was favorable, and presumably it gave him peace of mind as he went forward with the deal. **********''The major purpose of the letter ruling program is to provide taxpayers with certainty in advance of consummating a transaction,'' said Gerald G. Portney, the I.R.S.'s top technical expert and head of the section that issues the rulings. Because the program helps to avoid potential wrangles that can lead to audits, appeals and litigation, he added, ''it's a case where everybody wins.'' **********Private letter rulings are an arcane part of the nation's tax system that are generally familiar only to professionals such as lawyers and accountants who routinely deal with the intricacies of the law. ''John Q. Public doesn't know about them,'' said G. William Clapp, a tax partner with the accounting firm of Deloitte Haskins & Sells. ''But they probably should be more widely used than they are.'' **********As long as the actual transaction is exactly the same as the one outlined in the ruling request, a favorable private letter ruling virtually guarantees immunity against audit on the issues raised in the request. A taxpayer can still be audited on other, unrelated issues, however. **********The vast majority of the 5,000 or so such rulings the I.R.S. issues each year in response to voluntary requests deal with knotty business questions such as the tax implications of corporate reorganizations.  But many others deal with personal tax problems as well. **********Recent rulings, for example, considered whether an extra pair of special orthopedic shoes for a child with cerebral palsy were deductible (they were) and whether a husband-and-wife choral coaching team for a church were subject to Social Security and Federal income tax withholding (they were). **********Another case involved a taxpayer seeking a charitable deduction for a ''loveboat'' he planned to give to a tax-exempt organization that was formed to provide retreats for families to renew their familial relationships (The deduction, for the four-bedroom houseboat was granted). In yet another ruling request, the parents of a child with a birth defect sought a medical deduction for the costs of constructing a swimming pool for the youngster. (The parents, who were told the child must begin a swimming program in early infancy or face paralysis, received the deduction.) **********Frequently, investors thinking of swapping one piece of business property for another ask for a letter ruling so they will know whether the exchange will be considered tax-free. Another common request comes from executives being transferred abroad, who want to know whether the income tax of the foreign country will qualify as a creditable income tax for United States purposes. UNLIKE revenue rulings, which are only issued after an I.R.S. policyr eview and which apply to all taxpayers, the opinions in private r ulings apply only to the taxpayers requesting them. They cannot be c ited as precedent by other taxpayers. But ever since the law was c hanged in 1976 requiring the I.R.S. to publish all its letter r ulings, tax professionals have looked to private rulings as an i ndication of how the revenue service is likely to rule. Roscoe L.  E gger, the revenue service commissioner, has expressed concern that p rivate rulings are being cited too frequently as precedents in courtc ases, and he has warned that the revenue service may subject them toa higher level of review, which would sharply reduce the number i ssued. **********Private rulings are issued by a team of I.R.S. tax law specialists who are entirely separate from the revenue agents and tax auditors who examine returns. These specialists are required to contact taxpayers within 21 days after they have requested a letter ruling.  Though the ruling itself may not be issued for months, this informal contact with the specialist can be very helpful to a taxpayer. Often, the specialist will suggest ways to modify a proposed transaction so that it would qualify for a favorable ruling. **********''If the transaction is complex, the service may say, 'We will rule positively if you change it in this way,' '' said Michael I.  Saltzman, a partner in the law firm of Saltzman, Garbis, Schwait. **********On the other hand, the specialist may say he intends to issue an unfavorable ruling no matter how a taxpayer structures the deal. But even this advance information can be helpful. The drawback in going ahead with a transaction after the I.R.S. says it intends to issue an unfavorable ruling is that the taxpayer may be inviting an audit.  Frequently, the rulings division will send a copy of a withdrawn ruling request to a local I.R.S. office, where it can act as a red flag on a taxpayer's return. **********Another disadvantage to requesting a ruling is the cost of hiring a lawyer or accountant. ''It's kind of an expensive process,'' said Albert B. Ellentuck, national tax partner with the accounting firm of Laventhol & Horwath, who estimated the cost of a preparing a simple request at a minimum of $2,500. Moreover, the I.R.S., which currently issues rulings at no charge, is considering imposing a fee. **********Still another drawback is the time it takes to get one.  ''Generally, 80 percent of the rulings are issued within six months or less and maybe two-thirds are issued within four months or less,'' Mr. Portney of the revenue service said. **********At the same time, taxpayers do not have to retain a lawyer or accountant to request a private ruling, though most do. An I.R.S.  analysis indicates that about 8 percent of all ruling requests are filed by unrepresented taxpayers, and Mr. Portney said they fare as well as those with counsel. **********There is no magic to applying for a private ruling. Indeed, there is not even a special form, and Ellen Murphy, a spokesman for the I.R.S. says many taxpayers who write in for advice don't even realize they are in effect asking for a ruling. **********To request a letter ruling, a taxpayer should write the I.R.S.  Associate Chief Counsel-Technical, Room 6545, 1111 Constitution Ave.  N.W., Washington, D.C. 20224. The letter should include a description of all the facts concerning the proposed transaction, a statement of the legal points and authorities supporting your position, and a specific statement of what ruling you are asking for. **********Even though a ruling is requested, the I.R.S. may not comply. It will not issue private rulings on hypothetical transactions, for instance, or on questions of fact, such as whether the amount of compensation being paid to an executive is reasonable. **********There are also a host of particular tax matters on which it will not rule, because of pending court cases. Currently, the no-ruling list includes such questions as depreciation, whether scholarships and fellowships are taxable income, and whether a home being sold by a taxpayer age 55 or older qualifies as a principal residence for purposes of the $125,000 capital gains exclusion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/11/world/iran-elected-an-83-member-panel-to-select-a-successor-to-khomeini.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 276, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IRAN ELECTED AN 83-MEMBER PANEL TO SELECT A SUCCESSOR TO KHOMEINI", "print_headline": "IRAN ELECTED AN 83-MEMBER PANEL TO SELECT A SUCCESSOR TO KHOMEINI", "body_text": " **********Iran's 82-year-old revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, led Iranians today in voting for a special 83-member assembly to choose his successor after he dies. **********The Iranian state radio said he cast his vote in Teheran and other prominent ayatollahs voted in the holy city of Qum. **********All Iranians older than 16 were eligible to participate. **********Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, regarded as Ayatollah Khomeini's most likely successor, reportedly emerged from the polling place and prayed for long life for the revolutionary leader and for victory in Iran's war against Iraq. **********In a speech last month, Ayatollah Khomeini urged Iranians to vote as a measure ''to preserve the unity of the country.''

''I did not believe that an engine other than the conventional engine was possible.'' **********Soon afterward, Mr. Yamamoto, an engineer, became a believer in the potential of the unconventional engine. But he was one of the few.  Indeed the long, checkered history of Toyo Kogyo's efforts with the rotary engine is a story of technological perseverance in the face of considerable odds and financial adversity. **********The case is also one of the most vivid examples of the difficulty and risk of doing one of the things that Japan does best: bringing to market - or commercializing - technology that originated elsewhere. **********By contrast, the United States is strong in basic research. But, as Presidential science adviser George A. Keyworth and others have warned, America seems to have slipped in recent years in transforming scientific knowledge into products for the marketplace. **********The rotary engine was invented in 1954 in West Germany by Dr. Felix Wankel in cooperation with Audi NSU Auto Union of West Germany. In 1961, Toyo Kogyo was among about 23 companies that licensed the technology from Wankel and Audi/NSU. **********Today, Toyo Kogyo, Japan's third-largest auto maker, is the only auto maker in the world producing the rotary engine. Bigger and wealthier auto manufacturers, including the General Motors Corporation and the Nissan Motor Company tried without success to commercialize the rotary engine for automobiles. Both abandoned their projects because of problems with poor fuel economy and high exhaust emissions. NOT that development went all that smoothly for Toyo Kogyo. Its e xecutives occasionally had their own doubts about the wisdom of p ursuing an unproven engine technology. And in the mid-1970's, as g asoline prices soared after the 1973 Arab oil embargo, it was l argely the company's reliance on the rotary engine, which then got o nly 10 miles a gallon in city driving, that pushed Toyo Kogyo to t he brink of financial disaster. Inventories, losses and debts piled u p. From sales of 119,000 cars in 1973, Mazda's 1974 sales plunged to7 0,000 cars. It had a 15-month supply of rotary engine cars at a t ime when a two-month supply was considered normal. In 1975, the c ompany lost $57 million - the biggest loss in its history. **********A spirited internal debate ensued. Eventually, Toyo Kogyo and its main financial backer, the Sumitomo Bank, decided not to abandon the rotary engine, though its production was scaled back, mostly for use in the company's high-performance sports car, the RX-7. The number of rotary engine-equipped cars sold by Mazda fell from a peak of 224,241 in 1973 to a low of 43,732 in 1977. Last year, the total of rotary-powered vehicles was 63,975. Toyo Kogyo also makes conventional piston engines and diesel engines. **********Now the company's rotary engine is comparatively fuel-efficient, getting 21 miles a gallon in city driving and 30 miles a gallon on the highway, and Toyo Kogyo is solidly profitable. In the six months ended April 30, the company reported that its earnings rose 13.5 percent from the comparable period a year ago, to $45.2 million, on sales of $2.5 billion, up 1.5 percent, from $2.46 billion a year earlier. **********For Mr. Yamamoto, the rotary engine has been more than a marketing and engineering challenge, it has been a daily obsession from the start. This thin, intense man says he believes that there is a lesson in his company's experience. ''For the development of new technology like the rotary engine,'' he explained, ''you need consistent passion, not just logic.'' **********Much of that passion was plain corporate pride, Toyo Kogyo executives concede. In the early 1970's, before all the problems with the rotary cropped up, the corporate motto was ''Mazda is making history.'' For years, the rotary attracted some of Japan's brightest young automotive engineers to Toyo Kogyo, lured by the prospect of working on the rotary project. Thus, to admit failure publicly by abandoning it altogether would have been a great loss of face for Toyo Kogyo, in a country where corporate face matters very much. **********In Japan - as in the United States - corporate commitment tends to be measured by a double standard: A new product or technology is praised in fulsome tones when it has become a success. But when the new idea turns out to be a dud, the corporate commitment is usually deemed inflexibility on the part of management. **********In Toyo Kogyo's case, the rotary engine was ultimately a modest success. It has become a marketable product.  Yet that achievement was expensive. Toyo Kogyo has spent an estimated $100 million on research and development of the rotary, in addition to the untold cost of sales opportunities missed by not having a fuel-efficient line in the mid-1970's. IN 1961, Toyo Kogyo was mainly a producer of trucks, including t hree-wheeled vehicles sold throughout Asia. To become a full-fledgedi nternational auto producer, Tsuneji Matsuda, then the president, r easoned that Toyo Kogyo needed a competitive weapon that would give i t a distinctive niche in the marketplace. A trained engineer, Mr.  M atsuda chose as that weapon a new technology, the rotary engine. **********In theory, the rotary engine had great appeal. It would be 30 percent lighter, 50 percent smaller and contain only a fraction of the moving parts of the piston engine. **********By May 1963, Mr. Yamamoto had assembled a team of more than 40 engineers whose mission was to hone the German technology into a massproduction item. In April 1967, Toyo Kogyo began producing the rotary engine. ''That's when we crossed the Rubicon,'' Mr. Yamamoto said. **********The rotary engine that Toyo Kogyo produced in 1967 was almost entirely different from the German design it licensed six years before, except for the basic rotary concept. **********But once that technical Rubicon had been crossed, there were to be other obstacles in bringing the engine to market. In the late 1960's, air pollution became a pressing concern and a political issue in the United States. In early testing, the rotary-driven Mazdas were found to be polluters, emitting high levels of hydrocarbons. **********At the time, some scientists said the rotary engine could never meet the emissions requirements and would be relegated to being a museum curiosity. Yet by 1970, Toyo Kogyo was able to meet the American emissions guidelines through the development of a thermal reactor, a chamber for further burning its exhaust emissions. STILL, Toyo Kogyo executives believed that the pollution c ontroversy had blemished the reputation of the rotary. To burnish i t, the company decided in 1972 to stretch to meet the much more s tringent emissions control requirements then being proposed by S enator Edmund Muskie, Democrat of Maine. The approach of most of thea uto industry was to fight the so-called Muskie bill. At hearings in W ashington in May 1973 for the bill, only two companies testified, H onda and Toyo Kogyo. ''The others just said it was impossible,'' r ecalled Mr. Yamamoto, who represented his company at the hearings.  ' 'They wanted to maintain the establishment.'' **********Five months later, when the Arab oil embargo began, fuel efficiency replaced pollution control as the focus of public concern, and the Muskie bill was shelved. **********But in redesigning the rotary to meet the requirements of the proposed Muskie bill, Toyo Kogyo had paid a stiff penalty in fuel economy. And it paid dearly for being out of step with a suddenly changed market. The rotary was branded as a Japanese engine with an American disease - it was a gas-guzzler. Inventories piled up. **********Still, the company chose not to abandon the rotary engine. Its engineers believed that fuel efficiency could be improved considerably in a few years through a series of changes in fuel mixture, materials and design. **********In 1974, Mr. Yamamoto became the chief of ''Project Phoenix.'' His search for fuel-saving innovations was eventually successful: In 1981, when the RX-7 sports car, the hope of the rotary's future, was introduced in Las Vegas, it was an emotional moment for Mr. Yamamoto. **********''The tears ran down my face, '' he recalled. ''After all that difficulty, we came back.'' The rotary engine is now used in only about 8 percent of Toyo Kogyo passenger cars. Though it works well as a sports car engine, the rotary engine tends to lose power at low speeds, a liability in stopand-go driving. Mr. Yamamoto says a ''supercharged'' rotary that will have greater power at lower speeds will be on the market ''in the near future.'' But Toyo Kogyo is not expanding capacity to meet any surge in demand for rotary engines. **********Accordingly, it seems fair to ask whether all Toyo Kogyo's travails with the rotary were worth the effort. ''All things considered, I think it has been extremely good for Toyo Kogyo,'' said John T. Eby, president of the Ford Motor Company of Japan, and who is a Toyo Kogyo director. In November 1979, Ford bought a 25 percent stake in the Japanese company. **********Mr. Eby notes that the corps of engineers originally attracted to the company to work on the rotary has given Toyo Kogyo considerable strength in creating its own products, such as its highly successful front-wheel drive GLC/323, introduced in 1980. **********Furthermore, Toyo Kogyo executives believe that the rotary engine will be a useful weapon in an era of increased international competition. Ichiro Maeda, Toyo Kogyo's managing director for corporate planning, says that to thrive through the 1980's and 1990's his company must concentrate on certain ''niches'' in the market, rather than by trying to emulate giants like General Motors and Toyota, whose many lines of vehicles cover the automotive spectrum. **********''The rotary engine is very good for sporty cars,'' Mr. Maeda said. ''This will be one of our niches.''  THE LITTLE ENGINETHAT FINALLY COULD **********Felix Wankel, a West German automobile engineer, invented the rotary engine in 1954 and a Japanese company modified it after acquiring the rights in 1961. But it wasn't until years later that the United States got its first rotary-engine auto -a Mazda - and today Mazda's RX-7 remains the only rotary-powered car on the American market. **********The rotary engine popularized by Mazda's RX-7 is one of three commercially successful internal-combustion automobile engines. The others are the conventional piston-driven engine that has powered cars since 1886, and the diesel, which burns fuel by heat from compression, rather than explosions from spark plugs. **********The rotary has no pistons, intake or exhaust valves, connecting rods, or crankshaft. With fewer moving parts, it is lighter, vibrates less and makes less noise than a piston engine. **********The challenges of modifying the Wankel design for mass production were formidable enough to dissuade most of the other companies that acquired rights to the technology. Engineers at Toyo Kogyo, the makers of Mazdas, changed almost everything but the basic rotary concept. Metallurgists had to develop alloys and castings that could withstand the heat and friction. Seals had to be designed that would withstand high pressure and heat while preventing leaks.  Energyefficient fuel-air intakes and environmentally sound exhaust systems had to be created. **********''You have to take your hat off to the Toyo Kogyo people,'' said Mitsuya Goto, general manager of the international division of the Nissan Motor Company in Tokyo. ''Despite all the troubles the rotary gave the company, they did eventually succeed with it.'' **********Unlike a piston engine that creates power with pistons that move up and down within cylinders and turn a central crankshaft, Mazda's rotary engine has two triangular rotors with rounded edges that turn within vaguely figure-eight-shaped combustion chambers. Ignition of the air-fuel mixture by two spark plugs in the path of each rotor creates the explosive force that keeps the rotors turning. The central shaft turned by the spinning rotors transmits the power that drives the wheels. **********The Mazda's rotary displaces about 70 cubic inches and is relatively light (245 pounds for the manual transmission engine). It delivers 100 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute. **********By comparison, the Datsun 280ZX, another popular Japanese-built sports car, is powered by a six-cylinder, overhead-cam piston engine that is more than twice as heavy but delivers 145 horsepower at 5,200 revolutions per minute. **********About 185,640 of the Mazda RX-7's have been sold since the car was introduced in the United States in May 1978. The top-of-the-line model has a suggested list price of $11,895. The newest RX-7 equipped with catalytic converter is rated at 21 miles a gallon for city driving and 30 miles a gallon for the highway."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/20/business/finance-briefs-044331.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Cooper Tire and Rubber Co. filed with the S.E.C. for an offering of 650,000 shares of common stock through Merrill Lynch White Weld Capital Markets Group. *********** Corning Glass Works filed with the S.E.C. for an offering of $100 million of 25-year, subordinated exchangeable debentures through Lazard Freres & Co. *********** Dial Financial Corp. filed with the S.E.C. for an offering of $200 million of senior debt securities through underwriters to be determined. *********** Kidde Inc.'s issue of $50 million of 10 3/4 percent, 10-year notes are being offered with 1.5 million warrants to purchase Kidde common shares at $40 a share through Bear, Stearns & Co. *********** Lee Data Corp.'s offering of 2.6 million shares at $19 a share is being offering through Shearson/American Express Inc."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/12/business/economic-scene-cea-s-use-of-plonking.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1982-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 828, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; C.E.A.'s Use Of 'Plonking'", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; C.E.A.'s Use Of 'Plonking'", "body_text": " **********THE late Stephen Potter, famous as the discoverer of Gamesmanship (''the art of winning at games without actually cheating''), also made important but less noticed contributions to economics, which he called ''the plonking science.''

An example, to be delivered in a cuttingly audible voice capable of dulling the organs of comprehensibility: ''Unless something happens to change the state of demand, more will be bought at any given price than at any higher price.'' **********The just-released annual report of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers breaks new ground in its use of Economic Approach B. Here are a few of its plonks: **********- ''In a market economy, individual income depends upon what one has to sell and on the amount which others are willing to pay for it.'' **********- ''Individuals have different preferences and desire different goods and services.'' **********- ''Many people prefer not to live in a society where there is poverty and thus have an incentive to transfer some of their resources to the poor voluntarily. When one individual performs such a transfer, all individuals who dislike poverty benefit. Thus, most people will have an incentive to reduce their contributions to the poor and rely on the contributions of others.'' The authors' conclusion: Voluntary transfers will in all likelihood be too low to keep people out of poverty, so perhaps Government should do something. However, that will hurt the society's efficiency. For, as the report goes on: **********- ''Regardless of the form of transfer, there is still an efficiency cost. Transfers reduce the incentive of recipients to work, and the taxes imposed on the rest of society to finance these transfers also cause losses in efficiency.'' (This was also the argument of the 19th-century Social Darwinian, Herbert Spencer, who was against free public libraries, because he thought they caused loafing. Presumably nobody ever learned anything useful in a free public library.) **********But the Council of Economic Advisers often switches from Economic Approach B (utter obviousness) to Approach A (a little incomprehensibility.) A couple of examples: **********- ''The volatility in borrowed reserves could be reduced by tying the discount rate to market rates so as to reduce variability in the incentive to borrow. To keep such variability to an absolute minimum, the Federal Reserve would also have to set its discount rate som ewhatabove market interest rates - that is, to act as a penalty.'' **********- ''An important reason for going back to contemporaneous reserve accounting would be to permit greater flexibility in the discount rate, at a penalty rate or otherwise, which in turn would provide more precise short-run control over total reserves by reducing the volatility of borrowings.'' **********Mr. Potter was convinced that the purpose of plonking was to snow an audience. That may be. But it contains a danger: It may also act as a form of self-hypnosis upon the plonker, who may grow convinced that what he is saying makes sense, and is the only thing that does.  It may lead him to become deaf to counterarguments and counterevidence. It may even breed hostility to reality when reality fails to conform either to the uttterly obvious truths the plonker utters or to his brilliantly incomprehensible reasoning. **********But the council's report suggests that its members have not quite gone off the deep end yet. While they insist that monetarism and supply-side economics are ''two sides of the same coin,'' they recognize that big and continuing deficits (the consequence of too large supply-side tax cuts) may in a time of expansion sop up too much private saving and foreign capital inflows, drive up interest rates, retard investment and economic growth, create uncertainties about the Government's ability to control spending, make the task of the Federal Reserve harder and raise inflationary expe ctations.  However, the council declares, quickly recove ring its sang-froid, ''Maintenance of monetary restraint is a key part of the Administration's program and hence the potent ially inflationary effects of monetizing the Federal deficit wil l not be realized.'' Belief hardens into ideology. The plonker is self-plonked."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/23/world/man-in-the-news-a-mild-new-president-for-argentina.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Meislin", "pub_date": "1982-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 654, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A MILD NEW PRESIDENT FOR ARGENTINA", "print_headline": "MAN IN THE NEWS; A MILD NEW PRESIDENT FOR ARGENTINA", "body_text": " **********Reynaldo Benito Antonio Bignone, who was thrust into Argentina's presidency today, is a curious complement to the man who put him there, Lieut. Gen. Cristino Nicolaides. **********While people use such terms as ''tough,'' ''no-nonsense'' and ''hard-line'' to describe General Nicolaides, the new army commander, the description of General Bignone is often simply ''nice.'' **********''He is a mild man, not a hawk, and very different from Nicolaides,'' a Government official said today. He added that the new President, who retired from active duty as a major general late last year, was unlikely to give the army high command major problems in managing a Government that, with limited navy and air force support, appears likely to be less stable than its predecessor. **********No Involvement With Falklands **********That may have been part of his appeal to General Nicolaides, whose harsh manner and lack of political experience were said to have eliminated the possibility of his filling the job of President himself. **********Another was that General Bignone had no involvement in Argentina's war with Britain over the Falkland Islands, whose unsuccessful conclusion led to the ouster of President Leopoldo Galtieri last week. **********General Bignone, who is 54 years old, is known to be a strong supporter of the free-market economic policies of Jose Alfredo Marti de Hoz, who served as Minister of the Economy under President Jorge Rafael Videla. This was the policy that made him least attractive to the air force, which has favored tough controls on Argentina's battered economy. **********General Bignone has also spoken forcefully about the need for civil liberties, but has tempered his statements with warnings against Communists and other subversives. 'Civil Courage' Urged **********Commenting last year on the changes that had taken place in Argentina since its violent antiguerrilla campaign of the 1970's, he said, ''If someone was afraid to speak, now he can do it; if someone was afraid to write, now he writes; if someone was afraid to act, now he has no reason for it, and if someone was afraid of criticism, with reason or without it, now he can express it.'' **********But while calling for ''civil courage,'' he added that he excluded from these liberties ''the subersives and corrupt ones who we think and hope should have the greatest fear possible.'' **********General Bignone was born Jan. 21, 1928, in the town of Moron, west of the capital. He is married to the former Nilda Raquel Belen, and they have three children. **********His training and background are purely military. He entered the National Military Academy as a cadet at the age of 16, graduating as a second lieutenant in 1947. He worked his way upward, becoming a captain at the end of 1954 when he entered the Superior War College. **********He continued his climb, taking command of the Cadet Corps in the National Military Academy in 1970 and being named secretary to to high command in 1973. Subsequent posts were director of the National Military Academy, second in command of Argentina's military institutes, and secretary general of the army. Some Political Experience **********In December 1980 he became commander of military institutes, serving in that post until his retirement.  For a country where civilian politics has been suspended for six years, General Bignone's political experience is relatively extensive. **********A soft-featured, balding man who wears wire-rimmed glasses, he was an intimate of the generals who seized power from civilians in 1976.  As secretary general of the army during President Videla's tenure, he often served as liaison between the military and the political parties, by then suspended. **********His skills in this area should be useful if the army intends, as it pledged today, to return Argentina to civil government by early 1984."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/03/business/campbell-s-soup-to-nuts-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CAMPBELL'S SOUP -TO-NUTS PLAN", "print_headline": "CAMPBELL'S SOUP -TO-NUTS PLAN", "body_text": " **********''If you think of the food business as being your desk top, picture a wide segment in the middle that takes up about half of the desk,'' says John Morris, vice president of corporate development at the Campbell Soup Company. ''That's where Campbell is today. What we want to do is get on either side.'' **********Campbell, which opened its first factory here 113 years ago, has embarked on a strategy to expand beyond its base of soups, Swanson frozen food and Pepperidge Farm baked goods, and that activity has increased in the last three months. A company long known for its conservative approach to business, Campbell is now committed to a growth-through-acquisition strategy and a new emphasis on marketing. **********In January, it entered the frozen-sandwich market when it purchased for an undisclosed sum Snow King Inc., a Pottstown, Pa., maker of frozen sandwich meat whose sales in 1981 were $32 million. **********Then, in late March, Campbell announced an agreement in principle to buy Mrs. Paul's Kitchens for an undisclosed price. The privately held Philadelphia company has about 25 percent of the frozen fish market, and with some 65 frozen food varieties and $124 million in sales in 1981, it is the largest producer of frozen fish products. **********Mrs. Paul's, however, is engaged in a costly rebellion by franchisees of its Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips Inc. subsidiary, who refused to buy Mrs. Paul's products or pay it royalties. The proposed purchase by Campbell does not include the Arthur Treacher's operation. What it does include is brand names, current inventories, three frozen-food plants and a headquarters building. 'You Have to Acquire' **********Campbell manufactures a variety of processed foods at about 80 plants in the United States and a dozen foreign countries. Last year it reported earnings of $129.7 million, up 6.6 percent from $121.7 million in the fiscal year 1980, on sales of $2.8 billion, which were up 7.7 percent from $2.6 billion. **********''We determined we are going to grow at about 5 percent above inflation, which means you have to sell 5 percent more each year,'' Mr. Morris said of the acquisition push. ''The food business grows at about 1 to 2 percent a year, so if you want to grow at 5 percent you have to acquire to make the difference. **********''Our strategy is to acquire in areas of the food business where we are not represented and we prefer small companies that are on the fast track, that are in rapidly growing parts of the industry.'' **********In the past three years, that acquisition push has netted for Campbell such operations as Vlasic Foods, a pickles and relish producer; the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation's European food operations; Swift-Armour S.A. Argentina, a meat producer that supplies beef to Campbell; German Village, an Ohio pasta manufacturer; a couple of Southwest poultry growers; two mushroom farms; Martino's Bakery Inc., a California pie and cake maker, and Domsea Farms Inc., breeder of plate-size salmon and trout in Washington State that has $3 million in sales. Different Eating Patterns **********Campbell is now focusing the expansion on product lines that address changing food consumption patterns. Americans are eating more in the way of ''lighter'' foods such as fish and salads, and less beef. Mr. Morris said Campbell was looking to gain entry in the refrigerated salad lines, and new juice lines. **********''We are trying to head this company toward lighter types of protein, less carbohydrates, less salt,'' said R. Gordon McGovern, Campbell's president and chief executive officer. ''I think the underlying interest came in our analysis of the changing trend from meat, which is very expensive and has a high conversion feeding rate.'' By that he meant that more protein must be fed to a pound of beef than to chicken or fish for the amount of protein extracted. **********Mr. McGovern noted that Americans still eat less fish than do Europeans, but that Campbell intends to benefit from the changing eating patterns. He said that the proposed acquisition of Mrs. Paul's ''gives us the complete operation, from purchasing of ocean fish to preparation.'' Campbell will aggressively market Mrs. Paul's fish products and line of frozen vegetables. ''They've had to pull back on marketing because of difficulties with Arthur Treacher's,'' Mr.  McGovern said. ''We hope to restore it, and hope to come up with new items for them.'' **********Campbell entered the fish market in a small way when it purchased Domsea Farms, Union Carbide's pilot sea-ranching operation in Bainbridge Island, Wash. Mr. McGovern indicated Campbell was interested in a long-term venture of raising fish for its food products. **********''In the future it may be promising to raise some varieties of fish yourself,'' said Richard Larsen, a food industry analyst with the First Manhattan Company. ''They have Domsea Farms, which is in that business, so they are a few inches further along on the learning curve than other people.'' A New Marketing Thrust **********Besides such ventures into new food lines, Campbell is sharpening its marketing efforts. Mr. McGovern, who was named chief executive officer in January 1981, was reportedly brought in because of his marketing skills. He was president of the Pepperidge Farm Inc.  subsidiary. **********''The decision makers at Pepperidge Farm were marketers as opposed to the decision makers at the rest of Campbell, who were engineers.'' Mr. Larsen said. ''This is an indication that they are being marketing oriented.'' **********Barry Ziegler, a vice president at Bache Halsey Stuart, who follows the company, said: ''It's a company that has done things in a conservative fashion for so long. They've been dominated by protection of their soup franchise, trying to keep market share, and increase productivity. Under McGovern there seems to be something of a new tack. He's breaking up the company into business units. He would also like to be more aggressive with new products.'' **********Indeed, under Mr. McGovern, Campbell is experimenting with new versions of its standard soup product. ''A lot of people in the press call our soup products 'mature,' '' Mr. McGovern said. ''I'm calling them 'underworked.' '' **********He said Campbell was test-marketing soups intended to address new tastes. They include a line with ''crispy'' vegetables, a low-sodium line, and what he calls ''candlelight'' soups - upscale and noncondensed varieties such as clear oxtail soup and Serbian bean soup.

Haig Jr. and Defense Secretary Caspar W.  Weinberger seem so obvious to some ranking officials that they say the effective management of the Reagan Administration's foreign policy is being threatened. **********It has been clear for some time that the disagreements between the two secretaries were more than the usual State Department-Pentagon rivalries, despite repeated efforts by both men and their aides to gloss them over publicly. **********But in recent months, with the Administration deeply involved in trying both to maintain a cease-fire in the Middle East and to keep the Western alliance together in the midst of the Polish crisis, these Haig-Weinberger differences appear more acute. White House Frowns on Conflict **********Because the White House has made it clear that it does not like to see any public debate among its top aides, Mr. Haig and Mr.  Weinberger have been under pressure to play down the intensity of the conflict. Mr. Haig, who lacks Mr. Weinberger's longstanding personal friendship with the President, has in particular sought to avoid any public clash. **********However, when pressed today about public disagreements on how hard to press the Soviet Union, Mr. Haig acknowledged on the ABC News television program ''This Week'' that the dispute existed. **********''I think there are clearly differences,'' he said, ''but what's new about that? Each department comes at these problems from their differing perspectives. That's inevitable. It has always been so.'' Differences Grew During Trips **********Mr. Weinberger and Mr. Haig both returned to Washington on Saturday night after separate trips abroad, during which some of these differences became more pronounced as a result of public statements and through unattributed remarks from each man's Air Force plane. **********On the Middle East, the dispute is significant because Mr. Haig and Mr. Weinberger seem to have differing assessments of the importance of Israel to the United States. The Israelis and their supporters in this country have long said that Mr. Haig is more sympathetic to Israel's interests than Mr. Weinberger. Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel, at one point, publicly accused Mr. Weinberger of being hostile to his country. **********This perception arose because Mr. Weinberger, following Israel's unexpected attack on an Iraqi nuclear reactor last June, was reported to have urged much stricter sanctions against Israel than were subsequently approved. Furthermore, after each of the policy disputes with Israel, Mr. Haig has seemed to go out of his way to repeat the longstanding American pledges of support for Israel's security. **********Mr. Weinberger was depicted by Pentagon officials as having been at least initially opposed to signing the strategic cooperation agreement with Israel that was worked out at Mr. Haig's urging. And even though the accord was suspended after Israel annexed the Golan Heights, Mr. Haig has been received warmly by Mr. Begin and other top officials during his two recent trips to Israel. Israel Omitted From Itinerary **********The Defense Secretary, on his trip to the Middle East last week, went to Saudi Arabia, Oman and Jordan but omitted stopping in Israel, further fueling Israeli suspicions. Moreover, Mr. Weinberger and his aides were repeatedly quoted in ways that the Israelis found offensive. **********This reached a peak on Saturday when Mr. Weinberger said in Jordan that he favored the sale of arms such as advanced F-16 fighters and mobile antiaircraft missiles to Jordan. In addition, reporters on his plane said a senior official on his staff had said that the Reagan Administration was trying to ''redirect'' military policy away from Israel and toward the Arabs. Today Israel publicly protested those statements. **********State Department experts on the Middle East are very uneasy about those remarks because of a fear that the Israelis, already tense over the prospective return of the last segment of Sinai to Egypt in April and the reported buildup of Palestinian forces in southern Lebanon, might carry out a major military attack against the Palestinians and the Syrians out of frustration if Mr. Begin believes that the Administration is trying to work against Israel's interests. View Shared by Military Aides **********Mr. Weinberger's position, which is widely shared by senior military officers, is that the United States has neglected its ties to friendly Arab countries because of being hostage to Israeli policy. **********The Defense Secretary took the lead in pushing for the sale of Awacs radar planes to Saudi Arabia last year, and he seems convinced that Israel has not shown itself to be acting as a friend of America. Israel, he appears to believe, should pay a price for its bombing of the Iraqi reactor, the bombing raids in Beirut that killed many civilians and its annexation of the Golan Heights, all of which complicated overall American interests in the Middle East. **********Mr. Haig, on television today, said that he had coordinated with Mr. Weinberger, before they both left Washington, on what would be said on foreign policy issues, and declared that Mr. Weinberger was ''very close to those agreements.'' 'A Very Incorrect Word' **********But then, he added that he wanted ''to set the record very, very clear'' on the policy toward Israel. He said that the policy of President Reagan, ''who is the ultimate authority,'' had not changed in its support of Israel. When asked if the Weinberger aide had used the wrong word in saying there was an effort to ''redirect'' policy, Mr. Haig said, ''it is a very incorrect word if that is how it has been interpreted.'' **********The problem for the management of American policy is that the impression that Mr. Weinberger is hostile to Israel tends to undercut the effort being made by Mr. Haig to keep the Israelis from launching a new attack and to keep them interested in working out with Egypt an agreement on Palestinian self-rule. **********On the European questions, Mr. Weinberger and his chief aides seem to believe that the major allies are too detente-minded and unwilling to share a fair burden of defense and political costs in confronting the Soviet Union. As a result, European diplomats have tended to see Mr. Haig as their friend within the Administration, particularly during the Polish crisis. Pentagon Opposes Pipeline **********The Pentagon, which traditionally opposes any kind of technological transfer to the Soviet Union, has seized on the Polish crisis to advance its view that there should be ironclad controls on trade with the Russians and that renewed pressure should be brought on the allies to scrap their arrangements for a natural gas pipeline from the Soviet Union. **********In Madrid last week, Mr. Haig made it clear that while he personally opposed the pipeline project, he also was against allowing the differences over that deal to upset allied unity on Poland. **********Today, he said he was personally ''appalled'' by France's decision to go ahead with the pipeline project, but added, ''What I do not want done is to suddenly seize the anguish of the Polish situation to attempt to accomplish what has been a longstanding United States policy, and that is, to convince our allies that there are other alternatives, and above all to avoid blackmail of those allies on this very sensitive issue.'' Effectiveness of Sanctions **********On the overall question of sanctions, reporters on Mr. Haig's plane were told on Saturday that the curbs already imposed had been significant in forcing the Polish authorities to seek to moderate their crackdown. **********''We're not trying to pursue policies that will inevitably lead to violence and Soviet intervention,'' the reporters were told. ''That might make a lot of ideologues happy and enable them to say 'I told you so,' but I don't think it meets the prudent objectives of our historic needs.'' **********The reference to ''ideologues'' appeared to underscore Secretary Haig's defensiveness about charges that he has not been tough enough toward the Soviet Union. Central American Problems **********Mr. Weinberger has escaped such criticism and this rankles Mr.  Haig's senior aides, who like to point out that on Central America, for instance, Mr. Haig has been more willing to countenance the use of American military force to counter Cuban influence than has Mr.  Weinberger. **********Mr. Weinberger and his backers, however, argue that they have a better understanding of what is possible in America today. They say that the dispatch of American combat forces would be rejected on Capitol Hill and would cause major problems for the Pentagon in obtaining its appropriations for programs designed to counter the Soviet Union globally. **********The debate on what to do about the situation in Central America is apparently reaching its end within the Administration, with Mr.  Reagan due to give a major speech on his Caribbean Basin plan soon.  Mr. Haig, on television today, declined to give details of the speech in advance, except to say that it would deal with economic, social and security problems in the area."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/14/business/finance-briefs-148431.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 201, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Continental Group filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $200 million of debt securities. *********** First City Bancorp of Texas offered to buy 1.5 million of its common shares for $20.50 a share, with the option to purchase an additional 500,000 if it so chooses. *********** Getty Oil Co. filed a shelf registration for $300 million of debt securities. *********** Kansas City Power and Light Co. filed a shelf registration covering up to 1.2 million cumulative no-par preferred shares at about $25 a share, or 300,000 shares at $100 a share. *********** Household Finance Corp. filed a shelf registration for up to $400 million of debt securities. *********** Moore Financial Group Inc. filed a shelf registration for $100 million in debt securities. *********** Pacific Lighting Corp. said it was arranging a $200 million fiveyear loan from a bank syndicate led by the National Westminster Bank and the Swiss Bank Corp. *********** Union Electric Co.'s offering of $125 million of notes, due in 1992, was priced at par with a 15 percent coupon and will be sold through Merrill Lynch White Weld Capital Markets Group."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/26/business/first-city-federal-savings-loan-assn-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 40, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FIRST CITY FEDERAL SAVINGS & LOAN ASSN reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "FIRST CITY FEDERAL SAVINGS & LOAN ASSN reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/23/business/british-business-net-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Business Net Up", "print_headline": "British Business Net Up", "body_text": " **********British industrial and commercial companies' profits, net of stock appreciation, rose 23 percent in the second half of 1981 compared with the first half last year, partly because of North Sea oil, central statistical office figures show. **********Second-half net trading profits were 14.89 billion, up from 12.09 billion in the first half and 12.05 billion in 1980's second half.

The program is intended to encourage long-term semiconductor research and to increase the supply of professional staff, said Robert N. Noyce, vice chairman of the Intel Corporation and chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association. The trade group, which includes about 50 companies, is sponsoring the effort through a new, nonprofit affiliate, the Semiconductor Research Cooperative. **********The semiconductor industry in Japan has adopted a similar approach. The major difference has been that the Japanese Government has acted as both the catalyst and the major financial contributor. The American program, to go into effect May 1, will operate without the direct support or participation of the American Government. **********American companies are barred by antitrust laws from pooling research for joint product development, but not from pooling funds for basic research in universities. Silicon memory chips are wafers the size of a fingernail that are linked together to build computer components. **********The new partnership, which has been incorporated as a nonprofit group, is open to foreign companies that have significant manufacturing operations in the United States, Mr. Noyce said. **********But officials at a news conference today left it unclear whether Japanese companies could become members. Several have begun to expand in the United States. One, the Nippon Electric Corporation, has just announced a $100 million expansion of facilities at Roseville, Calif., near Sacramento. **********''We expect some reciprocity,'' Mr. Noyce said, referring to the limitations placed on access by American companies to joint research in Japan.

Goodman was first in your class.  And if you worked at the May Department Stores Company in the 1960's and 70's, you doubtless recall that sales doubled from $1 billion in 1968, the year before he became chief executive, to $2 billion in 1976, when he stepped down at the mandatory retirement age. Profits spurted, too. **********Mr. Goodman now heads Top Management Services, a St. Louis consulting concern that specializes in revving up sputtering companies, and he has distilled some of the wisdom of his 72 years into a new book, ''How to Manage a Turnaround: A Senior Manager's Guide.'' **********How much can advertising help a company to achieve marked improvement in its performance? It can help a lot, Mr. Goodman replied, if the campaign and the circumstances are right. **********''Too much advertising, far too much, is routine, and not enough is bold,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''But money put into a bold advertising campaign, with a brilliantly designed product, for a skillfully identified market segment - that pays off handsomely.'' **********As examples of good, bold advertising, he cited the introduction of Miller's light beer and Anheuser-Busch's counterattack with its own light brew. **********In getting the most out of advertising, Mr. Goodman said, it is vital for a top executive at client company to have an understanding of what the advertising agency is doing. **********''The top management of the business must have a feel for that,'' he said. ''The role of the client is terribly, terribly important.'' As examples of managers with a feel for what Madison Avenue is up to, he cited Chrysler's chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, and his opposite number at Johnson & Johnson, James E. Burke. **********''Some managements may be tone-deaf to this type of thing,'' Mr.  Goodman went on, ''and when they are, it's very difficult for them.  You can't just say to the agency, 'This is what we want you to do.' The top management must be careful not to dominate the creative people, but to be on their wavelength and to stimulate them.'' **********When a senior manager of a client company inhibits work by creative people at the advertising agency, he said, then the manager ''is not really getting the best out of their brains: They're giving you what they think you want, instead of what their talent tells them is the right thing.'' **********But what if the manager can't shake the nagging feeling that the creative people are a bunch of kooks?  ''It's a bad sign,'' said Mr. Goodman, ''when the manager feels that the creative people are kookie, because it shows that his own development and his own awareness of what's going on in the world may be limited. The manager must have a broad awareness of how people live in all walks of life.'' **********And just how good a job has the American advertising industry been doing for its clients, the aware ones as well as the others?  ''I don't feel very critical about the advertising industry,'' he replied. ''It's in constant ferment, as it should be, and good progress has been made, over the past decades, in the quality of advertising. A company that needs the right kind of advertising is not at a disadvantage in the U.S.A.'' **********As for recent advertising that knocks the competition, Mr. Goodman said: ''I don't admire it particularly - I wasn't brought up that way - but it may well be effective.'' **********Which is not to say Mr. Goodman is not innovation-minded - and competition-minded. In his book, which is put out by Macmillan's Free Press division, he writes: ''The management of a turnaround company should take a fresh and searching look at all aspects of its advertising program. Is there a consistent theme or approach that fits the competitive situation? **********''Does the wording of the ads speak with the true voice of the company?'' he goes on. ''Compare your advertising copy with that of your most successful competitors and judge whether or not your customers might take it to be old-fashioned or boring.'' **********Expanding on that theme, he said the other day that a basic truth he had learned during his years in merchandising was that, ''One thing that Americans won't stand for is boredom. Monotony is the enemy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/23/business/briefs-050921.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 266, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Allied Corp. said that it, Bendix Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. had agreed to extend the closing date of Allied's offer for stock of Bendix and Marietta until Dec. 13, to provide additional time for the Justice Department's antitrust investigation. *********** BankAmerica Corp. said it had created a subsidiary, BA Futures Inc., to execute financial futures contracts. *********** British Columbia Resources Investment Corp. said its BC Timber subsidiary would close its Skeena pulp mill in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, from Nov. 26 until markets improve. *********** Cummins Engine Co. said it would recall about 200 production workers at its engine plant near Columbus, Ind. *********** Dataforce International Inc. said it had agreed to sell certain assets to Rodeo Resources Ltd., a Vancouver-based oil and gas developer, in return for an unspecified amount of its stock. *********** Dow Chemical Co. said its Japanese subsidiary, Dow Chemical Japan Ltd., would build an epoxy resin plant in Kinu-Ura, Japan, in 1984. *********** Falstaff Brewing Co. said it had temporarily halted brewing at its Omaha plant because of low sales.

Jacobs, the Minneapolis investor who is the company's largest stockholder, made a $76.8 million bid to acquire the troubled Milwaukee brewer and sell approximately half of its capacity to the G. Heileman Brewing Company. **********The latest bid, which involves a $24-a-share cash tender offer for a minimum of 3.2 million shares, or 39 percent of Pabst's outstanding stock, is designed to overcome Justice Department antitrust objections to a Heileman-Pabst merger. **********The Jacobs group also wants to prevent Pabst from mergering with the Olympia Brewing Company, another ailing brewer. Thus, one condition of the bid was that Pabst would not acquire more than 5 percent of the shares or a substantial amount of the assets of Olympia, based in Tumwater, Wash. Early this month, Pabst made a $70 million cash-and-stock tender offer for 49 percent of Olympia's common shares. **********Group Holds 15.3% of Pabst **********Mr. Jacobs, together with associates, already owns 15.3 percent of Pabst's stock and ''is protecting his investment,'' said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''A combined Pabst-Olympia organization would be even tougher to turn around'' than Pabst alone, he added. Olympia, which has been beset by high marketing costs and competitive pricing, lost $1.4 million last year. **********If its conditions regarding Olympia were not met, the Jacobs group said, its offer would be reduced to $22 a share.  In a statement, Mr. Jacobs said that, if his group succeeded in acquiring Pabst, it would sell to Heileman for $135 million Pabst's Newark and Georgia breweries, as well as the right to manufacture Pabst's brands in those breweries and distribute them in a 27-state area, an arrangement that Heileman had agreed to. Pabst's plants in Milwaukee and Portland were not included in the Heileman agreement. **********''The deal gives Heileman a fair chunk of volume in the Northeast and South,'' areas where its sales are relatively weak, Mr. Goldman said. He noted that Heileman and Pabst would not be linked in the three states, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota, where together they hold 50 percent or more of the market. Earlier Offer by Heileman **********Last month, Heileman offered $24 a share for Pabst stock, but the proposed merger was opposed by the Justice Department last week on the grounds that it would lessen competition, especially in Northern states. Russell G. Cleary, chairman of Heileman, said yesterday that the Justice Department's opposition had led his company to negotiate with the Jacobs group, despite the fact that Heileman ''wanted very much to purchase'' all Pabst's stock. **********In Washington, a spokesman for the Justice Department said that it had begun considering whether the new bid would violate antitrust laws. **********Pabst shares, in active over-the-counter trading, closed yesterday at $20.50, up 12 1/2 cents. On the New York Stock Exchange, Heileman closed unchanged, at $23.375. Olympia, traded over the counter, closed at $19.875, down $1.625. **********The offer for Pabst stock was made by the JMSL Acquiring Corporation, a new company formed by Mr. Jacobs and three associates. Previously, a different group headed by Mr. Jacobs had offered $20 a share for 2 million shares, which Pabst refused. In April, Mr. Jacobs waged an unsuccessful proxy fight for control of Pabst. **********Another unsuccessful Pabst suitor is C. Schmidt & Sons, a Philadelphia brewer. Last month, Schmidt offered $25.50, in a combination of cash and subordinated debentures, for each share of Pabst. While Pabst management rejected the offer, it indicated that it would not oppose an all-cash bid of the same value. **********Pabst refused to comment on the new bid.

But these are difficult times for economists, who have been struggling not only with the normal self-doubt generated by a troubled economy, but also with the Reagan Administration's assault on the funding of economic research. **********William J. Baumol, the association's president for the past year, found himself at the forefront of the battle against the sharp budget reductions. **********As the association opened its annual meeting here last week, Mr.  Baumol was elated. He had just been told that the Administration had agreed to trim its proposed cutbacks for economics funding from the National Science Foundation, a major source of economic research funds. **********''We were threatened with cutbacks equal to 25 percent of the level that the Carter Administration had proposed,'' Mr. Baumol said. ''And while we are not nearly up to that proposed level again, we are no longer being shockingly singled out for onerous treatment. The word has come out that the Administration itself now feels that it went too far in its original proposals.'' **********The Carter Administration had proposed a $14 million budget for funding economic research in fiscal 1982, up from about $12 million the previous year. The Reagan Administration cut the 1981 budget to $8.6 million and planned to slash that to $3.7 million for 1982. Now, the 1982 budget is back to $6.5 million. **********Some economists might bemoan the reductions even now. Others might apologize for the state of the profession and econ omists' apparent inability to devise the means of maintaining a healthy economy. But Mr. Baumol, a professor at Princeton and New York Universities, takes a reaso ned approach both to the smaller budget and to the turmoil of mo dern economics. **********''I believe very strongly that some hand-wringing is healthy, although I feel that in economics today, it is basically unjustified,'' he said in an interview in the Presidential suite at the A.E.A. meetings here this week. Any discipline recognizes that what it doesn't know is much more than what it does know.'' **********To Mr. Baumol, the intellectual process in economics, as in other fields, is one of evolution. ''Every once in a while there is a breakthrough and everyone exaggerates its value,'' he said. ''Then gradually it sinks in that it is not quite that way.'' **********Indeed, whatever the current problems in economics, Mr. Baumol, 59 years old, does not interpret them as a sign of setbacks or even as an indication that economists know less than t hey used to. He simply thinks that the 1960's were a period of innoc ent bliss for economistsand the 1970's a period of cold reality. Econ omic knowledge, however,continued to advance. **********''Economists in the Kennedy and Johnson years made some forecasts that were virtually right on the nose,'' he said. ''But it was basically dumb luck. What happens to the economy depends very much on what happens in Iran or Mexico or on who is appointed to the Federal Reserve. And there is no econometric model that can forecast those things.'' **********If the 1960's were a decade of few unanticipated disruptions, the following 10 years were chock-full of shocks, such as the 1973 oil crisis, a series of crop failures and the fall of the Shah of Iran.  ''Luck was working the other way,'' Mr. Baumol contended, ''and people concluded that we didn't know anything about economics. That view was as nonsensical as the opposite view.'' **********While the schizophrenia might strike some as awkward, Mr. Baumol accepts it as inevitable. ''It is the nature of creativity to live in a manic depressive state,'' he said. ''One moment you think you know everything, and the next moment nothing.'' **********Mr. Baumol, an American, earned his Ph.D. at London University, specializing in such topics as antitrust, optimal pricing and resource allocation. Since his expertise is the organization of firms and other microeconomic subjects, rather than the broader workings of the economy as a whole, he has not been prominent in the public debate over Government policy, and his name is not widely known outside the economics profession. Within that profession, however, he is regarded as a scholar of the highest order. **********Over the years, he has turned his skills to subjects as diverse as antitrust suits and the funding of the arts. One of the subjects that he is grappling with now is the lack of growth in business productivity. It is an issue that has already attracted a good deal of attention and one that Mr. Baumol predicts will be crucial in the next few years. **********''Our productivity gain rate has virtually vanished,'' he said.  ''For two decades, it has been about half the rate of that in European countries, and about one-third of the rate of the rapidly growing Far Eastern economies. If we extrapolate, that spells serious troubles for us in one or two decades, since those differences will begin to explode in just a couple of years.'' **********He likens the situation to that of Britain, whose productivity growth in the late 1800's and early 1900's also began to shrink. He blames that continued trend for Britain's troubles today, and warns that ''some of the same sorts of things threaten here.'' **********What is the source of the American problem? In Mr. Baumol's view, there may be no single culprit.  ''There is evidence that there has been a relative absence of savings and investment,'' he said. ''There is also data that shows that if you look at productivity per hour - rather than productivity per person - things don't look so bad. We have simply had a sharp decrease in the number of hours worked.'' **********But he also cites another factor: the absence of the go-get'em ethic. ''The entrepreneurial spirit was very much with us in the 1940's and early 1950's,'' he said. ''But it has been 20 years since I have heard anyone say, 'The impossible takes a little longer.' '' **********Mr. Baumol predicted that the solution to the productivity problem may not even lie strictly within the realm of economics. ''The source of the problem may be something we cannot do anything about,'' he said. He offered as an analogy another problem: the reduced rate of personal savings. **********''If the reason for the lower savings rate is the disappearance of the Protestant ethic, there is no way we can deal with that problem,'' he said. ''Sure, we could help subsidize churches and synagogues, with the admonition that every fifth sermon be about saving. But if psychologists thought that might work, at best it would take a very long time. Instead, we might try to increase savings throu gh tax policy and interest rates.'' **********Mr. Baumol believes that the supply-side economics approach to spurring growth in productivity might work if the incentives were tied to achieving results. But even if that were to succeed, he said, it would not necessarily make everyone happy. ''Growth is not something you achieve without cost,'' he said. ''There are environmental costs and people would have to work harder. But the payoff would be a higher standard of living.'' **********As Mr. Baumol sees it, it is not only blue-collar workers who are working less. ''People have chosen more leisure and less pressure on the job, management as much as anyone. Much of the antitrust action we see is business trying to protect itself from the pressures of the marketplace - opting for the easy life.'' **********For himself, Mr. Baumol faces a somewhat easier life than he has for the past year. He is returning to full-time academic life, leaving the defense of the economics profe ssi on to his successor as head of the A.E.A, Gardner H. Ackley. Mr. Ack ley was a member of President Kennedy's Council of Economic Advis ers and chairman of President Johnson's in the 1960's, who is now at the University of Michigan.   THE NEW MAN:GARDNER ACKLEY **********WASHINGTON The economics building at the University of Michigan burned down on Christmas Eve, taking with it cherished professorial books and papers. **********But Gardner H. Ackley, the Henry Carter Adams University Professor of Political Economy at the university, left Michigan anyway to attend the annual meeting of the American Economics Association. It was a meeting he could not miss. Last week he became the association's president, and it was he who arranged this year's program and its key theme: the role of Government in the economy. **********That theme has always been a key interest of Mr. Ackley's. Like others of his generation, the 66-year-old professor was attracted to economics by the the Great Depression. ''The problems were apparent, and I was interested in public policy and the role of Government in fixing the economy,'' he explained in an interview. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, where he specialized in microeconomics. ''At that time, there wasn't any macroeconomics to speak of,'' he said. **********Indeed, Mr. Ackley is one of the economists who helped shape the notion of the Government's role in economic policy-making. His first Government job was on the staff of President Roosevelt's National Planning Board. He later became a member of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Kennedy, and chairman of the council under President Johnson. Between his periods in the Government, Mr. Ackley taught and wrote one of the first textbooks on macroeconomics. **********From the beginning, he felt that Government should be involved in the economy. ''Roosevelt was making the Government bigger and a more important influence in the economy - and hopefully more constructive,'' Mr. Ackley said. **********How about today? ''I think the Government has continued to be constructive - no question about it,'' Mr. Ackley said. ''The Reagan efforts may be a temporary step backward, but I think attitudes will shift again and that it will go in the other direction.'' **********That is not to say Mr. Ackley is in favor of unlimited Government involvement. ''Substantial further regulation would be a step backward,'' he said. ''But if it is a question of the size of the budget or income redistribution activities, I am not alarmed by developments in these areas at all.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/12/world/begin-arrives-for-visit-to-us-talks-scheduled-with-reagan.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Miller", "pub_date": "1982-11-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 499, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TALKS SCHEDULED WITH REAGAN", "print_headline": "BEGIN ARRIVES FOR VISIT TO U.S.; TALKS SCHEDULED WITH REAGAN", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel arrived in the United States yesterday to start a 10-day visit that is to include talks with President Reagan. **********Mr. Begin's trip comes at a time of considerable strain between the Israeli Government and some American Jews, some fundamentalist Christians and the Reagan Administration. **********Mr. Begin is to meet with President Reagan at the White House on Nov. 19. **********'Deep Friendship' **********In a statement at Kennedy International Airport after his arrival, Mr. Begin said his discussions with Mr. Reagan would be ''imbued with the deep friendship between our two countries based on the community of interests between the United States and Israel.'' **********He declined to answer other questions about his planned meeting with Mr. Reagan or his reaction to the death of Leonid I.

However, prices of Treasury securities fell during the afternoon by between one-eighth and one-half point in the last hour when it became apparent that the Fed would not cut the discount rate. **********The 10 3/8 percent bonds, for example, closed at 98 7/8, up about three-fourths of a point on the day, to yield 10.5 percent, compared with 10.58 percent on Thursday. **********''With the market doing well on its own,'' said analysts at Ried, Thunberg & Company, the Fed was likely to delay a reduction in the discount rate until some time when it ''might get more bang for the buck.'' **********Rates for Treasury bills and other short-term securities declined yesterday, with the three-month Treasury issue falling to as low as 7.82 percent before rising during the afternoon to close at 7.95 percent, down only two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, on the day. **********The three-month bill rate was down from the 8.28 percent average set at last Monday's auction, but was still well above the 7.44 percent average rate at the Oct. 18 auction, when market participants thought that the Federal Reserve was going to bring rates down more quickly than it has. **********The $1.3 billion decline in the M-1 measure of the basic money supply, to $475.8 billion in the week ended Nov. 24, was in line with market expectations. Growth of M-1, which consists of currency plus all kinds of checking accounts, ''is likely to be volatile'' this month, according to economists at Money Market Services.  Increases might total about $5 billion in the next three weeks, but would be followed by large declines when banks introduce money market accounts on Dec. 14, they predicted. **********In the latest 13 weeks, M-1 has averaged $466.7 billion, and has grown at an annual rate of 12.7 percent.  Robert Schwartz, an economist at Merrill Lynch, said the growth of M-1, which is about $13 billion above the Fed's 5 1/2 percent growth target for 1982, was not alarming and would not prevent the Fed from announcing a discount rate cut later this month. **********Fed data also showed that business credit demands continued to weaken in the week ended Nov. 24, a development that tends to lower interest rates. Business loans outstanding at large banks across the country fell by $778 million, while business borrowing in the commercial paper market fell by another $972 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/25/business/finance-briefs-159921.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 255, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Air International Inc. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell two million units, each consisting of one share of common stock and one common stock purchase warrant, through an underwriting group managed by First Affiliated Services. *********** Amdeco Inc. said its board had authorized the purchase ot up to 200,000 shares of its stock outstanding. *********** Andarko Production Co. filed with the S.E.C. $100 million of notes due in 1992, to be offered through a Merrill Lynch group. *********** Campbell Taggart Inc. said it had exchanged $19.5 million in subordinated notes for 974,362 shares of its common stock held by a private estate. *********** Cities Service Co.'s registered secondary offering of 2.1 million common shares was ended yesterday morning.

At the same time, the programs provide the executives with an interesting experience, sometimes tinged with nostalgia. **********Programs vary. Some schools invite retired executives, some working ones. Cornell asks a recently retired executive for a full semester on campus, where he serves as a kind of visiting professor.  Dartmouth asks executives to spend a week or so, while other schools invite them for a few days. **********Talking about the students, the executives overflow with such adjectives as ''eager, bright, ambitious.'' But what about suggestions or contrasts with M.B.A.'s in earlier years? **********''When I graduated from Harvard Business School in 1940, I was not interviewed by anyone,'' said William Wendel, former president of the Kennecott Corporation and a recent executive-in-residence at Cornell. ''I don't think students are nearly innovative enough in finding jobs. They rely too much on recruiters, and most recruiters on campus come from big companies. Students should consider second-tier companies, like those listed on the American Stock Exchange.'' **********He added: ''I also think recruiters' stress is on specialization, and I don't like that. I feel strongly that the real benefit of an M.B.A. education is that it gives you knowledge of all aspects of the business scene.'' He questions whether future managers need specialize, unless they are headed for such professions as accounting. **********One apparent irony is that virtually every company that hires M.B.A.'s insists that it takes only the brightest. ''That's nonsense,'' M r. Wendel said. ''I couldn't be at all sure that the grades I gave were at all accurate.'' He said that in management courses, for example, grades do not necessarily reflect brightness ofthe student. **********There has been criticism in recent years that some M.B.A. students lack writing and speaking facility, and many graduate business schools are trying to remedy this by a required communications course or a remedial course. Today, most programs require all students to take such courses as accounting, management, marketing, statistics and computer science. **********Whatever their lack of imagination in finding jobs, the students today are better equipped than those of 30 years and more ago, Mr.  Wendel said. ''There is nothing so brash as an M.B.A.,'' he said.  ''The job of manager is much more difficult these days than when I graduated.'' He offered this advice to top managers: ''When you pick a successor, you should pick one you're sure is better than you are.'' **********''One weakness I did notice at Cornell is that students need more reality,'' he said. ''I guess I think there's a definite place for the executive-in-residence.'' In his course, he said, he used specific business cases. ''I told what I thought,'' he said. ''The experienced professor is adroit enough with questions to get the class around to understanding his way of thinking. I am not expert enough, so I had to tell them outright what I thought.'' **********Another executive-in-residence, George Howick, a former vice president of the Carborundum Company, and now a small-business man, agrees with Mr. Wendel about job-hunting M.B.A.'s. ''More smaller companies are looking at M.B.A.'s,'' he said. ''Don't let recruiters run the job search.'' **********Mr. Howick is spending a quarter term at Bowling Green University, in Ohio, teaching a course called ''Special Problems in Advanced Policy Making.'' He said the students have ''a breadth of knowledge that I did not have.'' **********Mr. Howick is also impressed by the s tudent s' communications ability, both oral and written, compared with that of the students heknew six or seven years ago. ''I think part o f the reason is the culture has changed,'' he said. ''These stude nts are intent on getting good jobs.'' **********He worries that business schools ''have become highly quantitative -perhaps too much so.'' Students have been trained in certain functions, he explained, but the task of a general manager often involves separating out what is important. ''I consider that they receive largely training rather than education,'' he said. ''They want jobs, and the universities are responding to what the market is demanding.'' **********''There is a limited opportunity for liberal education in business school,'' Mr. Howick went on. ''Students don't read great books and they don't study history.'' He urges students not to let ''their studies interfere with education.'' **********''I spend some time here making students aware of different management styles and cultures,'' he said, noting that this is a subject you cannot learn from books. **********Mr. Howick also thinks students' expectations are too high, as when they expect a vice presidency after just a few years. But like Mr.  Wendel, he believes that a student with a ''B'' average can do just as well with his M.B.A. as an ''A'' student. **********''Finally, I think students should be aware of all kinds of opportunities to change careers,'' Mr. Howick said. ''They need to be more flexible. They are a little bit rigid about where they expect to go.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/13/world/turks-jail-3-for-hiding-man-who-tried-to-kill-pope-in-81.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turks Jail 3 for Hiding Man Who Tried to Kill Pope in '81", "print_headline": "Turks Jail 3 for Hiding Man Who Tried to Kill Pope in '81", "body_text": " **********A martial law court today sentenced to prison three accomplices of Mehmet Ali Agca, the man who tried to assassinate Pope John Paul II, on convictions of hiding Mr. Agca after his escape from a Turkish prison in 1979. **********Officials said the three, Hasan Murat Pala, Mehmet Dursun and Mustafa Dikici, were each sentenced to three years and one month for hiding Mr. Agca and for helping him out of Turkey after his escape from a military prison in Istanbul on Nov. 25, 1979. **********He had been sentenced to death for killing Abdi Ipekci, editor of the newspaper Milliyet, in 1979. **********Mr. Agca, who is serving a life sentence in Italy, was seized after the assassination attempt on the Pope on May 13, 1981."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/01/world/conservation-wins-in-colombia.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 271, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONSERVATION WINS IN COLOMBIA", "print_headline": "CONSERVATION WINS IN COLOMBIA", "body_text": " **********Belisario Betancur Cuartas, the Conservative Party candidate, was elected President of Colombia over three opponents Sunday, according to nearly complete results announced today. **********More than 7 million of an electorate estimated at close to 13 million voted, many more than is usual in Colombian elections. **********Polling was marked by a notable absence of violence. **********Mr. Betancur's nearest opponent was the Liberal Party candidate, 69-year-old Alfonso Lopez Michelsen, President from 1974 to 1978, who lost by nearly 400,000 votes.

Habib, the special American envoy, to restore a cease-fire. **********In west Beirut, buildings rattled from the impact of Israeli shells that lighted up the night sky with orange flashes and produced a film of rancid smoke that wafted across the city. **********The day-long barrage came as Mr. Habib returned after having told Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel that he would determine within two days whether the 6,000 Palestinian troops trapped in west Beirut were indeed prepared to leave Lebanon. **********No Sign of Early Withdrawal **********The Palestinians, who have been fortifying their positions by setting up dirt barricades, erecting antitank barriers and adding fresh sandbags, do not appear to be preparing to leave soon. **********Hani al-Hassan, the chief Palestinian negotiator with the Lebanese Government, and indirectly with Mr. Habib, said Mr. Begin's repeated deadlines ''were becoming humorous.'' **********''They are designed to cover up his failure in Lebanon,'' said Mr.  al-Hassan, adding that the Palestinians were ready to withdraw and reorganize their political and military presence in Lebanon provided their conditions were met. **********The Palestinians, he indicated, want a permanent cease-fire, a disengagement of forces and the deployment of a multinational force to cover any withdrawal, and want the entire package framed in a United Nations resolution that would advance the Palestinians' right to self-determination. **********The Israeli bombardments are interpreted by the Palestinians as an unambiguous signal that Israel will not settle for anything less than a total and immediate withdrawal from Lebanon. **********Wafa, the Palestinian press agency, said that at least 28 people were killed or wounded in this morning's air raids. Most of the raids appeared to be concentrated on military positions and residential areas largely evacuated by civilians, unlike Tuesday's attacks, which took the lives of 120 people, most of them civilians. Shelling From Gunboats Offshore **********After a night in which Palestinian gunners traded artillery fire with Israeli warships about 10 miles offshore, Israeli planes struck in mid-morning, blasting the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra, Shatila and Burj al-Brajneh. The planes also hit the Palestinians' office complex in the Fakhani district, positions near the airport and an outpost in the city stadium, which has been bombed so many times that it looks like the Coliseum in Rome. **********Israeli artillery positions in the southeastern hills and the gunboats along the coast kept up artillery fire against the Palestinian neighborhoods of Lailake and Uazi and the seafront districts of Ramlet el Baida, Bain Militaire and Manara, setting off large fires, the Lebanese Government radio said. **********The Palestinians returned the fire, sending Katyusha rockets into the Israeli hillside encampments. The rockets arced over west Beirut in a thunderous roar. The guerrillas also fired their heavy 130-millimeter cannons at the gunboats, but did not appear to have much effect. **********The Lebanese Christian radio said several Palestinian rockets had landed in the Christian-controlled eastern sector of Beirut and near the Presidential Palace in suburban Baabda, but made no mention of casualties. **********Besides their human and material impact, the weeklong artillery duels are taking a psychological toll on the 500,000 civilians living in the predominantly Moslem western sector of Beirut. Adding to their plight is the fact that the Israelis occupying east Beirut have cut off electricity and water supplies to the western sector for the last three days. The two sectors of have been divided along the so-called Green Line since the civil war of 1975-76. **********Saeb Salam, the titular head of west Beirut's Sunni Moslem community, said neighborhood delegations had been visiting him all day, pleading with him to seek American help in getting the water and electricity turned back on. **********''People have no water and no electricity, and with the constant bombing cannot sleep,'' Mr. Salam told reporters. ''Doesn't anyone in the world care? S O S, S O S.'' **********After a meeting involving Mr. Habib, President Elias Sarkis and Prime Minister Shafik al-Wazzan at the Presidential Palace, Mr.  Wazzan said the American envoy's visit to several Arab capitals and Jerusalem had produced some progress. The important thing, he added, ''is that the progress be translated on the ground.'' **********Lebanese Government sources said the negotiations for a Palestinian withdrawal were waiting for several factors to come together . **********First, the sources said, Mr. Habib was apparently able to obtain tentative agreements from Egypt, Syria and Jordan to take some of the Palestinians, provided that it was in the context of an Arab League decision. The Arab foreign ministers are meeting in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, to see whether they can lay the groundwork for a unified stance. **********Second, there is still no agreement on how the Palestinians would withdraw, whether directly out of Lebanon or first to the Bekaa Valley and the north, leaving Lebanon only when the Israelis do. **********Third, the Palestinians and the Lebanese still need to work out the details of what the Palestinian troops would do with their heavy weapons, what guarantees would be provided for the security of the 650,000 Palestinian civilians remaining in Lebanon and what kind of residual political and military presence the Palestine Liberation Organization would maintain in Lebanon. **********Finally, the Palestinians want any withdrawal from Lebanon to take place in the framework of an American or United Nations initiative that would not only provide for a multinational peace force to oversee a pullout, but would also recognize the P.L.O. and its demands for a Palestinian state."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/07/business/barton-brands-sold.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Barton Brands Sold", "print_headline": "Barton Brands Sold", "body_text": " **********Amalgamated Distilled Products P.L.C., a Scotch whisky distiller and dealer, said it was buying Barton Brands Ltd., a Chicago liquor producer, for about $38 million.

More than 25 years ago, A.T.&T.; began monitoring a group of young managers' attitudes toward jobs to see how they evolved over time. A year and a half ago, two staff research psychologists pulled their findings together for a report, ''Career Motivation in Mid-Life Managers.'' The following is an adaptation of it. **********By ANN HOWARD and DOUGLAS W. BRAYEXPECTATIONS and advancement desires among managers seem to fade g radually, gracefully, and for most, fairly early. By the time m anagers were interviewed after 20 years on the job, most had long a go given up their early dreams, and many couldn't even remember how h igh they had aspired in the beginning. At least on the surface, mosta ccepted their career plateaus and adjusted to them. Mid-life was a c risis to some of our participants, but not to the majority. **********Aside from adjusting to career plateaus, many had sound reasons for not wanting further promotions, even if they were available. A major problem is that relocation often accompanies promotions. After 20 years, respondents indicated that as the number of job-required moves increased, the number of unfavorable reactions to them also increased, especially on the part of the family. At middle-age, nearly half thought a proposed future move would evoke an unfavorable reaction, even with a promotion. **********Other reasons for resisting further promotions included not wanting the aggravations of additional responsibility or not liking the politics expected at a higher level. Thus, the absence of further promotional opportunities is not necessarily seen as a personal tragedy. **********There are also reasons why the organization may not want employees to look ever upwards. Not everyone has the ability to perform the job at the next higher level. **********Participants in the Management Progress Study were college graduates newly hired into management and non-college people hired for non-management jobs but promoted into management before turning 32. Because this was in the late 1950's, this meant that all were white males. **********At the original assessment, staff members made predictions of whether the participants would make the third level of management within the first 10 years. Among the noncollege group, about the right number of mostly the right men had risen this far by the end of 16 years. Among college graduates, an optimal number of promotions had occurred by the eighth year; by the time 16 years had passed, nearly all the qualified men had been moved up to third level, but so had nearly two-thirds of those rated low in potential. **********Our advice is: Don't inveigle the system to dangle promotions in front of those who don't really want them and those the organization shouldn't really want at higher levels. Another lesson is: Don't feel too sorry for those who have plateaued. **********Many have reached the level to which they aspired, and others are frankly relieved they don't have to. Others adjusted to the inevitable many years before, gradually and gracefully. Still others are at least able to muster up enough defense mechanisms to keep them from crashing into the despondencies claimed to plague the middle-aged. Perhaps most important, after 20 years the correlation of management level with happiness was conspicuously not significant. On average, these men were just as happy with career success or without it. **********Middle age did not bring reduced motivation to respond to job challenge, regardless of job level. Also, greater desire for autonomy was notable by the eighth year, but rose even more in the next 12 years. Expanding opportunities for achievement and autonomy without necessarily involving promotion suggest rich opportunities for lateral transfers. **********But one precaution: Transfers are likely to be resisted if they involve relocation. When asked their feelings about relocations for a lateral transfer, fully three-quarters of the respondents in the 20-year interviews said their feelings would be negative. Family resistance can be quite strong. **********In addition, it is difficult to come out ahead financially; even the most liberal company relocation plans involve unforeseen costs and problems exacerbated by high inflation and skyrocketing mortgage rates. Because the average move costs the organization about $30,000 a year, this is not a step for the company to take lightly. **********If transfers without relocation are difficult to come by, an alternative may be to enlarge the scope of the current assignment.  But if jobs are made richer in responsibility and authority, will they also require sacrifices of personal time? This may be a problem. **********The relative importance of work in the men's lives was gauged in interviews with them over the years that were coded by a clinical psychologist for the relative importance of nine life themes, such as marriage and family, religion, community service, recreational and social pursuits and occupational involvement. **********As early as the first year it was becoming clear who was turning on and moving up. The differences between the groups continued to spread as the years went by, and it became clear that career success and the importance of work in the managers' lives were highly related. **********For those who ended up at the bottom, at the first and second level, the process of withdrawal from job involvement began almost immediately, when they were in their early 30's. For those at middlemanagement level, disengagement began after 10 to 13 years, when they were in their late 30's. Those who reached levels of vice president and above still had not withdrawn by their mid-40's.WITHDRAWAL from occupational involvement is a function of age and r elative career success. But even the lower-level men would like t heir hours to be absorbing. They just don't want to go beyond their 4 0 per week. **********In large organizations, most middle-level managers are middle-aged, and a few will emerge as the top management of the future. The Bell System has made efforts to identify potential officers from middle managers and to help prepare them for their presumed future responsibilities with an executive development course. **********Two groups of managers in the Bell Advanced Management Program, or BAMP, were given many of the same questionnaires that had been given to middle-aged participants of our Management Progress Study. **********When asked how soon they expect their next promotion, almost all BAMP managers said within the next three years while only 21 percent of the MPS men anticipated this and 62 percent thought they would never get another promotion. **********When asked about the importance of advancing one more level, more than half the BAMP group said it was extremely or very important compared to only 16 percent of the MPS men. Ambition was not dead among high-flying middle-aged managers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/23/world/cluster-bomb-debate-puts-focus-on-overall-arms-sales-to-mideast.html": {"writer_name": "Drew Middleton", "pub_date": "1982-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 627, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CLUSTER BOMB DEBATE PUTS FOCUS ON OVERALL ARMS SALES TO MIDEAST", "print_headline": "CLUSTER BOMB DEBATE PUTS FOCUS ON OVERALL ARMS SALES TO MIDEAST", "body_text": " **********The controversy over Israeli use of American-supplied cluster weapons and reports that Israel has made such weapons have focused attention on the high level of arms shipments to the Middle East by the Soviet Union, France, West Germany, Britain, Italy, the United States and a number of smaller arms producers. **********An American military expert said it was impossible to fix a figure for the total arms transfers involved because in many cases the value of the sale and the date of delivery has not been announced. **********At present $1.5 billion worth of combat aircraft, self-propelled guns and armored personnel carriers are in the pipeline for delivery to Israel. The sale of 11 F-15 fighters is also being negotiated. **********Sales and transfers to Israel have expanded rapidly since 1980. So, however, have sales and transfers to Arab nations.  American military sales to Egypt amounted to $10.5 million in 1977. In 1980 and 1981, after the Camp David agreements, the sales were $203.8 million and $203.3 million. Deliveries from 1981 through 1983 are expected to include more than 300 M-60 tanks, 12 batteries of improved Hawk surface-to-air missiles and nearly 1,000 air-to-air missiles for installation in Egypt's fighters, including 40 F-16 aircraft under order.

The Israeli argument is that given time and thorough training programs, the T-72 and its crews will eventually pose a far greater threat to Israel. **********Syria has 400 T-72's. British military analysts believe that the Soviet Union has promised the delivery of another 250. United States analysts could not confirm this report. **********Syria will receive from the Soviet Union in the remainder of this year, according to a NATO intelligence source, ''a considerable number of self-propelled guns and Frog surface-to-surface missiles.''  Israeli Air Superiority **********The Israeli Air Force has maintained its superiority over any combination of Arab air forces since the 1956 Suez crisis.

Syria has an undisclosed number of MIG-23 fighters on order from Moscow. Tiny Qatar will receive 11 Mirage F-1 fighters from France. Iraq, after some minor losses in the war with Iran, is to receive 150 MIG-23's, 25's and 27's as well as 24 more Mirage F-1's from France. **********Although the Camp David agreement took Egypt out of the ranks of Israel's enemies, Israeli officials are privately worried about the modernization of the Egyptian Air Force.

The very short one is Milton Friedman, the monetarist who is considered the core of the conservative Chicago school of economics; the very tall one is George J. Stigler, a professor at the business school and a longtime champion of deregulation. **********Mr. Friedman, 70 years old, won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1976. Yesterday his friend Mr. Stigler was also awarded that prize. In a telephone interview, the tweedy, whitehaired professor was asked where the two economists parted company. ''Milton's out to save the world,'' he said, ''and I'm out to understand it.'' **********The remark disclosed much, both about Mr. Stigler's sense of humor -widely described as his most striking feature - and his approach to economics. **********For two decades, much of his research has focused on government regulation, from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the regulation of public utilities. While his conclusion has often been that such regulation is neutral or worse, ''I've become more interested in why things happen than how to change them,'' he said. Welcomed by His Colleagues **********The selection of Mr. Stigler, who is 71, was widely hailed by fellow economists, including those at the opposite end of the theoretical spectrum. **********''His research is controversial but respected,'' said Paul Samuelson, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and Nobel award winner who, as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, knew Mr. Stigler. But as Mr. Samuelson, who is a Keynesian, noted, if Mr. Stigler represented a minority view when he began his research, ''a growing fraction of economists are coming around to that view.'' **********Mr. Stigler may also be the first Nobel economist who has written extensively about the history of economics. ''He represents the humane tradition of scholarship,'' Mr. Samuelson said. **********In addition, he has established a reputation among legal experts for his study of the interaction of economics and law in such areas as antitrust, law enforcement, privacy and the theory of legislation. ''He is one of the pioneers of economic analysis of law,'' said Richard Posner, a Federal appeals court judge in Chicago who formerly taught law at the University of Chicago. **********A hallmark of Mr. Stigler's career has been his close association with Mr. Friedman. The two studied together under Frank Knight, then the guru of neoclassical economics at Chicago. In 1946, they wrote a book that argued that if controls were eliminated, the shortage of housing would be quickly ended. For a number of years, both Mr.  Stigler and Mr. Friedman taught at Chicago. 'He's Good Theater' **********''They're both difficult professors, tough graders,'' said Richard Thain, the business school's dean for career development, noting that many commercial banks and investment houses had a special interest in Mr. Stigler's students. ''As a lecturer, he's good theater,'' Mr. Thain added. **********''He has an exceeding wit and an exacting standard,'' said Paul MacA@voy, a Yale economics professor who began his teaching career under Mr. Stigler at Chicago more than a decade ago. At that time, he recalled, Mr. Stigler dominated the university's weekly workshops on industrial organization, attended by doctoral candidates. ''I've seen people break into tears under his insistent application of the highest standards,'' Mr. MacAvoy said. **********''He's very witty, and it's better to be laughing with him,'' Mr.  Samuelson said. ''His wit has point, and it's drawn blood.'' Born in Renton, Wash., in 1911, George Joseph Stigler graduated from the University of Washington in 1931 and received a master's degree in business administration from Northwestern University the following year. He studied economics, he said yesterday, because ''it was the middle of the Depression, and it seemed better to go to school than look for work.'' He got his doctorate at the University of Chicago in 1938. His Many Study Posts **********His teaching posts have included Iowa State College, the University of Minnesota, Brown University, the London School of Economics and, from 1947 to 1958, Columbia University. In 1958, he returned to the University of Chicago as the Charles R. Walgreen Distinguished Service Professor of American Institutions. **********He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1955 and a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences in 1957-58. In 1964, he was president of the American Economic Association. While he has accepted a number of minor government assignments, he turned down a high-level appointment with the Nixon Administration because, he said, ''I didn't want to go down there for two years.'' **********A widower for the past 12 years, Mr. Stigler has three sons: One is a statistics professor at the University of Chicago, another is a lawyer with Heublein and the third is a social worker in Toronto.  His hobbies are photography and golf. Recent Winners of the Nobel Prize for Economics 1978 Herbert A.

These days a faculty shortage at engineering schools, for example, has reached ''crisis proportions,'' according to educators.  There are possibly 2,000 unfilled jobs, or about 10 percent of engineering schools' faculty. **********Engineering enrollment is at a record high, thanks to the lure of high corporate salaries, but many schools are short of teachers because a lot of them, too, have been enticed by high industry pay. **********The National Engineering Action Council met recently in New York to consider ways to alleviate the faculty shortage, under the aegis of Paul Gray, president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. **********The council's chairman, Edward E. David Jr., president of the Exxon Research and Engineering Company, said the shortage threatened ''the quality of engineering education.'' A need for higher faculty salaries, new equipment and greater cooperation with industry were stressed. **********There are intangible benefits, however, that an engineer might consider when choosing between industry and academia.  The $30,000-a-year starting salary a young engineer might command in industry involves a full year's work, while a faculty member works only about nine months when the Christmas, spring and summer vacations are subtracted. Thus a $24,000 faculty job would be equivalent to $30,000 or so in industry. **********At Cornell University, the associate dean of the engineering school, Donald F. Berth, said recently, ''We're putting together packages for young engineers with a Ph.D.'' In addition to $27,000 in salary, an arrangement is made for them to spend a month or so consulting for a fee ranging from $4,000 to $10,000. This, he added, brings income up to industry levels. **********In addition, campus life offers many advantages for faculty members and their families - tennis, swimming pools, gymnasium, golf course, squash courts. Campus nursery schools are often available, and good public schools are nearby. For older children of faculty members, college tuition is often free. **********Low-cost housing is another perquisite at some universities, and costs tend to be lower anyway in a nonurban setting. Meanwhile, an engineer taking a company job in California's Silicon Valley is unlikely to find a house for less than $180,000, according to Robert J. Parden, dean of the University of Santa Clara's engineering school. **********Campus advantages can thus be worth many thousands of dollars to young faculty members. As they rise toward tenure, opportunities for research grants, consulting fees and endowed chairs increase. **********As another inducement, an engineer on the faculty of a thriving engineering school can keep pace with new technology, while one employed in industry may fall behind developments or become overspecialized. **********The shortage of qualified engineering teachers can also mean a quicker route to high-level positions than in industry, where the competition can be fierce. **********To alleviate the shortage, the National Engineering Action Council favors setting faculty compensation ''at a level recognizing realistically the market for such talent in industry.'' **********It also urges high priority for modernizing equipment to sustain ''frontier research'' and instruction based on current technology. It favors the use of technical aid to give professors more teaching and research time and part-time employment of engineers from industry as adjunct professors. **********The council suggests that engineering schools reconsider the Ph.D requirement for faculty, placing greater reliance on practical skill. And it urges creative methods of research to attract industry involvement. **********Meanwhile, engineering schools already use varied techniques.  The University of Minnesota has raised engineering tuition about $250 a semester, earmarking the extra money for faculty salaries.  M.I.T. has a cooperative program for graduate students. They work in industry but receive time off for studying.  Fifteen companies now support Carnegie-Mellon University's Robotics Institute.  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has established business-related projects, including an industrial park on land it owns.  The Massachusetts High Technology Council has urged its members to allot 2 percent of research and development expenditures to engineering education - an indication of the growing flow of industrial money into engineering schools. Major companies that have increased their aid to engineering education include Arco, Dow, Exxon, Union Carbide, Eastman Kodak, General Electric, Shell and Hughes Tool."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/14/business/city-stores-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-july-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CITY STORES CO reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "print_headline": "CITY STORES CO reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/21/business/olin-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OLIN CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "OLIN CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/29/business/business-people-rolls-royce-chairman.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1982-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 314, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ROLLS-ROYCE CHAIRMAN", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; ROLLS-ROYCE CHAIRMAN", "body_text": " **********William Duncan, the 59-year-old deputy chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, will become chairman of Rolls-Royce Ltd., Britain's state-owned producer of aircraft engines.

Shultz, putting the controversy over the pipeline issue with the European allies aside, has undertaken a discussion with them on overall East-West economic issues as the first step toward devising a more coordinated allied policy on trade with the Russians. **********United States and Western European officials said here yesterday that Mr. Shultz had been mostly listening to the Europeans, asking their attitude toward commerce with the Russians and toward the tightening of credits and technology sales to them. **********Mr. Shultz, who has been in New York for the United Nations General Assembly session since Sunday, is to address the world body today. He has already conferred privately with the foreign ministers of France, Britain and Italy, and the minister of state from West Germany, on East-West issues. Those four countries are the main suppliers of equipment for the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Siberia to Western Europe. **********The Reagan Administration, in retaliation for the imposition of martial law in Poland, has barred American companies from participating in the pipeline. It has angered the Europeans by trying to ban European affiliates from taking part and European companies from supplying components using American technology. Sanctions have been imposed against companies defying the Administration's actions. New Approach Sought **********John Hughes, Mr. Shultz's spokesman, said Monday that Mr. Shultz had agreed with his European counterparts that because the differences over the pipeline were so wide there was no point in discussing possible compromises. **********But American and West European officials said yesterday that Mr.  Shultz has made clear that in putting the pipeline issue aside, he was searching for a new approach to East-West trade that could avoid such rifts in the future. **********Mr. Hughes, who told reporters again yesterday that Mr. Shultz, in a meeting with Foreign Minister Emilio Colombo of Italy, had not discussed the pipeline dispute in detail, was asked why the issue was being avoided. **********''Well, I think basically that what is happening is a wider discussion of the overall East-West economic situation as it exists and how it might exist in the future, and a tendency to get away from the specifics in the pipeline dispute that has caused such controversy,'' he said. 'A Comparison of Notes' **********A senior West German official said that in Mr. Shultz's discussion on Monday with Minister of State Berndt von Staden, the Secretary had sought ''to get a feeling of what the Europeans think and how East-West economic relations are seen in the context of East-West relations as a whole.'' **********The Americans, he said, did not want to start the discussions ''on the decisive issue'' of the pipeline, but rather with what the French call 'a comparison of notes,' '' he said. **********''One day,'' the official said, ''we'll have to come to grips with the pipeline issue, but for the Secretary it is a first round. He wants to know what the Europeans are thinking.'' **********Foreign Secretary Francis Pym of Britain, who conferred with Mr.  Shultz on Tuesday, said at a news conference yesterday, ''We have to renew a debate on the ground rules over East-West trade.'' **********He said that ''we are trying to reconcile a difference that has been blown out of proportion by the press.'' ''What we need to do,'' he added, ''is establish a framework for East-West trade.'' Basic Difference Noted **********Mr. Shultz, in his two and a half months in office, has developed a reputation for taking his time before coming up with policy initiatives and for listening to many voices before making a decision. This was his approach leading to President Reagan's Middle East initiative and apparently is what is being done now over differences on East-West trade. **********Several Europeans said yesterday there is a basic difference with the Reagan Administration over trade with the Russians. The Europeans said they had told Mr. Shultz that they do not believe trade sanctions have that much impact on the Soviet Union and that while there was merit in barring technology with a military application they opposed the Reagan Administration's efforts to block the sale of advanced technology for use in the exploitation of natural gas and oilfields. **********Mr. Pym said that there had to be a debate not only on future credits and technological sales to the Russians, but on sales of food as well. The United States is a major seller of grain to the Russians, something that is pointed out repeatedly by Europeans who argue that this undercuts the Reagan Administration's arguments against the pipeline. ---- Baldrige Outlines Views By Reuters **********Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said yesterday that the Reagan Administration would not conduct business as usual with the Soviet Union despite pressure from Western Europe to lift the Siberian pipeline sanctions. But he indicated that the Administration might consider alternative approaches to penalize the Soviet Union for what Washington sees as its role in the declaration of martial law in Poland. **********Addressing the National Association of Export Companies in New York, he said the Administration would consider Western European suggestions ''if our European allies could get together with some unified approach that would be as effective as sanctions.'' **********''We will sit down at any time and talk about another approach besides sanctions,'' he said.

But this week about 300 persons, from all parts of the country, attended the fourth annual Hospitality Industry Investment Conference, sponsored jointly by the Real Estate Institute, Stephen W. Brener Associates, Lodging Hospitality Magazine and Pannell, Kerr & Forester, the real estate accounting and research firm. **********The hotel and motel executives were drawn to the event, held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Monday and Tuesday, to listen to, mingle with and pick up ideas from their colleagues as well as to make contacts with potential lenders or investors. **********''We consider this a working meeting providing important information and points of view for even the most experienced people in real estate,'' said Denis Phillips, dean of the School of Continuing Education at N.Y.U., who was an instrumental part in the formation of the university's Real Estate Institute. **********In characterizing the tone of the conference Mr. Brener said: ''Obviously we are in a recession and the hotel industry is feeling the squeeze. But despite the slowdown I think a lot of people have made it a point to be here to try to figure out what is going on and what they can do to make their business better.'' **********According to Mr. Brener's statistics, local hotels and motels reached a record high occupancy rate of 81 percent in 1979 and have suffered more than an eight percentage point drop since then. **********In the six sessions of the conference, participants dealt with such topics as alternative routes to financing, prospective institutional investment opportunities, the success of the unique-format hotels and motels, and the hospitality industry from the developers' point of view. **********As guides in their discussions, conference participants had such specialists as Gary L. Wilson, senior vice president of finance and development for Marriott Hotels; Jerrold Wexler, chairman of the Jupiter Corporation; Claude Ballard, a partner of Goldman, Sachs & Company, the investment house, and Charles E. Sayers Jr., vice president of real estate financing for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. **********Because hotel and motel chains offering an alternative to the standard room-with-bath format have apparently avoided the downward trend, according to some industry analysts, the panel discussion on special formats attracted considerable attention. **********Stephen B.

Wrigley Jr. Company is aggressively trying to re-establish itself as the nation's leading manufacturer of chewing gum. **********The Chicago-based company, having turned back a challenge from its competitors' sugarless and bubble gum products, is now intent on becoming a force in the market for liquid-center gums. **********Wrigley tried to do so once - and failed. The company introduced two liquid-filled chewing gum products several years ago, aimed at adults as a breath freshener, but they were withdrawn last year. **********Now Wrigley has brought out a new liquid-center bubble gum meant for children. Although the company contends that the new gum, called Tidal Wave, is completely different, and says that it will capture about 10 percent of the bubble gum market, some analysts are not enthusiastic about its prospects. Wrigley's Domination **********''The fact that the new one is a bubble gum and the other was a chewing gum won't make much difference,'' said Richard G. Elam, an investment analyst at Bacon, Whipple & Company, a Chicago brokerage firm. ''I'm afraid this product may meet the same fate as the first.'' **********Ever since William Wrigley Jr. started selling a spearmint-flavored gum in the late 1800's, Wrigley has had things pretty much its own way. For almost 80 years, the company sold only four kinds of gum - Doublemint, Spearmint, Juicy Fruit and P.K. -which were all introduced before 1915. P.K., the first sugar-coated gum, is sold almost exclusively for export. **********Wrigley controlled more than two-thirds of the total gum market until the 1970's, when its competitors -mainly Squibb's Bubble Yum and Care-Free sugarless gum (now owned by Nabisco Brands) and Warner-Lambert's Trident and Freshen-Up, the leading liquid-center chewing gum - mounted a serious challenge. Wrigley's market share declined to about 33 percent. **********But the company, which operates out of a white Renaissance-style landmark skyscraper, bounced right back. First, in 1974, it introduced Freedent, a special gum for denture wearers. Then it followed with Big Red, a cinnamon-flavored gum, two years later, and, in 1977, its first sugar-free gum. Finally, in 1979, the company took on Squibb's soft bubble gum product with the introduction of Hubba Bubba. Restructuring the Company **********To move these new products, Wrigley restructured its staid sales and marketing department. ''Our field force were still using pre-World War II techniques until we brought it up to date,'' said Claude Brooks, Wrigley's first vice president and corporate secretary. **********As a result, Wrigley's has reclaimed the top spot in the gum market, with a 44 percent market share. The company is No.1 in standard chewing gum; No.2 in bubble gum, behind Nabisco Brands, and No.2 in sugarless gum, behind Warner-Lambert. It hopes the resurgence in market share will end a two-year decline in its net income, which fell 7 percent last year, to $28.4 million, on sales of $607.8 million. **********The company reported a 13 percent increase in net income during the first quarter of this year, to $7.6 million, on sales of $137.3 million, compared with net income of $6.7 million, on sales of $148.9 million in the 1981 period. But the rise in net income resulted from accounting changes. Restating the figures based on prior accounting methods, Wrigley had a 13 percent drop in net income, to $5.6 million. **********The liquid-filled gum market has proved hard for Wrigley to crack.  The failure of its two previous entries resulted from weakness in demand for a liquid-center breath freshener, according to Mr. Brooks, who chewed more than a pack of the new gum during a recent interview.  Appealing to Children **********''We found that the gum appealed more to kids than to adults,'' he said. So Wrigley yanked the product off the market, modified it and reintroduced it as a bubble gum product for children. **********Repositioning products has worked for Wrigley before. When it introduced Big Red in direct competition with Warner-Lambert's Dentyne, sales began to lag after some initial success. Wrigley reintroduced the gum as a breath freshener, and its sales grew 20 percent a year. According to Mr. Brooks, the company expects the same thing for its liquid-center entry. **********''The demand for Tidal Wave is already ahead of production,'' he said.  Mr. Brooks said that the new gum was intended to capture 10 percent of the $500 million bubble gum market. But Warner-Lambert has introduced a similar liquid-center bubble gum product to complement its Freshen-Up and Chewels liquid-filled gums. **********A spokesman for the Warner-Lambert Company, Jack Sholl, declined to discuss the new product at length, but he did say that ''it's a successful product - the company is satisfied'' with its sales. **********Analysts expect the battle of the liquid-filled gums to intensify.  ''Wrigley is serious about this market,'' said Ronald L. Strauss, an analyst at William Blair & Company, a Chicago brokerage firm.  ''They learned a lot from their previous failure. We could see quite a battle.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/23/business/internorth-filing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Internorth Filing", "print_headline": "Internorth Filing", "body_text": " **********Internorth Inc. of Omaha, a natural gas pipeline distributor, said it had increased its stake in the Bucyrus-Erie Company, a manufacturer of mining and construction equipment, to 9.5 percent of the 20.4 million common shares outstanding.

Experts say it will not be long, however, before the shock waves spread far beyond Foggy Bottom. **********American companies are likely to channel more research and development outside the United States, diffusing technology and making it easier for Moscow to acquire, said Harald B. Malmgren, an independent trade consultant. Reactions from Europe and elsewhere may also become more tangible, he said. **********Canada and France, which both oppose intensifying the economic cold war with Moscow, may ignore the United States position and become more flexible in their own dealings with Moscow. More Installment Debt **********Despite painfully high interest rates and continuing pessimism about the course of the economy, consumers are again inching out on the credit limb. Thanks largely to the rebate-inspired jump in auto sales, May's report on consumer debt, due Thursday from the Commerce Department, should show a rise from April levels, says Sandra Shaber, an economist at Chase Econometrics. And, while the stimulating impact of last week's tax cut is likely to mean more credit purchases in the second half, the growth is not apt to be as vigorous as in past recoveries, Mrs. Shaber said. Housing is almost sure to remain in the doldrums, dampening spending on household appliances and furnishings, traditional buy-now-pay-later purchases. Some consumers may decide to use their fatter paychecks to reduce their debt load, she said, before taking on new responsibilities. **********Mrs. Shaber forecasts that consumer credit this year will rise 8.6 percent above 1981 levels. That reflects a somewhat less hopeful view of the second half than Mrs. Shaber held in the winter. Then she predicted a a strong enough recovery to generate an 11 percent increase in consumer credit for 1982. The OPEC Roller Coaster **********The last four months have been difficult for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. As members gather in Vienna this week, the problem they thought had been overcome last spring - squaring production with sagging demand - refuses to go away. **********With Nigeria, Libya and Iran producing above target levels, analysts say OPEC's output is exceeding its 17.5 million barrel-a-day ceiling by at least 1 million barrels. Unless further reductions are made, spot prices, which have begun to soften again, are likely to fall further from the $34 benchmark. Promises of lower production are apt to be made in Vienna, but analysts doubt they will be kept. **********Mounting debt and political differences with Saudi Arabia make it unlikely that Iran and Libya will cut production, said William Brown, director of energy studies at the Hudson Institute. And, while another sharp cut in Saudi production might correct the imbalance, that probably will not happen either. **********At this point, Mr. Brown said, only an early end to the inventory liquidation process or economic revival in major consuming countries can keep spot prices, now around $32, from falling further. Disconcerting Job Numbers **********An increasing number of analysts are proclaiming that the recession ended in May, but the first peek at conditions in June does little to support that notion. **********Although June's unemployment rate remained stuck at 9.5 percent, the jobless rate may not yet have reached its peak, said James Pihera, an economist at Georgia State University. Student joblessness recorded a surprisingly sharp drop last month. That trend is not likely to continue through the summer, Mr. Pihera said, and could push the overall jobless rate up to 9.8 percent in July and August. **********Other portions of the Labor Department report indicate the job markets have already deteriorated further. Overall employment and hours worked, two coincident indicators, showed sharp declines in June, Mr. Pihera said. That means that industrial production, which has declined in nine of the last ten months, probably fell again, too. **********To make matters worse, unemployment in the cyclical manufacturing and construction industries has risen further. If that continues, some analysts say it is more likely that the effects could spill over into the service sector, which thus far has remained relatively unaffected by the current downturn.

And the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has predicted this winter's flu season will be heavier than last year's. **********But the 12-year-old Du Pont subsidiary has had favorable medical press and heavy flu outbreaks in the past, and sales of Symmetrel, the only available flu drug, are only slightly more than $10 million. **********''Although it's gotten good medical journal press, Symmetrel has been a disappointment in the marketplace,'' said James Arenson, an industry analyst with the brokerage firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. **********Endo, whose annual sales total about $100 million, represents only a small part of Du Pont, where sales in 1981 totaled $22.8 billion.  Indeed, Endo has been overshadowed by its sprawling corporate parent but, as pharmaceutical industry analysts suggest, it is also not performing very aggressively. **********Du Pont entered the pharmaceutical business in 1966, when its scientists developed Symmetrel. In 1969, the company purchased Endo Laboratories, a private Long Island drug concern, primarily for its marketing capabilities. It is interesting, then, that industry analysts cite marketing problems as a major factor in Symmetrel's low profile among the flu-catching public. Endo's Marketing Funds **********Mr. Arenson said that one of the problems has been the restrictive method with which the company finances promotion of the drug. Money for marketing comes directly from Endo's own budget and not from the parent company, which means Endo is left virtually on its own to market its products. **********Mr. Arenson also asserted that too much money is pumped into research and development at the expense of marketing. According to Hazen L. Richardson, general manager of Du Pont's biochemicals department, 40 percent of sales are used in research and development, compared with an industry average of 11.5 percent. And more emphasis on research is planned, Mr. Richardson said. **********''Endo does not have the marketing capabilities, but I don't know if that's the only thing holding them back,'' said Leslie Ravitz, an industry analyst with Salomon Brothers. **********Another problem may have been Symmetrel's restricted uses after it was introduced. It was approved by the F.D.A. in 1966 for prevention of Asian A-2 influenza virus. By 1976 it received a broader approval for use in preventing all influenza A viruses, which are the most common of all viruses. In November 1980, the drug was granted F.D.A.  approval for treatment, as well as prevention, of all influenza viruses. With each of these additional F.D.A. approvals, Endo's potential market for Symmetrel was expanded. **********Last year, Endo embarked on a marketing effort aimed at linking Symmetrel with relief from the flu. The company was host at a public health seminar for 7,500 public health officials last December at the National Institutes of Health in Washington. **********The marketing blitz, Endo's first ever, was apparently unnecessary, since last winter's flu season was among the lightest on record.  Still, Edwin E. Messikomer, president of Endo Laboratories and director of Du Pont's pharmaceutical operations, said he is pleased with Symmetrel's sales. ''They were right on forecast,'' he added.  '''m glad it's held up despite the weakened flu season.'' **********''To a degree, Symmetrel is discretionary,'' one industry analyst said. ''If you don't use it, you're still going to get over the flu.'' One problem with the drug is its side effects, and Endo scientists have developed another drug that does not produce as many side effects as Symmetrel. **********Some industry analysts indicate that Endo will not likely blossom until Du Pont acquires another pharmaceutical concern.  Mr. Messikomer said his company was ''evaluating new opportunities,'' both by developing its own products and by seeking new products to license or companies to acquire. **********In all, Mr. Richardson said there were 12 new products in varying stages of development at Endo, including a cardiovascular drug, which controls nervous system disorders, and an anti-arthritic. The antiarthritic, Tiflamizole, is currently in clinical testing and, according to Mr. Richardson, two to three years away from market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/23/business/echlin-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-nov-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ECHLIN INC reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "print_headline": "ECHLIN INC reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/15/business/new-issues-slowing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 418, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW ISSUES SLOWING", "print_headline": "NEW ISSUES SLOWING", "body_text": " **********After last week's deluge of new corporate notes and bonds, when 17 issues with a face amount of $1.9 billion were sold, underwriters have scaled back their financing plans this week but warn that the volume could increase if investor demand strengthens. **********Last week's supply of new issues was one reason why prices of outstanding issues fell as much as 3 1/2 points to raise yields as much as 40 basis points.

McKinney, chairman and chief executive officer. **********Mr. McKinney has made it clear that Manville's strategy involved increasing pressure on the Government to push the growing asbestos compensation problem out of the courts and to help pay the claims of tens of thousands of workers who have sued the company and others in the industry. ''I expect to emerge from this, some system in which the Federal Government pays its share,'' he said. **********Mr. McKinney's expectations, however, are not about to be realized soon. To start with, some of his basic assumptions are disputed by lawmakers.

The dust was later linked to cancer, which, like asbestosis, usually appeared three or four decades after exposure. **********Shipyard workers are the major source of the litigation that has sent Manville, UNR Resources and several smaller insulation makers into bankruptcy hearings. **********During World War II, workers in Navy and private shipyards often labored in thick clouds of asbestos dust as they raced to build or repair warships and freighters. Almost 56,000 workers were heavily exposed during the war, according to the study on which Manville based its decision to file for bankruptcy. **********During the war, the Government issued directives on permissible asbestos uses. But the record shows that guidelines on proper exposure and operating procedures were frequently ignored. **********In 1964, Dr. Irving Selikoff and a research team at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York published a study of asbestos disease in insulation workers indicating that the problem was far more serious and widespread than thought. In succeeding years, increasingly tough regulations on allowable exposure and labeling requirements were adopted by the Government, some despite industry objections. **********Today, there are an estimated 35,000 plaintiffs seeking compensation from 250 companies for asbestos-related diseases. About nine million Americans living today are thought to have been exposed to asbestos from 1940 to 1980. Estimates of total asbestos liability have ranged from $50 billion to $200 billion. For U.S Payments **********Proponents of increased Federal participation in compensating the asbestos plaintiffs argue on three basic grounds - legal responsibility, morality and practicality. **********So far, the Government has never been found liable for injury to anyone who worked with asbestos. Proponents of Federal participation in a compensation fund say, however, that the Government has preserved that record only by invoking sovereign immunity, which protects it against many actions to which private parties may be subject. They say the courts should remove this defense or support legal theories that get plaintiffs around it. **********The basis of the proponents' argument is the contention that Government knew everything the industry knew about the dangers of asbestos and thus was negligent in supervising shipyards. Moreover, they say, the Government, by specifying the use of asbestos in many jobs and by promulgating weak guidelines and regulations, contributed to the problems, and thus there should be a legal basis for shared liability. The Morality Argument **********More important, they say, the Government's role makes it morally responsible to support a compensation fund even if the cloak of sovereign immunity preserves it from liability. **********''I don't think there's a smoking gun, but the data in hand show the Government's pervasive involvement is enough,'' contended David Pullen, a Manville executive who is a spokesman for the Asbestos Compensation Coalition, an industry-sponsored lobbying group. Mr.  Pullen said that most of the persons exposed to asbestos could be regarded as war victims, to whom the Government owes support analagous to that received by veterans. **********Finally, proponents of Government compensation argue that as a practical matter, it will cost the Government less and compensate the plaintiffs better if all claims were consolidated in a federally directed and supported compensation plan. Against U.S. Payments **********Opponents of Federal contributions to a new compensation plan think the courts will continue to say there is no legal basis for suing the Government for asbestos-related diseases. And Government lawyers dispute the significance of many of the statements and actions cited as proof of pervasive Government involvement or negligence. **********Peter Nowinski, a Justice Department lawyer, added that available documents showed ''an earnest if not always successful effort at surveillance'' in shipyards and that industry was the source of the guidelines the Government set. **********Negligent or not, the Government contends it has compensated all of its employees to the limits required by law under the Federal Employment Compensation Act. As of last December, it faced 6,000 such claims and had paid $9 million on the small percentage that had been processed. The Government also paid the industry's contributions to state workers' compensation programs for those who worked under contract to it in private shipyards, in addition to supporting asbestos-afflicted persons in welfare and support programs. **********Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and sponsor of a bill that would set up a compensation fund supported by industry and insurers and cut off future litigation, said: ''There's no indication that the whole thing will fall apart without Government participation in the compensation fund.'' **********As for practicality, Mr. Miller and his colleagues argue that it would be more feasible politically and better financially for taxpayers to reform workers' compensation law than to ''socialize American industry's losses.'' The Outlook **********There seems to be a growing consensus among Congressmen most familiar with asbestos problems that a federally arranged substitute for litigation is needed for fair, efficient compensation of persons who contracted lung disease or cancer caused by asbestos inhalation.  But there is no vocal support for the position that the Government should participate in a compensation fund. **********''You could say that Manville's filing lent urgency to the matter, but it didn't make the issues clearer,'' said William Shore, legislative assistant to Senator Gary Hart, Democrat of Colorado, sponsor of the bill most favorable to the asbestos manufacturers. **********Senator Hart's bill would set up a commission to judge relative responsibility of various producers and users of asbestos, leaving open the question of whether the Government was partly to blame.  Analysts assume that it would result in some Government participation in the fund, although the bill itself is careful not to assume Government responsibility. **********Legislation introduced by Mr. Miller and the most recent version of a bill by Representative Millicent Fenwick, Republican of New Jersey, would move litigation out of the courts and into the workers' compensation arena, but would not provide for Government contributions to the fund. **********The Asbestos Compensation Coalition shows some optimism. ''We are gaining a momentum, although I can't name our supporters and I wouldn't call it a snowball,'' Mr. Pullen said. **********''There's a consensus that some legislated remedy is needed,'' Mr.  Shore said. ''That's progress, since Mr. Miller used to oppose that.  I'd be surprised if there isn't some middle ground with limited Government participation that he could live with.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/04/business/ncc-plans-to-sell-simplicity-stake.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 148, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NCC Plans to Sell Simplicity Stake", "print_headline": "NCC Plans to Sell Simplicity Stake", "body_text": " **********NCC Energy Ltd. is seeking to sell its 20 percent interest in the Simplicity Pattern Company, the large sewing patterns producer, which had suspended a planned merger with NCC Energy.

The measures are part of its response to increasing pressures from the United States and Western Europe, which are suffering high unemployment while running huge trade deficits with Japan. **********''Japan realizes that its prosperity depends upon the prosperity of the United States and Europe,'' said Masumi Esaki, a former Minister of International Trade and Industry and chairman of a special committee of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party charged with easing trade frictions. ''Therefore, we are determined to do all we can to maintain the free-trade system.'' **********The products most affected by the changes that will be made in regulations governing imports are cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, motor vehicles, electrical appliances and equipment, and sporting goods. Response to Pressure **********Japan's huge trade surpluses have aggravated unemployment in the West. Accordingly, the pressure on Japan to make its markets more accessible to Western goods - or face possible protectionist action against Japanese exports - has intensified in recent months. **********Japanese and Western government officials have expressed concern that moves toward protectionism could set off retaliatory actions by other nations, possibly resulting in a trade war. **********On Tuesday, the Government disclosed the broad outlines of the measures it said it would take to make exporting to Japan easier. It said that 67 nontariff barriers to the Japanese market would be eliminated or significantly reduced. These barriers essentially restrict imports by insisting upon certain levels of product quality and safety, as well as product testing. Some of the barriers prohibit the use of certain foreign-made goods, such as tennis balls and aluminum baseball bats. **********Today, at a quickly arranged news conference, the 67 areas marked for action were identified, from a list of 99 nontariff barriers that had been in the subject of complaints by all of Japan's trading partners. **********Of the remaining 32 complaints, Mr. Esaki said that 9 would b e studied furth er, 15 were based on misunderstandings by the foreign countries and 8 would not be changed, primarily because Japan considers tha t it already meets the international standards. **********The often-criticized nontariff barriers are viewed by the United States and the European Economic Community as evidence that Japan is a closed market, resistant to imports, yet exporting aggressively at the expense of industrial production and employment in other nations. **********Although Japan has reduced its tariffs, it has maintained a number of less visible impediments to imports, such as unusually strict health and safety standards and exhaustive te sting requirements for some products. **********The package of changes must be approved by the Cabinet on Saturday, but that is considered to be a formality.  The following are included in the list of promised changes: **********- Acceptance of animal test data generated abroad for medicine and cosmetics. **********- ''Simplification and rationalization'' of the documents that must be filed when declaring imports. **********- Acceptance of clinical data generated abroad for medicines and medical machines. **********- Expediting approval procedures for cosmetics. **********- Revision of standards for plywood imports. **********- Recognition of labeling in languages other than Japanese for household goods. **********- Relaxation of safety standards for electrical appliances. **********- Acceptance of foreign test data on automobiles, **********- Translation into English of the laws and regulations concerning import approval requirements for automobiles. **********- Issuance of certificates by domestic sports organizations on eligible foreign-made sporting goods. **********- Classifying American-made sake using a grading system comparable to that used by Japanese sake brewers. Quick Action Pledged **********Most of the changes would be put into effect by ministerial directives, rather than by the time-consuming redrafting of statutes. Mr. Esaki also promised that the changes would be made quickly, some immediately and others within weeks. **********Foreign business executives charge that, regardless of high-level Government directives, lower-level customs bureaucrats, who have long been taught to impede imports, are unlikely to change their practices. **********In response to such complaints, Mr. Esaki pledged that ''we will follow up to see if the new procedures really were implemented.'' Foreign Reaction Guarded **********Reaction to the liberalization package by foreign officials was guardedly optimistic. William G. Barraclough, economic and commercial affairs counselor at the United States Embassy in Tokyo, termed the measures ''significant.'' But he added that it was not yet clear that the Government steps alone would solve the problems of access to the Japanese market. **********The labyrinthine distribution system in Japan, based on generations-old social relationships, is often cited as a nongovernmental barrier to foreign products. **********Responding to a question, Mr. Esaki pledged that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, through ''administrative guidance,'' would try to reduce the time required to bring a foreign car to market, and to insure that distributors make no more than ''normal profits.'' ---- U.S. Reaction Special to the New York Times **********WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 - Administration officials said today that they had not yet seen the details of the policy changes announced in Tokyo and would issue a formal reaction when the final package was conveyed to foreign governments. **********One top Reagan aide noted that the test would be whether there was a ''genuine opening'' of the Japanese market providing ''real opportunities which would lead to concrete improvements for American exporters.'' **********Lionel H.

But this year virtually every major brokerage house and investment banker is observing the practice, with bonuses that range from $400 to nearly 25 percent of an employee's annual salary, a spot-check showed. **********With daily trading volume frequently over 100 million shares since mid-August, the New York Stock Exchange said its members had earnings of $497 million in the third quarter, almost 10 times the $50 million they earned in the same period last year. **********As a result, there have been some sharp changes in previously austere bonus policies, the spot-check of more than a dozen firms showed. **********Dean Witter, for example, hadn't paid a bonus since 1978. But this month, the nation's second largest brokerage house is distributing Christmas checks that range up to $400 for its clerical workers and up to two weeks' pay for salaried employees who do not hold senior management positions. The firm, which informed its staff of the bonuses last Friday, said nearly 5,000 of its 12,000 employees will recieve the Christmas checks, with only senior executives and brokers on commission excluded from the bonuses. **********A Christmas bonus is ''the right thing to do this year,'' said Bob Anderson, Dean Witter's vice president for personnel, noting the brokerage fees that have been generated by the explosive trading volume. But there is ''certainly no assurance'' the practice will be repeated, he added. Dean Witter was acquired by Sears, Roebuck & Company last year. Brokers Are Excluded **********Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage house, paid bonuses yesterday to 18,500 of its 35,000 employees yesterday, with top salaried executives and brokers on commissions excluded. Those receiving the holiday checks, including secretaries, assistants and other salaried, nonmanagement workers, received an extra two weeks' pay if they had been with the firm all year. Smaller amounts, ranging down to $100, were paid to employees who joined the firm in 1982. **********Merrill Lynch also did not pay Christmas bonuses last year, when a weak market kept down earnings from stock brokerage, but it did pay the bonuses in 1980. **********Traditionally, some of the largest Christmas bonuses in the securities industry have gone to the employees of investment banking firms. John C. Whitehead, the senior partner of Goldman, Sachs & Company, said 2,000 of his firm's 3,000 employees would receive checks this year equaling 24 percent of their annual pay. The percentage is the largest ever paid by the company as a Christmas bonus. **********''We think bonuses are a useful tool that create teamwork,'' Mr.  Whitehead said. No Larger at Big Board **********At the stock exchanges themselves, there will be Christmas bonuses as usual this year, but the checks will be no larger than last year's at the New York Stock Exchange and less than last year's at the American Stock Exchange. **********The New York exchange said it would pay 1,700 of its 1,753 employees bonuses equal to 7.5 percent of annual salary. The Big Board has had the same Christmas bonus policy for more than five years.The American exchange said it would pay bonuses equal to 12.5 percent of annual pay, down from 15 percent last year and 14 percent in 1980. **********Like Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter, Prudential-Bache, another major brokerage, is reinstituting bonuses this year after suspending the practise in 1981. The company said its 3,600 clerical and administrative employees will receive between one and two weeks' additional pay, depending on length of employment. Based on Performance **********Salomon Brothers, the investment banking firm, paid a bonus to its employees on Sept. 30, the end of its fiscal year. The company said the amount of each bonus was based on an employee's individual performance. Mel Adams, a Salomon spokesman, declined to say how large the bonus checks were, although he said they were ''very generous.'' **********Morgan Stanley and Company, the big investment house, said it would pay a bonus to its employees this year, as it has in the past, but it declined to say how much. **********Prescott, Ball & Turben, a brokerage house, said its bonus schedule this year provides that salaried workers with two or more years of service receive about six weeks' bonus pay. Those with six to seven years' service in management positions will receive about 10 to 12 weeks' extra pay, the company said. **********Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, the investment banking firm, said this year's bonuses were paid to salaried employees in September, the end of the company's fiscal year. The bonuses were described as setting a company record, but the company declined to disclose details. **********Drexel Burnham Lambert. another brokerage house, said that employees with one or two years' service would get four weeks' additional salary, while those with 10 years' service would receive a bonus of 12 to 13 weeks. Oppenheimer Plans Payment **********Oppenheimer & Company, another investment banking house, does not pay bonuses at Christmas time, but a spokesman said they would be distributed at the end of January. The amounts, he said, have not been determined. **********The First Boston Corporation was expected to announce today that it would pay a Christmas bonus to its employees.

Prayers were then said for the success of the current Iranian offensive against Iran. **********Syria Advised Against Invasion **********The decision to allow the demonstration suggested that Syria was showing where its sympathies lie. But the protest march apparently caused some embarrassment here, since the Government of President Hafez al-Assad is said to have advised Iranian leaders against striking into the Iraq, ''a brother Arab country.'' **********At the same time, both Syria and Iran share a common goal - the ouster of Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein. Syria denounced Iraq for its invasion of Iran from the start of the war in September 1980, incurring disfavor among other Arab countries. Damascus is also said to have shipped considerable amounts of artillery and antiaircraft weapons to the Iranians. **********On the surface, Syrian-Iranian relations are close and friendly.  There have been recent visits to Damascus by Iran's Foreign Minister and Defense Minister, who held talks with President Assad over the crisis in Lebanon. **********Last month, at least two contingents of Iranian Revolutionary Guards arrived in Damascus to fight alongside Syrian and Palestinian forces in Lebanon. It is not publicly known how many Iranians actually got to the fighting lines, but the Israeli press reported that several hundred had infiltrated into west Beirut. Invasion Not Mentioned in Press **********The Government-controlled Syrian newspapers and broadcasting services have not mentioned the Iranian push into Iraq this week.  Sources close to the Syrian Government said the official reluctance to speak out was linked to the Lebanese situation. They said that if Syria denounced the attack on Iraq, it would anger Iran, which has given Damascus open support in Lebanon. But if Syria speaks out in favor of Iran, they said, it would win even greater hostility from other Arab nations at a time when Damascus feels a unified Arab stand is needed on the conflict in Lebanon. **********Syrian officials refuse to speculate even privately on the repercussions of an Iranian victory over Iraq. Those who do address the problem quickly point out that, unlike the situation in Iraq, which has a large Shiite Moslem population sympathetic to Ayatollah Khomeini, only 2 or 3 percent of Syria's nine million inhabitants are Shiites. **********These officials also say that the Moslem Brotherhood, the religious opposition to the Syrian regime, is composed of Sunni Arabs and has little in common with the Islamic fundamentalists in Iran.

Egypt has a ''good'' Arab voting record at the United Nations, having sided with the Arabs on all mayor issues such as the annexation of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights and Israeli policy on the West Bank. **********Egypt sees the nonaligned movement as one of the best forums to better explain its position, and Mr. Mubarak is almost certain to attend the conference in Baghdad if it is held. **********In several interviews with Arab newspapers during recent weeks he has said that he sees no conflict between Egypt's ''special relationship'' with the United States and its membership in the nonaligned world.

Egypt Strongly Pro-Iraq **********Egypt's position on the Iran-Iraq war is not far from that of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf nations. Egyptian statements have been strongly pro-Iraq. Last year, under President Anwar el-Sadat, two major arms and ammunition shipments were sent to Iraq. Egyptian workers in Iraq have been hired by the Iraqi Army to serve with good pay in noncombatant functions. **********Egypt, like Saudi Arabia, would like to see the war brought quickly to an end without humiliation for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.  Egypt, though further removed geographically, shares Saudi fears of Iranian military supremacy in the Gulf. More than Saudi Arabia, Egypt is vitally interested in preventing a cancellation of the Baghdad conference because of the war. **********Like Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf countries, Egypt sees Mr.  Hussein as a pragmatic leader with whom it would eventually be able to deal and who would counteract the hard-liners like Col.

Instead, he announced that he was appointing a consultative assembly to advise him on the best time to call elections. **********President Zia, speaking in an interview at his home in Rawalpindi, said he now believes that conditions are evolving to the point where the poll will be held ''not in too near a future,'' but ''not in too distant a future,'' either. **********''It's very difficult to give a time frame,'' he said, but he added that ''within two to three years we should be able to hold a general election.'' **********General Zia is scheduled to make a good-will visit to the United States for about a week, beginning Dec. 6, at President Reagan's invitation.

But General Zia said that as far as Pakistan was concerned, no political solution was possible unless all Soviet troops were withdrawn and Afghanistan regained its ''nonaligned status.'' **********He said also that while he hoped that the nearly three million Afghan refugees now living in Pakistan would eventually be able to return to their country, it would not be ''too difficult for Pakistan's 84 million people to absorb three million people'' if ''worse comes to worst'' and the refugees must stay. **********And the Pakistani leader, who came to power in a bloodless coup more than five and a half years ago, said that his meeting with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in New Delhi earlier this month ''has certainly allowed us to be a little more optimistic'' about the prospects for ''a peaceful, irritant-free relationship'' with India, a neighbor with which it has fought three wars in 35 years. Agreed to Set Up Commission **********General Zia and Mrs. Gandhi met in New Delhi only briefly, while the general was on his way to visit a number of East Asian countries. They agreed to the early establishment of a commission to work out differences between the two countries. General Zia said at the time that the talks ''couldn't be better,'' that ''we had a heart-toheart exchange'' and that the exchange had ''paved the way for a better relationship.'' **********In elaborating on the meeting during the interview here, he was somewhat more restrained. He said he and Mrs. Gandhi had decided to build ''on the areas of agreement'' rather than dwell on areas of disagreement. **********''Otherwise,'' he said, ''you'll never get anywhere.'' He said some ''very thorny problems'' remained, including the unsettled territorial status of Kashmir. **********But he said Pakistan was determined to ''open up a new chapter'' in relations with India, and he hoped India would reciprocate warmly.  Asked whether he thought Mrs. Gandhi had also seemed to want such a new turning, he said, ''From our meeting I felt that she's responsive.'' **********In addressing the question of free elections, General Zia noted that the democratic tradition had never become firmly established in Pakistan. As the result of the second of the two national elections that Pakistan has held, in 1977, he said, the ''country was on the brink of civil war and we had to intervene in order to save it.'' 'No Ethics' in Pakistani Politics **********In Pakistani politics, he said, there has been no stability. ''The political parties have no political acumen as such,'' he said.  ''There is no ethics in politics in Pakistan. Pakistani politics means violence, Pakistani politics means character assassination and Pakistani politics means get hold of power and then use it best to your advantage. **********''Before I hold an election,'' he continued, ''I should be able to foresee some positive results of the election.'' He said that by ''positive results,'' he did not mean that ''people whose faces I like'' should be elected to national office, or that he or his party should be elected. **********''I have no party,'' he said. ''What I mean is that after the election, there should be a strong and stable government that has been returned to office by the people; not by coercion, not by enforcement and not by any underhanded means.'' **********General Zia, who has been trying to order Pakistani society according to Islamic principles, said that one of the Islamic principles of government is ''that you should select amongst yourself the best that you have,'' and that the best leaders should live according to Islamic values. **********Holding an election, he said, is a means of achieving an end, ''not an end by itself.'' ---- Opposition Politicians Arrested **********KARACHI, Pakistan, Nov. 28 (Reuters) -

Soviet military doctrine emphasizes tight control of forward units by higher echelons of command and discourages small unit initiative. **********With the addition of political meddling by Baath Socialist Party officials, an American official said, ''tactical commanders were either not authorized to make quick decisions or, if authorized, were, in fact, reluctant to do so because of fear of subsequent punishment.'' **********Fearing accusations of cowardice, some Iraqi field commanders refused to move when under attack until it was too late to avoid capture, destruction or disorder, according to analysts. **********''They had ample firepower and manpower to prevent being overrun by Revolutionary Guards shouting Islamic slogans and charging them in a disorderly way,'' said a non-American expert. ''But in the crunch they clearly did not know how to employ those assets.'' A War of 'Amateur Armies' **********Several sources said they agreed in general with a remark in Mr.  Cordesman's article that ''both sides have shown that they are still amateur armies.'' **********Such analysis is not meant to slight the zeal of either side, but it helps to explain how Iran's strange new military organization, described as ''lashed up'' by one analyst, could prevail on a modern battlefield. **********The analysts said both sides fired many artillery shells but did not seem to have the communications, training or sophistication to apply artillery fire accurately to key targets. Tanks were used in large numbers, the sources said, but tank gunnery was very inaccurate. The use of fighter-bombers in close air support was unimpressive, one official said, although Mr. Corsesman wrote that armed helicopters were quite effective for both sides. **********The inability of Iraq to get the most out of its modern weapons permitted Iran's unorthodox mixture of militia zealots and professional soldiers to survive in what might have been a disastrous military environment. **********''In recent weeks the mullahs and the Revolutionary Guards in Iran showed they were willing to charge as assault infantry, and the Iranian armor and mechanized forces were happy to follow them,'' said one specialist. ''You can't exactly say that the professionals are commanding them. They are more or less pointing them in the right direction. But it has been working.'' **********Although some authorities are dubious, at least one Middle East analyst believes that the large number of Shiite enlisted men in the Iraqi Army were emotionally demoralized by the assaults from Iranian Shiites. The analyst said Shiites on both sides held ''a common belief in exactly the same slogans and that God decides battles.'' **********An American official said Iraqi commanders were apparently aware of possible demoralization. ''There is enough in the theory that, until they were needed, infantry units with high proportions of Shiites were deployed against Kurds and not against Iranians,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/05/business/noranda-outlook.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 78, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Noranda Outlook", "print_headline": "Noranda Outlook", "body_text": " **********Noranda Mines issued a pessimistic projection for 1982 1982 in its annual report. **********Noranda said its mine production of copper concentrate in 1981 was 250,000 tons, about 10 percent more than the previous year.

Ryan after a long and stormy hearing in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. ''This is not a precedent,'' he warned, saying he reserved the right to reverse the decision later. **********The judge acted after lawyers for a host of other creditors argued, in effect, that if the Authority was to receive funds from Lombard-Wall or Lombard-Wall Money Markets Inc., a subsidiary that also filed for bankruptcy, then they should, too. **********Bills Coming Due **********The Authority, which raises money for a number of colleges, hospitals and other institutions and invests idle money for some of them, had sought the cash to meet bills that were coming due. The money, the first dispensed by Lombard-Wall since it filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of Federal bankruptcy laws, was paid in the form of Treasury coupons that the Authority can cash. **********The Dormitory Authority, Lombard-Wall's largest unsecured creditor, has $250 million in secured debt and $52 million in unsecured debt with the little-known Government securities dealer. Lombard-Wall, in its trading activities, typically borrowed money for a fee from a party such as the Dormitory Authority and put up Government securities as collateral with the promise to buy them back at an amount slightly higher than the loan at a specified time. **********The aim of such an arrangement, called a repurchase agreement, is to provide the borrowing firm with money that it tries to invest at a higher return. Holding Off Creditors **********Saying that its assets must not be sold, Lombard-Wall has insisted that its creditors not be allowed to sell collateral they are holding; however, the Dormitory Authority said that it desperately needed the money and both sides brought an agreement to Judge Ryan for his approval yesterday afternoon. **********The judge at first had reservations, as did some of the 75 lawyers representing Lombard-Wall's creditors who packed the courtroom.  ''I am just apprehensive that anyone is going to get a leg up here by acting over-expeditiously,'' he said. **********But Henry Goodman, the attorney representing the Dormitory Authority, said it would be ''titanic and cataclysmic'' if the Dormitory Authority did not get the money. **********''It is cash needs, your honor, cash needs to meet contractor bills,'' Mr. Goodman told Judge Ryan.  ''Many of the other people here, too, would like immediately to have their affairs straightened out,'' the Judge responded. Firm's Chief Testifies **********The judge finally agreed to the order after Harold W. Kurtz, Lombard-Wall's president and chief executive, was brought into court to give sworn testimony that no one else had a claim on the securities. **********Nervously facing the room of lawyers, Mr. Kurtz said that his firm had paid cash for the coupons from United States Treasury securities that it proposed to turn over to the Dormitory Authority. According to Mr. Kurtz, his firm paid between $34 million and $35 million for the coupons and they now have a market value of $38.5 million. **********A repeat of the same scene is possible at another hearing scheduled for 11:30 A.M. today.

It provides for cuts in allocations for education and many other services but, in response to American urging, would increase military spending. **********The proposed budget, amounting to $216.2 billion, would include $11.8 billion for the military, an increase of 6.5 percent. A senior official of the Japanese Defense Agency, Hirokazu Arai, said he felt the projected outlay was at the level of ''the minimum of resources'' needed to reach the goals of the military program for 1983-87, ''to purchase all the equipment we need within that period.'' **********(In Washington, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger said Japan had made a ''reasonably significant effort,'' but added that it had not gone far enough toward matching its self-defense goals, United Press International reported. His criticism reflected the fact that the $11.8 billion projected for military spending would amount to less than 1 percent of Japan's gross national product.) **********The overall $216.2 billion budget for fiscal 1983, the first to be presented since Yasuhiro Nakasone became Prime Minister in November, was described as the most austere since 1955. It represents an increase of 1.4 percent over the 1982 budget and it reflects slumping tax revenues. Revenues for the 1983 fiscal year were expected to total $138.7 billion, as against $157.2 billion in 1982. The reason, officials said, is a lower than expected economic growth, now put at 3.4 percent for fiscal 1983. **********The budget proposal calls for a pay freeze for millions of Government officials, the 230,000 members of the defense forces, railwaymen and other public employees. However, there are plans for pay increases of 4.5 percent to be granted through a supplementary budget in the fall, retroactive to April 1. It is calculated that such pay increases would make the rise in defense spending 8.6 percent instead of the 6.5 percent mentioned in the budget proposal. 'Everybody Is Dissatisfied' **********Other austerity measures include reduced subsidies to agriculture, which is normally sacrosanct for political reasons. A Finance Ministry spokesman said at a briefing on the budget that ''everybody is dissatisfied.'' **********In January, the proposal is due to go to Parliament, where the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has a large majority. It is expected to be adopted in virtually its present form by spring. **********Prime Minister Nakasone went on television to appeal for public understanding of the budget. He compared the higher allocations to military spending to an insurance premium paid by a householder on what he described as ''a larger home,'' meaning, he said, that Japan has a bigger role to play in the world. **********''Our fiscal condition is very severe,'' said Shigeyoshi Genjida, an official at the Defense Agency.  ''These fiscal conditions forced our Government to make a real zero-sum budget,'' he said. ''This is reflected in a decrease on education, food control and local government. By accumulating these minuses, the defense budget was increased.'' **********The official said at a briefing that allocations for education and science were cut by nine-tenths of 1 percent, subsidies to farmers through food control accounts by 7.8 percent and payments to local government by 12.3 percent. Allocations for pensions were slightly cut and those for public works were to be held to the 1982 level. **********Mr. Arai, another Defense Agency official, said that the budget featured ''a marked shift of priority to defense.'' He added, ''This was a very bold step on the part of the Japanese Government, when other domestic programs were very sharply cut down.'' Down Payments of $100 Million **********Officials said that one illustration of Japan's seriousness over increasing military spending was the provision for ''future obligations'' in the military budget. These consist of down payments on American aircraft such as the F-15 fighter and the P-3C antisubmarine plane to be paid for over the next five years. **********The budget for 1983 provides for down payments on F-15's and P-3C's of just under $100 million, while the eventual cost of new military planes of this type will be over $1.4 billion, officials said. **********Some Japanese experts said the budget was too deflationary.  ''From an international viewpoint Japan is being asked to open its market and stimulate domestic demand,'' said Isamu Miyazaki, President of the Daiwa Research Institute and a former chief Government economic planner. ''It's very deflationary,'' he said.  ''Defense spending is not productive compared with public spending.'' **********Japan's fiscally conservative business community believes that the budget is, if anything, not taut enough.  ''This will mean a further continuation of a sizable deficit and that is a problem,'' said Masaya Miyoshi, an official at the Federation of Economic Organizations, the top businessmen's club."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/10/world/israeli-border-areas-shelled-after-raid-on-palestinians.html": {"writer_name": "David Shipler", "pub_date": "1982-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 534, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAELI BORDER AREAS SHELLED AFTER RAID ON PALESTINIANS", "print_headline": "ISRAELI BORDER AREAS SHELLED AFTER RAID ON PALESTINIANS", "body_text": " **********Some 100 rockets and artillery shells were fired into northern Israel today after Israeli air strikes against Palestinian bases, sending residents in the area running to their air raid shelters. **********There were no Israeli casualties reported. But the shelling, the first such attacks on Israeli territory since the cross-border ceasefire went into effect last July, appeared to hold the potential of provoking Israel into the extensive ground operation in southern Lebanon that has been under consideration during the last few months. **********Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, reportedly a strong advocate of a major assault to obliterate bases of the Palestine Liberation Organization across the border, has been restrained so far by Prime Minister Menachem Begin, for domestic and international political reasons. It is considered unlikely, however, that Mr. Begin will accept shelling attacks from Palestinians in southern Lebanon on northern Israeli towns and kibbutzim without a vigorous response. 4 Incidents Cited **********A military spokesman cited four incidents to justify today's air attacks: the planting of a mine, which wounded an Israeli soldier on patrol in south Lebanon; the planting of several antivehicle mines just inside Israeli territory near the Lebanese border two days ago; the laying of an explosive charge near a school in Ashkelon, south of Tel Aviv, and an incident this morning in which a bomb exploded in the back of a Jerusalem bus, injuring a woman and two children. **********The Israeli television broadcast a long film tonight on the bus attack, showing an eight-year-old girl in shock after being hit in the leg with shrapnel. All three were treated at a hospital and released. **********A military spokesman said that the air attacks were ordered by the Government ''after terrorist organizations had, during the past days, repeatedly and severely violated the cease-fire agreement.'' Syrians Did Not Attack **********A military communique identified the three targets in Lebanon as Mazraat al Wasitah, an operational base of the P.L.O.'s main arm, Al Fatah, containing bunkers, buildings and ammunition dumps three miles south of the Zahrani River estuary; Dahr Aqlin, a training base three miles south of Damur, and a gun position on the outskirts of Sidon, where two 100 millimeter artillery pieces, with a range of 14 miles, were located. The guns were out of range of the Israeli border. **********Although Israeli planes drew antiaircraft fire and Syrian MIG fighters were reported to have flown nearby, the Syrian pilots did not attack and all Israeli planes returned safely, according to the spokesman. **********After the attacks, the military issued a background paper asserting that ''Israel has demonstrated exceptional self-restraint in the wake of extensive P.L.O. cease-fire violations.'' Since July 24, the paper said, ''the terrorists perpetrated 130 attacks within Israeli territory, along Israel's borders, in Judea-Samaria and abroad.'' **********The last Israeli air attack took place April 21 in reaction to the killing of an Israeli soldier in southern Lebanon when his vehicle hit a mine. At the time, Israeli military commanders called it a warning action that would not be pursued if the P.L.O. returned to the cease-fire. No such pledges on the cease-fire were made today, however."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/05/business/united-canso-oil-gas-ltd-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNITED CANSO OIL & GAS LTD reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "UNITED CANSO OIL & GAS LTD reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/07/business/brazil-oil-purchases.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brazil Oil Purchases", "print_headline": "Brazil Oil Purchases", "body_text": " **********Brazil's state oil company, Petrobras, will double, to 100,000 barrels a day, its purchases of crude oil from the Saudi state oil concern, Petromin, the Petrobras president, Shigeaki Ueki, said. **********The increase will take effect Jan. 1.

It is the kind of quiet that makes for empty cash registers, bored salesmen and nervous shop owners. **********Depending on where their stores are situated, owners lost 30 percent to 70 percent of their customers when Mexico's President, Jose Lopez Portillo, imposed strict currency and import controls on Sept. 1. **********Businessmen here are dazed from the loss, and figure they can do little beyond cutting staff and hoping for a recovery in the Mexican economy that will bring back their customers from Juarez, just across the border. **********''Until now, this has been an international city,'' said Albert Schwartz, vice president of the Popular, a department store with three locations in town. ''It's tough.'' **********El Paso businessmen have always considered their proximity to the border an advantage because it expanded their own market of 500,000 people to 1.3 million. How the Cultures Mix **********South El Paso, the commercial neighborhood closest to the border, is almost an extension of Juarez. The Woolworth five and dime is a cinco y diez, the furniture store is a muebleria, and many of the sales clerks speak better Spanish than English. **********Even stores like J.C. Penney and Sears, which depend more on their American customers, have accepted pesos as eagerly as dollars.  ''For eight years we have taken pesos and it is hard for us to imagine not accepting them,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''But if it seems to be a hopeless cause, then we will have to stop.'' **********At present, most of the stores, including Popular, Sears and Penney's, are trying to keep some Mexican clients and clear charge accounts by accepting pesos and reselling them to banks or private exchange companies. However, many are concerned that there will be such a large buildup of pesos on the American side of the border that they will have to stop. **********Only three banks in this city and a couple of private exchange companies are still accepting pesos, but the rates change daily.  Although the Mexican Government set the official rate at 70 pesos to the dollar, compared with 48 in February and 26 in January, the rate at the El Paso banks has ranged from 85 pesos to more than 100 pesos per dollar recently. **********The banks and exchange companies sell the pesos to tourists or residents who make purchases in Juarez and can get a better exchange rate in the United States. **********''We try to balance our accounts and not take in more pesos than we can sell, but yesterday we weren't selling dollars because we had an oversupply of pesos and it gets harder all the time to keep the account balanced,'' Donald C. Shuffstall, assistant vice president of the State National Bank, said one day earlier this month. ''We have to find a new market for pesos or we can't accept them.'' **********Since the banks and private exchange companies use different rates, stores find themselves competing not only on the price of cereal and milk but also on their exchange rates. Makeshift signs with 80 pesos, 90 pesos or 100 pesos are placed on storefronts all over El Paso. **********''I can resell my pesos for 90 to the dollar but the store next to me can resell his for 80 pesos to the dollar, so I had to drop my rate and I'm losing money,'' said the manager of one store in South El Paso. **********Businessmen here are closely following each proclamation from Mexico City to determine what it means for them. The day after the Mexican Government issued a 54-page report on the import restrictions earlier this month, businessmen packed a meeting hall at the Chamber of Commerce and tried to find leniency in the guidelines. There was not much to be found. **********Jeffrey Brannon, an economist from the University of Texas at El Paso, told the audience flatly: ''We all need to reorient ourselves.  Juarez will have to get basic supplies from Mexico, and El Paso will have to reorient their markets to other parts of Texas and New Mexico.'' **********''The whole thing hit us right between the eyes,'' said Sam Sayklay, the manager of Economy Cash and Carry, a grocery distributor that sells to companies that export to Mexico. ''We can't work with the peso rate changing every day.'' **********Jesus Gallardo, manager of the Woolworth's store, sat at the soda fountain and looked at his sales figures. ''What sales?'' he responded, when asked about the numbers.

Report of Guerrilla Attack **********The interview, which was given at the front's sprawling complex of offices on Roosevelt Avenue here, came three days after the guerrillas reported a new attack by rebel forces guerrillas against Moroccan troops in southern Morocco. **********The guerrillas have contended that they killed more than 50 Moroccan soldiers in a number of locations in the area, but the Moroccan army has denied any such attack. **********Mr. Abdel-Fattah spoke as several African leaders were shuttling from capital to capital this week in search of ways to heal a major split within the Organization of African Unity, which admitted the Polisario Front as the organization's 51st member in February. **********Morocco and at least 19 other African countries have said they will boycott meetings of the organization where the front is seated, while supporters of the rebels, such as Algeria, have declared that their participation in O.A.U. meetings would be contingent on the seating of the guerrillas. New Attitude on O.A.U. Formula **********Mr. Abdel-Fattah left the impression during the interview that the front now viewed previous O.A.U. proposals -which have been accepted by Morocco in principle - for a cease-fire and a referendum to settle the seven-year-old war as inadequate. **********''The only way to end this war is through direct negotiations between the Polisario and Morocco,'' Mr. Abdel-Fattah, a slim, intense man who spoke in English and Arabic, said. ''There is no other way. We are ready to negotiate with Morocco any time. If there are no negotiations, there will be no cease-fire - and the war will continue. We want peace, and a just solution - but Morocco must talk directly with us.'' **********King Hassan has consistently refused such direct negotiations. He has said that the Western Sahara dispute will ultimately be resolved chiefly through talks between Morocco and the front's main supporter, Algeria. **********Mr. Abdel-Fattah scoffed at the King's position. ''If he wants to talk only with Algeria because they support us, does that mean we then should talk only with the United States because they finance and arm Morocco?'' he said, derisively. U.S. Promises of More Aid **********The Reagan Administration, Mr. Abdel-Fattah said, was unnecessarily inflaming the situation by its recent promises of more military and economic assistance to Morocco. **********''The danger of an internationalization of the conflict is daily increasing -and the United States has to accept a big responsibility in this,'' he added. ''The Moroccans don't need weapons, they need food. If Mr. Reagan is really concerned for King Hassan's crown, the best pressure he can apply is to get Hassan to stop the war, not continue it. But we say this quite clearly: the more weapons they give to Morocco, the more weapons we will need and the more we will seek those weapons from all those who will give them to us.'' **********''We have to defend ourselves,'' Mr. Abdel-Fattah continued. ''We cannot sit back and let the Reagan Administration help Morocco in slowly strangling us. The United States's increasing support to Morocco has consequences not only for the people of the Western Sahara but also for the security, peace and stability of this entire area. **********''If the Reagan Administration continues this kind of support to Morocco, our response will be to ask all those who can help us for more weapons - it's logical. The Soviet Union? My reply is, why not?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/06/world/censorship-by-israelis-on-fighting-tightens.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Censorship by Israelis On Fighting Tightens", "print_headline": "Censorship by Israelis On Fighting Tightens", "body_text": " **********Israeli military censorship was extended today to accounts issued by the United Nations on the fighting in southern Lebanon. **********Foreign reporters were barred from transmitting parts of statements issued by Timur Goksel, spokesman of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Naqura, Lebanon. **********Mr. Goksel, who can be reached by telephone from Israel, has been providing reporters with neutral accounts of the military situation.

Czeslaw Kiszczak, who is the Interior Minister, said the activists behind the demonstrations were being stirred up by the West and were bent on a confrontation with the martial-law regime. **********His speech, the first he has delivered directly to the nation, was regarded as the sternest warning so far against political marches on Aug. 31, the second anniversary of the agreement at Gdansk that created the Solidarity trade union, now suspended. **********Solidarity leaders have called for a two-week campaign of leaflet distribution and other protest actions, culminating in demonstrations in an attempt to force the regime to release internees and revive the union. **********The appeal has noticeably heightened tensions after a comparatively peaceful summer. This week, with heavy police patrols, attacks in the press on the West and a barrage of publicity about trials and raids on underground printing establishments, the Government is trying to overwhelm the mood of protest. 'Prophets of Confrontation' **********''The prophets of confrontation should abandon their actions while there is still time, while the road still remains open for a return to normal public life,'' General Kiszczak said, sitting before the cameras in military uniform. He is an alternate member of the party's Politburo and a member of the military council that was set up when martial law was declared Dec. 13. **********''No one, at home or abroad, should cherish illusions that it will be possible to organize street spectacles in Polish towns with impunity for the benefit of foreign TV stations,'' he said. **********''No one will be allowed to trample on the interests of the state and nation. If there have not been enough lessons so far, the provocateurs will be taught more. The authorities and law enforcement bodies have effective forces and the means to guarantee calm and security. Public order shall be maintained.'' **********Those preparing the marches, he said, are ''hypocritical'' in calling them peaceful.  ''Why, then, are crowbars, clubs, gasoline bombs, sharpened rods for puncturing tires and other tools and implements being readied?'' he said, adding that the organizers were also laying plans for first-aid centers to aid any victims in clashes with the police. Opposition to Protests Seen **********The general said most Poles opposed demonstrations that threatened to prolong martial law. Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish leader, said in a speech last month that he hoped to lift martial law by the end of the year. **********General Kiszczak sounded the theme, which has dominated the Polish press, that ''subversive centers'' in the West, particularly in the United States, were trying to provoke trouble. He said demonstrations on Aug. 13 and 16 had been inspired by foreign broadcasts. **********Balancing the toughness of his warning somewhat, the general said the Government was still following a policy of socialist ''renewal,'' as reforms are called, and would follow a policy of dialogue wherever possible. **********''The authorities do not aim at increasing repression,'' he said.  ''We are looking for other methods.'' To this end, he said, discussions are being held in factories to counter propaganda from underground groups, and activists in hiding should feel free to give themselves up. **********''We are not passive in waiting for people to turn themselves in voluntarily,'' he said. ''We are extending our hand to those who do not have the courage to do it first.'' **********The impact of the speech was probably heightened by items on the news program before it. They included statements from a committee headed by Mieczyslaw Rakowski, a Deputy Prime Minister, that underground groups were being set back, and film clips of clandestine printing equipment that the police said was uncovered in Szczecin and elsewhere. The news also said persons arrested for organizing street marches earlier this month would be dealt with before military courts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/16/world/pope-bids-ilo-build-social-solidarity.html": {"writer_name": "Victor Lusinchi", "pub_date": "1982-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 743, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POPE BIDS I.L.O.

''He must not be prevented from exercising that responsibility, though also bearing in mind the good of the community.'' **********The Pope appeared tired from his recent journeys to Britain and Argentina as he spoke before the nearly 2,000 government, trade union and management delegates who jointly represent their countries at the 149-member I.L.O.

John Paul was greeted at the airport shortly before 9 A.M. by Fritz Honegger, the Swiss President. **********The Pope was not on an official visit to Switzerland, and he did not kneel and kiss the ground on arrival here, as he usually does on visits. **********Besides addressing the labor conference, John Paul visited the headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the complex of the 12-nation European Organization for Nuclear Research, which straddles Switzerland's frontier with France. **********The Pope had lunch with the local representatives of Roman Catholic agencies at St. Nicholas de Flue Church, as did Pope Paul VI in 1969 when he made a one-day visit to address the I.L.O. The organization was founded by the Versailles Treaty at the end of World War I to advance the cause of peace by promoting social justice for workers. Says a Public Mass **********John Paul's only contact with the local population was at the public mass he said in the large exposition hall adjoining the airport just before boarding his plane for the return flight to Rome. **********Francis Blanchard, I.L.O.'s director general, said in welcoming the Pope to the conference that John Paul knew the life of a worker because he had ''worked in a stone quarry and in a chemical factory as a manual laborer.'' **********The Pope spoke from the same podium from which Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader who is now interned, addressed last year's conference as a Polish worker delegate. This year the Warsaw Government did not include any workers in its delegation, although I.L.O. rules call for one. **********At the outset of his speech the Pope recalled that the wounds he suffered in the attempt on his life in Rome last year had prevented him from addressing the 1981 conference as he had planned. **********John Paul urged that attention be focused on unemployment, with its ''harsh consequences for the workers which are too often overlooked.'' He urged that particular attention be given to the question of jobs lost because of the introduction of labor-saving technology ''without waiting for it to force itself upon our attention by the harm it causes.'' Says Work Enhances Dignity **********The guiding principle in dealing with unemployment problems, he said, ''should be that human work is both a right and an obligation for everyone, not only reflecting but enhancing the dignity of the human person.'' **********At the Red Cross headquarters, the Pope said the humanitarian agency and the Holy See were studying ways of closer ''collaboration on their activities in favor of peace.'' **********Speaking of the Geneva Conventions on the protection of war victims, John Paul said he would like to see added to them international agreements outlawing ''inhuman treatment and in particular torture.'' **********To the physics researchers at the nuclear center, the Pope said the church wanted the ''dialogue between science and faith, despite past tensions, to enter an always more positive phase and to be intensified at all levels. **********''The love of truth, sought with humility, is one of the great values capable of uniting men of different cultures,'' he said.

Dyson, president of Coca-Cola USA, yesterday announced the introduction of diet Coke, which he described as ''the most significant new product introduction'' in the history of the company. **********Although Coca-Cola has used it in ads, this is the first time the country's No.1 soft-drink company has put the name Coke on a product. And although he admits to the possibility that the new product might cannibalize some of the market for its Tab, which is already the leading diet cola, Mr. Dyson feels that it will create new drinkers in the category - men. **********Women have been the major users until now, making up the larger part of that 36 percent of the population that drinks low-calorie sodas with some frequency. **********All diet drinks constitute 13.8 percent of total annual soft-drink sales of more than six billion cases, according to John C. Maxwell Jr. of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc. He gives Tab 3.6 percent of the total; Diet Pepsi, 2.9 percent; Royal Crown Cola's Diet Rite, 0.6 percent, and Pepsi Light, 0.5 percent. **********Tab, Mr. Dyson said, has been positioned as a diet drink. Diet Coke (and the company is not capitalizing the D) is being positioned as a good-tasting cola that incidentally is low-calorie. **********Of course, Coke's ostensibly big news is a switch from recent industry pronouncements from the second-string competitors, Seven-Up and Pepsi-Cola, both of which have come in with caffeine-free colas.  Pepsi's announcement came as recently as Wednesday. **********Asked about his own company's intentions in the no-caffeine arena, Mr. Dyson responded that when Coke believes the time is right it will be there with such a product. **********Might he use the name Tab, as rumor has it? That is certainly one of the company's options, he said.  Although diet Coke is being sweetened with saccharin, the company's president said he did not rule out switching to either the new aspartame or cyclamates. **********Part of the advertising news here is that the campaign is not being done by Coca-Cola's regular agency, McCann-Erickson, but is handled instead by SSC& B, another of the Interpublic Group of Companies that, if Coke had its way, would still be secretly doing TV advertising for its Mello Yello beverage while McDonald & Little, Atlanta, continued as the publicly acknowledged agency of record. **********In any event, there was no SSC& B diet Coke advertising ready for yesterday's meeting, but there were tapes of the jingle, and those rousing jingles certainly have become the heart of the soft-drink industry's emotional advertising pitch. The line is: ''Introducing diet Coke - Just for the taste of it.'' **********The packaging, red on white rather than the traditional vice versa, was created by the Schechter Group. And instead of regular testmarketing, the product was given in-home trials under normal living conditions. **********Further defying soft-drink tradition, diet Coke will be introduced first into the New York market, which constitutes some 10 percent of the national population and is considered atypical of United States markets generally. The drink will be in seven markets with 15 percent of the population by September and, if schedules are kept, it will be virtually in national distribution early next year.  Meanwhile, as the product moves from market to market, the effectiveness of various advertising spending levels will be tested. **********Another expected question was how much Coke would be spending for advertising in light of reports that both Seven-Up and Pepsi would be spewing out as much as $100 million each on their introductions. **********While avoiding any precise figure, Mr. Dyson did say ''around $50 million-plus, and that is a very strong level to spend - spending twice that would be looking to advertising to do something extraordinary that the product can't accomplish itself.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/16/business/delorean-puts-debt-at-40-million.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DeLorean Puts Debt at $40 Million", "print_headline": "DeLorean Puts Debt at $40 Million", "body_text": " **********The DeLorean Motor Company listed its debts at $40 million, but creditors put the figure at $76.2 million, in estimates disclosed at a hearing in Federal Bankruptcy Court here.

The order, issued by the national guard commander, Brig. Gen. Ruben Dario Paredes, said the papers were being closed to ''moralize'' the press and put an end to ''insults and verbal violence.'' **********But Roberto Eisenmann, the publisher of the main opposition paper, La Prensa, said: ''The suspension of all the press last week was simply to disguise the closure of La Prensa. Paredes threatened to close us and did.'' **********The fate of La Prensa in coming weeks will be an important indicator of Panama's likely political direction. The paper's survival will be evidence that, despite last week's shake-up, the country is continuing its gradual return to democracy, but its permanent closure - or the introduction of direct censorship - would badly bruise hope for free elections scheduled for 1984. Troops Raid Newspaper **********While other newspapers were simply informed of the suspension, heavily armed troops and policemen burst into La Prensa last Friday afternoon. Striking some secretaries with rubber hoses, they drove reporters and other employees out of the building. **********When soldiers finally withdrew from the daily Wednesday afternoon, editors found that corrosive acid had been poured into computers, electronic composers and even the printing presses. Drawers and cupboards had been forced open, files had been removed and some money had been stolen. Damage was estimated at about $150,000. **********Although much of the newspaper's equipment was made at least temporarily useless, editors and reporters worked throughout the day in the hope of producing a small eight-page issue Friday. **********''The important thing is that we come out with something,'' Mr.  Eisenmann said. ''Our readers need to know that we haven't been intimidated.'' Compensation Is Offered **********Significantly, President de la Espriella linked the credibility of his new civilian administraiton to the early re-opening of La Prensa, which he was eventually able to negotiate with the national guard.  And after La Prensa's installations were found to have been damaged, the Government offered to pay compensation to the newspaper. **********The foundation of La Prensa in August 1980 was itself evidence that, after dominating the country for 12 years, the national guard was willing to relax its control of news organizations and opposition parties. But the guard - and former President Royo - proved highly sensitive to criticism. **********La Prensa was conceived by a group of liberal businessmen and lawyers as an opposition organ, but ownership is shared by over 500 stockholders who represent a broad spectrum of democratic opinion and numerous different political parties. ''Our editorial line is simply to be democratic in an autocratic situation,'' Mr. Eisenmann said. **********In exposes, cartoons and a widely read satirical column, La Prensa constantly challenged the Royo Government and the national guard. And the daily's readers - its circulation stands at around 14,000 - frequently responded by providing reporters with secret information about corruption within the regime and the guard. Scandals Brought to Light **********Over the last two years, La Prensa has brought to light numerous scandals deeply embarrassing to the regime, including a major fraud in the Social Security Institute. It recently reported that the brother of a senior guard officer had, inexplicably, more than $4 million in his personal bank account and that bank officers were said to be involved in drug trafficking and arms smuggling. **********Officials frequently responded furiously. President Royo brought four criminal libel suits, one of which resulted in the daily's editor, Carlos Gonzalez de la Lastra, being sentenced to five months' imprisonment, a case still under appeal. Last fall, an armed band linked to the official Democratic Revolutionary Party entered the newspaper, firing shots and beating up employees. **********More recently, three newspapers owned by the Government began campaigns of personal insults against key figures of La Prensa, suggesting that Mr. Eisenmann was a contrabandist and that other editors were sexually depraved. After one report that linked the national guard to a trading company supposedly involved in dubious business practices, Mr. Eisenmann said, he was summoned by General Paredes and warned that the paper could be closed. **********When Panama's Supreme Court accepted La Prensa's request for an injunction ordering General Paredes to lift the suspension, however, the national guard chief said he had not issued the order but had merely ''suggested'' the closing to Mr. de la Espriella. As a result, the President was able Wednesday to order that La Prensa be returned to its owners. Paper Resume Publication **********Three other newspapers, La Estrella, the English-language Star and Ya, have resumed publication after accepting that censors be placed in their offices. On Wednesday, though, Justice Minister Justo Fidel Palacios said there would be no prior censorship and that the three Government-owned newspapers would be on the streets again Monday. **********''De la Espriella was very anxious not to start his Government with the stigma of censorship,'' a close friend of the President said.  ''Ironically, he needs a free press as much as the opposition if he's going to gather any power of his own.'' **********Today, General Paredes said he would send a commission to La Prensa to establish whether the damage to installations was ''selfsabotage.'' But if the national guard's responsibility is established, he said, it would pay compensation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/28/business/xerox-income-declines-23.3-recession-is-cited.html": {"writer_name": "Dylan Landis", "pub_date": "1982-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 451, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RECESSION IS CITED", "print_headline": "XEROX INCOME DECLINES 23.3%; RECESSION IS CITED", "body_text": " **********The Xerox Corporation yesterday reported a 23.3 percent drop in its first-quarter net income that it said was caused by the recession.  Earnings fell to $109.5 million, or $1.29 a share, from a restated $142.7 million, or $1.69 a share, in the comparable 1981 period, the copier and computer maker said. **********First-quarter revenues were virtually unchanged at $2.051 billion, compared with $2.046 billion in the period a year earlier.  The world's largest maker of copiers, citing the recession as a major pressure on earnings, said that it had reduced its work force by 1,300 people, to 119,700, since the beginning of the year, continuing cutbacks that began in mid-1981 and bringing the total number of layoffs since that time to 3,300. **********C. Peter McColough, chairman and chief executive, and David T.  Kearns, president and chief operating officer, attributed the depressed earnings to several factors. Equipment Sales Down **********In a statement, the two officers said that the worldwide economic slowdown had forced sales of copiers and duplicators down. Sales of equipment declined 11.5 percent, to $230 million, from $260 million, and the mix of placements was weighted toward the smaller, less expensive machines than in the comparable 1981 period, the company said. **********The decline in the value of the dollar abroad, compared with the first quarter in 1981, and ''a substantial cost base impact from worldwide inflation'' also hurt earnings, Xerox said. **********Eugene G. Glazer, vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said that he had expected Xerox's earnings to be down, ''but these were down more.'' **********''For the first time, the recession seems to be catching hold of Xerox,'' Mr. Glazer said. A major indication, he said, was that the number of copies made on all Xerox copiers grew by only 8 percent, down from a normal quarterly growth of 10 to 12 percent. 'Squeeze on Earnings' **********Another sign of the recession was the 12 percent decline in equipment sales, a first-time decline in that area for Xerox, Mr.  Glazer said.

Under President Giscard d'Estaing, France was usually represented by its Foreign Minister at formal alliance sessions. **********President Giscard d'Estaing's reticent attitude reflected the legacy of hostility to the alliance that he inherited from Gen.  Charles de Gaulle, who expelled its headquarters from France in 1966 and removed French forces from the joint military command. **********Luns Notes Change in Attitude **********Acknowledging that a change in French attitudes was under way, the alliance's secretary general, Joseph M.A.H. Luns, said at a news conference Wednesday that ''this President of France is more positive toward the alliance and more friendly to the U.S. than his predecessor ever was.'' **********''This is confirmed by what he is doing here,'' Mr. Luns went on.  ''And it confirms what we have felt about the new French Government from the beginning.'' **********Several earlier moves by President Mitterrand also suggested a change.Last month, he caught his allies by surprise when he invited the alliance foreign ministers to hold their annual spring meeting in Paris next year, for the first time since 1966. **********Another straw in the wind, diplomats noted, was the concern President Mitterrand showed over Western European defenses and his more hostile attitude toward the Soviet Union last year, when he supported plans to strengthen the nuclear forces of the alliance through the deploying new American missiles and criticized antinuclear protesters in West Germany and other countries. Giscard's Views Are Recalled **********This contrasted with what Prof. Dominique Moisi of France's Institute for International Affairs has characterized as ''the benign indifference'' exhibited by President Giscard d'Estaing toward the whole debate over nuclear defenses and the threat posed by the deployment of the Soviet Union's SS-20 missiles, which the new NATO missiles are supposed to counter. **********Various explanations are offered by Western diplomats and other students of French affairs for the shift in France's approach to the alliance under the Socialists and for its more belligerent attitude toward the Soviet Union. **********A political lifetime spent warring with the Communist Party is felt by many to have made Mr. Mitterrand mistrustful of the Communists.  And while his decision to bring Communists into the Government may have been a tactic designed to weaken the party, a stronger anti-Soviet stance in foreign policy helps make this more palatable to moderates at home. New Responsibilities Seen **********More important, in the view of Professor Moisi, is an awareness of ''France's new responsibilities'' forced on the Socialist leadership by the wave of pacifism in West Germany and other countries, doubts about the United States' military strength and resolve and the fact that military spending still commands universal support in France because of its military independence. **********But while France's political attitude toward the alliance and the Soviet Union may be shifting, Western experts remain uncertain just how far this change will be translated into new strategic doctrines, closer to those practiced by the rest of the alliance. **********Under President Giscard d'Estaing, France already seemed to have moved a long way from the classic Gaullist doctrine that most French forces must be kept back to defend France itself in case the rest of the alliance lost the ''forward battle'' for West Germany. If France's forces then failed to hold the Soviet armies at bay, France would threaten a strategic attack on Soviet cities, which it hoped would deter an invasion in the first place. Backing Up West Germany **********But despite a greater apparent willingness to commit French forces to a forward defense of the whole of Western Europe, Western analysts say the French Socialists are proving reluctant so far to make the concrete tactical changes necessary to give this shift of emphasis more credibility. **********France's conventional forces in West Germany remain huddled along the French frontier in the Black Forest with the headquarters at Baden-Baden. **********An even more important test of the Socialists' intentions, officials believe, is whether they will help deepen alliance defenses by allowing troops in West Germany to be resupplied from France in a war, even though this would involve France in the forward defense. **********United States military officials say that joint planning with the French is going better than it used to under President Giscard d'Estaing. But there is still no formal commitment by the Socialists to provide logistical support for a forward battle in West Germany."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/18/business/hershey-oil-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HERSHEY OIL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "HERSHEY OIL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/28/business/restaurant-associates-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RESTAURANT ASSOCIATES INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "RESTAURANT ASSOCIATES INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/15/business/sorg-printing-co-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-feb-28.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 44, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SORG PRINTING CO INC reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 28", "print_headline": "SORG PRINTING CO INC reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 28", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/10/business/clabir-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-july-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 79, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CLABIR CORP reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "print_headline": "CLABIR CORP reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/02/business/finance-briefs-261880.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 183, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** American Express Credit Corp.'s $100 million issue of 11 3/4 percent debentures due in 2012 was priced at 98 to yield 12 percent through Shearson/American Express Inc. *********** Banc One Corp. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $50 million of notes due in 1992 through Merrill Lynch White Weld Capital Markets Group. *********** Citicorp said the average rate at the weekly auction of $150 million of its 91-day paper fell to 9.073 percent from 9.482 percent last week. *********** Citizens and Southern Georgia Corp. filed a shelf registration with the S.E.C. for $50 million in debt securities. *********** Dresser Industries' $100 million issue of 11 3/4 percent debentures due in 2007 was priced at 99.60 to yield 11.80 percent through First Boston Corp. *********** The Federal National Mortgage Association said it had sold $400 million in guaranteed mortgage-backed securities - $200 million at 12 1/2 percent, priced at 98.875 percent of par to yield 12.55 percent, and $200 million at 8 1/2 percent, priced at 70.00 percent of par to yield 12.23 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/11/business/us-steel-debt-payment-set.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Steel Debt Payment Set", "print_headline": "U.S. Steel Debt Payment Set", "body_text": " **********The United States Steel Corporation said it will attempt to pay back the $3 billion it borrowed to acquire the Marathon Oil Company within two years, partly by selling approximately $1 billion in assets this year and next. **********In a proxy statement mailed to Marathon shareholders this week, the nation's largest steelmaker said it has enough money readily available for spending to meet its debt obligations now and in the future. **********Some Wall Street analysts questioned the wisdom of the merger with Marathon, saying the $6.2 billion transaction could cause the combined companies cash-flow problems.

Confronted with a competitive onslaught based in part on advancing technology in Japan and, to a lesser extent, Western Europe, they are plunging resources into research and development. **********Consultants and academics are flooding business journals with reports on the strategic implications of technology and how to manage it. Still, although France, West Germany and Japan have joined the United States to make up what John Harris, president of the Technology Management Group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton, a consulting group, calls technology's ''big four,'' technology experts agree that over all, the United States has never lost the position it assumed during the 1940's as the world's leader in new technology. **********''Our stability, because of our size, is an advantage which is hard to beat,'' said Richard Foster, a principal at the consulting firm of McKinsey & Company. **********The United States' lead is clear in the fields of technology innovation generally considered crucial to its economic future, including biotechnology, most basic segments of electronics and sophisticated manufacturing processes. **********But some businessmen believe that the challenge is mounting rapidly. The Japanese have claimed technological supremacy in areas as varied as electronic memory devices, design and steelmaking. And Western Europeans have maintained their strength in traditional areas like chemicals and transport equipment, while achieving dominance in such less visible sectors as poultry processing equipment. **********Still, there is no widely accepted measure of technological strength, and first impressions can be deceiving. Japanese automobile technology, for instance, is not notably advanced. Thus, when Detroit shops abroad for new systems, as it is doing for fuelinjection devices for diesel engines, it is more likely to turn to such companies as Robert Bosch of West Germany or Lucas Industries of Britain than to Japan. **********Japan has pushed the application of new manufacturing technology, especially robotics and computer-driven industrial operations, further than its competitors. As a result, it has an advantage in terms of productivity and quality in the output of new cars, steel and a variety of consumer products. **********''They are certainly not ahead in technology in the sense of breakthroughs,'' James C. Abegglen, vice president of the Boston Consulting Group in the company's Tokyo office, commented recently.  ''They simply have the capacity to apply existing technology more quickly.'' **********Japan is well aware that its expertise in applying new technology would be far more formidable if it were more innovative. Spurred by the Japanese Government, Japanese industrialists are increasing efforts to innovate rather than license technology first developed abroad in such areas as electronics and biotechnology. **********''It would be wrong to make the Japanese out to be a powerhouse that will run us over,'' said Mr. Foster of McKinsey. ''They have to be selective.'' **********The Japanese impact in Western Europe has been strong in recent years precisely because of their selectivity, according to Ulrich Steger, the West German Social Democrat who is head of his party's committee in Parliament on economic and technological affairs. ''They are destroying complete branches of our industry not just bec ause of technology, but because of their carefully pl anned export strategy,''he said. **********The European reservoir of technological strength can be described as a patchwork quilt affected by historic strengths and Government policies. But European strength is evident in a number of areas, as is continued interest in new techn ology, according to Michael de Verteuil, man ager for research projects at the European Management Forum, of Gen eva, Switzerland. For instance, he said, in a recent study conduct ed by his organization, the United States was followed by Switzerlan d, West Germany, Britain and the Netherlands in researchand developme nt expenditures as a percentage of gross production for domestic cons umption. Japan was tied for sixth place with Sweden. **********Among European nations, West Germany is generally recognized for its strength in chemical technologies. Home of Bayer, BASF and Hoescht, three of the world's largest chemical companies, it has a long tradition of close cooperation between the industry and university researchers. It is also known for advances in heavy equipment design. **********France's first technological love has been vehicles. The nation has displayed an innovative if not always profitable interest in everything from technically sophisticated automobiles to supersonic aircraft. More recently, it has developed a state-of-the-art, highspeed train and spearheaded the success of Airbus Industrie, Europe's multinational answer to the American commercial aircraft industry. France has also teamed with West Germany to organize European nations behind a substantial space program. **********Britain remains a discouraging technological puzzle. Home of some the world's most respected research, it regularly innovates without engineering competitive products. The British, for example, invented the CAT scanner, a diagnostic device that allows doctors to avoid exploratory surgery in many cases by taking what amounts to a threedimensional X-ray, but American companies have taken over manufacturing and selling it. Similarly, British researchers discovered how to produce large quantities of pure antibodies by fusing antibody-producing cells to mouse tumor cells - a biotechnological breakthrough - but it was Americans who recognized the commercial value of the ''monoclonal antibody'' process and patented it. **********Experts note that national needs are relevant in measuring technological strength. Poor, developing nations may follow China, with its millions of small systems to convert animal and plant waste to fuel, in energy generation. **********Occasionally, special national needs create unexpected technological assets. South Africa, driven to develop energy independence because of international reluctance to trade with it in protest against apartheid, has become a world leader in synthetic fuel processes based on coal. And sun-drenched Israel, boycotted by the Arab oil producers, has become a leader in simple solar energy applications."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/16/world/argentines-put-blame-on-british-for-un-delay.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Schumacher", "pub_date": "1982-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 853, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARGENTINES PUT BLAME ON BRITISH FOR U.N.

A total of 790 seamen from the ship were rescued, the command said. No Commandos on South Georgia **********Argentine military officials also acknowledged for the first time today that there were no commandos still holding out on South Georgia Island, which British forces recaptured April 26. The commandos were captured and were among the 149 repatriated Argentine marines who returned here Friday. **********In the interview today, President Galtieri again sidestepped a question on whether Argentina would turn to the Soviet Union for aid.  ''If Great Britain insists with its militaristic attitudes,'' he said, ''taking the conflict toward final consequences, we want Argentina and the world to know that just as we have been maintaining this situation in these past five or six weeks, we will continue to maintain five or six months, or five or six years.''

''In the following days, it is probable that an approach toward the search for a solution may exist, but it is not definite.'' **********This was a slightly more positive assessment than one he gave for Peruvian television Friday night.

In the last decade, the large textile manufacturer has been a sluggish performer in an industry hit hard by rising imports, increasing competition and damaging price wars. Profits have tumbled since 1979, the company's best year, and long-term debt remains high. **********The future does not appear much brighter. Analysts predict Dan River's performance will be in line with the struggling industry's norm, at best, and say it will be some time before the company sees substantial improvement. ''Obviously,'' said one analyst, ''they have problems.'' **********Yet, Carl C. Icahn, the Wall Street financier, has spent the last two months and millions of dollars in a fierce bid to purchase as much as 50 percent of Dan River. And Dan River has taken a costly step to fight back. **********The primary attraction for Mr. Icahn lies far from Dan River's current operations or potential for earnings improvement, analysts say. Rather, the allure is more immediate: The company's book value is $35.11 a share, twice the current market price of its stock. The company's stock, which fetched as much as $23 a share last year, traded at $13 before the Icahn effort began. **********In Danville, Va., where Dan River is celebrating its centennial this year, the company line on its prospects differs from that of the analysts. Ineffective management, outmoded equipment and unprofitable plants are things of the past, executives say, pointing to extensive corporate restructuring this year and capital improvements totaling more than $250 million since the early 1970's. **********When the textile industry turns around early next year, said Thomas George, vice president for public relations, ''we think we'll be positioned to do very well.'' **********The numbers are not encouraging, however. After earning $22.2 million on sales of $579 million in 1979, Dan River posted profits of $19.6 million in 1980. Last year, earnings fell to $14.5 million while sales grew to $635 million. Analysts expect 1982 earnings to drop to between $3 million and $5 million. **********In fact, Dan River is performing below the norm in the struggling textile industry. While overall industry profits have dropped 40 percent so far this year, Dan River is down 76 percent, according to Edward F. Johnson, an analyst for E.F. Hutton. **********''Improvement in the textile environment, with consumer spending increases, will help,'' said Mr. Johnson, who forecasts earnings of about $9 million in 1983. ''But it's not as strong as Burlington or J.P. Stevens. We put it on the second tier.'' **********Dan River clearly has made attempts to turn the numbers around. It spent $157.5 million from 1977 to 1981 to modernize machinery at its 27 manufacturing facilities in five Southeastern states. Its president, Lester A. Hudson Jr., has said that capital spending would continue at a level approaching $40 million annually through 1987. (Because of the Icahn proceedings, Mr. Hudson and Dan River's chairman, David W. Johnston Jr., were unavailable for interviews this week.) **********In addition, unprofitable operations, like a texturizing plant in Mebane, N.C., and an industrial fabric facility in Cateechee, S.C., have been closed or sold. Investments have been concentrated in areas of strength - $20 million was spent, for example, to convert a South Carolina plant to expand denim production. **********''The company has decided to start making some very heavy bets on areas where they can be successful, such as denim and carpeting,'' said John S. Pickler, an analyst with Wheat First Securities. ''These are areas where they're as competitive as anyone in the industry, and I think that's a step in the right direction.'' **********Last June, Dan River announced a series of organizational changes intended, it said, to improve operating efficiency and ''eliminate staff and support function redundancy.'' **********Most important among the restructuring was the centralization of manufacturing and management in Danville, where the company was started. Since 1968, Dan River had maintained corporate offices both in Danville and in Greenville, S.C. - creating what many saw as damaging inefficiencies. The reorganization, which will be completed next year, is expected to save $4.5 million annually. **********Despite its present struggle, Dan River has its bright spots.  Production of died yarns, its oldest business, is still its strongest, accounting for more than 20 percent of total sales; the company says it produces 40 percent of colored-yarn fabric sales in the United States. The $59 million Floorcoverings division saw sales increase by 16 percent from 1980 to 1981. **********Still, analysts say the bottom line on Dan River is uninspiring.  Long-term debt, fed by expansion and a series of acquisitions in the 1960's and 1970's, topped $100 million last year, and more must still be spent. **********''The process is still going on,'' said E.F. Hutton's Mr. Johnson, predicting only gradual improvement over the next five years. dan river glance AT A GLANCE  Dan River Inc.

A variation called the tie-in barter, however, often finds the agency using its considerable leverage on the station to make the deal work. It might go something like this: Take the show and you'll get 40 percent of our business in your market. Reject it and you may suffer. Although agencies deny it, their critics say that their tactics are often coercive and unethical. **********The murky world of Madison Avenue's tie-in bartering was illuminated when the J. Walter Thompson agency disclosed this month that its syndication unit -the one that does the bartering - had overstated its revenues by $24.5 million over the last four years through what Thompson said were fictitious computer entries. **********The agency placed the head of its syndication and spot buying units, Marie Luisi, on an unpaid leave of absence, and it has written off $18 million in pretax earnings for the four years and lowered its 1981 fourth quarter pretax earnings estimate by $6.5 million. **********Thompson, which has the largest spot billings of any agency in the country - $301.1 million in 1981 - had more programs to barter than any other agency. Thus, its accounting scandal has raised many questions about how some agencies use tie-in barter and time-banking, which could cause major conflicts of interest. **********Generally, syndication refers to the sale of a television program.  The most prized and expensive syndicated properties are old episodes of hit shows (''M*A*S*H,'' ''All in the Family,'' etc.), and these are usually distributed by large syndicating companies, not agencies. **********Advertising agencies buy less desirable programs from producers, and they can then sell them outright to particular stations. But often these shows are given instead to the station in exchange for commercial time during the show, usually for a certain client interested in the property, or for commercial time to be used in the future. **********Roger Rice, president of the Television Bureau of Advertising, a sales and marketing organization that promotes television as an advertising medium, has been one of the leading critics of how agencies have used the practice in dealing with stations across the country. ''Tie-in barter is a shady, shoddy, seedy practice,'' he said. ''Station time should be bought on merit, not because of promises or threats.'' **********William T. Lifland, an antitrust expert at the law firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel agrees with the general counsel of Ted Bates & Company, Elhanan C. Stone, that the law is murky on such a tie-in practice, and that it could be construed as a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. **********The chairman of the television advertising bureau, David E.  Henderson, said that six large agencies - J. Walter Thompson, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, Grey Advertising, Ted Bates, Cunningham & Walsh and Doyle Dane Bernbach - were now involved in tie-in barter. Media executives at the first five agencies denied that they used the practice. Calls to the president of the New York office, media director and head of local broadcasting at Doyle Dane Bernbach were not returned. **********The denials by the agencies have been contradicted by TV station personnel, competing agencies, media buying services and syndicators. All, of course, have an interest seeing the agencies' bartering practices curtailed. **********However, television executives, too, are wary of discussing the subject publicly. Just 15 agencies control about 60 percent of the national advertising -or spot billings - placed on local stations in the United States, and the stations fear offending such important sources of their livelihood. But one who would discuss the issue is Larry Linehan, sales manager at WPIX-TV in New York. **********''Agencies often say to us, 'If you run this program, we'll give you X amount of dollars' '' he said. ''If I take the show I would expect preferential treatment. If I turned it down, I could have a problem. Sometimes I'll take the barter deal and not run the show, for instance with some of the programs that Dancer syndicates for General Mills. That's part of business. If it's good for WPIX, I'm in favor of it.'' **********MANY station officials, particularly those at top-rated stations, report little serious pressure. ''It's not that hard a sell,'' said Harold E. Protter, general manager of KPLR-TV in St. Louis. ''They tend to be people you've known for years. If you have a good working relationship with an agency, your share of business will probably increase.'' **********However, the sales manager of a Wisconsin station, who declined to be identified by name, is more concerned. ''The problem began eight or nine years ago and it's the bane of our existence,'' he said.  ''Historically, agencies offer you the dregs of the programming world - otherwise a full-time syndicator would pick the shows up. J.  Walter Thompson is the king of all this action. Sometimes we get hurt for turning down their shows.'' **********Fear of agency retaliation, although considerable, is not the only reason stations do not readily discuss tie-in barter. Mr. Rice says they cannot document such arrangements because the deals are never put in writing, and that some stations worry that they might be breaking the antitrust law. **********Several agency executives argue that the TV operators can play tough, too. ''Gimme a break!'' pleaded one top agency media director. ''When a station takes one of our syndicated programs, they often say, 'O.K., what will you give me?' And if you want to buy a good spot on a network, you usually have to take a package deal that includes some undesirable stuff.'' **********Syndication has grown dramatically since 1971, when the prime-time access rule, which turned an extra half-hour of time back to the local stations, helped create a need for programs. Agencies say their syndication activities have grown so that they can give clients more control over programming, combat the ever-rising cost of TV time, and, not incidentally, make more money for the agency. **********The ethics of syndication are not considered to be beyond reproach. An executive at a top-10 agency that syndicates programs said, ''I hear rumors about all kinds of scams and messes all the time.  Anything is possible. Kickbacks and bill-paddings and creative accounting are rumored constantly. That's why some agencies just choose to avoid it altogether.'' **********Walter Staab, president of the SFM Media Corporation, which buys advertising time and syndicates programs for advertisers, is a direct competitor of the top agencies. He maintains he is purer than most of them because his time-buying and syndication departments are told not to communicate with each other. **********''There has to be a Chinese wall within an organization between time-buyers and syndicators,'' he said. Many agencies say they have such a wall, but at Thompson the same person, Marie Luisi, was in charge of spot buying and syndication. **********Mr. Staab, who opposes time banks, unless separate banks are kept for each client, conceded the practice looked attractive in theory.  ''Many stations,'' he said, ''prefer to commit inventory rather than hard cash, especially since they are usually going to pay with some time they might be unable to sell. An agency, on the other hand, can get a 25 to 50 percent discount on the time it receives. Some of its clients, obviously, could realize significant savings when the agency sells them time at a cheaper rate. **********''But this time bank isn't worth anything unless it can be unloaded, and it has to be unloaded on the agency's clients, some of whom might find themselves on a station they should not be on.'' **********A media director at one of the country's top 15 agencies concurred. ''You should never own something you recommend that your client buy,'' he said. ''That's an obvious conflict of interest.'' **********Walter E. Reichel, senior vice president, executive director of media and programs for Ted Bates, said a wisely run time bank does not require an agency to ''unload'' time on anybody. **********Bates is now syndicating only one show, ''The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour,'' which, through an arrangement with an independent syndicator, it generally sells to stations for a fixed-dollar amount of future time. By Mr. Reichel's accounting, Bates obtains commercial time via the time bank for about 60 percent of the going rate. The time is then charged to Bates's clients at 80 percent of the regular rate, and the remaining 20 percent goes for servicing, overhead and profit. **********Few stations offer much praise for the agencies' syndicated shows.  For a year, a show called ''The Phantom Wolf,'' obtained via barter, has been gathering dust on the shelf at WLWT-TV in Cincinnati, the stations says. A propitious day for airing has not yet dawned, and even Peggy Green, president of the Dancer Fitzgerald subsidiary that once syndicated the program, admits it is ''a turkey - it's a good show but very few stations seemed to want it.'' **********Many station sales managers say, however, that when such programs are not accepted, economic disaster does not necessarily ensue.  ''I've taken very few barter deals from agencies,'' said Stuart Tauber, general sales manager at WSBK-TV in Boston, ''but they can't take much business away from me because I'm a big sports station and they need to reach this audience. At most, I've lost a little.'' **********Virtually everybody in the advertising business admits that the line between vigorous negotiation and coercion can, at times, be hard to discern. ''We don't do tie-in barter,'' said John Williams, general manager of WPSD-TV in Paducah, Ky., ''but if we get an offer from a big agency, there is an unspoken aspect, an assumption on my part that if I cooperate with them I'll get a better share of their business.'' **********Ned Gelband, vice president media and programming at Jordan, Case & McGrath, doesn't think the Thompson scandal or directives from agency lawyers will diminish the tie-in practice. **********''It comes down to human nature,'' he said. ''Middle-management people can get a great sense of power from getting tough with stations, and by convincing the stations to take a show they can prove themselves to their boss, even if they eventually hurt their clients.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/13/business/advertising-new-face-at-marschalk.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Face at Marschalk", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; New Face at Marschalk", "body_text": " **********Going in as executive vice president and director of strategic planning at Marschalk is Stuart J.

The offer is not conditioned on any minimum number of shares being submitted by shareholders. **********Although this is substantially less per share than Mesa had offered to the management of Cities Service, Mesa hopes that shareholders will respond with such enthusiasm that the Cities Service management would be persuaded to withdraw its opposition. **********Formal Reply Expected **********A lawyer representing Cities Service said late last night, ''My only comment is that I have no comment.'' He added that he had not yet been notified of the terms of the new Mesa offer. **********Charles J. Waidelich, chairman of the board at Cities Service, flatly rejected a $50-a-share bid for 51 percent of Mesa made last week, but Cities Service directors are expected to respond formally to the $50 offer at a special meeting tentatively set for tomorrow or Wednesday. **********Thus Mesa has two offers on the table, one of $50 a share for 51 percent of the company, as a first step in landing 100 percent of Cities Service, if Cities Service's management supports it, and one of $45 a share for 15 percent, if the company does not. **********Commenting on the $50 offer, T. Boone Pickens Jr., chairman of Mesa, said, ''Our proposal is still open and we hope that the board of directors of Cities Service will accept it.'' **********Mesa said that its own five-member board of directors had unanimously approved its offer to stockholders around 4 P.M.  yesterday in a conference held by telephone. **********Mesa had said earlier that it has sufficient financing for a $1.8 billion ''friendly'' bid for Cities Service. It added yesterday that it had arranged enough financing for the $555 million that it would need for its offer to shareholders, and that it reserved its right to purchase more shares if stockholders offered more than the 12.1 million sought. **********The Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago and the Bank of Montreal, as widely reported, are to lead a group of banks extending slightly more than $1 billion in credit lines to Mesa. But only about $600 million can be spent for the Cities Service takeover bid. The rest is earmarked for other corporate needs. **********Other banks in the financing group are the First Interstate Bank of California, the Republic Bank of Dallas, the Texas Commerce Bank, the Mellon Bank, the First National Bank of Dallas, the Marine Midland Bank and the Mercantile Bank. **********In what appeared to be tacit acknowledgment that many bankers were reluctant to help finance Mesa unless it could work out a friendly deal, Mesa said that it intended to seek additional financing and, if it was successful, it might purchase more than the 15 percent of Cities Service it was seeking to purchase from shareholders. **********Mesa officials stressed, however, that there could be no assurance that it could get any additional financing. More Financing Sought **********The company said that it was attempting to arrange financing with unidentified banks, other lending institutions and ''independent entities'' that would purchase stock or other securities from Mesa and possibly swap them later for oil and gas properties or other assets of Mesa or Cities Service, if Mesa won 100 percent of Cities Service. **********Stressing that the offer made to Cities Service's board chairman remained open - $50 a share in cash for enough to give the company 51 percent and $50 in securities for the rest -Mesa said that it was ''prepared to agree'' that the securities it would issue would be valued at $50 by any Wall Street banker of mutual agreement.  Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette is representing Mesa, while the First Boston Corporation and Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb represent Cities Service. **********Mesa already owns 4.1 million shares of Cities Service, or slightly more than 5 percent. Thus, should it get the 15 percent it seeks, it would hold the 20 percent needed to show that much of Cities Service's earnings in its own earnings. Dome Device Used **********Using a device ''developed'' by Dome Petroleum Ltd. last summer, when Dome offered to pay $65 a share for a maximum 20 percent of Conoco Inc., Mesa will be able to assess how eager Cities Service stockholders are to sell their shares. **********In Dome's case, Conoco shareholders overwhelmed Dome with stock, showing they were overjoyed with the price offered. But since Dome bid for just 20 percent, it sent back the rest. Mesa, however, has allowed for a strong reception and may purchase more. Moreover, as with Conoco, if Cities Service's stockholders flood Mesa with stock, the company may have major difficulties in fending off Mesa as a suitor. **********Anticipating Mesa's move, Cities Service last Monday acted first by officially offering to purchase 37 million shares of Mesa, or 51 percent control, for $17 a share. By last Friday, Mesa stock stood at $18.625, ahead 37 1/2 cents. Cities Service, the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange, advanced more than $1, to $38, on a volume of more than a million shares, suggesting that some sort of Mesa offer had been anticipated."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/09/business/who-s-trying-to-corner-tin.html": {"writer_name": "Colin Campbell", "pub_date": "1982-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2431, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WHO'S TRYING TO CORNER TIN?", "print_headline": "WHO'S TRYING TO CORNER TIN?", "body_text": " **********Since last July, a shadowy group of speculators has spent as much as half a billion dollars buying up huge quantities of tin. Their evident attempt to corner the market has since raised the price of this normally plentiful metal more than 25 percent - to as much as $7.60 a pound in London yesterday -while the prices of other commodities have sagged under world recession. **********Commodity traders have been startled by such high prices at this time. Governments, manufacturers and the governors of world exchanges have been investigating the scheme, pooh-poohing it, taking steps to undercut it, asking how much more the speculators can spend and, generally, filling the narrow world of big-time tin with the shrewd and wild gossip that attends every such manipulation. **********On the floor of the London Metal Exchange, where much of the world's tin is traded, the prevailing rumor is that the Malaysian Government lies behind the gigantic purchases, which have amounted so far to 20,000 and perhaps even 30,000 tons of soft, shiny, useful, unglamorous tin. **********Since Malaysia is the world's largest producer of tin, that country, its accusers say, has the most to gain from higher prices.  The recent buying binge, moreover, began right after the world's tinconsuming nations killed a proposal last July to raise tin prices under the cur rent International Tin Agreement. No Threat to U.S. **********The squeeze, which appears to be legal, is not considered threatening to any vital American interest. Roy Markon, chief tin salesman for the General Services Administration in Washington, which stockpiles dozens of strategic materials, said that the Government agency's tin stockpile stands at almost 200,000 tons. It has been estimated, he said, that only 42,000 tons would be needed in a war lasting three years. **********Nor do world supplies appear threatened; tin is mined in Bolivia, Indonesia, Thailand and elsewhere in addition to Malaysia. Although world production has been dropping from a normal 200,000 tons and more, most analysts expect the economic slump to produce an even bigger surplus this year than last. **********Nor has the unexpected price rise yet devastated dealers caught on the wrong side of the market. The main reason, tin traders say, is that the London Metal Exchange last week eased its rules on how much a trader in tin futures would be permitted to lose when he must deliver tin when his contract to do so comes due at the end of this month. **********Still, attempts to corner basic commodities are hardly common.  There seems to be a plot afoot and there are certainly fortunes at stake. Memories of the Hunt brothers' attempt in 1980 to corner silver, and of another group to send up coffee prices have been revived together with the lessons of their failures. The jealousies of nations are also at work - of tin producers, in this case, versus industrialized consumers. Rumors of an OPEC-style tin cartel are being heard more and more. **********''Buyers don't know what to do because traders don't know what to do,'' said an irritated trader in New York City who buys tin on the international market and sells it to manufacturers. **********''It's costing us a hell of a lot of money,'' said a spokesman for United States Steel in Pittsburgh. Calling the squeeze ''galling,'' he estimated that U.S. Steel alone bought 4,000 tons of tin a year, nearly all of it for tinplate. **********''It's probably the Malaysians,'' runs the private opinion of more than one tin expert in the United States Government - although a diplomatic official at the State Department insisted, ''We have not seen anything that constitutes proof'' that the Malaysian Government itself is involved. Malaysia Denies It **********Perhaps the buyers are ''private individuals,'' said George Kam, who heads the Malaysian Tin Bureau in Washington. ''Perhaps Malaysian,'' he said, ''perhaps Indonesian, perhaps some Arabs, perhaps OPEC money -all that jazz. It's certainly not the Malaysian Government that's doing it.'' High officials in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, have likewise denied that their Government is involved. **********One curious rumor, an American official reported, is that someone wants to monetize tin. But why anyone would choose a metal whose uses have been shrinking is an enigma, he said. ''Consumption has been going down, not up,'' a New York tin dealer observed. **********''Also there's a rumor that it's a West Coast American company,'' a broker in London said. Still another theory is that the buyers just want to close the London market. **********''Whoever's doing this is playing with fire,'' warned the State Department official, who, like many others, chose to speak only privately about the issue. **********Mr. Kam predicted: ''Either A, they'll get burned, like the Hunt brothers in silver, or B - I don't know what.'' 'A One-Way Bet' **********Most analysts predict that the scheme will collapse. ''This thing can't stay up there for long,'' said a tin purchaser in industry. But no one is sure. ''Up to a point,'' an American official noted, ''the speculator has a one-way bet.'' **********A key figure in the smelter of speculation is said to be a broker named Marc Rich. Mr. Rich, who made a fortune in oil during the early 1970's and whose Marc Rich & Company operates in Switzerland, New York and elsewhere, reportedly began proposing a world-scale plan to raise tin prices early last year. **********A spokesman for his company in New York said yesterday that it had a policy against discussing business, and that Mr. Rich was ''almost impossible'' to reach. **********According to The Economist, the respected London news weekly, Mr.  Rich also sells tin in the United States for the world's largest tin producer, the Malaysian Mining Company - 55 percent of which is owned by the Malaysian Government. **********Three Malaysian directors of that company are reported to have set up a tin-buying company last June named Maminco, with a capital of $90 million. Where the money came from, or where much more tin-buying money h as com e from, is uncertain. The Economist has reported that the Governmen t-owned Bank Bumiputra of Malasia is intimately involved. PICK UP FIRST AND LAST ADD FIRST AND LAST ADD TIN **********Abdul Rahim Aki, who is head of Maminco and also deputy chairman of the Malaysian Mining Company, has denied that the private company is connected with the Government company. But interlocking directorates and other coincidences have persuaded many tin traders in Penang - Malaysia's spot market for tin - and in London and elsewhere that the Government backs the squeeze, and the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange is said to be investigating. The Heavy Buying Begins **********After last July's failed attempt by tin-producing nations to raise the official floor under the metal, prices on the Penang market shot up more than 20 percent in 10 days, one American official said. Soon afterward, metals dealers in London noticed that traders from Maclaine Watson & Company Ltd. - part of the Drexel Burnham Lambert group - were paying premium prices for three-month tin futures. **********''They started buying massively,'' a London metals trader said.  ''They bought and bought and bought. I don't know how much they bought before that in Penang.'' **********In October a meeting of the International Tin Council, which regulates prices on behalf of most producing and consuming nations, raised the price, but only slightly. Then suddenly, a few weeks later, the buyers changed tactics. **********On Nov. 26 they sold 10,000 tons worth of futures and bought 10,000 tons of metal. The switch depressed futures prices and sharply raised the price of physical tin. It made the metal costlier, in fact, than futures contracts for it - a phenomenon known in London as ''backwardation,'' since the costs of inventories normally keep tin prices the other way around. **********''Backwardation'' had startling results. The speculators were able to sell some of their physical hoard and buy up further contracts for future delivery. As for those who remained in the market in the hope that the speculation would collapse, some must now deliver physical tin on Feb. 25 and 26. Prices are exceptionally high, and much of the tin they will need is controlled by the shadowy buyers. Some Nervous Traders **********The market has thus remained tight and traders jumpy, and some relatively amateur speculators - in a tin market usually played by a few senior traders - are said to be in trouble. **********''The situation,'' one trader in London said, ''has been getting steadily worse.'' ''Forward business,'' added a New York tin buyer, ''has slowed down despite backwardation.'' Citing ''abnormalities'' in the market, the London Metal Exchange announced last week that a ''gentlemen's agreement'' had been reached to insure that the market remained ''orderly.'' **********Traditionally, contractual default on the exchange has been penalized by what one trader called ''horrible'' fines and other sanctions. ''Now,'' the trader said, sounding disappointed, ''if you default on the tin market you're only going to be fined 120 per ton per day.'' 'Sparks Will Fly' **********''I didn't think the London market would ever do that,'' the trader added, saying that quicker-witted dealers had already escaped undamaged. Despite the rule change, he said, ''The sparks will fly'' in London late this month. **********The United States has no domestic market in tin futures, but some Americans are obviously riveted on world developments.  Will the mystery buyers run out of money? It has been noted that they have been selling as well as buying tin, and an American official said that the price has not risen greatly since Jan 22. The price has hovered, in fact, just below the point at which the manager of the International Tin Council's buffer stock must start selling tin to ease the price. This stockpile is small by American standards -only a few thousand tons - but analysts wonder if the buyers would rather not be forced to buy it. **********From another office in Washington, Mr. Markon at the General Services Administration, when asked if he planned to flood the market with the 22,000 tons of tin that Congress has authorized him to sell, said with a laugh, ''I'm a salesman!'' He added, ''We've made $125 million since we started selling'' a year and a half ago. His earnings have come from the sale of more than 8,000 tons of tin, most of it offered since the buying spree began. The tin is now being offered to foreign as well as domestic buyers, a power granted by Congress in December. **********It is against the agency's legislated policy, Mr. Markon said, to buy and sell commodities in a way designed to manip ulate their prices. But h e is empowered to sell off surplus stocks ''in a prudentmanner.'' **********The metal that Mr. Markon has been selling has been stored, he said, in ''unwanted'' depots in Mechanicsburg, Pa., and elsewhere.  Some of the surplus tin is three decades old, and some traders have wondered about its quality. **********Next June 30, the current International Tin Agreement will expire.  The United States has announced that it will not enter the next agreement, and Government officials believe that an agreement without this country and perhaps some other consumers might vitiate the concept of a regulated market in tin. Large American tin buyers, such as the steel companies, believe with the Reagan Administration that a freer market in a plentiful commodity would help keep consumers' prices down. Speculation on Motives **********The mystery buyers may be fighting a long-term drop in prices as well as an immediate one, and the drama's main audience is trying to figure out how the squeeze might possibly succeed. **********''Maybe they're holding on until we're out of this recession,'' said a tin purchaser for a large American steel company. ''Then demand would shoot up and they'd be home free.'' **********United States officials, trying to determine what might happen if the mystery buyers have $1 billion to spend, note a possible chink in America's armor: an inability to sell huge amounts of tin quickly. **********If, they say, the mystery buyer is rich enough to purchase the 22,000 tons of tin that Congress has already authorized, and if the buyer could afford also to buy the International Tin Council's much smaller buffer stock, and if the buyer could also pick up enough of the world's surplus production to keep that source tight - then (assuming some other if's including an economic upturn) the tin king might somehow dispose of his hoard at a tremendous profit before Congress can authorize the sale of more tin. For in the past, officials note, a complexity of interests has kept Congress from acting swiftly on stockpiled commodities. **********In any case, one Government official warned, if recent history repeats itself even huge sales might not lower prices greatly. During the rapid rise in commodity prices around the time of the oil price increases of 1973-74, the General Services Administration sold nearly 44,000 tons of tin over two years.  Yet world tin prices did not collapse. If something similar happens this t ime, the tin-producing countries would make a killing on the heels o f the mystery buyer. **********If present prices drop, and if the next International Tin Agreement fails to raise the floor, tin producers are widely expected to revive an old idea of forming a cartel. **********The prospect elicits skepticism and distaste from tin consumers and American officials.  ''I think the Malaysians are talking a little too strongly now,'' said a major buyer and seller of tin in New York City. ''I don't know who they think they are. Tin is not oil.'' He meant that the commodity was not as irreplaceable as oil. Others, however, have noted that tin production is concentrated in a handful of countries, and that three-quarters of the non-Communist world's tin comes from Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand -all members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. **********Critics have also noted also, however, that although tin consumption is rising in both Communist and developing countries, important substitutes have been found in the industrialized West, which uses three-quarters of the world's tin and devotes most of that to tinplate and solder."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/21/business/lone-star-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LONE STAR INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "LONE STAR INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/20/world/notes-soviet-union-andropov-oiled-election-machine-that-propelled-him-top.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1982-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2034, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOW ANDROPOV OILED THE ELECTION MACHINE THAT PROPELLED HIM TO THE TOP", "print_headline": "NOTES ON THE SOVIET UNION; HOW ANDROPOV OILED THE ELECTION MACHINE THAT PROPELLED HIM TO THE TOP", "body_text": " **********There was no campaign in any Western sense, no rallies and certainly no opportunity for the average Russian to make his weight felt. But Yuri V. Andropov had an election machine of a kind working for him long before the decision by the Communist Party's Central Committee last week to choose him as the party's new General Secretary. **********In some respects it was a more subtle machine than is customary in Soviet politics. As a former head of the K.G.B., the internal security and intelligence agency, Mr. Andropov probably had its backing, and that alone could be persuasive in a country where there are believed to be at least 100,000 K.G.B. men working on internal security alone. There are signs that he also had the backing of the 3.8-million-member armed forces, and there were large numbers of troops around the Central Committee building when the election occurred. **********But Mr. Andropov's loyalists also worked for him in other ways for months before Leonid I. Brezhnev's death but when it was alreay clear that the end was near. Officials with career links to the former K.G.B. head were to be found in the corners of diplomatic receptions and in quiet conversations over lunch praising his qualities. He was, they implied, the most capable man in the ruling Politburo, a modern man with a zeal for the efficiency that the Soviet Union so patently lacks. **********Little of this could be tested by Westerners, with whom the K.G.B.  chief has had little contact. Most diplomats were stuck with his biography, filled out by the relatively few major speeches he has given over the years and what could be divined from his 15-year stewardship of the K.G.B. The sotto voce assurances of Soviet officials here and in Western capitals thus formed an important influence on how Mr. Andropov was viewed. Account by a K.G.B. Defector **********Western accounts that Mr. Andropov speaks good English, likes whisky, plays tennis and appreciates Western culture were also based on Soviet sources - in this case officials, including a K.G.B. man, who defected to the United States. **********The K.G.B. man, Vladimir Sakharov, surfaced five months ago with his account of Mr. Andropov's penchant for Scotch and cognac, for Jacqueline Susann novels and for Glenn Miller records, asserting that he learned of them through his friendship with Mr. Andropov's son, Igor. **********The accounts may be true. One aspect, Mr. Andropov's English, is open to doubt, since he did not use it in his meeting with Vice President Bush on Monday, and even had written documents in English read to him by an interpreter. **********But the question that intrigues many Westerners here is whether the people who disseminated a more attractive image of the new Soviet party leader were consciously trying to offset his reputation as an unrelenting K.G.B. chief, and doing so in a way that they assumed would filter its way back into the Soviet bureaucracy. Knowing the U.S. **********It may seem fanciful that Western perceptions could influence the choice. But the Soviet leadership remains obsessed with the United States, and a man who seemed best equipped to deal with the adversary -by knowing American culture, among other things - might have an advantage. **********Since such things as a Politburo member's taste in liquor are not chronicled in Pravda, many in the Soviet bureaucracy learn about the top men through Western reporters, either in foreign publications that are a privilege of the elite or through Russian-language versions of such reports that are beamed back into the Soviet Union by Western radio stations. **********Only time will tell what difference, if any, Mr. Andropov's character makes. But the betting among Western diplomats who dealt with Mr. Brezhnev is that Mr. Andropov may prove even tougher. By this, they do not mean that he will favor armament over negotiations, but that in the talks that will inevitably occur he will prove shrewder, certainly more alert, than Mr. Brezhnev was in his declining years. As a new man in a potentially insecure job, he may have no other choice. A Farewell to Brezhnev **********To a Westerner, Mr. Brezhnev was not a sympathetic figure. He had traits that suggested an appealing degree of human weakness, such as his collection of Western sports cars and his habit, as Henry A.  Kissinger noted in his memoirs, of driving around his country retreats at breakneck speeds. He liked hunting boar and was vain about his prowess. He seemed to have a genuine affection for children. **********But he was also a man who presided over a system that was demoralizing to many Soviet citizens, and harshly repressive to the minority who dared to pose an open challenge. The repression was less severe than under Stalin, and nobody had to fear that he would be dragged out and shot. **********Living standards leaped up for millions during the Brezhnev years, and for this many were grateful. Yet Mr. Brezhnev changed nothing that was fundamental in the system, and as years wore by seemed in his stolid refusal to tackle bureaucratic strangulation and corruption in many ways to embody it. **********And yet when he died, and still more when he was buried, there was a mournfulness and a grandeur in the ceremonies that touched many Westerners whose attitude toward the Soviet leader was usually expressed in sardonic jokes. An Impressive Funeral **********Nobody who attended the lying-in-state could fail to be impressed by the scale of it, the mountains of wreaths and the unending line of mourners, the orchestra playing Beethoven, Mozart and Tchaikovsky, the immaculate army guards with their white belts and gleaming bayonets, the red, white and yellow sashes, many of them from party and Government bodies but many others from men and women who had grown up with Mr. Brezhnev, fought with him in the war or served with him in the provinces during his rise up the party ladder. **********Some Russians found the funeral lugubrious and overblown. But even cynics seemed to be touched by the grieving of his family. A woman most Soviet citizens barely glimpsed while Mr. Brezhnev was alive, his widow, Viktoriya, was suddenly exposed to television cameras, pulling away from the men who were Mr. Brezhnev's bodyguards to cast herself across the open coffin, caressing his forehead and hair; their daughter, Galina, reputed to be someone with a taste for diamonds and parties, was there, too, plainly ravaged. **********As a state ceremony, it had everything the Soviet system can muster. The tall, blond young men of the Rota Pochyotnogo Karaula, or Honor Guard Company, the elite unit that guards the mausoleum and performs other ceremonial duties, marched alongside the olive-green gun carriage into Red Square with a precision in their high-stepping gait and in the clockworklike swings of their arms that was daunting to anybody who ever tried to march in time. **********The army band that followed, playing Chopin's ''Funeral March'' over and over in a tempo that seemed sometimes almost to stop, missed not a step nor a note in the two hours that the funeral lasted. **********At the end, there were some slip-ups. The two attendants who slipped past the family and the members of the Politburo to lower the satin-covered coffin into the grave botched the job, with one of the boiler-suited workers lowering one of the sashes suspending the coffin so fast that it dropped several feet. As Mr. Andropov and others moved in to toss handfuls of earth onto the coffin, the workers could be seen on the television screen unceremoniously shoveling earth into the hole. A Quick Transition **********After 18 years it was over very fast. Mr. Brezhnev died at 8:30 A.M. on Wednesday, Nov. 10. He was replaced as party leader on Friday at noon, and by Monday at 12:45 P.M. he was buried. By Tuesday flags were back at full staff and Government offices were returning to their routines. In barely six days an era had ended and another one had begun, its first earmark an impatience to get on with work undone. **********Within hours of the burial Mr. Andropov had met with many foreign leaders, including Vice President Bush and Secretary of State George P. Shultz. The new party leader had held conversations of at least some substance on issues as diverse as nuclear weapons, Afghanistan, the Middle East and Poland. **********He had seemed to visitors to be plainly in command, notwithstanding reports that continued to circulate among some Soviet sources and their Western contacts of a power struggle in the two days that intervened between the death of Mr. Brezhnev and the appointment of Mr. Andropov. **********Only next week, when the Central Committee is expected to meet again and possibly make new appointments to the depleted ranks of the two key top party bodies, the Politburo and the Secretariat of the Central Committee, will it be possible to begin to gauge with any confidence the degree of the new leader's authority. But some things changed right away, as they do in almost any political system that revolves around one principal figure. Andropov's Primacy **********In the funeral procession, the Politburo members, in their snapbrim hats, awkwardly tailored overcoats and unpolished shoes could have been any collection of Soviet leaders over the last 30 years. They were mostly of pensionable age. But Mr. Andropov's primacy could not be mistaken. **********It was not only that he walked in the front row, with a stride that suggested pre-eminence. Not far behind him, and close to him throughout the day, was a man in civilian clothes with a small suitcase. It could have been a medical kit. Or it could have been the Soviet equivalent of the ''black box'' for conducting nuclear war that follows American Presidents wherever they go. The Bush Visit **********Although Vice President Bush was diverted from a visit to Africa on short notice, flying to Moscow on a 10-hour flight from Lagos, Nigeria, he was met at Sheremetyevo Airport by the cavalcade that follows the Vice President wherever he travels abroad. An Air Force C-141 Starlifter had preceded him with two bulletproof Lincoln Continentals and a retinue of Secret Service men who accompanied him even into the Kremlin and waited outside the modest room where he met Mr. Andropov. **********The United States had been asked to limit its funeral party to the bare minimum because of the large number of foreign dignitaries - 32 heads of state, 15 prime ministers, more foreign ministers than anyone could count - and the number was pared to exclude even Mr.  Kissinger, probably Mr. Brezhnev's closest contact among all highranking Western officials. Nonetheless, when the air crews, Secret Service men, chefs and chauffeurs were all counted, the party totaled more than 120. Some had to sleep in American diplomats' residences. **********The logistics were impressive. Mr. Bush's wife, Barbara, was met with a mink coat flown in from Washington to augment her African wardrobe. Mr. Bush had a statement on his meeting with Mr. Andropov ready within 20 minutes of returning to the American Embassy, a previously prepared text into which a single paragraph was dropped after Mr. Bush, Mr. Shultz and top officials huddled in the waiting room of the embassy clinic. The line, referring to the Kremlin talks as ''frank, cordial and substantive,'' was the best hint any reporters got immediately of what went on. **********For some in the embassy, one of the most impressive parts of Mr.  Bush's visit came afterward, when the Vice President moved to the embassy snack bar and spent half an hour circulating among embasy staff members and thanking them for making the visit go smoothly. ''I know how hard you worked,'' Mr. Bush said, recalling that he once headed the American diplomatic mission in China. ''We had Henry Kissinger coming in, and believe me, that was no vacation.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/06/business/italy-suing-sindona.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 179, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Italy Suing Sindona", "print_headline": "Italy Suing Sindona", "body_text": " **********Italy is seeking to recover $6 million that it contends was diverted by Michele Sindona from two of his now-bankrupt Milan banks.

On Monday, it will begin to advertise three cars and trucks of Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, some of whose automobiles - but totally different lines - are already being sold by Chrysler. **********The selling by Chrysler is one hurdle for the agency. Then there is the fact that Mitsubishi is not such a familiar name. And, let's face it, an imported Japanese car is no novelty. Mitsubishi, in fact, will be the seventh. **********And, then, remember that Chrysler's four models are low-priced, and that the agency has to promote the new, higher-priced - $6,500 to $14,500 - Starion, Cordia and Tredia without denigrating the Chrysler products. **********Lotsa luck. **********''We're introducing a line of cars and trucks at a time when there might be an attitude that there are too many here already,'' said Anthony C. Chevins, undaunted agency president. **********And, while the introductory ad budget is impressive on a per-unit basis, its total figure, of probably near $10 million, is slightly more than a drop in the budget compared with all other automotive advertising spending. In the fourth quarter of last year, according to Leading National Advertisers, imported passenger cars had $81.6 million in advertising in all major media, excluding newspapers and spot radio, while the domestic makers had $138.5 million. **********''We had to be very creative, very exciting and very different,'' Mr. Chevins said, explaining that while all the work had been done in New York under Arthur R. Miranus, executive vice president and creative director, the servicing of the account would be handled by the agency's Los Angeles office. Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, the advertiser, is based on the West Coast. **********C.& W., which has been the corporate agency for the Mitsubishi parent for two years, working only in print, has prepared a pool of TV commercials of 10-second, 30-second and 60-second length that will be backed by 80 percent of the budget, starting Monday. **********The first two weeks of television will be devoted to a 10-second spot that will seek to establish that Mitsubishi has its own dealer network and to promote the three-diamond logotype that Chrysler may not use outside its showrooms. **********For the next six weeks, 30-second and 60-second spots will show all items in the product line, and 30-second spots will be used to promote individual models and diesel turbo trucks on Oct. 18. **********The Monday start will be in 15 markets. Later the number will grow to 22 markets. Mitsubishi has 22 dealers whose total passenger sales are limited to 30,000 units for the year under a trade agreement between Japan and the United States. **********Mitsubishi has thoroughly researched its markets. It has decided which models its cars will most likely compete against and it knows in which markets its cars sell best. The use of commercials for different models in each market will be guided by that information. **********Two-page, four-color ads will begin to run in October in three news weeklies, and in Sports Illustrated, Road and Track, Sunset, Boating and Flying, Audio, Popular Photography, World Tennis, Stereo Review and Penthouse. **********That last magazine is an interesting choice since there will not be much of an auto advertising clutter problem. Detroit does not use the so-called skin books; neither Toyota or Datsun, which have in the past, have signed up for schedules. The only other Japanese cars in the book will be Isuzu and Subaru. **********The campaign is being aimed at 18-to 54-year-olds, but particularly at the 25-to-34 set.

Like most German men of his generation, Mr.  Stihl looked askance at women in business. **********That was in 1969. Judging by the scarcity of women executives in West Germany even today, this attitude seems to persist.  But Mr. Stihl's daughter, Eva Mayr-Stihl, overcame her father's misgivings. After studying languages and economics at Munich University, she joined the marketing department of the family enterprise, and now she is the company's executive vice president and chief financial officer. **********The Stihl Group, with sales of $355 million a year, has 5,300 employees and eight plants around the world. It revolutionized the lumber business, and more recently it helped generate a thriving market for do-it-yourself tools. 'Think About It Carefully' **********''My father was not enthusiastic about my joining the company,'' Mrs. Mayr-Stihl recalled during a recent conversation in her spacious office at Stihl headquarters, situated in a wooded valley just outside this southern German town. ''He told me to think about it carefully - that it wasn't just a pastime.'' **********Her father built the company's first electric chain saw in an old factory building near Stuttgart in 1926. A year later he introduced the gasoline-driven saw, a 140-pound heavyweight model that two men had to handle. The company's success followed, and lumbering was never the same again. **********Stihl saws were popular before World War II. They were shipped to the United States starting in 1930. But the company's really explosive growth came in the postwar years, when Stihl succeeded in reducing the saws' weight while maintaining their power. **********The first wave of steep oil price increases in the mid-1970's, a severe blow for many industrial concerns, caused Stihl's sales to boom because the demand for wood - as an alternative fuel to oil - skyrocketed, increasing the need for chain saws. **********At the same time, the Stihl Group, which until then had specialized in heavyweight saws for professional woodsmen, entered the new market for lightweight ''hobby saws.'' Stihl also expanded overseas. Plants Established Abroad **********In 1973, the year Andreas Stihl died, the company began assembling saws in Brazil, a promising market, to avoid tough import barriers. A year later a plant was opened in Virginia Beach, Va., to serve the United States. And in 1979 two more overseas plants - a chain factory in Switzerland and an assembly plant in Australia -joined the list. **********In 1975 Mrs. Mayr-Stihl took charge of the company's finances during a series of management shifts.  Analysts who follow the Stihl Group say she has skillfully handled its complicated operations. Her problem was to assure stable financing during a period of turbulent growth, with Stihl selling saws in about 130 countries and expanding production in four nations where monetary and credit conditions differed widely. **********While Stihl's American unit faced high interest rates and a volatile dollar, for example, the Brazilian subsidiary had to grapple with triple-digit inflation and a tangle of financing regulations. **********''I like to delegate authority,'' Mrs. Mayr-Stihl said. ''I have two good people - for finances and for cost accounting. And I never felt tempted to gamble on exchange rates. We had to let the overseas units do their financing locally.'' **********In addition to chain saws, which account for 85 percent of production, Stihl also makes brush cutters, hedge trimmers and disk cutters for masonry and metal. Hampered by Recession **********Stihl reported consolidated worldwide sales of $355 million for 1981, up 18.6 percent from the year before. But most of the gain, Mrs. Mayr-Stihl said, came from the surge in the value of the American dollar in relation to the West German mark. **********As a family-owned company, Stihl never announces its earnings, but the impact of the recession on the timber industry reduced last year's net income, Mrs. Mayr-Stihl acknowledged. **********Family members hold several positions at the company. The president is Hans Peter Stihl, Mrs. Mayr-Stihl's brother. Her husband, Robert Mayr, works in the marketing division, and a younger brother, Rudiger Stihl, heads the legal department. **********Mrs. Mayr-Stihl says the status of women in the West German business world is improving. ''It's a problem of generations,'' she declared. ''When I went to school, a third of the students were girls. Today it's about half and half. That will have an effect on careers.'' **********The German language, like English, was unprepared for sexual equality. There is no neutral form of address for women. In America the use of ''Ms.'' has been advocated, but the German approach is different. All women in business here, after they reach a certain maturity, are addressed as ''Frau'' (''Mrs.'') regardless of whether they are married or single. Outlook for the Company **********Despite growing competition, Mrs. Mayr-Stihl is optimistic about the company's future. ''The market shrank last year, but we were able to broaden our share,'' she said. ''And it's not because we're cheap. On the contrary. But we emphasize the product, distribution and service. We never went through mass merchandisers because we view a chain saw as a service-intensive product. We never speculated on quick sales. I think it's paying off.'' **********Most analysts say her optimism seems well founded. They cite Stihl's strong overseas production and distribution system and its reliance on heavy-duty chain saws used by professionals, which are more recession-resistant than light saws used by do-it-yourself hobbyists."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/02/world/sudanese-calls-for-arab-meeting-including-egypt-on-iran-iraq-war.html": {"writer_name": "William Farrell", "pub_date": "1982-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 586, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SUDANESE CALLS FOR ARAB MEETING, INCLUDING EGYPT, ON IRAN-IRAQ WAR", "print_headline": "SUDANESE CALLS FOR ARAB MEETING, INCLUDING EGYPT, ON IRAN-IRAQ WAR", "body_text": " **********President Gaafar al-Nimeiry of the Sudan called today for a conference of moderate Arab countries, including Egypt, to try to end the war between Iraq and Iran. **********Mr. Nimeiry made the proposal as he and President Hosni Mubarak met briefly with reporters after a long meeting.

''I have never been as excited about a mission as I have about this one.  This really has great potential.'' **********While the physician could not predict precisely how a modern rehabilitation program would benefit China, he observed that in the United States and some other countries, ''about 20 percent of the population have some type of problems that need some type of rehabilitation. It may be very modest or it may be very complicated.'' If this estimate holds true for China, up to 200 million people could be affected. **********Rehabilitation programs in China have tended to involve sanitariums, which are usually situated at mineral spas or similar therapeutic sites. In cities like Peking, handicapped people get around on hand-cranked tricycles. In the countryside, they are often limited to crutches or remain bedridden. **********''They have a physical therapy program, but the problem we had early on was to sell the philosophy of our program - that you have to treat the whole man,'' Dr. Rusk said. As an example, he told his Chinese audiences, over 80 percent of patients paralyzed from the neck down returned to gainful work after being treated at the Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine in New York. **********''Now they realize that in addition to their passive program, they need a dynamic program,'' Dr. Rusk said.  The World Rehabilitation Fund, over which Dr. Rusk presides, has trained specialists in over 100 countries. In the last 25 years, more than 3,000 physicians and 1,000 brace and limb makers have been trained. Impressed by Chinese Advances **********Dr. Rusk was impressed by some efforts he was introduced to in China. He talked of ''absolutely fascinating'' microsurgery being done in Shanghai to reattach severed limbs and extremities. ''The surgery is very meticulous and takes from eight to as high as 18 hours,'' he said. **********In addition to attending operations at which acupuncture was used as an anasthetic, Dr. Rusk witnessed demonstrations of myoelectric hands developed by biological engineers in Shanghai. ''I think they are the most advanced that I have seen anyplace,'' said Dr. Rusk of the artificial limbs, which are operated by brain waves through a computer. **********Dr. Rusk was invited to China after the World Rehabilitation Fund sponsored a year of training in New York for Wu Xiangguan, a Peking physician. Dr. Wu returned to tell the Minister of Public Health about the program. The mission to China included two other institute physicians, Mathew H.M. Lee and Sung J. Liao, as well as Dr. Rusk's granddaughter, Susan Sutphen, who just graduated from medical school. **********The Chinese have proposed translating Dr. Rusk's basic textbook into Chinese."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/11/business/informatics-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INFORMATICS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "INFORMATICS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/16/business/company-news-mobil-discount.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mobil Discount", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Mobil Discount", "body_text": " **********The Mobil Oil Corporation said that its gas customers would receive a 4-cent-a-gallon discount for cash purchases at most Mobil gas stations in the Southeastern and Middle Atlantic states beginning yesterday.

They are being arrested and punished randomly and collectively, regardless of their individual guilt or innocence, the officers said, and they are being victimized by Jewish settlers, who are inflaming the atmosphere and are going unpunished for their violence. **********The six officers, all reservists with combat experience, ranged in rank from lieutenant to major. They said they had been sent into tense situations with only vague orders, ill-trained troops and virtually no riot-control equipment - only their guns - to quell angry demonstrators who attacked them with stones and bottles. **********The news conference was held under the auspices of the Peace Now movement, which opposes the Government's policies in the territories. The movement was started by reserve Army officers several years ago to press for a more flexible Israeli position during peace talks with Egypt. Its last major demonstration, a protest in Tel Aviv March 27, drew as many as 25,000 supporters. 15 Arabs Killed by Gunfire **********Since the clashes in the occupied territories began in mid-March, 15 Arabs, most of them teen-agers, have been killed by soldiers' and settlers' gunfire. Estimates of the number wounded range from about 90, which is the army's figure, to nearly 200 listed by Palestinian journalists. Two Israeli soldiers have died, one from a knife attack on the West Bank and one from a hand grenade thrown in the Gaza Strip. **********The demonstrations were ignited by the dismissal of an elected mayor and town council on the West Bank that had refused to meet with the Israeli civilian administrator of the area, Menachem Milson. Mr.  Milson subsequently ordered the removal of two other elected mayors, and a fourth was dismissed by an army decree. **********The Israeli radio reported today that 25 members of Mr. Milson's senior staff had written a joint letter of protest about his methods and policies, arguing that he had undermined accomplishments made by the previous military government, that he had refused to consult with them and that he had taken actions behind their backs. Difficult Decision for Officers **********The army officers' news conference was probably without precedent in Israel, where the army has always been so integral to the fabric of the society that its strategies have usually commanded a loyalty as firm as loyalty to country. The officers said that it had been difficult for them to take the step, knowing, too, that they were treading at the edge of legality in revealing what they had seen of military activities. **********They had asked to meet with Defense Minister Ariel Sharon to discuss the problems privately, they said, but he refused. They met tonight with the army's chief legal officer to report details of incidents that they witheld from reporters. The army had no comment on the officers' allegations. **********Maj. Yuval Neryah, a tank officer who earned the highest decoration for bravery in the 1973 war, said that while he had fought in extremely hard battles, ''the number of difficult recollections I carry with me from them are modest compared to the feelings I've returned with from a month in reserve duty'' on the West Bank. 'The Soldiers Have No Defenses' **********''A group of soldiers, five, six or eight with a commander, are there, get into a situation where rocks are thrown at them, and the army today has nothing to offer us,'' he said. ''The soldiers have no defenses, and in the end, all we have is our weapons, our rifles.'' **********Despite standing orders to shoot at feet, he said, officers and their men ''panic, get excited, and then it's permitted to do almost anything.'' He contended that the past practice of conducting investigations into every incident of firing had been virtually abandoned. **********As a result, Major Neryah contended, fewer and fewer officers are willing to take the risks of withholding fire, and ''a situation develops where soldiers and officers lose their discipline, in essence become real victims of the Government's policy in the territories.'' **********''This is a process,'' he said, ''that in my estimation is harmful, first and foremost to ourselves, and to our soldiers, who we are trying to educate as we were taught, that you don't hurt unarmed people.'' Use of Untrained Troops Reported **********Rami Avni, an artillery lieutenant, charged that new troops not even finished with basic training and barely able to handle a rifle were sent into the midst of demonstrations. **********''So what do they do?'' the lieutenant said. ''I saw it with my own eyes. They take a platoon of trainees, and I was shocked, and they swoop down on demonstrators like animals tearing at prey. I've never seen such a thing. This is how we're educating our soldiers? Good God, what will become of us?'' **********The officers condemned the collective punishment and random arrests that they said had become routine. For example, if rocks are thrown, Major Neryah said, ''we go into the approximate area from which the rocks were thrown - and it's very difficult to pinpoint from exactly where - and act against civilians, local residents, part of whom, maybe even most of them, don't even know what happened.'' **********If a road to a Jewish settlement is blocked by rocks, and stones are thrown, said Lieut. Shuki Cohen, a tank officer, ''we get there, and we don't encounter the ones who made the provocations. **********''They have light feet and they take off to the hills,'' he went on. ''Are we supposed to spend the day running after them? So we come across the elderly, the women, small children, and they are punished. It's unbelievable. That's the policy.'' Mistreatment of Prisoners Cited **********Lieutenant Avni said that groups of prisoners - ''we don't know who's guilty and who's innocent'' - were brought to army barracks and were made to ''clean out bathrooms, the vehicles, they clean the pots in the kitchen - yes, the prisoners.'' **********Jewish settlers also came in for strong criticisms, especially from Lieutenant Cohen. They ''create an atmosphere and arouse anger, and are influencing events,'' he said. He condemned ''the way they relate to soldiers who are in fact defending them, their way of relating to the local Arabs in a debasing way, calling them 'dirty Arabs' and so forth, and this includes even the smallest children.'' **********''They think they can do anything they wish,'' he continued, ''and they act as they see fit. They run around armed - more than once they have shot out of buses when stones were thrown at them, without any relation to what was happening. I'm told that the settlements in the territories are supposed to in some way serve security interests. But my personal impressions are that the opposite is true.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/24/world/around-the-world-british-defense-minister-is-visiting-falklands.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Defense Minister Is Visiting Falklands", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; British Defense Minister Is Visiting Falklands", "body_text": " **********The British Defense Secretary, John Nott, today became the first British Cabinet member to visit the Falkland Islands in 149 years of British rule. **********He is on a three-day tour of the islands and their British garrison during which he will attend the reburial of 14 soldiers who died recapturing the islands from Argentina. **********Mr. Nott will visit sites of crucial battles of the war, which began on April 2 and ended with Argentina's surrender on June 14.

As the candidate of the party that has ruled Mexico for the past 53 years, he was required to offer new promises that might revive the population's faith in the system, but public skepticism ran deep. **********Since then, however, Mr. de la Madrid has gone much further than form required, doggedly pursuing the topic and converting ''moral renovation'' into a central plank of his entire electoral platform.  And, in doing so, he has not only sent shudders of concern through a political system in which enrichment in office has become a norm, but he has also raised expectations that many Mexicans feel will be impossible to satisfy. 'A Clamor of the People' **********''Our actions will demonstrate that we're serious,'' Mr. de la Madrid said in a recent interview with a Mexican monthly, Contenido, ''and reality will defeat incredulity or irresponsibility. My words have not fallen into a vacuum. Moral renovation constitutes a veritable clamor of the people.'' **********Yet even he recognized that corruption is ''a profound cultural problem that permeates to the very root of Mexican culture'' and he stressed that the phenomenon was common to the private sector, the labor movement, the educational system and news organizations as well as to the Government. **********Most Mexicans would concede that corruption is an accepted part of daily life here, affecting them either as victims or beneficiaries.  But most would also argue that corruption has grown dramatically over the past decade, above all in the Government. ''It doesn't matter if they steal a bit,'' said a taxi driver who must pay daily bribes, or ''mordidas,'' to policemen for real or imaginary traffic violations, ''but they shouldn't steal so much.'' **********The ordinary Mexican's most frequent contact with corruption comes in his dealings with the police and with lower-level civil servants, who frequently demand a gratuity to complete the simplest bureaucratic procedure. But businessmen also complain that ''kickbacks'' are routinely paid on almost every contract granted by the Government. Corruption of Ministers Rumored **********Part of the disillusionment with the Lopez Portillo administration appears to stem from a widespread perception that it has failed to live up to its promise to control corruption. And while major scandals involving officials usually erupt only after they leave their posts, the rumor mill has long since identified key ministers and heads of state enterprises who are believed to have made vast fortunes over the past five years. **********A common practice has been for senior officials to own shares in companies that are major Government contractors, above all in public works or the oil industry. Frequently, though, extravagant displays of wealth - such as acquisition of a series of new homes in Mexico City, seaside resorts and the United States - are put down to ''inexplicable enrichment.'' **********A key role in Mexican society is also played by ''influence,'' the power and immunity enjoyed by friends and relatives of key officials. Mr. Lopez Portillo himself has been criticized for appointing his son, a sister and several cousins to important positions. And while the President won applause last year when he rejected the gift of a $2.4 million ranch that political friends had bought for his retirement, many Mexicans have been upset to discover that he is building a five-home complex for his family on a huge piece of land on the outskirts of the capital. **********At the same time, many Mexicans who complain about ''public immorality'' also benefit from the tradition of corruption. In the private sector, for example, tax evasion is widespread, while the payment of a bribe is somehow considered less venal than receipt of a bribe. Labor leaders are also frequently paid off by management to settle wage disputes, while most journalists receive regular payments from the Government that they regard as part of their salaries. Legal Loopholes a Target **********In face of this deeply entrenched custom, Mr. de la Madrid's strategy of ''moral renovation'' is therefore not one of wielding, in his words, ''an authoritarian garrote.'' Nor is it ''a vengeful program aimed at sowing fear and bitterness in the nation.'' Rather, he said, its objective is for ''public immorality to stop being a central problem of Mexico and the Mexicans.'' **********Direct sanctions, he believes, are less important than eliminating many of the administrative and legal loopholes and much of the excessive bureaucracy that encourage corruption. ''Regulations and bureaucracy at times make unnecessary, impractical, impossible and even absurd demands,'' he noted. ''I think we should eliminate the power of the authorities to make arbitrary decisions affecting the legitimate interests of individuals.'' **********But he also stressed the importance of modifying attitudes toward corruption through the educational system and the communications media. And while the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party still pays $70 a day to local reporters covering Mr. de la Madrid's campaign, he has pledged to eliminate the practice of having journalists on government payrolls. **********In his interview with Contenido's editor, Armando Ayala Anguiano, a longtime campaigner against corruption, Mr. de la Madrid noted that it was ''unacceptable'' for officials to receive presents. Asked pointedly whether he would appoint relatives to government posts, he stressed that family relationships or friendships would not affect his decisions. **********In a separate interview, Mr. de la Madrid disclosed plans to announce the salaries received by top officials, including the President, and to insist on public statements of assets when entering and leaving office. He also pledged to set an example. ''I can tell you quite frankly that I own the house I live in, the house I lived in when I got married where my mother now lives and a country house near Cuautla,'' he said. ''But I have no investment in shares or businesses whatsoever. I think that private business interests are totally incompatible with public service.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/20/world/cambodia-dropped-from-india-parley.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 364, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CAMBODIA DROPPED FROM INDIA PARLEY", "print_headline": "CAMBODIA DROPPED FROM INDIA PARLEY", "body_text": " **********India, the host country for the next summit meeting of the nations describing themselves as nonaligned, has announced that it is not inviting the Vietnamese-backed regime in Cambodia to the conference. **********The recently formed Cambodia coalition in exile, led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, has also been excluded from the talks, due to take place in March. **********The moves are apparently aimed at containing divisions between supporters and critics of the Soviet Union.

''We're both rich and I'm lonely.'' The matchmaker put down her dress-for-success book and sighed.  ''Marrietta is a naughty girl,'' she said. ''She wants to stay a spinster.'' **********''This is a firm offer,'' Shmendrix said. ''Do your job.'' The matchmaker went to Marrietta. ''Have I got a match for you!  Handsome young Shmendrix, tenderly offering $48 a share for your hand.'' **********''I don't like him,'' the nubile maiden decided immediately. ''He's bossy. He wouldn't let me run my own house.'' ''He won't take no for an answer,'' the matchmaker pressed. ''He's already gone to your family. They'll make you do it. Be nice, go along.'' The matchmaker saw that the girl was seething, but what could the tempting target of takeover do? **********When the matchmaker got back to Shmendrix, the young man was in a frenzy. ''Fool!'' he cried, ''Marrietta went around behind your back and took a marriage contract to all my relatives. She'll marry me, all right, but I'll be henpecked and she'll be master of the house.'' **********The matchmaker blanched. ''Nobody has ever done such a thing to King Solomon brothers.'' Her eyes narrowed. ''I see in this deed the hand of Harry Grayshark.'' **********Now it was Shmendrix's turn to turn pale. ''Grayshark the gobbler, uniter of all technologies?'' The young man gulped. ''Matchmaker, the last time 'Jaws' Grayshark walked into a house, he threw the management out into a 10-foot snowdrift without earmuffs. And that was a friendly takeover.'' **********The matchmaker went directly to Grayshark. ''How could you do this thing? You're forcing the Shmendrix into having a unity day for all the cousins, they're taking ads, their tender is getting tough.  Young Shmendrix just voted himself a golden handshake in case he has to retire in a hurry. What's the big idea?'' **********''They were on my swallow list,'' Grayshark explained. He took out an envelope and made some notes on the back. ''But now I'm not so sure. With all the expenses of borrowing to buy each other out, the new family's debt might be half their total capital, and the interest may depress the amount the both of them could earn together. Let 'em cut each other up, and maybe I'll pick up the pieces.'' **********Back at Marrietta's house, the matchmaker pleaded in vain for the girl to forget the counterattack. ''With Shmendrix, you could maybe get along in time - but if you sell your soul to Grayshark, you'll both be out in the cold. And if you spend all this time in court before the wedding, can you imagine what the divorce will be like?'' **********Marrietta was adamant: ''Uncle Harry will help keep your young man in his place,'' adding darkly, ''And who is that blonde woman Shmendrix brings with him to meetings?'' THE matchmaker threw up her hands. When she returned to the S hmendrix house, she heard sounds of great festivity, with rice beingt hrown and cans tied on cars. **********''Welcome to the wedding!'' said young Shmendrix, ''I just married Alice Allied, who despises Harry Grayshark for preferring Haig & Haig Scotch to Hennessy Cognac. This is a real love match, perks all around, and it will enable me to keep Marrietta as a concubine and to do housework, no heavy lifting. We'll sell off a couple of Marrietta's fur coats to lower the debt. A happy ending.'' **********The matchmaker wasn't so sure. She hurried to the village pundit, a heavily bearded pauper wise in the ways of family finances.  ''I'm a matchmaker, not an antitrust lawyer, but somehow I get the feeling it's not right for everybody to be in everybody else's pocket this way,'' the matchmaker said. ''It's all getting out of hand. Do the business schools offer ethical guidance on this?'' **********''Wharton started to, but just merged with Stanford to avert a takeover by Harvard,'' reported the wise man.  ''My problem is a lack of heroes,'' explained the matchmaker. ''In the old days, the executive who built a better mousetrap, or created a new need and supplied it, or produced a product that took the world by storm - he was the hero, and an easy match to make.'' **********''And now?'' asked the wise man, moving to his telescope.  ''Today's business heroes are the assemblers of conglomerates who turn out puddings without themes,'' said the distraught matchmaker.  ''The purpose of matches should be to introduce real efficiencies, or to create little R.& D. children to go out and take care of the family later. Instead, the heroes you read about on the business pages are the men who wind up sitting on the largest pile of assets, with the most former cabinet officers on their boards of directors. I tell you, making matches for nonmanaging agglomerators is no fun.'' **********The wise man pressed his eye to the glass and took the long view.  ''Matchmaker, remember that hard times beget cannibalism, but good times ahead will churn up entrepreneurs. Families will soon be asking of all these brides and grooms, 'Are you doing this to profit the family, or sit atop an empire?' '' **********The matchmaker rolled her eyes and waited for some wisdom she could put to practical use in gaining perspective.  Suddenly the wise man tensed, turned from the telescope, and punched the printout button. ''Here it is,'' he said, tearing the sheet from the computer, ''the wisdom of the ages, from a poem of a hundred years ago, with the long view on all this financial Pacmania.'' **********The sheet read: Great fleas have litle fleas Upon their backs to bite 'em, And little fleas have lesser fleas, And so ad infinitum; And all the great fleas themselves In turn have greater fleas to go on, While these again have greater still, And greater still, And so on. **********---------------------------------------------------------------------  William Safire's column appears regularly on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/19/world/french-unemployment-down.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 50, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "French Unemployment Down", "print_headline": "French Unemployment Down", "body_text": " **********French unemployment figures registered their first quarterly decline in five years today, with 2,600 fewer people jobless at the end of September than at the end of June.

Its most prominent organizations, after all, were usually clumsy and embarrassing (witness the John Birch Society). Its leading publications were at best elegantly superficial (National Review) and at worst cranky and intemperate (Human Events). And its carping obsession with Communism was ill advised and politically crippling, for the liberals themselves had effectively pre-empted that issue. It did not seem presumptuous, therefore, when respected critics began to write smugly of the disappearance of a serious right, to celebrate what the historian Eric Goldman once called ''the arrival of a broad consensus in the thinking of Americans about the public issues of the day.'' **********But reports of the death of the American right were, as we now know, premature. Even 20 years ago conservatism remained a far more significant force than most liberals were willing to admit.

And by 1980 with liberalism in almost total disarray, it was ready to seize at least partial control of the Government. **********The nature and significance of this right-wing revival is the subject of Burton Yale Pines's new book, an enthusiastic, even gloating, account of how the forces of ''traditionalism'' have swept through grass-roots America to transform the nation's politics. **********Since Mr. Pines spent most of a year traveling around the United States gathering material for his book, it is perhaps not surprising that the best parts of the book are not those that analyze the significance of the right-wing resurgence but those that describe how it has happened. And on that subject, he is often very good. The key to the conservative renaissance, he argues, is not so much the right's rising resentment as its ability to use modern political techniques to make that resentment felt. Corporate efforts to promote ''procapitalist'' values, parental attempts to purge progressive innovations from the schools and return to ''basics,'' the campaign by women to stop the Equal Rights Amendment and ''strengthen the family,'' the crusade by evangelicals to restore religious piety and fight the dreaded spread of ''secular humanism'' - all have relied on complex and sophisticated methods of organization, fund raising and promotion. Conservatives have, in other words, fused their fervent commitments with practical and effective efforts to increase their political influence - with what long-range results we can only guess. **********On the other hand, it is difficult to take seriously Mr. Pines's portrayal of the American left, which he caricatures in much the same crude way that liberals used to caricature the right. Liberalism has been, he suggests, a wild bacchanalian spree, marked by nihilism, hedonism and godlessness. Led by a powerful and conspiratorial ''new class'' of journalists, academics and other influence peddlers, liberals have worked to de- Continued on Page 26  stroy the foundations of American society - ''restricting freedom in the marketplace ... loosening social restraints,'' eroding the nation's defenses, all, it seems, out of sheer perversity. **********At the same time, Mr. Pines's picture of the right is offered in an almost embarrassingly obsequious tone. With breathless hyperbole, the former Time magazine writer (he now works at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank) portrays the American right as rising up in moral anger to cast the traducers from their midst: ''Across the nation, in numbers beyond tallying, Americans have been mobilizing - some for more than a decade, others for just a few years - against liberalism and in support of traditional values.'' Before them the radicals and nihilists of the left have scattered in confused disarray. The nation is once again walking tall. (Lest anyone think otherwise, Mr. Pines includes numbing collections of statistics and polling data to support his claims.) **********HIS effort to define the broad common ground that will, he believes, unite the various right-wing constituencies into a strong and enduring coalition is particularly unconvincing. There are, he concedes, many distinct factions within conservative ranks, factions that often seem as bent on fighting each other as on combating the common enemy. But all such groups, Mr. Pines maintains, share certain basic values and commitments, even if they have not yet realized it.  All are defenders of what he calls ''traditionalism,'' the Burkean belief that ''history and tradition are better able than man to fashion man's institutions and norms, that reason has its limits and that today's generation has the solemn responsibility to convey unharmed to its heirs what it has inherited from its ancestors.'' Traditionalism, he suggests, is a unitary concept, embracing a single, coherent ideology. **********YET as his own reporting makes clear, even those who speak most fervently of their heritage often differ fundamentally over what that heritage is. To the ''Old Right'' - the defenders of corporate America and its interests -tradition dictates a firm commitment to capitalism and unfettered economic growth. To the ''New Right'' - a vaguely populist group more interested in cultural and moral issues -tradition means the defense of local values and institutions against the threats of centralized power, a concern that has produced animosity toward the business and financial establishment as often as it has toward the Government. And to the ''neoconservatives'' - intellectuals whose conversion to the right is of relatively recent vintage - the relevant tradition is that of the liberal Arcadia of midcentury, when basic decisions about the nation's course were entrusted to an educated, respected and supremely confident elite. To defenders of this establishment tradition, Jerry Falwell and Phyllis Schlafly are scarcely more appealing than Jerry Rubin and Bobby Seale. **********All conservative groups share a veneration of the nation's heritage. (So, for that matter, do most liberals.) All look askance at the recent performance of the Federal Government. (Many liberals do that too.) But Mr. Pines fails to explain how these very different concepts of what tradition is and what the Government should do to restore it are to be reconciled to produce a lasting ''traditionalist'' majority. **********Whatever one thinks of Mr. Pines's analytical efforts, however, it will be difficult to refute his broader conclusion. ''Liberalism,'' he claims, ''indeed seems like a dynasty fast losing the Mandate of Heaven. On the ascendancy is traditionalism, challenging liberalism on every major front and ending the liberal monopoly of the agendasetting process. On every critical public policy matter, liberals now must share the platform with traditionalists.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/21/world/around-the-world-trudeau-rail-car-pelted-with-rocks-and-food.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around The World; Trudeau Rail Car Pelted With Rocks and Food", "print_headline": "Around The World; Trudeau Rail Car Pelted With Rocks and Food", "body_text": " **********A crowd of about 500 demonstrators surrounded a train carrying Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau of Canada and some pelted his railroad car with rocks, eggs and tomatoes when it stopped here Thursday night en route to Toronto. **********He stayed inside during the brief stop in Sudbury, which has 40 percent unemployment - the highest jobless rate in metropolitan Canada.

As a result, these groups are calling for commercial rent controls. **********Faye Leeper and Santa Taylor, officers of two neighborhood merchant groups on the Upper West Side, which has experienced a residential and commercial revitalization in recent years, said that rent increases of 200 percent to 500 percent were now commonplace in the area. **********Emanuel Fuchs, chairman of the 400-member Retail Jewelers of Greater New York and chairman of the Small Business Task Force, a private group, said the increases were forcing many merchants to ''drain their already limited resources, and forcing others to go out of business completely.'' **********And William Seitz, president of the Neighborhood Cleaners Association, which has 1,000 members in New York City, said his group had received complaints of ''catastrophic'' rent increases from all over the city. **********''There's no question that landlords are entitled to increases,'' he said. ''But those increases should have some relationship to reasonableness and reality.'' **********Commercial rent regulation is the way to mitigate the problem, according to these and other merchants and several city and state legislators. **********A member of the City Council, Ruth Messinger, has introduced a bill that would limit rent increases on commercial establishments under 10,000 square feet to no more than 12 percent a year. The bill, first introduced two years ago, would apply to commercial spaces used for light manufacturing as well as for stores and offices. **********Under its provisions, a three-member Small Business and Commercial Protection Board, appointed by the Mayor and approved by the Council, would determine the precise amount of the yearly increase. The board would also rule on whether landlords deserved hardship exemptions and would penalize landlords who charged excessive rents. **********State Senator Franz S. Leichter and Assemblyman Richard N.  Gottfried, both of Manhattan, have introduced legislation in Albany that would authorize the City Council to establish a commercial rent regulation system. **********The measures, which even the supporters concede have no chance of passage this year, are vigorously opposed by the Koch administration and the real estate industry. **********''There is nothing the real estate industry sees more bright red about than this,'' said Richard Rosan, president of the Real Estate Board of Greater New York. ''I can't convey the depth of sentiment against it. Commercial rent control would be an absurdity. It would be absolutely disastrous and impossible to administer.'' **********Robert A. Kandel, commissioner of the city's Office of Economic Development, was more circumspect but equally opposed to the idea.  ''We believe the market ought to be allowed to function freely,'' he said. ''Certain areas are now hot. Revitalization is taking place. Property values are going up. Community life is energized, and city tax revenues are increased. This has great benefit to the neighborhood and to the entire city. Commercial rent control would be a disincentive to revitalization.'' **********Mr. Rosan noted that many expiring leases were negotiated 10 and 15 years ago. Thus the rents had long since declined in real value, he added, and only now are being raised to what the market will bear. **********Both men said they realized that some shop owners might be forced to move under the push of neighborhood revitalization. But they noted that when upgrading occurred in East Side areas many shops did not leave their neighborhoods but moved off the main thoroughfares to side streets with cheaper rents. **********Supporters of the legislation, like Mr. Fuchs of the retail jewelers group, contend, however, that the size of the increases will indeed drive out many small stores. **********He said that small merchants often could not move without great financial harm because they were dependent on a clientele that would not follow them. The problem is exacerbated, he added, because most of the viable commercial strips in the city are experiencing huge rent increases. **********However, George Sternlieb, director of the Rutgers University Center for Urban Studies, said he believed that commercial rent regulation was not necessary because the ''harsh reality of the retail market's condition'' would keep rents down. **********Mr. Sternlieb said that landlords of small businesses in most city neighborhoods who were seeking high rents were making a mistake.  ''The high visibility spots like Columbus Avenue are an old New York story,'' he said, ''but they aren't the whole of New York City.  There is a squeeze. There will be retailers who go to the wall. But there will also be landlords looking at empty stores.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/11/world/brazilian-set-for-ticklish-visit-to-us.html": {"writer_name": "Warren Hoge", "pub_date": "1982-05-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 593, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRAZILIAN SET FOR TICKLISH VISIT TO U.S.", "print_headline": "BRAZILIAN SET FOR TICKLISH VISIT TO U.S.", "body_text": " **********The President of Brazil, Joao Baptista Figueiredo, begins a state visit to the United States on Tuesday that, in the words of a newspaper here, has suddenly become ''Malvinized.'' **********The crisis in the Falkland Islands, which Latin American nations, following the Argentine lead, call the Malvinas, has already prompted the Brazilians to cancel three social occasions associated with the trip and to reduce by a day President Figueiredo's stay in the country. **********Brazilian and American diplomats both say the clash in the South Atlantic and the future of American relations with Latin America will be a major topic of conversation when Mr. Figueiredo meets with President Reagan on Wednesday. **********Though it shares a 1,200-mile-long border with Argentina and Mr.  Figueiredo himself lived in Buenos Aires as a child, Brazil has not joined in the overt expressions of support for its neighbor that have emerged elsewhere on the continent. The Brazilians recognize the Argentine claim to sovereignty over the islands but argue that the matter should have been settled through negotiation. **********At the same time, they have inclined their policy toward the Argentines by selling them arms and small planes and by denouncing British armed attacks while remaining officially silent on Argentina's actions. **********Where other Latin American nations have viewed Washington's backing of Britain in terms of hemispheric betrayal, the Brazilians have cited the development more as a justification of their decision in the last decade to pursue an independent foreign policy.
